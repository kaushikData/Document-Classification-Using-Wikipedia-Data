[[Image:Alanclark.jpg|thumb|right|Cover page for ''Alan Clark Diaries'']]
[[Alan Clark]] kept a regular [[diary]] from 1955 until August 1999 (during his second spell as a [[Member of Parliament]]) when he was incapacitated due to the onset of the [[brain tumour]] which was to be the cause of his death a month later. The last month of his life would be chronicled by his wife, Jane.

*Volume 1 ''Diaries: In Power 1983–1992'' (1993)
*Volume 2 ''Diaries: Into Politics 1972–1982'' (2000)
*Volume 3 ''Diaries: The Last Diaries 1993–1999'' (2002)

Alan Clark published his diaries covering the period 1983 to 1992 after he left the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], deciding not to seek re-election to his [[Plymouth Sutton (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton]] seat.  Published in 1993 and known simply as ''Diaries'' (although later subtitled ''In Power''), they have been recognised as a definitive account of the downfall of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].

Before his death in 1999, Clark had started work on the [[prequel]] to the 1983–1992 ''Diaries'' to cover his entry in politics, from seeking a Conservative Association to adopt him as their Parliamentary Candidate in 1972 until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]]. Published a year after his death, this volume was titled ''Diaries: Into Politics'' and covered 1972 to 1983.

The final volume, covering Clark's decision not to seek re-election at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], his regret at leaving the House of Commons and then his return to Parliament was published in 2002 and included Clark's final days dying from a brain tumour.

Throughout his diaries Clark refers admiringly to [[Henry Channon|Henry "Chips" Channon]] and his diaries.  He also quotes [[Adolf Hitler]], to whom he refers as "Wolf".

The diaries include much reference to Clark's love of his chalet at [[Zermatt]], his Scottish estate at [[Eriboll]] and the architecture of and country around [[Saltwood Castle]], his home in Kent. Clark's fascination with [[classic cars]] is also evident, as his enthusiasm for [[backgammon]].

The Diaries were serialised into six episodes of ''[[The Alan Clark Diaries]]'' by the [[BBC]] and shown in 2004 with [[John Hurt]] and [[Jenny Agutter]].

== ''Diaries: In Power 1983–1991'' ==
The first published diaries open with Alan Clark, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament for [[Plymouth Sutton]] since [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]], about to seek re-election at the 1983 general election. The Conservatives were expected to win the election, following the recent [[Falklands War]] and a disunited [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and Clark expected to be promoted from the back benches.

Early on in the diaries, Clark records the death of his father, the author, broadcaster and art historian [[Kenneth Clark]], from whom Clark inherited [[Saltwood Castle]] in Hythe, Kent.

In the very next entry in the diary, we get an insight into one of Clark's recurring lapses with the opposite sex. His opponent at the election, the Labour candidate, was 22-year-old Frances Holland, of whom Clark records;

{{quote|I'm madly in love with Frances Holland. I suspect she's not as thin and gawky as she seems. Her hair is always lovely and shiny. Perhaps I can distract her at the count on Thursday and kiss her in one of those big janitors' cupboards off the Lower Guildhall|[1983] p8}}

Clark is, at this time, also carrying on an adulterous affair with Valerie Harkess, the wife of a South African judge, and her two daughters (to whom he referred collectively as "the coven"). Clark made no effort to disguise the coven's identity. The affair became public knowledge in 1992 after Clark left the House of Commons, and it was cited in the Harkess divorce case.

[[File:The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.jpg|thumbnail|The Library in 2013. Two further stories of public space and stacks are underground]]
'''The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library''' at the [[University of Virginia]] is a research library that specializes in American history and literature, history of Virginia and the southeastern United States, the history of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, and the history and arts of the book. The library is named after Albert and Shirley Small, who donated substantially to the construction of the library's current building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthehook.com/96513/cover-buried-treasure-uvas-special-collections-get-new-home "Buried Treasure: UVA's Special Collections Get A New Home," in ''The Hook'' (March 3, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Small, an alumnus of the University of Virginia, also donated his large personal collection of "autograph documents and rare, early printings of the Declaration of Independence." This collection includes a rare printing of the [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]] of the Declaration of Independence. Joining the library's existing Dunlap in the Tracy W. McGregor Collection of American History, Small's copy made U.Va. [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#List of extant Dunlap broadsides|the only American institution with two examples of this]], the earliest printing of the nation's founding document. It also includes the only letter written on July 4, 1776, by a signer of the Declaration, [[Caesar Rodney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41140-2004Nov10.html |title=Colonial History's Grand Reopening|publisher=The Washington Post|date=10 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Albert H. Small Declaration of Independence Collection boasts an interactive digital display which allows visitors to view the historical documents electronically, providing access to children and an opportunity for visitors to manipulate the electronic copies without risk of damage to the original work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kioware.com/resources.aspx?resID=92&amp;title=Declaration+of+Independence+Museum+Table+Kiosk Declaration of Independence Museum Table Kiosk] in&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the collections cover a range of fields, the library is best known for the Tracy W. McGregor Library of American History, the Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature, the [[William Faulkner]] collections, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] Collections, the Sadleir-Black Collection of [[Gothic Fiction]], extensive book, manuscript, and photography holdings in Virginia history, and original documents of the works, life, and legacy of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Additional strengths include historical papers of [[James Madison|James Madison,]] [[Dolly Madison]] and [[James Monroe]], [[typography]] and other book arts, [[trade literature|trade catalogues]], [[slave narratives]], [[equestrianism]] and other forms of traditional [[sports]], documents, correspondence and oral records of the Southern [[Civil Rights Movement]], political and public affairs papers of major Virginia political figures, and one of the world's largest collections of [[miniature books]].

== History ==
[[File:Rufus Holsinger's image of The Rotunda burning in 1895, destroying most of the library collections.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rufus Holsinger's image of the Rotunda burning in 1895, destroying most of the library collections]]
[[Thomas Jefferson]] situated a library, rather than a chapel, at the center of the University of Virginia's campus, unlike existing American colleges. He also composed the first list of books to be included in the collection and placed newspaper appeals for library gifts to fill the new library,&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;Michael Plunkett,"History of Special Collections," unpublished memoir of previous Director of Special Collections, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]]. [[James Madison]], who was the second rector of the university after Jefferson, established the first endowment fund for acquisitions, through a bequest made in his will in 1836.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;''Special Collections at the University of Virginia'' University of Virginia, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Rotunda burned in 1895, only twenty percent of the original books survived; they are the longest held volumes in the Small Special Collections Library today, and librarians have for many years been acquiring replacements for burnt volumes. The University Archives and the earliest manuscript gift to the university—the papers of [[Richard Henry Lee]], acquired before 1832&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt;—also survived.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, many rare and unique items were added to the library's collections, both books and manuscripts. Purchases were also made as well, including the John Henry Ingram collection of Edgar Allan Poe. In 1930 a "Virginia Collection" was established in one wing of the library and the first archivist was hired.&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt; Following the construction of the new Alderman Library in 1938, the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts was organized to house and administer the principal historical materials in the library's collection. Over time, these units became separated, so that by 1962 there were two divisions: the Rare Books Division and the Manuscripts and University Archives Division. These departments merged in 1987 to form the Special Collections Department. In 2004, the current building opened.

== Collections ==
=== Foundational Collections ===
In 1938, the library accepted as a donation the library of [[Tracy W. McGregor]], the Detroit philanthropist and book collector; McGregor had bequeathed his collection to the administrators of the McGregor Fund, who selected the University of Virginia as its final home. The fund also supported the construction of the McGregor Library, a large room in the new Alderman Library that housed the Rare Books reading room for several decades.  McGregor's collection of rare books, maps, and manuscripts comprised three areas of study: American exploration and history, British literature, and [[Cotton Mather]] and other members of the Mather family. The collection immediately established the University of Virginia as a center for the study of American history and culture. 

In 1960, the library received a deposit that established it as a major site for the study of American Literature, when Clifton Waller Barrett placed in the library his major collection of books and manuscripts of major and minor American writers through 1940. The library has continued to collect in the tradition of Barrett since the collection arrived; Barrett's donation was finalized in the early 1990s. The Barrett book collection contains first and other significant editions of virtually every major work of American literature from the nation's founding to 1950, as well as many minor works, since Barrett's collecting interests stretched well beyond the canon. Of particular interest are deep holdings in little known writers, and an extensive collectionof editions and other printed materials related to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]. Some of the significant manuscript materials held within the Barrett Collection include more than a hundred letters of the early American novelist [[Charles Brockden Brown]], manuscripts of several major works of [[Washington Irving]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]], hundreds of manuscript fragments for the significantly enlarged second edition of Walt Whitman's [[Leaves of Grass]], a large collection of the papers of [[Louisa May Alcott]] and the Alcott family, significant manuscripts and correspondence of [[Mark Twain]], the papers of [[Stephen Crane]], including a manuscript of [[The Red Badge of Courage]], over 650 letters of [[Henry James]], significant holdings in the manuscripts, personal papers, and correspondence of [[Lafcadio Hearn]], [[Robert Frost]] (including a recently discovered unpublished poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801882.html |title=Unknown Frost Poem Comes Out From Hiding at U.Va.|publisher=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2006|last=Kinzie|first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the papers of novelists [[John Dos Passos]] and [[Ellen Glasgow]] and poets [[Vachel Lindsay]] and [[Sara Teasdale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://small.library.virginia.edu/collections/featured/the-clifton-waller-barrett-library-of-american-literature/ The Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature | Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Jefferson ===

The university has long been the home to many original documents relating to Thomas Jefferson and his family. Holdings include hundreds of letters to and from Jefferson, his architectural drawings, family documents, numerous books from Jefferson's library, an extensive research collection of works about Jefferson, and artifacts such as one of his [[polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraphs]] and the telescope with which Jefferson watched the construction of the university from his hilltop home nearby, [[Monticello]].

=== University of Virginia Archives and Faculty Papers ===

The library documents the history of the university all the way back to its founding; holdings include the original minute book of the Board of Visitors, written mostly in the hand of the first secretary, Thomas Jefferson, as well as the first matriculation book, which documents every student who entered the university in its early decades, including notables such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Early ledgers of the university document the building of the university's structures, the renting of enslaved laborers to build and maintain the campus, and the development of a curriculum. Documents from the late nineteenth- through the twentieth century document the development of the university's modern infrastructure, student organizations, expansion of the campus and operations, and debates over the university's refusal to admit women and black students.

Papers of many of the university's most prominent faculty are held in Special Collections, including civil rights activist [[Julian Bond]], physicist [[Jesse Beams]], poet [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], and novelists [[Ann Beattie]] and [[John Casey (novelist)|John Casey]].

=== William Faulkner ===
U.Va. holds the largest collection of printed and manuscript materials related to [[William Faulkner]]. His association with the library began when he came to the university as a visiting faculty member, first in the 1930s and then in the late 1950s. The [[William Faulkner Foundation]], which Faulkner founded, was created in part as a mechanism by which to secure the continued deposit of his papers in the university's Manuscripts Collection after his death, which occurred in 1962. This collection,  converted from a deposit to a gift in 1962, comprises the bulk of the manuscripts and typescripts of the writer's novels and short stories, along with extensive correspondence and other related materials. In 1960, scholar and bibliographer Linton Massey had donated his massive collection of Faulkner editions, periodicals, and secondary works. Faulkner's daughter, Jill, deposited many further manuscripts and over 300 books from Faulkner's library over the course of many years, and additional Faulkner collections, such as the papers of U.Va. professor and Faulkner biographer Joseph Blotner, have been added. The collection is the basis for a [http://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/ major online archive of Faulkner audio recordings].
=== Virginiana ===
The collections are an important source for research on the history of Virginia, with particular strength in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and Central Virginia. Collections of many significant Virginia families, plantations, and businesses are at the core of historical materials documenting Virginia from its earliest days to the present. Plantation and early family papers contain rare information about [[enslaved person]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, including a significant collection of letters written by previously enslaved Virginians who moved to Liberia. The collections are notable in their representation of regional debates over race, including the archives of influential eugenicists and civil rights activists. Also notable are the records of the Charlottesville School Board, which document the era of [[desegregation]] and [[massive resistance]]. Papers of Charlottesville and Albemarle County political figures are wide ranging.

=== Political Cartoons and Caricature ===
The collections are rich in the genre of political or editorial cartoons, and include the archives of Richmond editorial cartoonist [[Ed Seibel]], UVA alumnus [[Bob Gorrell]], and Art Wood. The Gerald Meeks Collection is a comprehensive collection of examples of American cartoon artists; among its treasures are a large collection of [[Oscar Cesare]] originals. The papers of [[Edward Stettinius Jr.]] include a large number of original editorial cartoons about the founding of the [[United Nations]]. A complete set of [[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)]] caricatures also resides in the library. In 2018 the library acquired the papers and original art of editorial cartoonist and fine artist [[Pat Oliphant]]. 

=== Gordon Collection ===

{{Main|Gordon Collection}}

The Gordon Collection (also known as the Douglas H. Gordon Collection) comprises some 1200 volumes of French books dating from the sixteenth through the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Tarte"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Brill| isbn = 978-90-04-35151-6| pages = 52–74| last = Tarte| first = Kendall| title = Itineraries in French Renaissance Literature: Essays for Mary B.

== Research and Outreach ==

Special Collections is visited by a wide range of audiences, and its collections likewise have been featured in significant publications worldwide. Major cross-institutional [[digital humanities]] projects featuring the collections include the ''Walt Whitman Archive'', the Edgar Allan Poe Society's collected e-texts website, the ''Rossetti Archive'', ''Mark Twain in his Times'', and ''Uncle Tom's Cabin &amp; American Culture''. Among several large digital collections produced in-house are the [[Jackson T. Davis|Jackson Davis]] Collection, a significant resource for the study of African American educational history&lt;ref&gt;"Vintage pictures tell black students' saga." The Washington Times. (January 15, 1999): 576 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2013/05/24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the photo archive of the studio of Rufus Holsinger, who documented life in Charlottesville, Virginia; this was the first University of Virginia collection to join the Digital Public Library of America project and one of the DPLA's founding collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalcurationservices.org/2013/04/18/holsinger-collection-now-available-through-the-digital-public-library-of-america/|title=Holsinger Collection Now Available Through the Digital Public Library of America|publisher=University of Virginia Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library's collections play a prominent role in many courses taught in the [[Rare Book School]], which serves hundreds of scholars, librarians, and book dealers each summer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6D81E3EF937A15754C0A9649D8B63&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;smid=pl-share Jennifer Schuessler, "Peering Into the Exquisite Life of Rare Books." ''The New York Times'' (July 24, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest are the extensive publishers bindings, early printed works, and a working [[Hinman Collator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/the-rare-book-scholars-secret-weapon/ |title=The Rare Book Scholar's Secret Weapon |publisher=New York Times |date=24 July 2012 |first=Jennifer |last=Schuesser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Special Collections played a significant role in documenting the ouster and reinstatement of the university's president, [[Teresa Sullivan]]. Along with collecting physical documentation of the public and press reaction to the events, the library made news for collecting [[born digital]] materials&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/uva-creates-archive-documenting-sullivans-resignation/37295?cid=wc Angela Chen, "UVa Creates Archive Documenting Sullivan's Resignation."

''NBC29.com'' (June 25, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; and accepting materials collected for the library by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/city-woman-wants-uva-board-meetings-on-the-record-and/article_4220f6d8-d914-5681-bbcc-651bac0b14b9.html Ted Strong, "City Woman Wants UVa Board Meetings on the Record,and has the Stenographer to Prove It."

'''''Arlo and Janis''''' is an American [[gag-a-day]] [[comic strip]] written and drawn by [[Jimmy Johnson (cartoonist)|Jimmy Johnson]]. It is a leisurely paced domestic [[situation comedy]]. It was first published in newspapers on July 29, 1985.

== Cast ==
The focus of the strip is tightly on its two title characters, a middle-aged, middle-class [[baby boomer]] couple with an easygoing approach to life. The family surname is '''Day''', but it's only rarely used in the strip. Johnson confessed, "When I first sold the strip, the family had no name. The strip itself had no name! Preparing to launch, the syndicate brain trust decided, 'Let's make their name ''Day'' and call the strip ''Day by Day.'' ' However, it turned out there was an old, semi-defunct newspaper column called ''Day by Day,'' and legally timid heads prevailed. The strip was named ''Arlo and Janis.'' I subsequently kept the name ‘Day.’ Why not?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/?p=469 |title=Murder, he wrote 09/05/08 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, surveying his core cast, compared Gene, Janis and Arlo to [[The Three Stooges|Larry, Moe and Curly]], respectively, with the family cat, Ludwig, corresponding to [[Shemp Howard|Shemp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toonopedia.com/rlojanis.htm |title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Arlo and Janis |date=2006 |accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Arlo''' is Janis' husband. "He works for one of those vague, comic-strip corporations that survives year after year despite inept management, disgruntled workers and no apparent purpose."&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.com/comics/arlonjanis/html/cast_ArlonJanis.html |title=Arlo &amp; Janis – Meet the Characters |publisher=Comics.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916225959/http://www.comics.com/comics/arlonjanis/html/cast_ArlonJanis.html |archivedate=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlo is drawn wearing a tie when at work, and at home he wears jeans and a plain T-shirt. His character is generally laid back and [[irony|ironic]]. He enjoys barbecues, and dreams and daydreams of sailing.&lt;ref name="arloandjanis642"&gt;That could take forever! http://arloandjanis.com/?p=642#comments&lt;/ref&gt;  He can be riled by injustice and marauding squirrels. He ponders the meaning of life, monitors his decline, and doesn't get enough exercise. He is in his late 40s.
*'''Janis''' is Arlo's wife. Like Arlo, she is shown to have an undefined corporate job, at which she has been known to receive embarrassing faxes and emails from Arlo. Especially in earlier strips, she was portrayed as insecure about her looks (despite Arlo's sincere compliments) and, due to that insecurity, prone to "petty jealousies."&lt;ref name="arloandjanis642"/&gt;  She worries about Arlo's health and about Gene growing up. Janis is sincere, straightforward, and works hard on her relationships. She gets plenty of exercise, and enjoys gardening. She has at times sunbathed secretly, despite the danger to her health.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''Caught Red-Handed'' http://arloandjanis.com/?p=780&lt;/ref&gt;  "A highlight of the strip's  run was when Janis bobbed her shoulder-length hair."&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
[[File:Ludwigsfirstappearance.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The first on-panel appearance of Ludwig, then referred to only as "the cat".|left]]
*'''Gene (Eugene)''' is their son.&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt; Arlo and Janis were once frequently joined by their son, but as Gene slowly matured, his presence in the strip shrank dramatically. He is a good kid. Having been approximately eight years old when the strip was introduced, he received his driver's license May 26, 2003. By 2007, he's roughly eighteen when a week's worth of strips in June 2007 featured Gene's high school graduation. In August 2007 he is shown leaving home for college. Johnson maintained that Gene's diminished role in the strip was due to his wanting to show realistically the way that adolescents begin to lead their own lives. In time, Gene received more panel-time as his relationship with Mary Lou blossomed. The couple surprised Arlo and Janis with a small wedding ceremony in September 2012, and they seem to have been pronounced man and wife in a pantomime daily on September 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2012/09/20 |title= Arlo and Janis |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were presented as "Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Day" in the final panel of the next day's installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2012/09/21 |title= Arlo and Janis |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= September 21, 2012|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ludwig''' the cat was first seen in the third panel of the daily published November 2, 1993, and has only more recently become a regular character. Except in fantasy sequences, Ludwig behaves like a real cat. One such sequence began with Ludwig suggesting to Arlo that "the role of the cat in this strip should be more anthropomorphic!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2013/04/09&lt;/ref&gt; On Johnson's blog, at least, he is often referred to as "Luddie", and his fans are identified as "Luddites".&lt;ref&gt;http://arloandjanis.com/?p=573 That darn cat 11/17/08&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mary Lou''' is their daughter-in-law. She first appeared as a summer love whom young Gene met while on a family beach vacation in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/Mary%20Lou%202.htm |title=A smattering of strips from 1993 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had brought her back into the strip on several occasions as early as Christmas 1993 and the summer of 1994, including the summers after Gene's first three years of college (2008, 2009 and 2010). Johnson said that Mary Lou had taken on an importance second only to the three main characters and Ludwig, and that she and her family are about the only recurring characters outside the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/?p=443#comments |title=The Backstory of Mary Lou 8/18/08 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/?m=200906 |title=June 2009 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mary Lou, an unwed mother from a previous relationship, became Gene's first mature love interest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.com/arlo&amp;janis/?DateAfter=2009-06-16&amp;DateBefore=2009-06-16&amp;Order=d.DateStrip+DESC&amp;PerPage=1&amp;Search=&amp;x=41&amp;y=5 |title=Arlo &amp; Janis free online comic strip library at |publisher=Comics.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 Gene offered Mary Lou his great-grandmother's ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.com/arlo&amp;janis/?DateAfter=2010-07-16&amp;DateBefore=2010-07-16&amp;Order=d.DateStrip+ASC&amp;PerPage=1&amp;Search=&amp;x=12&amp;y=11 Arlo &amp; Janis Comics.com 6-18-10 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 she became Gene's wife.
*'''Meg''' is Mary Lou's precocious daughter from an early relationship.
*'''Other Cast Members:''' Mary Lou's father Gus often appears. Other characters take part in storylines on occasion, some as established "guest stars", but no other characters appear regularly in the strip, and few ever recur at all.

== Content ==
''Arlo and Janis'' strips are most often [[gag-a-day]] strips based on recurring themes, with only rarely any advancement of continuity. Readers may see themselves in Johnson's observations, and have written to his blog jokingly accusing Johnson of looking in their windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/?p=449#comments |title=A Rhetorical Question 8/20/08 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, Johnson strings together a few daily gags that, taken together, amount to the exploration of a topic. Only rarely does he create arcs of daily strips that together take on all the traditional elements of a [[narrative|story]].

Johnson wrote, "I’ve always enjoyed serial strips, but they change the nature of the product. Ultimately, I think I prefer the gag-a-day format, done well. The 'done well' part is crucial. Of course, they can’t be hilarious every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/?p=479#comments |title=Goodbye to all that 9/11/08 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=September 10, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sometimes when I get on a roll with an extended conversation within a sequence of strips", Johnson observed, "the whole can be viewed like a short comic book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/|title=Hard Copy Christmas II 12/18/17 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=Dec 18, 2017 |accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson wrote that early on he experimented with short poems "when I wanted to do something a bit different or when I was stuck for a better idea." In time it occurred to him that the limerick format was inherently comical and "fit the four-panel format" of the comic strip. Since the time of that realization, the limerick has been an occasionally recurring structure in the daily strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/sheer-poetry-2#comments |title=Sheer Poetry |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his recurring themes for jokes and storylines are touched on below:

=== Physical attraction ===
[[File:Arloandjanissuggestive.jpg|left|550px|thumb|An example of the frequently suggestive content that the strip features.|left]]
Many of the most notable jokes are based on sexual attraction, especially Arlo's desire for Janis. Despite having been a couple since meeting in college in 1973 (a [[backstory]] revealed in a series of strips that also functioned as a parody of the book and film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), Arlo and Janis are still besotted with each other. The libidinous content of the strip can be surprisingly overt to readers accustomed to more sanitized newspaper comics. And in a medium where long marriages are often presented as either sexless or antagonistic (''[[The Lockhorns]]'', ''[[Andy Capp]]'', etc.), these strips that show the couple's love and ongoing attraction to each other offer an alternative.

"There has always been knowledge of sex in ''Arlo and Janis'', and the fact that married people have sex," Johnson said. "I think it's silly to ignore that humans have sex. It's like ignoring eating and sleeping."&lt;ref name="birmpost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Johnson_Carolyn_85177820.aspx| title= Birmingham Post-Herald, Published on: 7/5/2001| accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson also wrote, "I'd be willing to bet you five dollars I was the first cartoonist to depict a couple exchanging sexual fantasies in bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arloandjanis.com/fantasies2.htm |title=Fantasies 2 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the "Comics I Don't Understand" website, "The Arlo Award" is given to a cartoonist who slips something past the syndicate censors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsidontunderstand.com/wordpress/?s=arlo%2Baward|title=Comics I Don’t Understand |publisher=Comicsidontunderstand.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janis's negative [[body image]] has been a popular topic over the years. She sees herself as at least a little overweight, and unworthy of wearing a two-piece swimsuit. Arlo, on the other hand, persistently tries to convince her to put on the [[bikini]] again.

===Office humor===
The early years of the strip regularly featured office humor. Johnson claims he was "doing office humor when [[Scott Adams]] worked for the phone company", but he used the theme less frequently over time. Johnson has attributed that decline to two factors. First, his memories of own his experiences in an office setting began to fade as he became ensconced in his cartooning, leaving him "neither inclined nor qualified to comment on 'the office.'" Second, he feels that with the concept of traditional "careers" falling by the wayside, his middle-aged title characters would tend to center their lives around relationships and home. Seldom were jobs even mentioned as time passed, and by 2017, Johnson felt he needed to address the suspicion of readers that Arlo and Janis were retired. While proclaiming they retained their usual undefined jobs, Johnson allowed that Arlo and Janis were in "that winding-down phase of employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arloandjanis.com/2017/05/16 |title=Harpe diem |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date=May 16, 2017 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of the sexes and species, and generations ===
Stereotypical gender differences between Arlo and Janis provide a lot of the strip's content. For example, Janis often accuses Arlo of not listening to her, and he pretends that he does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arloandjanis.com/gripe1.htm |title=Gripe 1 |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlo watches football and Janis complains about it.

Arlo's envy of the cat Ludwig's idyllic lifestyle, sometimes veiled as criticism, fuels many strips. "I make it a rule to draw one cat cartoon a week," Johnson writes. "I draw a cat cartoon every fifth or sixth Sunday. Other than that, I don't plan it. Sometimes, a cat cartoon will run late in the week, then on Sunday, then again early the next week. Inevitably, I will get mail of the ilk, 'I hate your stupid cat cartoons! That's all you do anymore! Why don't you throw yourself under a bus, you loser!' If I were a cat, I'd steer clear of those types." Johnson's readers submit many stories of cute cats to his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arloandjanis.com/cracks.htm |title=Cracks |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson also treats Arlo's envy of Gene's youth and freedom, and Arlo's ironic and sympathetic observation of Gene's unawareness of how much lies ahead. Janis is shown worrying that Gene is growing up—and away—before she is ready and she struggles to hold onto him.

===Politics and history===
The strip often includes political viewpoints. In particular, Arlo regularly rants about the damaging influence of large corporations on [[American society]]. One lengthy storyline examined American and [[Cuba]]n relations. Another related the [[World War II]] experience of Arlo's father.

===Modern life===
''Arlo and Janis'' humorously criticizes the pace, direction, and quality of modern American life. Arlo feels trapped on a "treadmill" and has questioned the wisdom of the entire disposable consumer economy on multiple occasions. In the strip on Sunday, November 30, 2008, this idea was reiterated by Janis: "You said we buy things we don't need with money we don't have." Arlo counters with, "But the people who sell us the things we don't need depend on the money we don't have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.com/arlo&amp;janis/?DateAfter=2008-11-30&amp;DateBefore=2008-11-30&amp;Order=s.DateStrip+DESC&amp;PerPage=1&amp;Search=&amp;x=38&amp;y=13 |title=Arlo &amp; Janis free online comic strip library at |publisher=Comics.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Arlo has gone up a tree to escape "the absurdity of modern living," but he soon pines for a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.com/arlo&amp;janis/?DateAfter=2009-08-20&amp;DateBefore=2009-08-20&amp;Order=d.DateStrip+DESC&amp;PerPage=1&amp;Search=&amp;x=38&amp;y=20 |title=Arlo &amp; Janis free online comic strip library at |publisher=Comics.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called conveniences like cable television and cellular phones are examined. For example, the miniaturization of [[data storage devices]] is both trumpeted and lampooned in the November 3, 2007, daily, with Janis unable to find the tiny disk that conveniently holds all her photographs. The loss of [[privacy]] that has come with the internet is also mourned: "I still think it's creepy to go to a book or music web site and have it make suggestions of 'other titles you might enjoy,'" admits Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arloandjanis.com/netshare.htm |title=Net Share |publisher=Arloandjanis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surrealism, fantasy and metaphor ===
There are regular detours from "reality". In one case, Arlo "called in sick" to the strip and was replaced by a large, realistically drawn [[alligator]] for a week. Janis imagined a large dust-bunny named [[Harvey (film)|Harvey]] in another sequence, representing her feelings of house-keeping inadequacy. Janis has shared her fantasy of being a [[torch singer]] and Arlo has periodically "sailed away" from his mundane existence in extended daydreams. The courtship of a [[mermaid]] by a fisherman and a fable of the grasshopper and the ant were both played out by the Arlo and Janis characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.msu.edu/comics/rri/grri/gras.htm |title=Index to Comic Art Collection: "Grasping" to "Gratuitous" |publisher=Lib.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808140321/http://www.lib.msu.edu/comics/rri/grri/gras.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fourth wall]] is sometimes broken, and readers sometimes are shown behind the scenes, with the "actors" preparing for the strip. For example, as [[Daylight Saving Time]] ended on November 4, 2012, nothing is happening, and Arlo implies that the reader has come in too early due to the time change, and that the "comic strip doesn't begin for another hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2012/11/04 |title= Arlo and Janis |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-reference ===
There have been many [[meta-joke]] strips about the process of creating a daily comic strip, particularly about [[writer's block]], with the character admitting (for the cartoonist) the absence of a joke or the reuse of a joke used before. Arlo's fondness for and the inclusion in the strip of the Mississippi-born singer/songwriter [[Jimmy Buffett]] reveal Johnson's musical taste, and his love of sailing mirrors Johnson's. Within the Sunday strip for January 1, 2012, Arlo affixes that same strip onto his freezer door, creating the infinity effect sometimes used on comic book covers, and also referencing that habit of comic strip readers to clip and post favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2012/01/01 |title= Arlo and Janis |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= January 1, 2012|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the July 19, 2018 daily strip, Johnson steps out into full view. He draws himself drinking coffee at the drawing board. A blank sheet of paper awaits an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gocomics.com/arloandjanis/2018/07/19 |title= Arlo and Janis |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= July 19, 2018|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
Though it's unclear exactly where Arlo and Janis live, Johnson's southern upbringing regularly influences the strip, and it might be assumed that they live in or near a southern city such as [[Jackson, Mississippi]], [[Birmingham, Alabama]] or [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. On the other hand, it snows quite a bit in their area. In a 2008 strip, Johnson put their home a four-hour drive from the coast, but he didn't reveal which coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arloandjanis.com/wheres-arlo|title= Where's Arlo? |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson|date= November 29, 2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson wrote in his blog on January 2, 2014, "I remember not long after I started drawing Arlo &amp; Janis , I made a reference to eating peas on New Year’s Day, and my editor in New York City expressed concern that might be a 'southern' tradition, and we didn’t want to give newspaper editors the idea A&amp;J was a 'southern' strip. I guess she was afraid I’d start doing jokes about fatback and kissin’ cousins."

Most of the action takes place in the home and the yard, both of which are portrayed with an economy of ink. In earlier years especially, a glimpse into the office environments of either Arlo or Janis might be given. There are occasional forays into the neighborhood, but there are few if any discernible landmarks there. The seashore is the favored vacation destination.

Especially after Gene's marriage, the strip's setting expanded to include Gene's family's home, their farm, and their farm stand and cafe.

== Origins of the characters' names ==
According to Johnson's ex-wife, the newspaper columnist [[Rheta Grimsley Johnson]], the lead characters are named after 1960s music icons [[Arlo Guthrie]] and [[Janis Joplin]], and their son after [[Eugene McCarthy]].&lt;ref name=Barbie&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BPWpLufrz_MC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=arlo+%26+janis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0ENOTI6kNIn2tgOKksztDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arlo%20%26%20janis&amp;f=false Johnson, Rheta ''Enchanted Evening Barbie and the Second Coming: A Memoir'', NewSouth Books, 2010 {{ISBN|1-58838-250-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58838-250-4}} p90]&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Johnson has said that Arlo was inspired by a friend with curly hair who resembles Guthrie, and the name Janis was "a marketing device used to attract the baby boom generation."&lt;ref name="birmpost" /&gt; Some readers have suggested that the strip is autobiographical, because Janis and Rheta Grimsley Johnson are lookalikes, as are Johnson and Arlo. Rheta Grimsley Johnson confirms the physical resemblances, but states that the strip is not autobiographical, noting that they did not have any children, and that there is not a contrast between her personality and that of Johnson, unlike the personality differences in the strip between Arlo and Janis.&lt;ref name=Barbie/&gt;

== Jimmy Johnson ==
[[Jimmy Johnson (cartoonist)|Jimmy Johnson]] lives in the coastal city of [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]. Although his own house was largely undamaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005, the devastation of his adopted hometown affected Johnson greatly; his blog at [http://www.arloandjanis.com ArloAndJanis.com] focused on little else for months afterward, and references to the hurricane appeared in the strip in the last third of 2005.

== Reprint volumes ==
There has been one paperback reprint volume titled ''Arlo and Janis: Bop 'Till You Drop''. It was published by Pharos Books in February 1989. The ISBN numbers assigned to it are: {{ISBN|0-88687-413-0}}; and {{ISBN|978-0-88687-413-1}}. When offered for sale on [[Amazon.com]], it is usually priced as a prized collectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0886874130/ref=sr_1_olp_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228260477&amp;sr=8-1 |title=Used and New: Arlo and Janis: Bop 'Till You Drop |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson made mention in his blog of wanting to publish a twentieth anniversary volume for 2005. In 2008, after repeated inquiries by posters to his blog, the idea was revived on April 1, but on March 3, 2011, Johnson announced in his blog that the book deal had fallen through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arloandjanis.com/?p=1529 |title= Vive la différence |first= Jimmy|last=Johnson |work=arloandjanis.com |date= March 3, 2011|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in November 2011, Johnson self-published ''Beaucoup Arlo &amp; Janis'', a 256-page, hard-bound collection of over 900 carefully selected A&amp;J comic strips with several introductory essays by the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arloandjanis.com/beaucouparloandjanis | title= The A&amp;J Book | first=Jimmy|last=Johnson|work=arloandjanis.com|date=November 27, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benson Island''', known to the [[Tseshaht First Nation]] people as C'isaa (Ćišaa?atḥ) or Ts'ishaa (Ts'isha?atH), is part of the [[Broken Group]] in [[Barkley Sound]] on the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. It is notable because the [[Tseshaht First Nation]] recognize it as the creation site where the first man and first woman of the Tseshaht people came into this world.

==Geography==

[[File:Benson Island SEBeach.jpg|thumb|left|View of the southeastern beach on Benson Island]]
Benson is a small, irregularly shaped island on the northwestern edge of the Broken Group. It covers about {{convert|43|acre|ha}} and is about {{convert|.5|mile|km}} at its longest points from north to south. The shoreline is mostly very rugged, with two rock beaches on the northeast and southeast sides of the island. The northeast beach is the site of a former Tseshaht village, and there is a large cultural shell [[midden]] extending approximately {{convert|985|ft|m}} along the shoreline.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/860422/Five_Thousand_Years_of_Fishing_at_a_Shell_Midden_in_the_Broken_Group_Islands_Barkley_Sound_British_Columbia|first=Iain|last=McKechnie|title=Five Thousand Years of Fishing at a Shell Midden in the Broken Group Islands, Barkley Sounds, British Columbia|pages=29–30|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small [[blowhole (geology)|blowhole]] on the west side that is active mostly during high tides.

==History==

===Tseshaht people===

[[File:Ch'ichu'atH.jpg|thumb|A wood carving of Ch'ichu'atH, recognized by the Tseshaht First Nations as the First Man, at the cultural site on Benson Island, British Columbia, Canada. Carving by Gordon Dick of the Tseshaht First Nation.]]

The [[oral history]] of the [[Tseshaht]] people, part of the [[Nuu-Chah-Nulth]] culture of western [[British Columbia]], identifies Ts'ishaa (C'isaa) (Benson Island) as the place where Kapkimyis, a supernatural being in their tradition, created the first Tseshaht man and woman.&lt;ref name=nuu&gt;{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Susan|editor=Alan H. Hoover|title=Nuu-Chah-Nulth Voices, Histories, Objects &amp; Journeys|publisher=Royal British Columbia Museum|year=2000|pages=133–142|ISBN=0-7718-9548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of the story about this event. The following is taken from two current versions as told by the Tseshaht people:

*A girl called Nasayilim ("Sky Day") was awakened to see two people ‒ an old man and a [[shaman]]. The old man cut his left side, and the shaman collected the blood that flowed from the wound. He blew on it, creating what we call ''ts'chsy'a'pi'', the "life pulse". From this a boy named Naasiya'atu ("Day Down"), also known as Ch'ichu'?atH, was created. The boy and the girl grew up and had many children. Thus many were descended from the two. The Chief in the Sky made an island, high and dry, called Ts'isha' for the people to live. The boy was given a war club with blood along the edge and told to keep it on the beach so the tribe would never die.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This synopsis of the Tseshaht creation story is combined from two slightly different stories, one found on the interpretive signs on Benson Island (see photo accompanying this article) and another found on p138 of ''Nuu-Chah-Nulth Voices'' (see references)&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of C'isaa (Ts'ishaa) to the Tseshaht people is indicated by their very name: "Tseshaht" means "people of Ts'ishaa".&lt;ref name=tseshaht&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tseshaht.com/|title=We are Tseshaht|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological evidence shows the site at C'isaa was first occupied over 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/faculty/mcmillan/tseshaht.html|title=Tseshaht Archaeological Project|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tseshaht oral history tells of continuing occupation of the site until after European contact. The Tseshaht people used Ts'ishaa as a home village as they followed sea mammals, salmon and other food and natural resources throughout Barkley Sound as the seasons changed.&lt;ref name=tseshaht/&gt;

===Post-European Exploration===

In 1791 the Spanish Ship ''Santa Saturina'' entered Barkley Sound, marking the first European contact with the indigenous people living in the area. Over the next 100 years the Tseshaht and other First Nations in the area suffered enormous population declines, primarily from diseases such as [[smallpox]] that were brought by the European explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=First Nations Health Authority|url= http://www.fnha.ca/wellness/our-history-our-health|title=Our History, Our Health|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1865 the island was labeled on British Admiralty charts as Hawkins Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/4201.html|title=GeoBC: Benson Island|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 John W. Benson purchased the island and proceeded to build a large home on the east side of the island. The home was later expanded into a hotel for visitors. On November 19, 1922 the Victoria ''Colonist'' newspaper reported that the island "had a small hotel worth visiting. There were about ten acres cleared and a portion of it was planted in a garden and orchard to supply the hotel. The island and hotel are owned by Mrs. Benson, widow of an old-time sealing captain, and one of the early pioneers of the West Coast of Vancouver Island."&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite book|first=R. Bruce|last=Scott|title=Barkley Sound, a history of the Pacific Rim National Park area|publisher=Victoria, Canada: R. Bruce Scott|year=1972|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 most of the Broken Group islands, including Benson, were included in the newly designated [[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]]. The island has been a popular destination for [[sea kayak]]ers, recreational sailors and other visitors to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/parks/pacific-rim-canada-park/|title=Pacific Rim National Park Reserve|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Parks Canada]] and the [[Tseshaht First Nation]] reached an agreement to prohibit all camping on the island due to its cultural significance. An interpretive display about the importance of the island was installed in 2012. It includes a tall wooden house standing post carved by Tseshaht artist Gordon Dick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/activ16.aspx|title= First Nations Cultural Experiences: Broken Group Island Unit|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day trips are still permitted so that visitors may learn about the Tseshaht history.

The '''Berlin State Museums''' ({{lang-de|Staatliche Museen zu Berlin}}) are a group of institutions in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], comprising seventeen museums in five clusters, several research institutes, libraries, and supporting facilities. They are overseen by the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and funded by the German federal government in collaboration with Germany's federal states. The central complex on [[Museum Island]] was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1999. By 2007 the Berlin State Museums had grown into the largest complex of museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Langels, Otto: [http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/zeitreisen/649800/ "Constitutional Reality: 50 years of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation"], in German, [[Deutschlandradio]], 25 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Director-general of the Berlin State Museums is [[Michael Eissenhauer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">The Pawnbroker's Shop that has been reconstructed at [[Black Country Living Museum]] is one of a pair of cottages built in the 1840s, from School Lane in [[Himley]].

==Pawnbroking in the Black Country==
{{coord|52|31|23.1|N|2|4|36.81|W|region:GB|display=title}}

For an overview of Pawnbroking please see [[Pawnbroking|The History of Pawnbroking]].

[[File:Pawnbrokers.JPG|thumb|Outside of pawnbrokers shop at Black Country Living Museum]]

Pawnshops prospered in areas where the wages were low and unstable. In the Black Country in 1870 there were 160 pawnbrokers in the area, [[Walsall]] had 15 and [[Wednesbury]] had 48. &lt;ref&gt; Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.15. &lt;/ref&gt; For a housewife with a large family to look after it was a constant struggle to make ends meet. It was not uncommon for a family to have linen or clothes that they would pawn as a bridging loan until next payday. The struggling family could pawn their goods on a Monday and could buy them back the following Friday or Saturday. &lt;ref&gt; Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.15. &lt;/ref&gt; The items pawned were taken as security for a loan, the value of the item was based on what the pawnbroker thought he would get if he sold the item on. In return the customer would receive the loan a ticket. To redeem their pledge the customer had to pay the loan back in full plus any charges this included the valuation of their items and the cost of the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum Trust|location=Dudley|isbn=978-0-9562031-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pawnbrokers in the Black Country needed to be where the people were. Some of these businesses started in [[Public Houses]], which were frequently visited and saved customers a trip into town. &lt;ref&gt; Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.16. &lt;/ref&gt; Other Pawnbrokers operated out of converted houses in prominent positions like [[corner shops]].

==As a Museum Exhibit==
[[File:Pawnbrokers Window.JPG|thumb|Window of pawnbrokers shop at Black Country Living Museum]]

The pair of cottages from School Lane in Himley originally operated as a corner shop. The setting of the display was designed to represent a small scale business. The shop takes its name from a well known Black Country pawnbroker, Joseph Wiltshire, who owned shops in [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]], [[Wolverhampton]] and Carter's Green in [[West Bromwich]]. The exhibit at the Black Country Living Museum combines pawnbroking with retail, as did many pawnbroking businesses in the 19th century. In the museum's reconstruction the unredeemed goods and other stock are sold in the front room, while pawning of goods was done in the 'pledge room' at the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum Trust|location=Dudley|isbn=978-0-9562031-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shop window of the Pawnbroker's gives a good example of the types of goods that customers would 'pledge'. The display includes shoes, clothes, furs, musical instruments, children's toys and even a set of false teeth.

==History==
BotSeer served as a resource for studying the regulation and behavior of Web robots as well as information about the creation of effective robots.txt files and crawler implementations. It was publicly available on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

BotSeer provided three major services including robots.txt searching, robot bias analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Yang Sun, Z. Zhuang, I. Councill, C.L. Giles, [http://nitch.marketing/determining-bias-search-engines-robots-txt/ Determining Bias to Search Engines from Robots.txt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104202/http://nitch.marketing/determining-bias-search-engines-robots-txt/ |date=2015-04-02 }}, ''Proceedings of IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2007)'', 149-155, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoomwebmedia.com/search-engine-optimization.php&lt;/ref&gt; and robot-generated log analysis. The prototype of BotSeer also allowed users to search six thousand documentation files and source codes from 18 open source crawler projects.

BotSeer had indexed and analyzed 2.2 million robots.txt files obtained from 13.2 million websites, as well as a large Web server log of real-world robot behavior and related analysis. BotSeer's goals were to assist researchers, webmasters, web crawler developers and others with web robots related research and information needs. However, some people received BotSeer negatively, arguing that it contradicted the purpose of the robots.txt convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120420234917/http://www.ihelpyou.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-25747.html BotSeer? - SEO Best Practices Search Engine Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;

BotSeer had also had set up a [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222203547/http://www.v4d.net/ |date=December 22, 2008 |title=Web Robot Behavior and Performance Test }} (instead of [http://www.v4d.net/ unrelated current site] )&lt;/ref&gt; to test the ethics, performance and behavior of [[web crawlers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15829">'''COBRA''' (or '''CoBrA''') was a European [[avant-garde]] [[art movement|movement]] active from 1948 to 1951. The name was coined in 1948 by [[Christian Dotremont]] from the initials of the members' home cities: [[Copenhagen]] (Co), [[Brussels]] (Br), [[Amsterdam]] (A).

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:'Questioning Children', oil on canvas painting by Karel Appel, 1948, private collection.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'Questioning Children', oil on canvas painting by [[Karel Appel]], 1948, private collection]] --&gt;
During the time of occupation of World War II, the Netherlands had been disconnected from the art world beyond its borders. COBRA was formed shortly thereafter. This international movement of artists who worked experimentally evolved from the criticisms of Western society and a common desire to break away from existing art movements, including "detested" naturalism and "sterile" [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]]. Experimentation was the symbol of an unfettered freedom, which, according to Constant, was ultimately embodied by children and the expressions of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baumgartner |first1=Michael |title=Klee and Cobra: A Child's Play |publisher=Hatje Cantz |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; COBRA was formed by [[Karel Appel]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys|Constant]], [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]], [[Christian Dotremont]], [[Asger Jorn]], and [[Joseph Noiret]] on 8 November 1948 in the Café Notre-Dame, Paris,&lt;ref name="moma.org"&gt;MOMA online [http://moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10954&amp;displayall=1 collections page]&lt;/ref&gt; with the signing of a manifesto, "La cause était entendue" ("The Case Was Settled"),&lt;ref&gt;"La cause était entendue" is an ironical reference to the manifesto "[http://www.andrebreton.fr/Resources/Assets/56600100560650/HR_56600100560650_1.jpg La cause est entendue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110537/http://www.andrebreton.fr/Resources/Assets/56600100560650/HR_56600100560650_1.jpg |date=2011-07-18 }}" (The Case Is Settled) from the supporters of Revolutionary Surrealism&lt;/ref&gt; drawn up by Dotremont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3558757 ''La cause etait entendue'', first version of the CoBrA group's manifesto, 8 November 1948, Yale University Library, Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Formed with a unifying doctrine of complete freedom of colour and form, as well as antipathy towards [[Surrealism]], the artists also shared an interest in [[Marxism]] as well as modernism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Their working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children’s drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of [[Paul Klee]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name="moma.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming together as an amalgamation of the Dutch group Reflex, the Danish group Høst and the Belgian Revolutionary Surrealist Group, the group only lasted a few years but managed to achieve a number of objectives in that time: the periodical ''Cobra'', a series of collaborations between various members called ''Peintures-Mot'' and two large-scale exhibitions. The first of these was held at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam, November 1949, the other at the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Liège (city)|Liège]] in 1951.

In November 1949 the group officially changed its name to Internationale des Artistes Expérimentaux with membership having spread across Europe and the United States, although this name has never stuck. The movement was officially disbanded in 1951, but many of its members remained close, with Dotremont in particular continuing collaborations with many of the leading members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CoBrA Museum |url=http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/cobra.html |location=Cobra Museum, The Netherlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621043026/http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/cobra.html |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of the group consisted of semi-abstract paintings with brilliant color, violent brushwork, and distorted human figures inspired by primitive and folk art and similar to American [[action painting]]. Cobra was a milestone in the development of [[Tachisme]] and European [[abstract expressionism]].

Cobra was perhaps the last avant-garde movement of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stokvis – [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8HpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=COBRA+art+movement&amp;dq=COBRA+art+movement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIl-yRpr_dxgIVQ1wUCh24hQyn Cobra: The Last Avant-garde Movement of the Twentieth Century] Lund Humphries 2004, 349 pages, {{ISBN|0853318980}} [Retrieved 2015-07-15]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nathalie Aubert the group only
lasted officially for three years (1948 to 1951). After that period each artist
in the group developed their own individual paths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Auber, Nathalie. “’Cobra after Cobra’ And The Alba Congress:

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manifesto ===

The manifesto, entitled, "''La cause était entendue''" (The Case Was Settled) was written by CoBrA member Christian Dotremont and signed by all founding members in Paris in 1948. It was directly speaking to their experience attending the Centre International de Documentation sur l’Art d’Avant-garde in which they felt the atmosphere was sterile and authoritarian. It was a statement of working collaboratively in an organic mode of experimentation in order to develop their work separate from the current place of the avant-garde movement. The name of the manifesto was also a play on words from an earlier document signed by Belgian and French Revolutionary Surrealists in July 1947, entitled "La cause est entendue" (The Case Is Settled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokvis|first1=Willemijn|title=Cobra: The Last Avant-Garde Movement|date=2004|publisher=Lund Humphries|location=Aldershot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The European artists were different from their American counterparts (the [[Abstract expressionists]]) for they preferred the process over the product and introduced primitive, mythical, and folkloric elements along with a decorative input from their children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cooke, Lynne. “Review.” The Burlington Magazine 126, no. 978 (September 1, 1984): 583.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the new approaches that united the COBRA artists was their unrestrained use of strong colors, along with violent handwritings and figuration which can be either frightening or humorous.  Their art was alive with subhuman figures in order to mirror the terror and weakness of our time unlike the dehumanized art of [[Abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Edith. "Cobra Exhibition in Rotterdam." The Burlington Magazine 108.760 (1966): 388–89. JSTOR. Web. 14 Sept. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This spontaneous method was a rejection of Renaissance art, specialization, and ‘civilized art’, they preferred ‘uncivilized’ forms of expression which created an interplay between the conscious and the unconscious instead of the [[Surrealist]] interest in the unconscious alone. The childlike in their method meant a pleasure in painting, in the materials, forms, and finally the picture itself; this aesthetic notion was called ‘desire unbound’. The Dutch Artists in particular within Cobra (Corneille, Appel, Constant) were interested in Children's art.“We Wanted to start again like a child” Karel Appel insisted.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Appel, from an interview with Eleanor Flomenhaft, October 16, 1975; cited in Flomenhaft 1985, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Western Left, they were built upon the fusion of Art and Life through experiment in order to unite form and expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== CoBrA exhibitions ==
They exhibited mainly in Holland, but also Paris and other countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 875035|title=Cobra Exhibition in Rotterdam |date=July 1966  |journal=The Burlington Magazine |last = Hoffmann |first=Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stedelijk Museum Exhibition===

The first major exhibition was held at the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] in November 1949 under the title "International Experimental Art".

The museum's director and curator [[Willem Sandberg]] was interested in bringing experimentalism and abstraction to The Netherlands, and had also been an active member of the Dutch Resistance during the war. He was deeply involved with the CoBrA group and maintained direct contacts between the artists and the Stedelijk Museum.&lt;ref name="stedelijk.nl"&gt;http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/cobra-the-stedelijk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/willem-sandberg-warm-printing&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Aldo van Eyck]], who would later become known for his architecture of playgrounds as cultural critique, was asked to do the interior design of the exhibition. The close relationship between Van Eyck and the artists from the CoBrA, who also drew their inspiration in particular from children's drawings, makes it probable that much of Eyck's early inspiration for the playgrounds may have derived from CoBrA.&lt;ref name="stichtingconstant.nl"&gt;http://stichtingconstant.nl/cobra-1948-1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://merijnoudenampsen.org/2013/03/27/aldo-van-eyck-and-the-city-as-playground/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stedelijk Museum exhibition gave rise to furious criticism from press and the public. A critic from ''[[Het Vrije Volk]]'' (Free People) wrote, “Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum” (“Smirch, twaddle and mess in the SMA"). The CoBrA artists are considered scribblers and [[con artists]].&lt;ref name="stichtingconstant.nl" /&gt; Newspapers spoke of offensive art and provocation on the part of the artists, and one evening for experimental poetry at the Stedelijk was the occasion for a public brawl.&lt;ref name="stedelijk.nl" /&gt;

=== Exhibition in Liège ===
The last CoBrA exhibit was located in [[Liège]], Belgium, in 1951. Shortly after this exhibit, the group dissolved. The show was organised by [[Pierre Alechinsky]], an artist from Belgium. The Dutch architect, Van Eyck designed the exhibition layout, just as he had for the 1949 CoBrA exhibition in Stedelijk. The innovations of this exhibit were that the composition for the wall was in a  grid formation. In addition, the sculptures, which were featured in this show were on coal beds from the Liege area itself.

This show was not specific to only CoBrA artists, and also, major artists of the CoBrA movement were not in this exhibit due to the existing conflict within the group that eventually led to the collapse of CoBrA shortly after in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V-_iBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cobra+1951+exhibition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NiAIA1neY2&amp;sig=OHUBjMPfxSa5so9ttjvYmWZoVp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwDGoVChMItfTTg4D6xwIVlo6SCh2MagKs#v=onepage&amp;q=cobra%201951%20exhibition&amp;f=false |title=The Art and Politics of Asger Jorn: The Avant-Garde Won't Give Up |date=August 2014 |accessdate= |website=Google Books |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Unlimited |last=Kurczynski |first=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
* [[Alison M. Gingeras]] praises Cobra as being a, "...wonderfully messy, cacophonous, and multi-tentacled," entity.&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inside-cobra-the-wonderfully-messy-avant-garde-movement-youve-never-heard-of_55e49410e4b0aec9f3540ee4 "Revisiting The Radically Avant-Garde Movement Art History Forgot". ''The Huffington Post''. Retrieved 2015-09-22]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ernest Mancoba]] (1904–2002), of South Africa, claimed to be one of the only black artists of Cobra. In his own words, Mancoba, a clear supporter of the Cobra movement, criticizes the views of his fellow artists regarding himself: "The embarrassment that my presence caused to the point of making me, in their eyes, some sort of 'Invisible Man' or merely the consort of a European woman artist—was understandable, as before me there had never been to my knowledge any black man taking part in the visual arts 'avant garde' of the Western World."&lt;ref name="Huffington" /&gt;

==Legacy==
There is a Cobra Museum in [[Amstelveen]], Netherlands, displaying works by [[Karel Appel]] and other international avant-garde artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/ Cobra Museum of Modern Art], Amstelveen&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is known for its large assemblage of works of CoBrA art.  The museum displays works by Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, and Asger Jorn, the movement's leading exponents. (www.nsuartmuseum.org )&lt;from Florida travel book and the museum's website&gt;

Auctioneers Bruun Rasmussen held an auction of COBRA artists on April 3, 2006 in Copenhagen. It set records for the highest price for an [[Asger Jorn]] painting (6.4 million DKK for ''Tristesse Blanche'') and for the highest amount raised in a single auction in Denmark (30 million DKK in total).

The '''Declaration of Independence of Azerbaijan''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycanın İstiqlal Bəyannaməsi}}) is the [[declaration of independence]] of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] from the [[Russian Empire]]. Azerbaijan was proclaimed independent in [[Tiflis]] on 28 May 1918.&lt;ref name="Элм"&gt;{{cite book|title=Азербайджанская Демократическая Республика (1918 - 1920)|year=1998|publisher=Элм|isbn=5-8066-0897-2|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was founded by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Muslim representation in the defunct [[Transcaucasian Seim]] had constituted itself into the Azerbaijani National Council, and on May 28, 1918 proclaimed that a new nation was born. So far only a geographical reference, Azerbaijan now became the name of a state, and some 2 million people, called variously Tatars, Transcaucasian Muslims and Caucasian Turks, officially became Azerbaijanis.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski"/&gt;

== History ==
At the beginning of 1918, the political situation in the Caucasus remained critical. After the failure of the Russian-Germany peace talks in Brest-Litovsk, the German-Turkish troops began to attack on 6 December 1917 in the Caucasus. At the beginning of January 1918 Turkish troops were able to capture the Kars and Batumi provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.gov.by/eng/index.php?id=348346|title=History of the war|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputies from the Transcaucasus elected to the Russian Entrepreneurial Council decided to establish a Transcaucasian Sejm- the Transcaucasian Parliament as the government body in the country on February 14, 1918.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://axc.preslib.az/en_a1.html|title=Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

30 members of Musavat Party and the Democratic Party of Neutral people, 7 members from the Muslim Socialists, 3 members from the İttihad Party, 4 members from the Democratic Socialist-Democratic Menshevik Party, included to Transcaucasian Sejm.(Parliament) As a result, 44 Azerbaijanis took place the Transcaucasian Seim and established the Muslim fraction of the Sejm. These were:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After a long and thorough discussion, the Secretary [[Mustafa Mahmudov]] read the names of voters; 24 votes, with 2 abstentions, adopted a Declaration of Independence of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="Элм"/&gt; The Declaration was signed by [[Hasan bey Aghayev]], [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]], [[Nasib Yusifbeyli]], [[Jamo bey Hajinski]], Shafi bey Rustambeyli, [[Nariman bey Narimanbeyov]], [[Javad Malik-Yeganov]] and [[Mustafa Mahmudov]].

'''Pharmaceutical packaging''' (or '''drug packaging''') is the packages and the [[packaging]] processes for [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical preparations]]. It involves all of the operations from production through [[drug distribution]] channels to the end consumer.  

Pharmaceutical packaging is highly regulated but with some variation in the details, depending on the country of origin  or the region. Several common factors can include:  assurance of patient safety, assurance of the efficacy of the drug through the intended [[shelf life]], uniformity of the drug through different production lots, thorough documentation of all materials and processes, control of possible migration of packaging components into the drug, control of degradation of the drug by oxygen, moisture, heat, etc., prevention of [[microbial]] contamination, sterility, etc. Packaging is often involved in dispensing, dosing, and use of the pharmaceutical product. Communication of proper use and cautionary labels are also regulated. Packaging is an integral part of pharmaceutical product. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Segments of usage==
Pharmaceutical packaging can often be thought of by the segment in the distribution system being encountered and by the functions needed by the user of the package.   Packaging requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;  {{cite book

[[File:Examining Bulk Drug Containers (FDA 100) (8250838700).jpg|thumb|right|Bulk drugs in fiber drums]]
Bulk pharmaceuticals can be shipped to another pharmaceutical company for further processing, to a [[contract packager]] for forming unit packs, to international customers, etc.               Bulk shipments might be in fiber drums (with plastic liners), [[bulk box]]es, [[corrugated box]]es with liners, [[intermediate bulk container]]s, and other [[shipping container]]s.

Smaller bulk packs can be shipped to pharmacies, particularly compounding pharmacies.  The liquids or powders can be measured and put into primary packages.

Shipments to medical professionals could be at hospitals, nursing homes, veterinarians, dentists, etc.    These packaged  pharmaceuticals are intended to be dispensed and administered by professionally trained and certified personnel.  
[[File:Drugstore Ancillary Personal at work 19.JPG|thumb|right|Preparing consumer packaging of prescription drugs at pharmacy]]
Drugs under prescription control are sent to pharmacies in [[multi-pack]]s of unit packs or in bottles containing many hundreds of capsules.     Typically  a pharmacist prepares the final form of the unit pack or places a lower count of capsules in a small bottle for the customer.  In a pharmacy, pharmacists are available to answer questions and to ensure that proper documentation is provided.  Internet pharmacies mail the prescribed drugs to the customer; boxes or mailing envelopes are used.  Child resistant packaging is often required on the unit packs; if requested, a pharmacist is allowed put drugs in a bottle with easy open features.

Over-the-counter drugs are sold in drug stores, grocery stores, and diverse retail outlets.  Usually the package needs to have all the usage information available.  Packages often need to have [[tamper resistant]] features and [[child-resistant packaging]].

Usually the packaging and labeling of [[dietary supplement]]s, [[homeopathic]] drugs, and [[folk medicine]]s are not regulated.  Some producers voluntarily follow the regulations for over-the-counter drugs or regional [[Pharmacopoeia]]s.

==Package forms==

The wide variety of pharmaceutical solids, liquids, and gasses are packaged in a wide variety of packages.  Some of the common primary packages are:

===Blister packs===
{{Main|Blister pack}}
[[File:Plaquettes de pilule.jpg|thumb|right|Birth control pills in blister packs]]
Formed solid [[unit dose]]s of pharmaceuticals ([[Capsule (pharmacy) |capsules]], [[suppositories]], [[Tablet (pharmacy) | tablet]]s, etc.) are commonly packed in blister packs.  In Europe about 85% of solid unit doses are packed in blister packs with only about 20% in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Blister packs are pre-formed plastic/paper/foil packaging used for formed solid drugs.  The primary component of a blister pack is a cavity or pocket made from a thermoformed plastic. This usually has a backing of [[paperboard]] or a lidding seal of [[aluminum foil]] or [[plastic film]]. Blister packs are useful for protecting drugs against external factors, such as humidity and contamination for extended periods of time.

Blister packing machinery is readily available and is suited to validation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | accessdate = 26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottles===
[[Image:Induction sealed bottle.jpg|thumb|A foil innerseal on a  bottle]]
{{Main|Glass bottle}}
{{Main|Plastic bottle}}

Bottles are commonly used for liquid pharmaceuticals as well as formed tablets and capsules.   Glass is most common for liquids because it is inert and has excellent barrier properties.   Various types of plastic bottles are used both by drug producers as well as by pharmacists in a pharmacy.

Prescription bottles have been around since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="SHA 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsey|first1=Bill|title=Medicinal/Chemical/Druggist Bottles|url=https://sha.org/bottle/medicinal.htm|website=sha.org|publisher=[[Society for Historical Archaeology]]|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, prescription medication bottles were called ''medicinal bottles''.&lt;ref name="SHA 2016"/&gt; There are many styles and shapes of prescription bottles.&lt;ref name="SHA 2016"/&gt;

Prescription bottles come in several different colors, the most common of which being orange or light brown due to its ability to prevent [[ultraviolet light]] from degrading the potentially photosensitive contents through [[Mechanistic organic photochemistry|photochemical reactions]], while still letting enough visible light through for the contents to be easily visible. Other common colors include: Clear (for compounds that don't degrade in light), blue, dark brown, green, and various opaque hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.qorpak.com/WhyShouldIChooseBrownBottles.aspx | title=Why are Many Bottles Brown? | accessdate=1 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timed Dosing===

Some mail order pharmacies are now offering timed dosing packets for medications. They put a certain number of pills, as directed by your physician into a plastic package and print the date and time that the drugs are to be taken. It is used for people with multiple medications that are taken at different times of the day. &lt;ref name="Pharmacy Startup PillPack Could Change The Way America Takes Its Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2015/04/15/this-pharmacy-startup-wants-to-change-the-way-you-take-your-medicine/#96d9adb7de04 |title= Pharmacy Startup PillPack Could Change The Way America Takes Its Medicine |accessdate= 20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature==
[[File:Cold control packaging.jpg|thumb|right|Shipment of vaccine: PU insulated box, gel packs, temp monitor, etc.]]
Many pharmaceutical products are sensitive to heat or cold. Controlled distribution systems and sometimes [[cold chain]]s are  required.   

A mail order or [[online pharmacy]] usually ships orders by mail services or by small parcel carrier.  The shipment is not temperature-controlled and it may sit in a [[Letter box|mail box]] upon delivery.  Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the [[USFDA]] found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136&amp;nbsp;°F (58&amp;nbsp;°C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Black | first =J. C. |author2=Layoff, T  | title = Summer of 1995 – Mailbox Temperature Excurions of St Louis | work = US FDA Division of Drug Analysis | publisher = | url=http://www.layloff.net/articles/1995%20Mailbox%20Temp%20in%20STL.pdf | doi = | accessdate = 1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insulated mailing envelopes are sometimes used.

Larger shipments are sent in [[insulated shipping container]]s with [[dry ice]] or [[gel pack]]s.  A digital [[Temperature data logger]] or a [[time temperature indicator]] is often enclosed to monitor the temperature inside the container for its entire shipment.

==Counterfeiting==

{{Main|Counterfeit medications}}
Counterfeit drugs are a serious problem;  people can be taking useless drugs or even very dangerous drugs without knowing it.  Custom package seals, [[authentication]] labels, [[hologram]]s, and [[security printing]],  can be valued parts of an entire security system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | accessdate = 21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They help verify that enclosed drugs are what the package says they are. Drug counterfeiters, however, often work with package counterfeiters, some of whom can be sophisticated.  No packaging system is completely secure.

==Prescription labels==
Medication packaging includes a document that provides information about that drug and its use.  For [[prescription medication]]s, the insert is [[Technical writing|technical]], and provides information for [[Health professional|medical professionals]] about how to prescribe the drug. Package inserts for prescription drugs often include a separate document called a "patient package insert" with information written in [[Plain English|plain language]] intended for the [[end-user]] -- the person who will take the drug or give the drug to another person, for example a minor.  Inserts for [[over-the-counter medication]]]s are also written plainly.&lt;ref name=Nathan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nathan |first1=Joseph P. |last2=Vider |first2=Etty |title=The Package Insert |journal=US Pharm. |date=2015 |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=8-10. |url=https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-package-insert |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nadine Vanlaer |title=Drug Package Inserts: the Letter of the Law - Packaging Gateway |url=https://www.packaging-gateway.com/features/feature755/ |work=Packaging Gateway |date=August 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reading labels"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Consumer Reports|authorlink1=Consumer Reports|title=Drug Safety: Reading Labels and Patient Information|url=http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ReadingLabels1.pdf|website=consumerreports.org|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Take as directed"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Consumer Reports|authorlink1=Consumer Reports|title=Drug Safety: Taking Drugs as Directed|url=http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TakingAsDirected.pdf|website=consumerreports.org|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the US the document is called "prescribing information" or the "package insert" (PI) and layperson's document is called the "patient package insert" (PPI).&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt;  In Europe the technical document is called the "summary of product characteristics" and the document for end-users is called the "package leaflet".&lt;ref name=EMA&gt;{{cite web |title=Marketing authorisation - Product-information requirements |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000199.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac0580022bb3 |publisher=European Medicines Agency |accessdate=18 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bottle or box also has information printed on it, intended for the person taking the medication.&lt;ref name="Take as directed"/&gt;

==Packaging production==
{{Main|Validation (drug manufacture)}}
[[File:Laboratoires Arkopharma - Chaine de conditionnement remplissage piluliers.JPG|thumb|right|Example pharmaceutical packaging line]]
All aspects of pharmaceutical production, including packaging, are tightly controlled and have regulatory requirements.   Uniformity, cleanliness, sterility, and other requirements are needed to maintain [[Good Manufacturing Practice]]s. 

Product safety management is vital.  A complete [[Quality Management System]] must be in place.  Validation involves collecting documentary evidence of all aspects of compliance.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quality assurance extends beyond the packaging operations through distribution and cold chain management; Good [[drug distribution|distribution]] practice is often a regulatory requirement.

With a large portion of  pharmaceutical packaging being outsourced to [[contract packager]]s,  additional demand is being placed on specialty areas, i.e. specialty dosage forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2016/11/cmo-report-two-thirds-pharma-manufacturing-outsourced|title=Two-thirds of pharmaceutical manufacturing is outsourced; preferred providers pick up largest share|last=|first=|date=|website=Pharmaceutical Processing|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic Freedom Fighters''' ('''EFF''') is a [[South Africa]]n [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[political party]]. It was started by expelled former [[African National Congress Youth League]] (ANCYL) President [[Julius Malema]], and his allies, in 2013.&lt;ref name="Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malema launches his Economic Freedom Fighters|author=Meggan Saville|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/malema-launches-his-economic-freedom-fighters/|newspaper=Dispatch Online|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725200305/http://www.dispatch.co.za/malema-launches-his-economic-freedom-fighters/|archivedate=25 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malema is President of the EFF, heading the Central Command Team which serves as the central structure of the party.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malema takes command of Economic Freedom Fighters|author=Setumo Stone|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2013/07/11/malema-takes-command-of-economic-freedom-fighters|newspaper=[[Business Day (South Africa)|Business Day]]|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714113641/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2013/07/11/malema-takes-command-of-economic-freedom-fighters|archivedate=14 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently the third-largest party in both houses of the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African Parliament]], receiving 1,169,259 votes and a 6.35% share of the vote in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. {{Citation needed span|text=By December 2014, the EFF claimed to have over half a million members, although this has not been independently verified.|date=August 2018|reason=not verified independtly, not even a source that we can use to cite EFF saying that they even have those numbers}}

==History==
At a 26 July 2013 press briefing in [[Soweto]], Malema announced that the new party had over 1000 members, double the 500 required for registration with the [[Electoral Commission of South Africa|Independent Electoral Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref name="EFF 1000"&gt;{{cite news|title=EFF readies for election registration as over 1 000 members recruited|author=SAPA|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2013/07/28/eff-readies-for-election-registration-as-over-1-000-members-recruited|newspaper=[[The Times (South Africa)|The Times]]|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730092849/http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2013/07/28/eff-readies-for-election-registration-as-over-1-000-members-recruited|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF is now registered with the IEC, after an objection to its registration by the [[Freedom Front Plus]] (FF+) was dismissed in September 2013.&lt;ref name="It'sOfficial"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's official: Malema's EFF is a political party|author=Verashni Pillay|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-09-05-malemas-eff-to-contest-2014-elections|newspaper=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907063401/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-09-05-malemas-eff-to-contest-2014-elections|archivedate=7 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Splinters and infighting==
In 2015, the EFF suspended [[Member of parliament|MP]] Lucky Twala and expelled three MPs, Mpho Ramakatsa, Andile Mngxitama and [[Khanyisile Litchfield-Tshabalala]].&lt;ref name=m.news24.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Litchfield-Tshabalala-UDMs-new-national-organiser-20150605|title=Litchfield-Tshabalala UDM's new national organiser|author=Genevieve Quintal|date=2015-06-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930022925/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Litchfield-Tshabalala-UDMs-new-national-organiser-20150605|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mngxitama formed his own party, named [[Black First Land First]] (BLF), while Litchfield-Tshabalala joined the [[United Democratic Movement]].

[[File:EFF land march on Mandela Day 2014.JPG|thumb|A small march by the EFF on Mandela Day (18 July) 2014 near the parliament building in [[Cape Town]] protesting in support of [[land reform in South Africa]].]]
The EFF "draws inspiration from the broad [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] tradition and [[Frantz Fanon|Fanonian]] schools of thought in their analyses of the state, imperialism, culture and class contradictions in every society", according to one of its declarations.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.effonline.org/declaration|title=Declaration|work=effonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It criticises the [[African National Congress]] and their primary opposition, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], for their allegedly pro-business stances, which it claims have sold out the black people of South Africa to capitalism as cheap labour. It promises to tackle corruption, provide quality social housing, and provide free primary healthcare and education for all, as well as proposing to [[expropriation|expropriate]] stolen land, nationalise the mining and banking sectors, double welfare grants and the minimum wage, and end the proposed toll system for highways.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

The EFF takes significant inspiration from [[Thomas Sankara]] in terms of both style and ideology.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duval Smith|first=Alex|date=30 April 2014|title='Africa's Che Guevara': Thomas Sankara's legacy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27219307|newspaper=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101053949/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27219307|archivedate=1 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2014 column, the prominent EFF member Jackie Shandu declared his party a "proudly Sankarist formation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shandu|first=Jackie|date=22 May 2014|title=The Sankarist makings of the EFF|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2014-05-22-the-sankarist-makings-of-eff/#.VFqe0d186rX|newspaper=[[Daily Maverick]]|location=[[Johannesburg]]|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106000454/http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2014-05-22-the-sankarist-makings-of-eff/#.VFqe0d186rX|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF has been vocal in its criticism of black business owners and black owners of mining companies in South Africa. In an address at the Oxford Union in November 2015, Malema spoke out against billionaire mining company owner Patrice Motsepe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2015/11/26/effs-malema-takes-aim-at-sellout-black-billionaires-in-oxford-address|title=Business Day|website=www.bdlive.co.za|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229135821/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2015/11/26/effs-malema-takes-aim-at-sellout-black-billionaires-in-oxford-address|archivedate=29 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2016/05/01/Patrice-Motsepe-has-no-power%E2%80%9A-says-Malema|title=Patrice Motsepe has no power‚ says Malema|last=Jordaan|first=Buchule Raba And Nomahlubi|website=Times LIVE|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127215142/http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2016/05/01/Patrice-Motsepe-has-no-power%E2%80%9A-says-Malema|archivedate=27 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further protests in 2015, the EFF delivered demands that included the socialization of the mining sector and called for more explicit targets for the 26% BEE ownership required by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-11-01-yes-and-no-to-effs-list-of-demands|title=Yes and no to EFF’s list of demands|last=John|first=Victoria|newspaper=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128050240/http://mg.co.za/article/2015-11-01-yes-and-no-to-effs-list-of-demands|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malema addressed a crowd in Marikana, Rustenburg in the platinum mining area, blaming mining companies and calling out platinum mining company Lonmin in particular, for poverty in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/bdd0ce804d689dfe9d42df4b5facb1b5/Malema-blames-mining-companies-for-high-levels-of-poverty-20160707|title=SABC News - Malema blames mining companies for high levels of poverty:Thursday 7 July 2016|last=Tatai|first=Sello|website=www.sabc.co.za|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127232029/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/bdd0ce804d689dfe9d42df4b5facb1b5/Malema-blames-mining-companies-for-high-levels-of-poverty-20160707|archivedate=27 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, after [[2016 South African Local Government elections|local elections]] in South Africa, the EFF has suggested that they will back the Democratic Alliance in hung-metro areas, but would not be entering into a coalition with any political party in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-17-malema-says-the-eff-wont-form-coalitions-but-will-support-da-in-hung-metros|title=Malema says the EFF won't form coalitions, but will support DA in hung metros|last=Feltham|first=Luke|newspaper=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128050103/http://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-17-malema-says-the-eff-wont-form-coalitions-but-will-support-da-in-hung-metros|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-profile members==
High-profile members of the Central Command Team include [[Floyd Shivambu]], [[Fana Mokoena]] and [[Mbuyiseni Ndlozi]] (National Spokesperson).&lt;ref name="EFF Central Command"&gt;{{cite web|author=Economic Freedom Fighters|date=|title=Central Command Team|url=http://www.effonline.org/structure|publisher=effonline.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812200344/http://effighters.org.za/structure/officials/|archivedate=12 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial businessman [[Kenny Kunene]] joined the Central Command Team in July 2013 before resigning from the Central Command Team on 20 August 2013 and from the organisation on 26 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Sushi"&gt;{{cite news|title='Sushi King' quits EFF leadership|author=Poloko Tau|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/special-features/sushi-king-quits-eff-leadership-1.1565564#.UhhxMWthiSM|newspaper=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=24 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824143456/http://www.iol.co.za/news/special-features/sushi-king-quits-eff-leadership-1.1565564#.UhhxMWthiSM|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ExitKunene"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kunene quits EFF|author=[[South African Press Association|SAPA]]|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Kunene-quits-EFF-20130826|newspaper=[[News24]]|date=26 August 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829084845/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Kunene-quits-EFF-20130826|archivedate=29 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2013, it was announced that Dali Mpofu had left the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) after 33 years of membership and joined the EFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/dali-mpofu-joins-eff-1.1601553#.UoctTNKmimg|title=Dali Mpofu joins EFF - Cape Times|publisher=IOL.co.za|date=2013-11-04|accessdate=2013-11-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233822/http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/dali-mpofu-joins-eff-1.1601553#.UoctTNKmimg|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support base==
According to a November 2013 [[Ipsos]] survey, the party's supporters are younger than average, with 49% being younger than 24, overwhelmingly black (99%) and mostly male, with women representing only 33% of the support base. A disproportionate number of supporters live in Malema's home province of [[Limpopo]] (28%), while only 1% live in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], a more populous province.&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web|title=The supporter profiles of SA`s three largest parties|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page72308?oid=534039&amp;sn=Marketingweb+detail&amp;pid=90389|publisher=Politicsweb|accessdate=6 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022154/http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page72308?oid=534039&amp;sn=Marketingweb+detail&amp;pid=90389|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was expected to make an impact in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 general election]], taking between 4 per cent and 8 per cent of the national vote. This was potentially enough for the party to hold [[Balance of power (parliament)|the balance of power]] in provinces where the governing African National Congress was in danger of losing its absolute majority.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/economic-freedom-fighters-on-rise-in-south-africa-1.1779028|title=Economic Freedom Fighters on rise in South Africa|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=6 May 2014|publisher=''The Irish Times''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506162746/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/economic-freedom-fighters-on-rise-in-south-africa-1.1779028|archivedate=6 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ANC retained its absolute majority, but the EFF moved into third place, surging past the shrinking [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], with a 6.35% share of the vote to the IFP's 2.40%.

On 6 August 2015 the EFF announced that it has secured a Constitutional court case for its [[Jacob Zuma]] campaign of "#PayBackTheMoney". The case was heard on the 9 February 2016. The Judgement was released by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.

On 27 February 2018 the EFF tabled a motion in The National Assembly to amend the Constitution so as to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The motion, brought by the EFF leader [[Julius Malema]], was adopted with a vote of 241 in support, and 83 against. The only parties who did not support the motion were the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], [[Freedom Front Plus]], [[Cope]] and the [[African Christian Democratic Party|ACDP]]. Land Expropriation is one of the EFF's Seven cardinal pillars.&lt;ref name="LandExpropriation"&gt;{{cite news|title=National Assembly adopts motion on land expropriation without compensation|author=Jan Gerber|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-national-assembly-adopts-motion-on-land-expropriation-without-compensation-20180227 |date=27 February 2018 |accessdate=12 October 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920012156/https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-national-assembly-adopts-motion-on-land-expropriation-without-compensation-20180227|archivedate=2018-09-20|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the student wing of the EFF, the EFF Student Command won many universities across the country. The red berets defeated the ANC-aligned [[South African Students Congress]] (Sasco) at the [[Durban University of Technology]], the [[University of Zululand]] and [[Mangosuthu University of Technology]]. They also won in Cape Town, the District Six, Mowbray and Bellville [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] (CPUT) campuses with landslide victories, meaning they now are in charge of the institution's SRC. They also won the [[University of Cape Town]]. Peter Keetse, president of the EFFSC, said the win was a warning shot for what was going to happen in 2019 national general elections. He said the youth were the influencers of the future, “therefore, this is an indication of what is to follow”.&lt;ref name="EFFStudentCommand"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comrades see red as students back EFF on campus|author=Kwandokuhle Njoli|url=https://www.iol.co.za/sunday-tribune/news/comrades-see-red-as-students-back-eff-on-campus-17275465|date=30 September 2018|accessdate=12 October 2018|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Research Identifier Database''' ('''GRID''') is an openly accessible [[database]] of educational and research organizations worldwide, created and maintained by Digital Science &amp; Research Solutions Ltd., part of the technology company [[Digital Science]].&lt;ref name="gridLaunch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digital-science.com/blog/news/digital-science-launches-grid-a-new-global-open-database-offering-unique-information-on-research-organisations/|title=Digital Science Launches GRID, a New, Global, Open Database Offering Unique Information on Research Organisations|last=Wheeler|first=Laura|date=2015-10-12|website=digital-science.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikiDataGrid"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2427|title=GRID ID|website=''wikidata.org''|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each organization is assigned a unique GRID ID and there is a corresponding [[World Wide Web|web]] address and page for each ID in the database.  The dataset contains the institution's type, [[Geographic coordinate system|geo-coordinates]], [[Website#Types|official website]], and Wikipedia page.  Name variations of institutions are included, as well.&lt;ref name="disambiguate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grid.ac/pages/disambiguate_your_data|title=DISAMBIGUATE – Resolve unstructured text affiliations to GRID ids|website=grid.ac|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public release of GRID occurred on 22 September 2015, and it contained entires for {{formatnum:47648}} institutes.  The 30th public release of GRID was on 27 August 2018, and the database contained {{formatnum:89506}} entries.&lt;ref name="release2018-08-27"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grid.ac/downloads|title=DOWNLOAD – Documentation – All releases|date=2018-08-27|website=grid.ac/downloads|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) specification as [[linked data]], and can therefore be linked to other data.&lt;ref name="LOD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digital-science.com/blog/news/digital-sciences-grid-now-available-linked-open-data/|title=Digital Science's GRID Now Available As Linked Open Data|last=Szomszor|first=Martin|date=2016-08-15|website=digital-science.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Containing {{formatnum:14401}} relationships, GRID models two types of relationships: a parent-child relationship that defines a subordinate association, and a related relationship that describes other associations&lt;ref name="gridStats"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grid.ac/stats|title=GRID Statistics|website=grid.ac/stats|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gridPol"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grid.ac/pages/policies|title=GRID Policies|website=grid.ac|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Digital Science released GRID under a [[Creative_Commons_license#Zero_/_public_domain|Creative Commons (CC)]] CC0 license, without restriction under copyright or database law.&lt;ref name="CC0InfoToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/Digest/Digital-Science-Gives-GRID-a-CC0-License-115138.asp|title=Digital Science Gives GRID a CC0 License|last=Scardilli|first=Brandi|date=2016-12-06|work=Information Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0DigSci"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digital-science.com/press-releases/digital-science-releases-global-research-identifier-database-grid-cc0-license/|title=Digital Science Releases Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) Under CC0 License|last=Wheeler|first=Laura|last2=Hulme|first2=Lisa|date=2016-12-05|website=digital-science.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22954">The '''history of email''' extends over more than 50 years, entailing an evolving set of technologies and standards that culminated in the [[Email|email systems]] we use today.

[[Computer]]-based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of [[time-sharing]] computers in the early 1960s, and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the [[ARPANET]], which aimed at [[software portability]] between its systems. That portability helped make the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) increasingly influential.

For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the [[X.400]] email system, part of the [[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile]] (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=2016-01-01 }}, Susan R. Harris, Ph.D., and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Internet }}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, [[POP3]] and [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] email protocols the standard.

== Precursors ==
Early dedicated machines and networks for sending text messages existed in the form of the [[telegraph]], [[Telex]] and [[AUTODIN]].

Telex became an operational [[teleprinter]] service in 1933, and after 1945 spread around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

However, telex did not enjoy significant and worldwide growth until after 1945. Thanks to the great advantages of the new telex service, above all in overcoming time differences and language problems, telex networks were introduced in quick succession in all parts of the world.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AUTODIN]] network, first operational in 1962, provided a message service between 1,350 terminals, handling 30 million messages per month, with an average message length of approximately 3,000 characters. &lt;ref name="NAS USPS"&gt;USPS Support Panel, Louis T Rader, Chair, Chapter IV: Systems, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA27 Electronic Message Systems for the U.S. Postal Service], National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1976; pages 27–35.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, AUTODIN linked more than 300 sites in several countries.

==Host-based mail systems==
With the introduction of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS) in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;"CTSS, Compatible Time-Sharing System" (September 4, 2006), [[University of South Alabama]], [http://www.cis.usouthal.edu/faculty/daigle/project1/ctss.htm USA-CTSS].&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time multiple users could log into a central system&lt;ref&gt;an [[IBM 7094]]&lt;/ref&gt; from remote terminals, and store and share files on the central disk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Van Vleck]], "The IBM 7094 and CTSS" (September 10, 2004), ''Multicians.org''
 ([[Multics]]), web: [http://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html Multicians-7094].&lt;/ref&gt; Informal methods of using this to pass messages were soon developed and expanded:
* 1965 – [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] "MAIL" command by Pat Crisman, [[Glenda Schroeder]], and [[Louis Pouzin]].&lt;ref name="thvv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html|title=The History of Electronic Mail|author=Tom Van Vleck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each user's messages would be added to a local file called "MAIL BOX", which would have a "private" mode so that only the owner could read or delete messages. The proposed uses of the proto-email system were for communication from CTSS to notify users that files had been backed up, discussion between authors of CTSS commands, and communication from command authors to the CTSS manual editor.

Developers of other early systems developed similar email applications:

==LAN email systems==
In the early 1980s, networked [[personal computer]]s on [[LAN]]s became increasingly important. Server-based systems similar to the earlier mainframe systems were developed. Examples include:
* [[cc:Mail]]
* [[LANtastic]]
* [[WordPerfect Office]]
* [[Microsoft Mail]]
* [[Banyan VINES]]
* [[Lotus Notes]]
Eventually these systems could link different organizations as long as each organization ran the same email system and proprietary protocol.&lt;ref&gt;with various vendors supplying gateway software to link these incompatible systems&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email networks==
To facilitate electronic mail exchange between remote sites and with other organizations, telecommunication links, such as dialup modems or leased lines, provided means to transport email globally, creating local and global networks. This was challenging for a number of reasons, including the widely [[Non-Internet email address|different email address formats]] in use. 
* In 1971 the first [[ARPANET]] email was sent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Network Email|url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html|author=Ray Tomlinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through RFC 561, RFC 680, RFC 724, and finally 1977's RFC 733, became a standardized working system.
* PLATO IV was networked to individual terminals over leased data lines prior to the implementation of personal notes in 1974.&lt;ref name=wooley/&gt;
* Unix mail was networked by 1978's [[uucp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/vol2/uucp.bun |title=Version 7 Unix manual: "UUCP Implementation Description" by D. A. Nowitz, and "A Dial-Up Network of UNIX Systems" by D. A. Nowitz and M. E. Lesk |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used for [[USENET]] newsgroup postings, with similar headers.
* BerkNet, the Berkeley Network, was written by [[Eric Schmidt]] in 1978 and included first in the Second Berkeley Software Distribution. It provided support for sending and receiving messages over serial communication links. The Unix mail tool was extended to send messages using BerkNet.&lt;ref name="berknet"/&gt; 
* The [[delivermail]] tool, written by [[Eric Allman]] in 1979 and 1980 (and shipped in 4BSD), provided support for routing mail over dissimilar networks, including Arpanet, UUCP, and BerkNet. (It also provided support for mail user aliases.)&lt;ref name="joy-4bsd"&gt;Setting up the Fourth Berkeley Software Tape, William N. Joy, Ozalp Babaoglu, Keith Sklower, University of California, Berkeley, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mail client included in 4BSD (1980) was extended to provide interoperability between a variety of mail systems.&lt;ref name="shoens-mail"&gt;Mail(1), UNIX Programmer's Manual, 4BSD, University of California, Berkeley, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BITNET]] (1981) provided electronic mail services for educational institutions. It was based on the IBM VNET email system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_bitnet.htm "BITNET History"], livinginternet.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1983 – [[MCI Mail]] Operated by MCI Communications Corporation.  This was the first commercial public email service to use the internet. MCI Mail also allowed subscribers to send regular postal mail (overnight) to non-subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;"[[MCI Mail]]", MCI Mail&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1984, IBM PCs running DOS could link with [[FidoNet]] for email and shared bulletin board posting.

==Attempts at interoperability==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
Early interoperability among independent systems included:
* [[ARPANET]], a forerunner of the Internet, defined protocols for dissimilar computers to exchange email.
* [[uucp]] implementations for Unix systems, and later for other operating systems, that only had dial-up communications available.
* [[CSNET]], which initially used a purpose-built dial-up protocol, called Phonenet, to provide mail-relay services for non-ARPANET hosts.
* Action Technologies developed the [[Message Handling System]] (MHS) protocol. This was later bought by [[Novell]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vxcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 "Delivering the Enterprise Message], 19 Sep 1994, Daniel Blum, Network World&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/archive/1994/94-03-07hot_.html ''"...offers improved performance, greater reliability and much more flexibility in everything from communications hardware to scheduling..."''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330215111/http://www.networkworld.com/archive/1994/94-03-07hot_.html |date=2014-03-30 }}, 03/07/94, Mark Gibbs,

* [[HP OpenMail]] was known for its ability to interconnect several other APIs and protocols, including MAPI, cc:Mail, SMTP/MIME, and X.400.
* Soft-Switch released its eponymous email gateway product in 1984, acquired by [[Lotus Software]] ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickshelness&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Coloured Book protocols]] ran on [[United Kingdom|UK]] academic networks until 1992.
* [[X.400]] in the 1980s and early 1990s was promoted by major vendors, and mandated for government use under [[GOSIP]], but abandoned by all but a few in favor of [[Internet]] [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] by the mid-1990s.

==From SNDMSG to MSG==
In the early 1970s, [[Ray Tomlinson]] updated an existing utility called [[SNDMSG]] so that it could copy messages (as files) over the network. [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Lawrence Roberts]], the project manager for the ARPANET development, took the idea of READMAIL, which dumped all "recent" messages onto the user's terminal, and wrote a programme for [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] in [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] macros called ''RD'', which permitted access to individual messages.&lt;ref name="livinginternet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/e/ei.htm |title=Email History |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=1996-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Wessler then updated RD and called it ''NRD''.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal|last=Partridge|first=Craig|title=The Technical Development of Internet Email|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=30|issue=2|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|location=Berlin|date=April–June 2008|url=http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1109/mahc.2008.32|pages=3–29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512165437/http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marty Yonke rewrote NRD to include reading, access to SNDMSG for sending, and a help system, and called the utility ''WRD'', which was later known as ''BANANARD''. John Vittal then updated this version to include three important commands: ''Move'' (combined save/delete command), ''Answer'' (determined to whom a reply should be sent) and ''Forward'' (sent an email to a person who was not already a recipient). The system was called ''MSG''. With inclusion of these features, MSG is considered to be the first integrated modern email programme, from which many other applications have descended.&lt;ref name="livinginternet1"/&gt;

==ARPANET mail==
Experimental email transfers between separate computer systems began shortly after the creation of the [[ARPANET]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="thvv" /&gt; [[Ray Tomlinson]] is generally credited as having sent the first email across a network, initiating the use of the "[[At sign|@]]" sign to separate the names of the user and the user's machine in 1971, when he sent a message from one [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[DEC-10]] computer to another DEC-10. The two machines were placed next to each other.&lt;ref name="firstnetworkemail"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wave New World,Time Magazine, October 19, 2009, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Tomlinson's work was quickly adopted across the ARPANET, which significantly increased the popularity of email. Tomlinson is internationally known as the inventor of modern email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469428062/ray-tomlinson-inventor-of-modern-email-has-died|title=Ray Tomlinson, Inventor Of Modern Email, Dies|date=6 March 2016|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially addresses were of the form, ''username@hostname''&lt;ref&gt;RFC 805, 8 February 1982, Computer Mail Meeting Notes&lt;/ref&gt; but were extended to "username@host.domain" with the development of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).

As the influence of the ARPANET spread across academic communities, [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] were developed to pass mail to and from other networks such as [[CSNET]], [[JANET NRS|JANET]], [[BITNET]], [[X.400]], and [[FidoNet]]. This often involved addresses such as:
:hubhost!middlehost!edgehost!user@uucpgateway.somedomain.example.com
which routes mail to a user with a "[[bang path]]" address at a UUCP host.

[[File:Musée_de_Croix,_ancien_Hôtel_de_Groesbeeck_de_Croix.jpg|thumb|Its facade]]
The '''Hôtel de Groesbeeck - de Croix''' is a [[hotel particulier]] in [[Namur]], Belgium. First built in the 13th century, it was resdesigned by the architect [[Jean-Baptiste Chermanne]] in the mid 18th century. The town council bought it in 1935 and it now houses the town's collection of 19th, 20th and 21st century decorative arts. It has been closed for restoration since February 2013 and is due to reopen at the end of 2018 or early in 2019.

{{lowercase|title=iSync}}'''iSync''' is a [[software application]] first released by [[Apple Inc.]] on Jan 2, 2003. Apple licensed the core technology from [[fusionOne]]. It ran only under [[macOS|Mac OS X]] and was used to synchronize contact and calendar data from [[Address Book (application)|Address Book]] and [[iCal]] with many non-Apple [[SyncML]]-enabled [[mobile phone]]s via a [[Bluetooth]] or [[USB]] connection. Support for many (pre-October 2007) devices was built-in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2824|title=iSync: Supported mobile phones in Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108063357/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2824|archivedate=November 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with newer devices being supported via manufacturer and third-party iSync Plugins. Support for Palm OS organizers and compatible smartphones was removed with the release of iSync 3.1 and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. [[BlackBerry OS]], [[Palm OS]], and [[Windows Mobile]] ([[Pocket PC]]) devices could not be used with iSync, but were supported by third-party applications. Before the release of [[Mac OS X 10.4]], iSync also synchronized a user's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] bookmarks with the then [[.Mac]] subscription service provided by Apple.

Starting with Mac OS X 10.4, much of iSync's original syncing functionality had been moved into the Sync Services framework, which developers can use to incorporate synchronization into their own applications. iSync, however, retained responsibility for the setup, configuration and synchronising of supported mobile handsets. Since the release of iTunes 4.8, the user interface for synchronizing iPods had been delegated to [[iTunes]], although [[Revision control#Common vocabulary|conflict-resolution]] and substantial changes to contact information (&gt;5%) shows use of iSync. Synchronization with [[MobileMe]] (previously .Mac) was then the domain of MobileMe Sync, accessible through a [[System Preferences]] pane.

iSync was removed from Mac OS X in version [[Mac OS X Lion|10.7 (Lion)]].&lt;ref name=TUAW&gt;http://www.tuaw.com/2011/05/26/no-more-isync-in-lion/&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the underlying framework still existed in Lion and [[OS X Mountain Lion|10.8 (Mountain Lion)]], it was possible to restore the functionality of iSync using a [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|10.6 (Snow Leopard)]] installation or backup.&lt;ref name=slashusr&gt;http://slashusr.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/the-missing-isync-in-os-x-lion-and-what-to-do-about-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

The volumes relating to the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon Popes]] (1305—1387) as well as the following [[antipope]]s were moved from [[Comtat Venaissin]] to the Secret Archives in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Ricci, Corrado. 2003. ''Vatican: Its History Its Treasures (1914)''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7661-3941-7}}. p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records include both the books in which an array of Curial officials recorded receipts and expenditures, and general annual accounts of items.&lt;ref name="haskins"&gt;Haskins, Charles H. 1896. "The Vatican Archies." ''The American Historical Review''. '''2''', 1: 40-58.&lt;/ref&gt; They were recorded in journal form until 1378,&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; denoting the expenditures of each subset of the [[papal household]], military expenses, construction costs, and art commissioning.&lt;ref name="a122"/&gt; However, ''Introitus et Exitus'' is fundamentally an incomplete record of the financial dealings of the Holy See, as the Apostolic Camera itself represents only the surplusses of various regional transactions, and popes conducted significant financial dealings off balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, these records often exclude direct cash payments made by popes themselves or mediated through the Curia's [[Bank of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="a136"/&gt;

Because of the thoroughness of the records down to the minutest details, they have been used by historians to establish the daily living conditions in the papal household&lt;ref name="haskins"/&gt; and the administration of the [[Papal States]].&lt;ref&gt;British Records Association. ''Archives''. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The records have been utilized by [[art history|art historians]], notably [[Eugène Müntz]],&lt;ref name="haskins"/&gt; to determine the number of artists who contributed to certain works, authenticate works of unknown origin, and to discover previously unknown works.&lt;ref name="a136"&gt;Ambrosini, 1996, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been scoured by [[economic history|economic historians]] to study past [[Europe]]an [[exchange rate]]s and [[interest rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla, Carlo M. 1992. ''Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-30816-2}}. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden appearance of debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, [[Domenico della Rovere]], Sanseverino, and Orsini after a gap in the records in August 1492 has been used to allege that [[simony]] occurred in the [[papal conclave, 1492]].&lt;ref&gt;Setton, 1984, p. 433-434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other records of the Apostolic Camera include ''[[Liber Censuum]]'' (492—1192),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Apostolic Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Obligationes et Solutiones]]'', ''[[Obligationes communes]]'', ''[[Collectoriae]]'', and ''[[Diversae Cameralia]]''; the artificially created ''[[Registra Vaticana]]'' includes documents of the Camera mixed with those of the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs]], and other secretariats; the ''[[Registra Avenionensia]]'' catalogs materials relating jointly to the Chancery and the Camera.&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 1605.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juanqinzhai''' (Chinese: '''倦勤斋'''), or the "Studio of Exhaustion From Diligent Service," is a hall in the [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]] built by the aging [[Qianlong Emperor]] as part of his retirement suite. After announcing his desire to retire from the throne, the emperor began building a retirement suite, the Palace of Tranquil Longevity, in the northeast corner of the [[Forbidden City]]'''.''' This complex, also called the Qianlong Garden, was built with the highest quality and designed with the most exceptional Chinese techniques. Juanqinzhai was an imperial lodge in the north end of the garden, and contains rare examples of murals painted on silk and bamboo craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/juanqinzhai-qianlong-garden|title=Juanqinzhai in the Qianlong Garden {{!}} World Monuments Fund|website=www.wmf.org|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) began a partnership with the Palace Museum to restore the Qianlong Garden. The first of the 27 pavilions to be restored was the Juanqinzhai, which was completed in 2008. Because of the huge success of this restoration, the partnership has been extended so that each of the other 26 buildings in the garden can be fully restored.

==History==
[[File:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|The aging Qianlong Emperor.]]Juanqinzhai was built as part of the Palace of Tranquil Longevity in the Forbidden City. Emperor Qianlong ruled from the Forbidden City in Beijing, where he presided over the zenith of the Qing Dynasty. Art and architecture flourished during his reign and China reached a new peak of wealth and culture. The Qianlong Emperor's passion for painting, sculpture and embroidery extended to his palaces. Even late in his reign, when the Qianlong Garden was being built, the emperor's passion for art was displayed in the beautiful decoration of the pavilions and halls there. Qianlong's grandfather Kangxi's long and impressive reign so intimidated the Qianlong Emperor that he refused to out-reign his grandfather. In 1772, in anticipation of his planned retirement, Qianlong ordered the construction of a small retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/article/pdfs/pg_31-33_qianlong_private_world.pdf|title=Qianlong's Private World|last=Tzu Ng|first=Henry|date=Winter 2003–2004|website=World Monuments Fund|publisher=World Monuments Fund|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These small buildings were much different from the monumental buildings in the Outer Court and were much more intimate. However, these buildings remained as dignified and noble as the governmental buildings, as they would be still be the home and office of the Retired Qianlong Emperor.

After the completion of the imperial residence, the emperor prepared to move into his new home. Qianlong abdicated in 1796, leaving the throne to his son, who would reign as the Jiaqing Emperor. However, between 1796 and 1799, Qianlong continued to effectively rule China behind the scenes, and his son was emperor in name only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jiaqing|title=Jiaqing {{!}} emperor of Qing dynasty|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the creation of the beautiful gardens and buildings of the Palace of Tranquil Longevity, Qianlong never moved into his new suite, and remained in the traditional residence of the emperors. After the emperors death, an edict was produced ordering that no one could rebuild or change the designs of the garden, preserving it untouched. This edict is one of the main reasons that the original eighteenth century interiors remained in the Juanqinzhai and other buildings of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/article/pdfs/pg_12-17_qianlong_layout.pdf|title=Restoring an Intimate Splendor|last=Powell|first=Eric|date=Spring 2006|website=World Monuments Fund|publisher=World Monuments Fund|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the last emperor was removed from the Forbidden City in 1924, the doors of the Qianlong Garden and many other halls of the Forbidden City were locked and forgotten.

===Restoration===
In 2001, after years of neglect, the World Monuments Fund began a partnership with the Palace Museum in Beijing to restore the Qianlong Garden. The project, which cost 18 million, is slated to be finished in 2019, in time for the 600th anniversary of the construction of the Forbidden City (2020). Juanqinzhai's murals, which are the only large ensemble of eighteenth illusionist painting in China, were removed from their backing, and painstakingly cleaned. After much searching, the conservators found a source of paper for the new backing. This paper was made using traditional materials rather than modern techniques, which is revolutionary for a Chinese restoration. In China, "historic preservation usually entails razing a structure and replacing it with a brightly painted replica."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Suzhou, the same city where Qianlong himself ordered silks, dozens or workers labored extensively to produce the beautiful screens that decorate the reception room and the theater room. Each of the embroideries were carefully sewn by hand, even the unique double-sided transparent screens in the audience hall. Like the paper, a trial and error process was used to produce the brocade on the various thrones and tables. It took many tries to replicate the Qing dynasty "cloud brocade" which was used extensively in Juanqinzhai. Finally, a carver of inner skin bamboo was found to carve the deer in relief in the audience hall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The restoration of Juanqinzhai was lauded throughout China and the West as a milestone in the history of restoration, especially in the Forbidden City. The Chinese team even raised another $5 million to help with the restoration of the other 26 buildings of the Qianlong Garden.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/arts/design/01forb.html|title=Chinese and Westerners Collaborate on Restoration Inside the Forbidden City|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|date=2008-12-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
Though he never stayed in Juanqinzhai, Qianlong still planned the Palace of Tranquil Longevity as his personal retreat, filled with his favorite designs and motifs. From the eastern entrance, the emperor entered a large, two storied audience room, paneled with bamboo and silk screens. On the lower half of the screen is a carving of deer playing amongst pines and rocks, while the top half of each partition is decorated with an intricate, semi-transparent silk screen. In the center of lower level sits a formal throne, embroidered in imperial yellow and flanked by traditional Chinese couplets. Behind the partitions are an enfilade of rooms, filled with calligraphy, artworks, and mirrors. On both floors, the emperor had a set of private rooms and thrones, each filled with natural light, due to the semi-transparent silk screens, which also appear on both levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Met|title=The Emperor's Private Paradise: Virtual tour of Juanqinzhai|date=2011-03-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlkPuwak2dE|accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western half of Juanqinzhai is the "Theater Room." In this section, a small pavilion equipped with a stage is surrounded by a bamboo fence and is faced by another two-floored viewing platform, from which the emperor could watch opera or plays. The pavilion and fence bring to mind the outdoors, and the warm colors of the bamboo and the light from the windows bring the feeling of summer into this room. Though the room has a warm and informal feel, the ideals of the Forbidden City are still present in the room. Like the columns in the main halls in the Outer Court, the faux bamboo is made of a rare nanmu tree, painted to look like bamboo. Despite this expensive touch, the piece-de-resistance of the room are the floor to ceiling [[trompe-l'œil]] murals hung here. On the wall the bamboo fence is replicated in paint, and behind it stands a large pavilion with trees and birds. Mimicking the real bamboo fence, the mural also contains a circular "moon gate," where a crane stands watch. On the ceiling is a bamboo lattice motif, interlaced with vibrant grapevines. Here, the emperor could entertain his passion for art, gardening, and opera throughout the year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=NIBB AUHH|title=The Emperor's Secret Garden (2010) 乾隆花园修缮记|date=2012-12-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fxJ0xEoY8I|accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maillardet's automaton at the Franklin Institute.webm|thumb|Maillardet's automaton is drawing a picture]]

'''Maillardet's automaton''' (or '''Draughtsman-Writer''', sometime also known as '''Maelzel's Juvenile Artist''' or '''Juvenile Artist''') is an [[automaton]] built in [[London]] circa 1800 by a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] mechanician, [[Henri Maillardet]]. It is currently part of the collections at [[Franklin Institute|The Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]].

==Acquisition==
In November 1928 the Franklin Institute received the pieces of a brass machine. It came from the descendants of John Penn Brock, a family who knew that at some time it had been able to write and draw pictures. Having been in a fire, its restoration involved a considerable amount of work. The Brock family believed that the machine had been made in France by an inventor named Maelzel. 
The original writing instrument, either a quill or a brush, was replaced with a stylographic fountain pen. Once repaired the automaton began to produce elaborate sketches and poems. In the border surrounding the final poem, the automaton wrote, ''"Ecrit par L'Automate de Maillardet"'', translating to ''"Written by the automaton of Maillardet"''.&lt;ref name=fi&gt;{{cite web|title=Maillardet's Automaton|url=https://www.fi.edu/history-resources/automaton|publisher=The Franklin Institute|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restorer and paper engineer [[Andrew Baron (paper engineer)|Andrew Baron]] spent about 70 hours in 2007 repairing the Maillardet automaton to bring it back to working order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benjamin Franklin Fiesta|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-mexico/santa-fe/santa-fe-new-mexican/2014/01-17|work=Santa Fe New Mexican, NewspaperArchive.com|date=17 January 2014|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maillardet's Automaton: The Franklin Institute Science Museum|url=https://www.fi.edu/history-resources/automaton|website=www.fi.edu|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franklin Institute's Maillardet Automaton Demo 11/04/07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwkkDfs-RKg|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel exhibitions==
During the early nineteenth century, Maillardet exhibited this automaton and other automata that he created throughout England, and to other countries in Europe as far as [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref name="fi"/&gt; The following is a partial list of known exhibitions of the Maillardet's automaton. The automaton was mostly known as the ''Juvenile Artist'' in those exhibitions:

[[File:The Automaton Exhibition 1826 at Gothic Hall in Haymarket London.jpg|thumb|The Automaton Exhibition at Gothic Hall in 1826. The Juvenile Artist was at the right.]]

* '''1821 – 1833''': The automata of Maillardet were in the possession of a gentlemen named Mr Schmidt. He held an exhibition in London. The last public display in London was held in 1833 at New Gothic Hall, 7 [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket Street]] before the exhibition was on tour to St. Petersburg&lt;ref name="unmasking"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houdini|first=Harry|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houndin|year=1908|publisher=Publishers Printing Company|location=New York|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it disappeared along with other automata in the collection.&lt;ref name=byte&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Dr. James M|title=Antique Mechanical Computers Part 2: 18th and 19th Century Mechanical Marvels|journal=Byte - The Small Systems Journal|date=August 1978|volume=3|issue=8|pages=104–106|url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1835''': An exhibition in [[Boston]] under the showman [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel]] included the Juvenile Artist automaton&lt;ref name="masshist"/&gt;
* '''1835''': The Juvenile Artist automaton was also traveled to Philadelphia in an exhibition at American Museum located then at the corner of Fifth and Chesnut Streets. The announcement for the event mentioned the success of Maelzel's exhibition in Boston. It also attributed the automata including the Juvenile Artist in the exhibition as "Maillardet's unrivalled mechanical and musical automata". The announcement was recorded as having Henri Maillardet, Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, and American Museum (Philadelphia, Pa.) as authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Untitled announcement|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/american-museum-corner-of-fifth-and-chesnut-streets-the-proprietor-has-the-pleasure-of-announcing-the-engagement-for-a-short-time-with-the-proprietors-of-the-exhibition-of-maillardets-unrivalled-mechanical-and-musical-automata-recently-exhibited-in-boston-with-signal-success-by-mr-maelzel-the-day-exhibitions-take-place-at-10-and-12-oclock-am-and-2-and-4-oclock-pm-admittance-25-cents-children-half-price-the-automaton-juvenile-artist-the-musical-lady-the-automaton-tight-rope-dancer-the-automaton-magician-the-walking-figure-a-beautiful-mechanical-humming-bird-a-magnificent-classic-vase-the-evening-exhibition-of-the-above-will-commence-at-half-past-7-in-addition-to-the-splendid-panoramic-spectacle-of-the-destruction-of-the-cities-of-the-plain-or-the-last-day-of-sodom-and-gomorrah-the-panorama-commences-at-9-oclock-precisely-every-evening-admittance-to-the-whole-50-cents-back-seats-25-cents-children-under-10-years-of-age-when-accompanied-by-their-parents-or-guardians-half-price-the-museum-opens-at-9-oclock-am-daily-sundays-excepted/oclc/85222158?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|accessdate=2 October 2013|author=Henri Maillardet|author2=Johann Nepomuk Mälzel|author3=American Museum (Philadelphia, Pa.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==

===Amazing Machine===
The Maillardet's automaton is a highlight of the ''Amazing Machine'' permanent exhibit at The Franklin Institute. The exhibition includes more than two dozen rarely displayed machines with [[Exploded-view drawing|exploded views]] of the machines to show their components such as [[gear]]s, [[cam]]s, [[pulley]]s and [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazing Machine|url=https://www.fi.edu/exhibit/amazing-machine|publisher=The Franklin Institute|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maillardet's automaton is always on display but the staff operate it only a few times a year for public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geekend Picks: Automaton Demonstration, Dorian’s Parlor, They Live with Rowdy Roddy Piper!|url=http://www.geekadelphia.com/2013/07/18/geekend-picks-automaton-demonstration-dorians-parlor-they-live-with-rowdy-roddy-piper/|publisher=Geekadelphia|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations show all seven drawings of the automaton as seen in the followings:

===Computer history===
The pictures of Maillardet's automaton are among other artifacts in the collections of [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]]. The museum has a collection of machines in pre-computer era. Particularly for Maillardet's, the museum highlights the use of its [[cam]]s in similar function to [[read-only memory]] (ROM) of computer to store pre-defined data for retrieval at a later time. In Maillardet's automaton case, it stores motion data necessary to write a poem on paper.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Graceful Moves, for a Boy Made of Metal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/science/maillardet-automaton-inspired-martin-scorseses-film-hugo.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maillardet's Automaton - Memory (Catalog Number 102697995)|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102697995|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be the largest cam-based memory of any automaton of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gayle|first=Damien|title=The incredible 200-year-old automaton: The jewel-studded clockwork caterpillar built to show off 19th Century high technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2253631/The-incredible-200-year-old-automaton-The-jewel-studded-clockwork-caterpillar-built-19th-Century-high-technology.html|accessdate=29 September 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information capacity of the automaton to hold 7 images within the machine was calculated to be 299,040 points, almost 300 [[kilobit]]s of storage.&lt;ref name=byte/&gt;

[[File:Automaton drawing of Cupid, 29 April 1835.jpg|thumb|Automaton drawing of Cupid on April 29, 1835 by ''Maelzel's Juvenile Artist'']]

===Maelzel's Juvenile Artist===
The [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] holds a drawing created in 1835 by an automaton in the collections of papers and artwork of the [[Henry Minot|Minot family]]. The drawing is untitled with a depiction of [[Cupid]]. The writing on the picture indicated that it was drawn by Maelzel's automaton which was known at the time as the ''Maelzel's Juvenile Artist''. It is believed that at least one member of the Minot family witnessed the drawing by the Juvenile Artist at the exhibition of [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel]]'s automata in [[Boston]] on April 29, 1835. The Massachusetts Historical Society theorizes that the Juvenile Artist may in fact be the Maillardet's automaton. An explanation is that Maelzel might have acquired the automaton in the 1830s. As in other automata in his collection, they were known at the time as Maelzel's. After Maelzel's death, the automaton could have been auctioned off in Philadelphia to pay his debts. The new owner then attributed it to Maelzel.&lt;ref name="masshist"&gt;{{cite news|last=Linker|first=Jessica|title=Souvenir of a "Splendid Exhibition": Cupid as Drawn by Maelzel's Automaton, the Juvenile Artist|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2012january.php|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=Massachusetts Historical Society - Online: Object of the Month|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Cirencester offices are spread over three floors and include a staff gym, lounge and a games room that contains a [[foosball]] table that was formerly owned by Hollywood actor [[Robert Downey, Jr]].&lt;ref name=SouthWestBusiness/&gt; In May 2015, the company was ranked seventh among all small UK companies on the Best Workplaces list.&lt;ref name=PlacesToWork&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Work Places 2015|url=http://www.greatplacetowork.co.uk/storage/Publications/greatworkplaces2015rev.pdf|publisher=Great Places To Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a £3 million renovation of ‘The Castle’ by Bath-based workplace design and build firm Interaction&lt;ref&gt;https://www.interaction.uk.com/case-studies/moneycouk-/&lt;/ref&gt;, the company received huge press coverage, with Chris Morling unofficially titled ‘Britain’s best boss’.&lt;ref name="ThisIsMoney.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-4317776/Is-internet-guru-Britain-s-best-boss.html |title='I've never shouted at my staff - no matter how irritating I find them': Is this internet guru Britain's best boss? |author=Ruth Sunderland |publisher=ThisIsMoney.co.uk |date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4128444/Tech-entrepreneur-spends-3m-renovate-castle-HQ.html |title=Britain's best place to work?

== History ==

The word "[[Naga people|Naga]]" denotes several ethnic tribes living on the Himalayan Range in [[Northeast India]], which were brought under the control of [[British India]] during the 19th century. After India's independence, some Naga leaders tried to assert independence. In 1975, the separatist [[Naga National Council]] (NNC) gave up violence and signed the [[Shillong Accord of 1975|Shillong Accord]] with the Government of India. Some of the NNC leaders disapproved of this peace treaty: these leaders included [[Isak Chishi Swu]] of Sumi (Sema) tribe, [[Thuingaleng Muivah]] of Tangkhul tribe and [[S. S. Khaplang]]. These leaders formed the NSCN as a new separatist organization, which has been described as a [[Maoist]] breakaway group of the Naga National Council.&lt;ref name="DegenhardtDay1983"&gt;{{citation |last1=Degenhardt |first1=Henry W. |last2=Day |first2=Alan John |title=Political dissent: an international guide to dissident, extra-parliamentary, guerrilla, and illegal political movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlSGAAAAMAAJ |year=1983 |publisher=Gale Research Company |isbn=978-0-582-90255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSCN started an underground Naga Federal government having both civil and military wings. Later, a disagreement surfaced within the outfit leaders over the issue of commencing dialogue with the Indian Government. On 30 April 1988, the NSCN split into two factions; the NSCN-K led by Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah. The split was accompanied by a spate of violence and clashes between the factions.

On 6 April 2015 a new faction NSCN (Reformation) was formed. Y. Wangtin Konyak and P. Tikhak officially announced the formation of a new Naga political group going by the name 'National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Reformation)' or NSCN (R). The decision came after Wangtin Konyak, a senior minister (Kilonser) and personal secretary to Khaplang and Tikhak, the spokesperson of the outfit were expelled by Khaplang after misunderstanding arose over the recent abrogation of ceasefire with the Government of India.

The duo, wanted to continue with the ceasefire maintaining that "violence has never served a good purpose and the Naga political problem can only be resolved through peace and negotiation" while Khaplang had it abrogated because the "14 years of ceasefire between NSCN (K) and India has become a mockery and futile exercise." The primary agenda of the new NSCN-R would be to "develop a sense of brotherhood among the Naga family and to rebuild the trust and faith among the Naga society.

On 3 August 2015 NSCN leader T Muivah signed a peace accord with the Government of India in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and NSA Ajit Doval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-signs-landmark-nagaland-peace-treaty-with-nscni-m-in-presence-of-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/48332059.cms| location=India | work=The Economic Times | title=Government signs landmark Nagaland peace treaty with NSCN(I-M) in presence of PM Narendra Modi | date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NSCN also joined with a militia organization named the [[United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia]], along with other Northeast Indian terrorist groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/UNLFW-The-new-name-for-terror-in-NE/articleshow/47547899.cms|title=UNLFW: The new name for terror in NE - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/nine-miltant-groups-of-ne-form-united-front-with-chinese-blessings/story-6SuTFuFRymf27fSueYyoaP.html|title=Nine miltant [sic] groups of NE form united front with Chinese blessings|date=24 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after broke off peace talks with the Indian government. It also was responsible for the [[2015 Manipur ambush]], in which 18 soldiers of the Indian army were killed and 15 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/myanmar-operation-70-commandos-finish-task-in-40-minutes/article7302348.ece|title=Myanmar operation: 70 commandos finish task in 40 minutes|date=2015-06-10|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-03-11|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The objective of the NSCN was to establish a Sovereign, Naga State by unifying all the Naga-inhabited areas in the North East of India and Northern Burma which the organisation and the people of the area proposed as [[Nagalim]]. Unification of all Naga tribes under one administration and 'liberating' Nagalim from India is listed as one of the supposed main objectives of the organisation. Its manifesto is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development.

Journalist [[Bertil Lintner]] has described NSCN's ideology as "a mixture of [[evangelical Christianity]] and revolutionary socialism".&lt;ref name="ASAShimray_2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. S.

==Area of operation==
NSCN is active in North East India. The state of Nagaland and the hill districts in Manipur inhabited by the Nagas are the main areas where strong influence and presence of the organisation is felt. Its presence in neighbouring states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are also widely acknowledged. On the international level, the presence and influence of the NSCN in the Northern part of Myanmar that are inhabited by the Naga tribes dates back to the time when the Nagas started their freedom struggle.

==Leadership and structure==
Late [[Isak Chishi Swu]] and [[Thuingaleng Muivah]], the founding fathers of NSCN-IM, was Chairman and General Secretary of NSCN-IM respectively and [[S. S. Khaplang]] is the Chairman of the NSCN-K.

On the political front, the NSCN-IM has divided its area of influence into 11 regions based on sub-tribe considerations and administrative convenience. In many areas, it runs a parallel government. There are four major ‘Ministries’ – Defence, Home, Finance and Foreign Affairs. Moreover, there are five other Ministries including Education, Information and Publicity, Forests and Minerals, Law and Justice and Religious Affairs. The most prominent among the Ministries is the ‘Home ministry’, which is considered as a replacement of the Indian State government machinery. The heads of 11 administrative regions report to the ‘Home Minister’ (Kilo Kilonser). The devolution of administrative arms of the organisation goes down to the town and village levels in the NSCN-IM’s areas of influence.

The outfit has also established a government-in-exile called the Government of the People’s Republic of Nagaland/Nagalim (GPRN) which, interacts with formal and non-formal world bodies and media. The GPRN sends emissaries abroad to garner support and raise funds for the Naga cause.

==Linkages==
Over the years, the NSCN-IM has tried to develop extensive linkages both within and outside India. It is alleged that Pakistan and China are providing finance as well as arms and ammunition to NSCN in their fight for independence against the Indian Government. The group was previously backed by India’s intelligence agencies to weaken the main Naga insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India’s north-east: The spoils of peace|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21660574-countrys-longest-running-ethnic-insurgency-over-spoils-peace|accessdate=8 August 2015|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that NSCN patronised smaller extremists outfits in the North East of India by giving warfare and intelligence trainings and providing logistics for waging war against India.NSCN had also extreme links with its extremist partner ZRF and ZRO.

The outfit has also opened up contacts with international organizations like the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in Geneva, [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO) at the Hague and the UN [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] (UNWGIP).

China is also instrumental in providing training and arms, which was established after the arrest of the top NSCN IM leader Anthony Shimray. After his arrest by the Indian intelligence agencies he also revealed that he was tasked by Chinese intelligence agencies to collect and gather intelligence on Indian troop deployments in north eastern states of India. Further it is also alleged that NSCN is the major faction that helps many other minor militant outfits in north east and is widely accepted as the main reason of continued insurgency in north eastern states of Indian republic.

==History==
{{wikisource|1997 NewsBank President Daniel S. Jones statement before United States Congress}}
[[File:1997 NewsBank President Daniel S. Jones statement before United States Congress.pdf|thumb|left|[[s:1997 NewsBank President Daniel S. Jones statement before United States Congress|1997 NewsBank President Daniel S. Jones statement before United States Congress]].]]

Author of the book ''Megatrends'', [[John Naisbitt]], founded NewsBank.&lt;ref name="andrews17"&gt;Andrews 1998, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was launched in 1972.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=October 3, 2015|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4533536|work=BloombergBusiness|title=Company Overview of NewsBank, Inc.|date=October 3, 2015|archivedate=October 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003103548/http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4533536}}&lt;/ref&gt; NewsBank was then bought from Naisbitt by Daniel S. Jones, who subsequently became its president.&lt;ref name="andrews17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; Naisbitt left NewsBank in 1973.&lt;ref name="mcclellan87"&gt;McClellan 1987, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 NewsBank had one-hundred employees in-house.&lt;ref name="andrews17" /&gt; Another one-hundred employees worked from home and would travel to the company's headquarters, bring back newspapers to their residence from there, and then come back to the company with indexed information on these publications.&lt;ref name="andrews17" /&gt; The company's headquarters in 1986 was in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="andrews18"&gt;Andrews 1998, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Andrews was brought on in 1986 as Product Manager for CD-ROM.&lt;ref name="andrews17" /&gt; His job was to help the company transition from a paper format of delivery to libraries, to instead provide its indexes and full-text articles on [[CD-ROM]] format.&lt;ref name="andrews19"&gt;Andrews 1998, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The subscription price for this service initially was [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 per library.&lt;ref name="andrews19" /&gt; Visitors to libraries with the new CD-ROM services found that their research time searching through the CD-ROM index instead of paper indexes was cut down from 30 minutes to five minutes.&lt;ref name="andrews19" /&gt; NewsBank used an arbitrary selection process for determining which news articles the company considered worthy for archiving; it based this on those that were not simply stories of regional interest and that were more widely appealing to a larger potential audience of future researchers.&lt;ref name="mcclellan87" /&gt;

In 1992 NewsBank had difficulty providing its users with a method to search for information based upon a specific geographic position. Newspaper results were listed by subject matter first and then subsequently by location. At the time it indexed articles via [[microfiche]] from more than 400 media publications in the United States.&lt;ref name="byronanderson"&gt;Anderson 1992, pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced in 1993 that it would provide a CD-ROM product indexing full-text of newspapers from 35 publications including ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''.&lt;ref name="fulltextnewspaper"&gt;{{cite news|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|title=Full-text newspaper collections|work=Information Today|date=May 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 NewsBank was the only company to provide access to an index to periodical literature in the subject of [[theater]].&lt;ref name="sheehy" /&gt; The only method accessible at the time to researchers in the field was ''NewsBank's Review of the Arts: Performing Arts''.&lt;ref name="sheehy"&gt;Sheehy 1994, pp. 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; NewsBank provided access to this service via [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref name="sheehy" /&gt; NewsBank started compiling the full-text of articles related to the local economy of geographic areas and providing this information via CD-ROM to its clients in 1994.&lt;ref name="searchingbusiness"&gt;{{cite news|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|title=Searching business news on CD-ROM: Business NewsBank Plus vs. Business Dateline|date=January 1, 1994|work=The Information Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[privately held company]] was cited by ''The Information Advisor'' as bringing in annual revenue of approximately $19 million, and employing a staff of 350 people.&lt;ref name="searchingbusiness" /&gt; By 1998, NewsBank provided indexes via CD-ROM to newspaper articles from over 450 cities in the United States.&lt;ref name="researchpapers"&gt;{{cite news|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|title=Research papers can be breeze|date=September 18, 1998|work=[[Post-Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, NewsBank merged with [[Readex]].&lt;ref name="fritze" /&gt; With the closure of the merger, NewsBank had acquired one of the earliest organizations to archive [[microform]] in America.&lt;ref name="fritze" /&gt; In 2001 NewsBank compiled the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS) Index and made it available via CD-ROM.&lt;ref name="usinggovernment"&gt;Sears 2001, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; NewsBank joined forces with Micromedia, Ltd., a division of IHS Canada, to help distribute its products in 2001.&lt;ref name="micromedia"&gt;{{cite news|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|title=Micromedia, Ltd. Partners with NewsBank, Books24x7.Com|date=March 1, 2001|work=Information Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 NewsBank maintained archival access to hundreds of media references from the period of 1996 to current day.&lt;ref name="scholarsguide"&gt;Martirosyan 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 NewsBank was structured in a pay-for-use format, with access differentiated for different types of users including [[public library|public libraries]], [[State school|public schools]], as well as [[higher education]] settings.&lt;ref name="localandregional"&gt;Martin 2005, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

NewsBank reached an agreement in 2011 with ''[[The Daily Northwestern]]'' newspaper of [[Northwestern University]] to archive all of its historical publications.&lt;ref name="leopold"&gt;{{cite news|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|title=130 years of Daily Northwestern|date=June 14, 2011|work=State News Service|first=Wendy|last=Leopold}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task would archive more than 90,000 pages of total material from the school.&lt;ref name="leopold" /&gt; It included a plan to archive not just ''The Daily Northwestern'' but also prior related publications from a time period of 1871 to 2000, and index this material so it could be keyword searchable on the Internet.&lt;ref name="leopold" /&gt; Dan Jones, President and CEO of NewsBank, had a prior relationship with the university at the time, serving as University trustee and president-elect of the Northwestern Alumni Association.&lt;ref name="leopold" /&gt;

In 2013 NewsBank provided users with its service Access World News—which ''Reference Skills for the School Librarian'' called the "world's largest full-text news database".&lt;ref name="riedling" /&gt; According to the book ''Communication and Language Analysis in the Public Sphere'', in 2014 NewsBank contained "over 990 news sources, with each state in the U.S. represented, as well as national publications, television and radio programs."&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;Hart 2014, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The 2004 book ''Reference Sources in History'' by Ronald H. Fritze, Brian E. Coutts, and Louis Andrew Vyhnanek wrote that: "NewsBank is one of the world's largest information providers."&lt;ref name="fritze"&gt;Fritze 2004, pp. 107–108; 291.&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Journalism: A Guide to the Reference Literature'' (2004), Jo A. Cates said: "NewsBank is a massive database, the NewsFile Collection alone providing access to full text articles in more than 500 newspapers, wire services, and broadcasts."&lt;ref name="cates"&gt;Cates 2004, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 book ''Reference Skills for the School Librarian'' by authors Ann Marlow Riedling, Loretta Shake, and Cynthia Houston called NewsBank a "popular indexing series".&lt;ref name="riedling"&gt;Riedling 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; They pointed out that NewsBank provided access to "an easy-to-search database of articles, activities, and lesson plans for the elementary and middle grades, covering key issues and events in every subject area."&lt;ref name="riedling" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4387">The "'''Nine Herbs Charm'''" is an [[Anglo-Saxon literature|Old English charm]] recorded in the 10th-century AD&lt;ref name=GORDON92-93&gt;Gordon (1962:92–93).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lacnunga]]'' manuscript.&lt;ref name=MACLEODMEES127&gt;Macleod (2006:127).&lt;/ref&gt; The charm is intended for the treatment of poisoning and infection by a preparation of nine herbs. The numbers nine and three, [[Numbers in Norse mythology|significant in Germanic paganism]] and later [[Germanic folklore]], are mentioned frequently within the charm.&lt;ref name=MACLEODMEES127/&gt; The poem contains references to [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|English Pagan]] elements, including a mention of the major [[Germanic paganism|Germanic god]] [[Woden]].

According to [[R. K. Gordon]], the poem is "clearly an old heathen thing which has been subjected to Christian censorship."&lt;ref name=GORDON92-93/&gt; Malcolm Laurence Cameron states that chanting the poem aloud results in a "marvellously incantatory effect".&lt;ref name=CAMERON144&gt;Cameron (1993:144).&lt;/ref&gt;

The charm references nine herbs:
* ''Mucgƿyrt'' Mugwort (''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'')
* ''Attorlaðe'' (identified as cockspur grass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'') by R. K. Gordon;&lt;ref name=GORDON92-93/&gt; partially defined by others as betony (''[[Stachys officinalis]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm OEME Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;)
* ''Stune'' Lamb's cress (''[[Cardamine hirsuta]]'')
* ''Ƿegbrade'' Plantain (''[[Plantago]]'')
*''Mægðe'' Mayweed (''[[Matricaria]]'')
* ''Stiðe'' Nettle (''[[Urtica]]'')
* ''Ƿergulu'' Crab-apple (''[[Malus]]'')
* ''Fille'' Thyme ([[Thymus vulgaris]])&lt;ref name=GORDON92-93/&gt;
*''Finule'' Fennel (''[[Foeniculum vulgare]]'')

At the end of the charm, prose instructions are given to take the above-mentioned herbs, crush them to dust, and to mix them with old [[soap]] and [[apple juice]]. Further instructions are given to make a paste from water and ashes, boil fennel into the paste, bathe it with beaten egg&amp;nbsp;– both before and after the prepared salve is applied.

Further, the charm directs the reader to sing the charm three times over each of the herbs as well as the apple before they are prepared, into the mouth of the wounded, both of their ears, and over the wound itself prior to the application of the salve.

===Woden===
The poem contains one of two Old English mentions of ''[[Odin|Woden]]'' in Old English poetry; the other is ''[[Maxims (Old English poems)|Maxims I]]'' of the ''[[Exeter Book]]''. The paragraph reads as follows:
{{bq|text=&lt;poem&gt;A snake came crawling, it bit a man.
Then Woden took nine glory-twigs,
Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.
There apple brought this pass against poison,
That she nevermore would enter her house.&lt;ref name=GORDON92-93/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Suggestions have been made that this passage describes Woden coming to the assistance of the herbs through his use of nine twigs, each twig inscribed with the [[rune|runic]] first-letter initial of a plant.&lt;ref name=MAYR-HARTING27&gt;Mayr-Harting (1991:27).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plaint note''' is a legal document, chiefly referred to as such under [[English law]] and that of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. It is sent by a court to a defendant to confirm legal action taken against them, and to inform them of their case number. In this way, it is comparable to a [[summons]] in [[American law]].

'''The Sandberg Prize for Israeli Art''' refers to a prize for art and design awarded at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem, with a particular focus on [[Israeli art]]. The prize was inaugurated in 1968 with funds from an anonymous [[New York City|New York]]–based donor.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sandberg Prize Foundation in the [[Israel Museum]]", Jerusalem and Negev News, Maariv, 1967/04/12&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is named in honor of [[Willem Sandberg]], who served between 1964 and 1968 as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Israel Museum, which opened in 1965.
==History==
The Sandberg Prize Foundation was established with a 75 thousand dollar fund which was earmarked for the purchase of Israeli art, and to be awarded to artists for their work. The anonymous donor requested to honor the work that Sandberg had done to promote Modern Art in Israel and with the intension of supporting the proliferation of art in [[Israel]].  

[[Joseph Zaritsky]] was the first artist to be awarded the prize 2 January 1968. The panel of judges for the prize included Sandberg and [[Yonah Fisher]]. The prize was given to Zaritsky for the 1964 painting which paid homage to [[Jan Vermeer]]. In the many interviews that followed the prize, Zaritsky stressed that the artwork has an independence of its own and "it is not permissible to look at  a painting and see more than what is there", he explained "an artists should not imagine beyond what he sees. What he sees is what there is. A painting is not a dream".&lt;ref&gt;"Yosef Zaritsky and the Sandberg Prize", Davar, 1968/01/19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Zaritsky receives the Sandberg Prize", Maariv, 1968/01/12&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 1968, the Sandberg Prize was awarded to [[Yigal Tumarkin]] for Sculpture and [[Arie Aroch]] for Painting.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sandberg Prize for Yigal Tumarkin and Arie Aroch", Davar, 1968/11/13&lt;/ref&gt;   

In addition to the prize a Sandberg Research Grant was awarded over the years from the Department of Design and Architecture at the Israel Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Nilerman, Prize recipients for the Israeli museum, Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Stanisław Cyganiewicz''' (April 1, 1879 – September 23, 1967), better known by the ring name '''Stanislaus Zbyszko''', was a Polish [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] 2-time [[World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship (original version)|World Heavyweight Champion]] at his highest profile in the [[United States]] during the 1920s. The surname Zbyszko was only a nickname, which was given him by friends due to his bravery when he was a child - it was the name of a fictional medieval Polish knight from the historical novel ''[[The Knights of the Cross]]'' by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. He was the brother of [[Wladek Zbyszko]].

==Early life==
Stanislaus Cyganiewicz was born on April 1, 1879 in Jodłowa near [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]. A noted intellectual, he studied music, philosophy, and law while growing up in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. He also possessed gifted strength; and he joined the renowned Vindobona Athletic Club while in college, where he gradually developed an imposing physique. In addition, he also practiced in the Sokol (“Falcon”), a Polish patriotic gymnastic society, which centered on the physical, mental, and cultural advancement of the nation’s citizens while instilling discipline and a love of country. Around the turn-of-the-century, Cyganiewicz first encountered the wrestling industry when he used his great power to successfully defeat an experienced grappler at a local circus in Poland. Standing just 5'8", Cyganiewicz was built like a house, carrying 260 pounds of chiseled muscle; and he was soon recruited to [[Berlin]] by a local promoter. As fellow strongman [[George Hackenschmidt]] established himself as Europe’s premier grappling star, Cyganiewicz was thus attracted to a career in wrestling as well; and he was subsequently introduced to the professional game by the Polish grappler [[:pl:Władysław Pytlasiński|Władysław Pytlasiński]], who eventually became his mentor.

==Wrestling career==
Over the next few years, Cyganiewicz gradually established himself among Europe’s fastest-rising Greco-Roman wrestlers while competing in a number of tournaments; and by 1903, Health &amp; Strength listed him among the continent’s leading heavyweights. He eventually took the ring name Stanislaus Zbyszko; and in 1906, he battled Russia’s "Cossack" [[Ivan Poddubny]] to a two-hour draw before then outlasting George Lurich and Constant le Marin to win a prestigious [[Paris]] tournament. He was next brought to England by Charles "C.B." Cochrane, who was previously Hackenschmidt’s manager; and he engaged in a series of prominent encounters against Turkey's "Champion of the Bosphorus" Kara Suliman while performing at the London Pavilion and the Gibbons music halls. However, he was soon embroiled in a major controversy when Suliman was revealed to be [[Bulgaria]]'s Ivan Offtharoff, who was actually employed by Zbyszko and Cochrane in one of the earliest public revelations of wrestling's "theatrical hoaxes".
[[File:Stanislaus Zbyszko 2969681420 7648a49ef5 o.jpg|thumb|Zbyszko circa 1913]]
As Zbyszko started to compete more often in [[England]] and the [[United States]], he increasingly began to make the switch to catch-as-catch-can freestyle wrestling; and for several years, he alternated between grappling styles as he traveled between continents and countries. Already billed as Europe’s [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] champion, he was subsequently recognized among the world’s top catch wrestlers when he fought [[Frank Gotch]] to a one-hour draw in November 1909 in Buffalo, NY. The following year, he scored heralded victories over Dr. Ben Roller and “the Terrible Turk” Youssuf Mahmout, thus confirming his reputation among the world’s elite grapplers while also setting up a huge second encounter with Gotch at the Chicago Coliseum on June 1, 1910 for the undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. However, in the rematch, Gotch tricked Zbyszko, jumping him when Zbyszko walked out for what was in Europe the customary handshake, and pinning him in just 6.4 seconds. Zbyszko was infuriated and protested the result, but the match went on and Gotch took the second fall in just under 30 minutes.  The performance led many fans to believe the bout was a work (although Gotch would never again face Zbyszko during his career).

Despite the controversial loss, Zbyszko was now regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared [[Great Gama]], an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure [[Frank Gotch]] into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in [[London]]. The match was £250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position.  Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama’s greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko’s lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. Nevertheless, Zbyszko still became one of the few wrestlers to ever meet the Great Gama without going down in defeat; The two men were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910. On that date, Zbyszko failed to show up and Gama was announced the winner by default. He was awarded the prize and the John Bull Belt. Receiving this belt entitled Gama to be called [[Rustam-e-Zamana]] or [[World Champion]]. Over the next decade, he competed in Europe while his younger brother, [[Wladek Zbyszko]], established himself among the top stars in the United States.

In 1927 it was announced that the Great Gama and Zbyszko would face each other again. The day finally came in 1928 when both wrestlers met again in Patiala. The result of the bout was, however, drawn quickly when Gama threw Zbyszko in only 42 seconds.

==Championship Controversy==
[[File:Ike Robin and Stanislaus Zbyszko (1926).jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photograph of two men shaking hands in front of a grey wall|[[Ike Robin]] (right) and Stanislaus Zbyszko, still billed a world champion, shake hands before [[Professional wrestling in New Zealand#Early years (1900–1920s)|their 1926 bout]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].]]
By this time, the industry had begun a gradual shift towards “worked” programs; and Stanislaus Zbyszko was eventually recruited back to the U.S. by the “Gold Dust Trio” of [[Strangler Lewis]], [[Billy Sandow]], and [[Toots Mondt]]. Though now in his early 40s, Zbyszko was booked to defeat Lewis for the World Title on May 6, 1921; but his reign was ultimately a bust at the box office, and he relinquished the title back to Lewis on March 3, 1922. Around this time, a disagreement caused [[Joe Stecher]] to split from the Gold Dust Trio promotion, thus forming a separate wrestling faction. Zbyszko remained with the Trio, who were promoting ex-football player [[Wayne Munn]] as a charismatic new champion. In order to build up Munn’s credibility, the Trio booked him to successfully defend the title against Zbyszko on April 15, 1925; however, Zbyszko had secretly accepted a payoff from Tony Stecher (Joe’s brother/manager) to switch to their company. Consequently, Zbyszko betrayed the Trio by turning the match with Munn into a legitimate [[shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]], pinning the non-wrestler again and again until the referee was forced to award the title to the 47-year-old veteran, who then dropped the title to Stecher a month later to complete the ploy. This was one of the last times a World Title changed hands legitimately; and the legacy of this conspiracy was momentous, as it would be decades before promoters would ever feel comfortable putting their title on a non-wrestler again, thus fueling the support for expert “hooker” [[Lou Thesz]] to serve as a champion throughout the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

==Retirement==
In 1928, Zbyszko received a lucrative offer to wrestle the Great Gama in a rematch of their bout from 18 years earlier. Despite both men now being well past their primes, the match purportedly drew 60,000 fans, who watched Great Gama defeat Zbyszko in just 40 seconds, leading many to speculate that Zbyszko was paid to do the job for Gama. Zbyszko then retired and actively scouted wrestling talent in [[South America]], where he discovered soccer, rugby-player, boxer, wrestler and acrobatic gymnast [[Antonino Rocca]], whom he developed into one of the sport’s biggest stars. From their Missouri farm, the Zbyszko brothers also trained future legends [[Johnny Valentine]] and [[Harley Race]]; and Stanislaus had a supporting role in the movie,&lt;!-- Actually shot in 1949. --&gt; ''[[Night and the City]]'' (1950). Knowing that a key role in the film was a grizzled Greco-Roman wrestling legend, director [[Jules Dassin]] said he "didn't want to pick an actor and train him to be a wrestler -- I wanted to do the opposite. I had never gone to a wrestling match, but I had an image of a wrestler from my youth."  The wrestler turned out to be Zbyszko. Dassin said, "I was told he was dead, but it turned out he was alive and was a chicken farmer in New Jersey." He turned out to be "a beautiful, cultured, multilingual man" who looked like a graceful rock formation. During breaks in filming, Dassin would travel into town to watch [[experimental theatre]]; he later recalled that Zbyszko was the only other person who would tag along (the rest of the cast and crew balked at the invitation). Like the character he played in the movie, Zbyszko often complained of the industry’s evolution into a form of showmanship.

On September 23, 1967, Stanislaus Zbyszko died of a heart attack at age 88. He was cited by Strangler Lewis as one of the best legitimate wrestlers of all-time; and as a tribute, his surname was later adopted by [[Larry Zbyszko]].

In 1983, Stanislaus Zbyszko was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/wrestling/stanley-zbyszko/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092131/http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/wrestling/stanley-zbyszko/ |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State University System of Florida Libraries''' is the [[academic library]] system of the [[State University System of Florida]] (SUS). The library system, which serves [[Florida]]'s twelve [[public university|public universities]], is one of the largest in the world, with more than 18 million items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flbog.org/resources/quickfacts/ SUSF Resources - Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; Though each campus library is separate, they share a reciprocal borrowing agreement known as the Florida Distance Learning Initiative, signed on February 9, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcla.edu/FCLAinfo/sus/borrowing_agreement.html SUS borrowing agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical collections are scattered across each of the SUS campuses. Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed below. Due to organizational differences, having more libraries does not directly translate into a higher volume of specific collections of materials.

==Discovery==
[[File:Stan -T.rex fossill and MOR555 - cast by Volkan Yuksel DSC06441.jpg|left|thumb|Black Hills Institute of Geological Research from Hill City, South Dakota]]
During the summer of 1990, a group of workers from the [[Black Hills Institute]], located in [[Hill City, South Dakota|Hill City]], searched for fossils at the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]] in western [[South Dakota]] near the city of [[Faith, South Dakota|Faith]]. By the end of the summer, the group had discovered ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' bones and was ready to leave. However,  a flat tire was discovered on their truck before the group could depart on August 12.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Tommy: [http://www.museumnetwork.com/features/05_22_highlight_sue2.asp Unveiling Sue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416133435/http://www.museumnetwork.com/features/05_22_highlight_sue2.asp |date=April 16, 2007 }}, Retrieved on April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While the rest of the group went into town to repair the truck, [[Sue Hendrickson]] decided to explore the nearby cliffs that the group had not checked. As she was walking along the base of a cliff, she discovered some small pieces of bone. She looked above her to see where the bones had originated, and observed larger bones protruding from the wall of the cliff. She returned to camp with two small pieces of the bones and reported the discovery to the president of the Black Hills Institute, [[Peter Larson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unearthingtrex.com/press/UnearthingTrex-5.5.04.pdf |title= T. rex dig goes online |publisher= unearthingtrex.com |accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He determined that the bones were from a ''T. rex'' by their distinctive contour and texture. Later, closer examination of the site showed many visible bones above the ground and some articulated vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; 

The crew ordered extra plaster and, although some of the crew had to depart, Hendrickson and a few other workers began to uncover the bones. The group was excited, as it was evident that much of the dinosaur had been preserved. Previously discovered ''T. rex'' skeletons were usually missing over half of their bones.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;Larson, Peter; Donnan, Kristin. ''Wex Appeal''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that Sue was a record 90 percent complete by bulk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Field Museum|title=Unearthing the Secrets of Sue: Educator Guide|edition=Second|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/sites/default/files/jsandy/2014/08/07/sue_educator_guide_2010-3.pdf|accessdate=July 9, 2016 |pages=3, 52|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 73% complete counting the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, P, 2008, "One Hundred Years of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'': The Skeletons", In: Larson and Carpenter (eds.). '' ''Tyrannosaurus rex'': The Tyrant King''. Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe that this specimen was covered by water and mud soon after its death which prevented other animals from carrying away the bones.&lt;ref name="Relf"/&gt; Additionally, the rushing water mixed the skeleton together. When the fossil was found the hip bones were above the skull and the leg bones were intertwined with the ribs. The large size and the excellent condition of the bones were also surprising. The skull was {{cvt|1394|mm}} long, and most of the teeth were still intact. After the group completed excavating the bones, each block was covered in [[burlap]] and coated in [[plaster]], followed by a transfer to the offices of The Black Hills Institute where they began to clean the bones.

==Dispute and auction==
[[File:Field fg06.jpg|thumb|Field Museum Fossil Preparation Lab]]

Soon after the fossils were found, a dispute arose over their legal ownership. The Black Hills Institute had obtained permission from the owner of the land, Maurice Williams, to excavate and remove the skeleton, and had, according to Larson, paid Williams {{USD|5000}} for the remains.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, Miriam: [http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/contract_law_beyond/ A T-Rex Named Sue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407131725/http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/contract_law_beyond/ |date=April 7, 2007 }}, Retrieved on April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Williams later claimed that the money had not been for the sale of the fossil and that he had only allowed Larson to remove and clean the fossil for a later sale.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; Williams was a member of the [[Sioux]]&lt;!--This is the specific Sioux group that lives in this region.--&gt; tribe, and the tribe claimed the bones belonged to them. However, the property that the fossil had been found within was held in trust by the [[United States Department of the Interior]]&lt;!--This is the agency that owns most federal land in the US.--&gt;.

In 1992, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[South Dakota National Guard]] raided the site where The Black Hills Institute had been cleaning the bones and seized the fossil,&lt;ref&gt;Cataldo, Rosie: [http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/fedgaz/01-07/fossils.cfm Digging for dollars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212181549/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/fedgaz/01-07/fossils.cfm |date=February 12, 2008 }}, Retrieved on April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; charging Larson on 158 points. The government transferred the remains to the [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]], where the skeleton was stored until the penal and civil legal disputes were settled. The United States Senate voted to not confirm the appointment of Kevin Schieffer as [[United States Attorney for the District of South Dakota]] after his controversial handling of the penal case. Larson was in 1996 convicted to a two year prison sentence on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995. 

Williams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property. Many were then worried that the fossil would end up in a private collection where people would not be able to observe it.&lt;ref&gt;Monastersky, Richard: [http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/sakesue.htm For the Sake of Sue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211201943/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/sakesue.htm |date=December 11, 2007 }}, Retrieved on December 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poling, Jeff: [http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/reserve.htm Reserving "Sue"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210185237/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/reserve.htm |date=December 10, 2007 }}, Retrieved on December 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field Museum of Natural History|The Field Museum]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] was also concerned about this possibility, and decided to attempt to purchase Sue. However, the organization realized that they might have had difficulty securing funding and requested that companies and private citizens provide financial support. The [[California State University|California State University system]], [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], [[McDonald's]], [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]], and individual donors agreed to assist in purchasing Sue for The Field Museum. On October 4, 1997, the auction began at {{USD|500000}}; less than ten minutes later, The Field Museum had purchased the remains with the highest bid of {{USD|7.6 million}}. The final cost was {{USD|8362500}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoganson |first1=John W. |title=The Selling of the ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' Named "Sue": Its Effect on North Dakota's Fossil Resource Management Program |volume=25 | issue=2 |url=https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndfossil/education/pdf/Trexsue.pdf |work=NDGS Newsletter |date=Summer–Fall 1998 |pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0878226.html|title=Tyrannosaurus Sue|website=www.factmonster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freedom du Lac|first1=J.|title=The T. rex that got away: Smithsonian’s quest for Sue ends with different dinosaur|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-t-rex-that-got-away-smithsonians-quest-for-sue-ends-with-different-dinosaur/2014/04/05/7da9a73c-b9a6-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html|accessdate=December 12, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest amount ever paid for a dinosaur fossil.&lt;ref name="Steve Fiffer 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Fiffer|year=2000|title=Tyrannosaurus Sue|publisher=W.

==Preparation==
[[File:Sue skull.jpg|thumb|left|Sue's skull]]
The Field Museum hired a specialized moving company with experience in transporting delicate items to move the bones to Chicago. The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or "matrix", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.&lt;ref name="Relf"/&gt;

Once the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bone damage===
[[File:Sue TRex Skull Full Frontal.JPG|upright|thumb|Front view of Sue's replacement skull]]

Close examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death—the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013. A ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' episode said that the death occurred in a seasonal stream bed, which washed away some small bones. During life, this carnivore received several injuries and suffered from numerous pathologies.&lt;ref name="Relf"&gt;Relf, Pat. ''A Dinosaur Named Sue: The Story of the Colossal Fossil''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury to the right shoulder region of Sue resulted in a damaged shoulder blade, a [[Tendon avulsion|torn tendon]] in the right arm due most likely from a struggle with prey, and three broken ribs.&lt;ref name="rothschild-2001"&gt;Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.&lt;/ref&gt; This damage subsequently healed (though one rib healed into two separate pieces), indicating Sue survived the incident. The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture. 

Multiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|publisher=PLOS ONE|accessdate=July 9, 2016|language=English|doi=10.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John, Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound. Subsequent study by Field Museum paleontologists found no bite marks. The distortion and breakage seen in some of the bones in the back of the skull was likely caused by post-mortem trampling. Some of the tail vertebrae are fused in a pattern typical of [[arthritis]] due to injury. The animal is also believed to have suffered from [[gout]].&lt;ref name="Rothschild"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rothschild | first=BM |author2=Tanke D |author3=Carpenter K | title=Tyrannosaurs suffered from gout | journal=Nature | volume=387 | issue=6631 | pages=357 | year=1997 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6631/abs/387357a0.html | doi=10.1038/387357a0 | pmid=9163417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate exactly how the animal died; the cause of death is ultimately unknown.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;

After the bones were prepared, photographed and studied, they were sent to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work consists of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated as it was in life. The real [[skull]] was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head {{cvt|13|ft|0|order=flip|sp=us}} off the ground. Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like. The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study.

The Sue exhibit opened on May 17, 2000, with more than 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Holly: [http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0878226.html Tyrannosaurus Sue], Retrieved on April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gurche]], a [[paleoart]]ist,  painted a mural of a ''Tyrannosaurus'' for the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;"Local artist honored for T-rex painting".

The '''''Taiping Yulan''''', translated as the '''''Imperial Reader''''' or '''''Readings of the [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Taiping Era]]''''', is a massive [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[leishu]]'' [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedia]] compiled by a number of officers under [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] from 977 to 983. It was commissioned by the imperial court of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasty]] during the first [[Chinese era names|era]] of the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Emperor Taizong]]. It is divided into 1,000 volumes and 55 sections, which consisted of about 4.7 million [[Chinese characters]]. It included citations from about 2,579 different kinds of [[documents]] spanning from [[books]], [[poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[proverbs]], [[steles]] to miscellaneous works. After its completion, the [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Emperor Taizong]] is said to have finished reading it within a year, going through 3 volumes per day. It is considered one of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]''.

It is one of the sources used by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] scholars to reconstruct the lost ''[[Record of the Seasons of Jingchu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Theobald |first=Ulrich |date=2010 |title=China Knowledge |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de |contribution=Jing-Chu Suishi Ji |contribution-url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Science/jingchusuishiji.html |location=Tübingen }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent's sister-in-law and wife to his brother Theo, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]],  spent many years after her husband's death in 1891 compiling the letters, which were first published in 1914. [[Arnold Pomerans]], &lt;!-- Arnold Pomerans was a noted and very influential British translator who specialized especially in the Dutch language https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/arnold-j-pomerans-6144212.html.

Editing: "van Gogh scholar and editor of the 1996 ''The Letters of Vincent van Gogh''--&gt; editor of a 1966 selection of the letters, wrote that Theo "was the kind of man who saved even the smallest scrap of paper", and it is to this trait that the public owes the 663 letters from Vincent.

Indeed, the only period where the public is relatively uninformed is the Parisian period when they shared an apartment and had no need to correspond. &lt;!-- Pomerans introduces the Goncourt comparison (not his) but effectively dismisses it as weighty. Editing :"Moreover, Pomerans believes that the brothers modeled themselves after the [[Goncourt brothers|de Goncourt]] brothers and that they likely knew the letters were of literary significance. As a whole, the letters represent a unified work of art the two brothers created together." --&gt;The letters effectively play much the same role in shedding light on the art of the period as those between the [[Goncourt brothers|de Goncourt]] brothers did for literature.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"&gt;Pomerans (1997), xv–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo van Gogh's wife, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], devoted many years to compiling the letters about which she wrote: "When as Theo's young wife I entered in 1889, our flat in the Cité Pigalle in Paris, I found at the bottom of a small desk a drawer full of letters from Vincent".&lt;ref name = "Pxiii"/&gt; Within two years both brothers were dead: Vincent as the result of a gunshot wound, and Theo from illness.  Joanna began the task of completing the collection, which was published in full in January 1914.&lt;ref name = "Pxiii"/&gt; That first edition consisted of three volumes, and was followed in 1952–1954 by a four-volume edition that included additional letters. [[Jan Hulsker]] suggested, in 1987, that the letters be organized in date order, and undertaking that began in 1994 when the Van Gogh Letter Project was initiated by the Van Gogh Museum. The project consists of a complete annotated collection of letters written by and to Vincent.&lt;ref name = "VGletterwriter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publication history: The first collected edition of 1952-1954 and thereafter |url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/publications_5.html |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition and early publication===
In the last days of December 1901, running through January 1902, [[Bruno Cassirer]] and his cousin [[Paul Cassirer]] organized the first van Gogh exhibition in [[Berlin, Germany]]. Paul Cassirer first established a market for van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], controlled market prices. In 1906 Bruno Cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of Vincent's to Theo van Gogh, translated into German.&lt;ref&gt;The date 1908 proposed in ''The posthumous fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890–1970'', by [[John Rewald]], (first published in ''Museumjournaal,'' August–September 1970), ''John Rewald Studies in [[Post-Impressionism]]'', p. 248, published by Abrams 1986, {{ISBN|0-8109-1632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The letters==
Of the 844 surviving letters that van Gogh wrote, 663 were written to Theo, 9 to Theo and Jo. Of the letters Vincent received from Theo, only 39 survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letter_writer_1.html "Van Gogh as Writer"] Retrieved December 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter was written when Vincent was 19 and begins, "My dear Theo". At that time Vincent was not yet developed as a letter writer – he was factual, but not introspective. When he moved to London, and later to Paris, he began to add more personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letter_writer_2.html "The Earliest Letters"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1888 and ending a year later, van Gogh wrote 22 letters to Émile Bernard in which the tone is different from those to Theo. In these letters, van Gogh wrote more about his techniques, his use of color, and his theories.&lt;!-- eplace 'theories', awful word --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubow, Arthur. "Letters from Vincent". ''Smithsonian''. Volume 38, Issue 10. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The letters as literature===
Van Gogh was an avid reader, and his letters reflect his literary pursuits as well as a uniquely authentic literary style.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt; His writing style in the letters reflects the literature he read and valued: [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], historians such as [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]], and naturalists such as [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomerans (1997), xx&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally he read novels written by [[George Eliot]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Keats|Keats]]' poetry, reading mostly at night when the light was too poor for painting. [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] told him "that he read too much".&lt;ref name="Drabble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Drabble|first=Margaret|title=Dutch Courage|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/art/2010/01/van-gogh-vincent-letters-work|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|date= 18 January 2010|accessdate=4 March 2012|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Lqf9KIi8|archivedate= 14 December 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker wrote of van Gogh's letters, "Vincent was able to express himself splendidly, and it is this remarkable writing talent that has secured the letters their lasting place in world literature". Poet [[W. H. Auden]] wrote about the letters, "there is scarcely one letter by van Gogh which I&amp;nbsp;... do not find fascinating".&lt;ref name = "VGletterwriter"/&gt; Pomerans believes the letters to be on the level of "world literature" based on style and the ability to express himself.  In the letters Vincent reflects different facets of his personality and he adopts a tone specific to his circumstances. At the time he went through a stage of religious fanaticism, his letters fully reflect his thoughts; at the time he was involved with [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Sien Hoornik]] his letters reflect his feelings.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt;

===The letters as chronicle of an artist's life===
Van Gogh's letters paint a chronicle of an artist's life, with the notable omission of the period when he lived in Paris and therefore had no need to correspond with his brother.&lt;ref name = "Pxviff"/&gt;  The letters can be read as an autobiography of an artist; time spent in [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], Paris and London, [[The Hague]], [[Drenthe]], [[Nuenen]], [[Antwerp]], [[Arles]], [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Remy]] and [[Auvers-sur-Oise|Auvers]]  chronicle his corporal travels as well as his artistic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Pomerans (1997), xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Vincent wrote Theo every day—beyond the need to acknowledge financial support, describing England and  the Netherlands. He included in the letters sketches of common people such as miners and farmers for he believed the poor would inherit the earth.&lt;ref name = "Drabble"/&gt; Van Gogh's spiritual and theological thought and convictions are revealed in his letters throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Cliff|title=Van Gogh and God : a creative spiritual quest|date=1989|publisher=Loyola University Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=0-8294-0621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

For much of his adult life he was lonely and pushed to learn as much as he could about the world around and about his craft. [[Margaret Drabble]] describes the letters from Drenthe as "heart-breaking", as he struggled to come to terms with the "darkness of his hereditary subject matter", the bleak poverty and meanness of Dutch peasant life. This struggle culminated with his painting ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''. His friend and mentor Van Rappard disliked the painting. Undeterred, van Gogh moved south, via Antwerp and Paris. His letters from Arles describe his [[utopia]]n dream of establishing a community of artists who lived together, worked together, and helped each other. In this project he was joined by Paul Gauguin in late 1888.&lt;ref name = "Drabble"/&gt;

=== Autograph of letter 716 ===
[[File:Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin - Letter VGM 716.jpg|thumb|center|x150px|Letter 716: Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Emile Bernard. Arles, Thursday, 1 or Friday, 2 November 1888]]

Letter 716 is  a letter sent jointly by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Émile Bernard around 1 November 1888 shortly after Gauguin had joined van Gogh in [[Arles]].  Late that summer, van Gogh had completed his second group of ''[[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|Sunflower]]'' paintings, amongst his most iconic paintings, two of which decorated Gauguin's room, as well as his famous painting ''[[The Yellow House]]'' depicting the house they shared.

The letter is unique in being a joint letter from the two, and can be read in both the original French and an English translation at the website of the [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s edition of the letters.&lt;ref name= "Letter 716" group= "Letters"&gt;{{cite web|title= 716 Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Emile Bernard. Arles, Thursday, 1 or Friday, 2 November 1888|url= http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let716/letter.html|work= Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= 1|quote= Next, I don’t think it will astonish you greatly if I tell you that our discussions are tending to deal with the terrific subject of an association of certain painters. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it they discuss, amongst other matters, their plans to form an artists' commune, possibly abroad. In reality their relationship was always fraught, and by the end of the year they had parted for good, van Gogh himself hospitalised following a breakdown in which he had mutilated one of his ears.

The [[autograph]] fetched €445,000 at a sale in Paris 12–13 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=van Gogh, Vincent (1853-1890) et Gauguin, Paul (1848-1903).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">A '''warehouse receipt''' is a document that provides proof of ownership of commodities (e.g., bars of copper) that are stored in a warehouse, vault, or depository for safekeeping. 

Warehouse receipts may be negotiable or non-negotiable. Negotiable warehouse receipts allow transfer of ownership of that commodity without having to deliver the physical commodity.  See [[Delivery order]].
  
Most warehouse receipts are issued in negotiable form, making them eligible as collateral for loans. Non-negotiable receipts must be endorsed upon transfer.

In the [[United States]], warehouse receipts are generally regulated by Article 7 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] by the various jurisdictions.

Rather than delivering the actual commodity, negotiable warehouse receipts are used to settle expiring futures contracts.

Warehouse receipts may also indicate ownership of inventory goods and/or unfinished goods stored in a warehouse by a manufacturer or distributor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1552">'''Wildlife Treasury''' was an educational animal [[encyclopedia]] for young children published between 1975 and 1981 by [[Leisure Books]].

==Description==

The encyclopedia was released in a series of "Wildlife Cards" showing entries on specific animals, with over one thousand cards in all.  The Wildlife cards were available through a monthly [[subscription]], with the first set provided with a green plastic carrying case.

The Wildlife Treasury Cards were mainly released in the [[United States]], but a different version of the cards were also available in [[Canada]].  Canadian cards had rounded corners, to distinguish from the U.S. Cards, and were unnumbered.  The card sizes, pictures, and write-ups were identical between U.S. and Canadian version.

==Commercial Advertisement==

An often remembered trait of the "Wildlife Treasury" series was an advertisement featuring an excited young boy describing some of the cards in his wildlife collection.  The [[Rhinoceros]], [[Proboscis monkey]], and [[Platypus]] are all discussed, at the end of which the young boy exclaims: "They're all in my Wildlife Treasury!!"  The commercial ran on American television for several years in the 1980s, most significantly on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]].

'''Wolfgang's''' (formerly Wolfgang's Vault) is a private music-focused company established in 2002 dedicated to the restoration and archiving of live concert recordings in audio and video format and the sale of music memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Wolfgang's LLC|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=118910321|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began with the collection of the late promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], and added multiple other music and memorabilia archives.  It was called "the most important collection of rock memorabilia and recordings ever assembled in one business," by The Wall Street Journal, Dec 13, 2005.

==History==

Wolfgang's was started by William E. Sagan, who purchased a warehouse filled with Bill Graham Productions memorabilia in 2003, including taped concert recordings, for about $6 million.  These materials had various owners after the death of [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], the concert promoter, in 1991.  The name Wolfgang's is inspired by Bill Graham's original name, Wolodia "Wolfgang" Grajonca.&lt;ref name=lat1&gt;{{cite news|title=Rockers sue over sales of memorabilia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/19/business/fi-wolfgang19|first1=Geoff |last1=Boucher |first2=Martin |last2=Zimmerman|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched its website in November 2003. Later that year, Wolfgang's released the BG Archive photography collection, and subsequently added collections called "vaults" for:  vintage poster art, rock clothing, vintage audio concert recordings.  The Video Vault was added in 2011.
On August 7, 2012, Wolfgang's announced to its free streaming service users, via email, that later converted to a subscription based model on August 8, 2012.

In late 2016 the company changed its site URL to [https://www.wolfgangs.com wolfgangs.com] and its name from Wolfgang's Vault to simply Wolfgang's.

==Music==
Beginning in the late ‘60s, Graham recorded thousands of performances, which he stored on tapes in the basement of the Bill Graham Presents headquarters. Bill Sagan acquired these archives in 2003, and had the tapes restored and digitized for presentation on the Concert Vault of audio recordings.  In February 2006, Wolfgang’s launched Vault Radio to allow fans of the music to hear some of these recordings. In an article about Vault Radio, the [[Washington Times]] noted “lovers of classic rock will not find a better historical source for their favorite music anywhere on the Internet.”

In August 2012, the music archive became its own site, Concert Vault, hosting thousands of video and audio recordings and boasting the largest online archive of live music recordings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concertvault.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; The membership based site includes a free trial period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concertvault.com/membership.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Radio France's "Un Jour Sur La Toile" named Wolfgang's their #1 website of the year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/chro/unjoursurlatoile/index.php?id=75023&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PC Magazine]] named it one of the best five undiscovered music sites of the year in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2327440,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MacWorld]] named the free iPhone app the world's best iPhone app of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/index.cfm?newsid=26313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other properties==
*Wolfgang's bought ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' in 2006, and relaunched it in 2007, and relocated it in August 2011 to a blog at the newly acquired ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine.
*Wolfgang's bought a majority stake in [[Daytrotter]] in 2008.
*Wolfgang's bought the ''[[Ash Grove (music club)]]'' blues archive in 2009.
*Wolfgang's bought the ''[[Newport Jazz]]'' and ''[[Newport Folk Festival]]'' archives in 2010.
*Wolfgang's bought ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine in 2011.

==Legal issues==

In 2006, some bands whose materials were being sold or streamed sued Sagan for infringement of rights, saying that the rights in the materials being brokered by Wolfgang's belong to the artists themselves. Among the groups represented were [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Doors]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Carlos Santana]].&lt;ref name=lat1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytwho"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levine|first1=Robert|title=Who Owns the Live Music of Days Gone By?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12video.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, works by artists [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Bob Marley]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] that were owned by Wolfgang's became available through an agreement between the company and Universal Music Group.&lt;ref name="nytold"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=Old Music Online|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/arts/05arts-OLDMUSICONLI_BRF.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The manuscript was in use at [[St. Leonard's Church, Wollaton]] from the 1460s, until Catholic Latin service books were banned in the [[Reformation]] in the 1540s. The antiphonal was kept safe in [[Wollaton Hall]] library until 1924, when it was returned to the church.  In 1974 it was put in the care of the University of Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscripts/2011/11/03/medieval-treasure-to-be-opened-to-public-view/  Medieval treasure to be opened to public view]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''year-in-review''' is any sort of [[Annual publication|publication which is traditionally released on an annual basis]] to cover the events of the past year from the perspective of the contributors to the publication. Years-in-review are often intended to highlight the highs and lows of the events which occurred throughout the year, and often include select works published during the year which are considered by the editors of the year-in-review to be the most memorable works of the year. Years-in-review are often used to list "Top Ten" lists voted upon by hired critics and reviewers of other media.

On broadcast media, years-in-review (also called "Countdowns") are segments of regular series or annual specials which offer mini-documentaries summarizing the highs and lows of the prior year.

==Non-entertainment==
Outside of strictly-news and entertainment-oriented media, the term "year-in-review" can also apply to any statistical internal overview of an [[Organizational performance|organization's performance]] in comparison to prior years of operation.

'''Yvert et Tellier''' is a [[postage stamp]] dealer and a [[philately|philatelic]] publishing company founded in 1895 in the northern [[France|French]] city of [[Amiens]], where the head office is still located. The logo is a circle divided into a [[snowflake]] and a smiling sun. It is a pun on the name of the company: ''hiver, été liés'' ("winter, summer together") sounds a lot like the French pronunciation of ''Yvert et Tellier''. 

The family company was founded by [[Eugène Yvert]] in 1831 as a [[printing works]] for a [[Legitimists|legitimist]] newspaper. The switch to philately was decided 1895 by Eugène's grandson [[Louis Yvert]] and his chief printer [[Théodule Tellier]]. Nowadays the company is still run by the Yvert family.

==Products==
Yvert et Tellier's major product is a [[stamp catalog]] which is a reference for stamps and countries that are most collected by French philatelists: France, [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], and the former French colonies and their philatelic history as independent states. In France, it is one of the most important philatelic publishing companies, along with [[Cérès (edition)|Cérès]] and [[Dallay]]. 

Continuing the old association between [[Louis Yvert]] and [[Théodore Champion]], the ''Ancienne Maison Théodore Champion'' edits monthly and yearly a colour catalog of newly issued stamps from all over the world. Usually, Yvert catalogs for non-European countries were printed in black and white, but in 2008 they started with full color prints.

It is one of the international references as well, with [[Michel catalog|Michel]], [[Scott catalog|Scott]] and [[Stanley Gibbons]]. The Yvert catalogs list stamps issued by all countries in the world, but for non-European countries, the volumes are organized in alphabetic order whereas the German company Michel uses a geographical classification.

==History==

=== Genesis and management successions ===
During the 1890s in Amiens, the Yvert family's printing works is the property of [[Louis Yvert]], grandson of the founder, and his chief printer [[Théodule Tellier]]; Tellier kept the company running after the premature death of Louis' father. Louis did not like being in charge of the legimist paper founded by his father, ''L'Écho de la Somme''. He discovered [[stamp collecting]] thanks to Tellier, a philatelist, who had already added a small philatelic newspaper, ''[[L'Écho de la timbrologie]]'', to the papers printed by the company.

In 1895, Yvert and Tellier started getting involved in philatelic books. In November 1896 they published a worldwide catalog of stamps and a [[stamp album]]. The success was immediate because of their logical and permanent numbering, in contrast to most of their contemporaries, who changed the numbers in their catalogues upon discovering forgotten stamps.

In 1900, Yvert et Tellier associated with Paris stamp dealer Théodore Champion, who sold unused stamps from all over the world. He fixed the prices of the stamps sold by the company. After Champion's death in 1955, Pierre Yvert and the brothers Ladislas and Alexandre Varga bought Champion's company and the new firm continued to fix Yvert et Tellier's prices.

In April 1913, Tellier sold his share of the company to Louis Yvert because of the loss of his young grandson. Due to their friendship, Yvert decided that the catalog would continue to be named ''Yvert et Tellier''.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Yvert prepared his two sons and his son-in-law to run the firm. Henri ran the printing works, his brother [[Pierre Yvert|Pierre]] directed ''L'Écho de la timbrologie'', and Jean Gervais took care of the publishing.

Pierre Yvert's and Jean Gervais' two grandsons have run the company since the 1990s.

=== Recent commercial history ===
Since 2001 the apparition of the [[Dallay]] catalog has had a major effect on the French philatelist public by providing larger pictures of stamps and information not found in the Yvert et Tellier catalogs, such as the name of the artiste and/or engraver, first date of issue, use, etc. Yvert has been fighting on two fronts: it has successfully defended the rights to its numbering system, and it distributes a free CD-ROM with its French stamp catalog.

Nevertheless, in March 2005, by urging of the French ''Conseil de la concurrence'', Yvert agreed to sell the use of the Yvert stamp numbers to other publishers.

In June 2006 Yvert et Tellier published a new catalog of French stamps, a cheaper pocketbook version containing just pictures and prices, as did [[Cérès (editor)|Cérès]], the second main philatelic publishing company in France.

=== Genealogy of the Yvert family ===
The Yvert printing company and Yvert et Tellier editor have been ruling mostly by members of the Yvert family. This family tree presents the people who managed these two companies since they were found in the 19th century.

Zeus is the child of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to [[Hera]], by whom he is usually said to have fathered [[Ares]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], and [[Hephaestus]].&lt;ref name="Hamilton1942"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Edith|title=Mythology|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|year=1942|edition=1998|page=467|isbn=978-0-316-34114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[oracle]] of [[Dodona]], his consort was said to be [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]], by whom the ''[[Iliad]]'' states that he fathered [[Aphrodite]].{{refn|name="aphrodite"|There are two major conflicting stories for Aphrodite's origins: [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' claims that she was born from the foam of the sea after Cronos castrated Uranus, making her Uranus's daughter but [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' has Aphrodite as the daughter of Zeus and Dione.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad|Il]].'', Book V.&lt;/ref&gt; A speaker in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' offers that they were separate figures: [[Aphrodite#Aphrodite Ourania and Aphrodite Pandemos|Aphrodite Ourania and Aphrodite Pandemos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symp.]]'', 180e.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including [[Athena]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hermes]], [[Persephone]], [[Dionysus]], [[Perseus]], [[Heracles]], [[Helen of Troy]], [[Minos]], and the [[Muse]]s.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1942"/&gt;

He was respected as an [[Sky father|allfather]] who was chief of the gods&lt;ref&gt;[[Homeric Hymns]].&lt;/ref&gt; and assigned the others to their roles:&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert|Burkert]], ''Greek Religion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad|Il.]]'', I.503 &amp; 533.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[interpretatio graeca|equated]] with many foreign [[weather god]]s, permitting [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] to observe "That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men".&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 2.24.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus' symbols are the [[thunderbolt]], [[eagle]], [[bull (mythology)|bull]], and [[oak]]. In addition to his [[Dyeus|Indo-European inheritance]], the classical "cloud-gatherer" (Greek: {{lang|grc|Νεφεληγερέτα}}, ''Nephelēgereta'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|nefelhgere/ta^|Νεφεληγερέτα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the [[ancient Near East]], such as the [[scepter]]. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.

==Name==
[[File:The Chariot of Zeus - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|The Chariot of Zeus, from an 1879 ''Stories from the Greek Tragedians'' by Alfred Church.]]

The god's name in the nominative is {{lang|grc|Ζεύς}} (''Zeús''). It is inflected as follows: [[vocative]]: {{lang|grc|Ζεῦ}} (''{{Lang|grc-Latn|Zeû}}''); [[accusative]]: {{lang|grc|Δία}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|Día}}); [[genitive]]: {{lang|grc|Διός}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|Diós}}); [[dative]]: {{lang|grc|Διί}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|Dií}}).

''Zeus'' is the Greek continuation of *''[[Dyeus|{{PIE|Di̯ēus}}]],'' the name of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] god of the daytime sky, also called *''{{PIE|Dyeus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;tēr}}'' ("Sky Father").&lt;ref name="Zeus"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Zeus| title=American Heritage Dictionary|chapter=Zeus| accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; The god is known under this name in the [[Rigvedic deities|Rigveda]] ([[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''[[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus/Dyaus Pita]]''), [[Latin]] (compare ''[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]'', from ''Iuppiter'', deriving from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] vocative *''{{PIE|dyeu-ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;tēr}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Jupiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from the [[PIE root|root]] *''dyeu''- ("to shine", and in its many derivatives, "sky, heaven, god").&lt;ref name="Zeus"/&gt;
Zeus is the only deity in the Olympic [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] whose name has such a transparent Indo-European etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|title=Greek Religion| year=1985| page= 321|isbn=0-674-36280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attested forms of the name are the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀇𐀸}}, ''di-we'' and {{lang|gmy|𐀇𐀺}}, ''di-wo'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Linear B word di-we|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16703}} {{cite web|title=The Linear B word di-wo|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16635|website=Palaeolexicon.

[[Plato]], in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'']], gives a folk etymology of Zeus meaning "cause of life always to all things," because of puns between alternate titles of Zeus (''Zen'' and ''Dia'') with the Greek words for life and "because of."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceOQKf0ZvFMC "Plato's ''Cratylus'',"] by Plato, ed. by David Sedley, Cambridge University Press, 6 Nov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ceOQKf0ZvFMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Plato's%20Cratylus&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.91]&lt;/ref&gt;  This etymology, along with Plato's entire method of deriving etymologies, is not supported by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAUWAAAAYAAJ|title=The Makers of Hellas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1xn5Bb-CacC|title=Limiting the Arbitrary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Zeus Getty Villa.jpg|thumb|Zeus, at the Getty Villa, A.D. 1 – 100 by unknown.]]

===Birth===
[[File:Idäische Grotte 11.JPG|thumb|"[[Cave of Zeus]]", [[Mount Ida (Crete)]].]]

[[Cronus]] sired several children by [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]: [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]], and [[Poseidon]], but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] that he was destined to be overthrown by his son as he had previously overthrown Uranus, his own father, an oracle that Rhea heard and wished to avert.

When Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for his acts against Uranus and his own children.  Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mythology: Myths, Legends, &amp; Fantasy|year=2003|publisher=Sweet Water Press|isbn=9781468265903|page=21|chapter=Greek and Roman Mythology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===

Varying versions of the story exist:

# According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 139)) Zeus was raised by a nymph named Amalthea. Since Saturn (Cronus) ruled over the [[Earth]], the [[heaven]]s and the [[sea]], she hid him by dangling him on a [[rope]] from a [[tree]] so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.
# According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html#1 1.1.5-7])) Zeus was raised by a [[goat]] named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] in a cave called Dictaeon Antron ([[Psychro Cave]]). A a company of soldiers called [[Kouretes]] danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry.

===King of the gods===

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Statue of Zeus dsc02611-.jpg|thumb|upright|Colossal seated [[Dagon|Marnas]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] portrayed in the style of Zeus.  Roman period Marnas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Gaza}}; [http://www.plekos.uni-muenchen.de/2004/rhahn.html Johannes Hahn: Gewalt und religiöser Konflikt]; [http://philologos.org/__eb-thlatb/chap08.htm#mosue The Holy Land and the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; was the chief divinity of Gaza ([[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]).]]

After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at [[Pytho]] under the glens of [[Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, the [[Omphalos]]) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[emetic]] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's [[stomach]] open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], from their dungeon in [[Tartarus]], killing their guard, [[Campe]].

As a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him [[thunder]] and the thunderbolt, or [[lightning]], which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the [[Titanomachy]]. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.

After the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the "earth-shaker" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also [[Penthus]]).

Gaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the [[monster]]s [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under [[Mount Etna]], but left Echidna and her children alive.

===Zeus and Hera===
{{Main|Hera}}

Zeus was brother and consort of [[Hera]]. By Hera, Zeus sired [[Ares]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] and [[Hephaestus]], though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone. Some also include [[Eileithyia]], [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], [[Enyo]] and [[Angelos (Greek mythology)|Angelos]] as their daughters. In the section of the Iliad known to scholars as the [[Deception of Zeus]], the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it.&lt;ref&gt;Iliad, Book 14, line 294&lt;/ref&gt; The conquests of Zeus among [[nymph]]s and the mythic mortal progenitors of [[Greeks|Hellenic]] dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with [[Leto]], [[Demeter]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Themis]], [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]] and [[Mnemosyne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886&amp;ndash;900].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+901 901&amp;ndash;911].&lt;/ref&gt; Other relationships with immortals included [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]. Among mortals were [[Semele]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] (for more details, see below) and with the young [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] (although he was mortal Zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality).

Many myths render Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus's mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a [[nymph]] named [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by talking incessantly, and when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The Greeks variously claimed that the Moires/Fates were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness [[Themis]] or of primordial beings like [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]], or [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]].

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The Charites/Graces were usually considered the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome but they were also said to be daughters of Dionysus and Aphrodite or of Helios and the naiad Aegle.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Some accounts say that Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus were born parthenogenetically.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;According to one version, Athena is said to be born parthenogenetically.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Helen was either the daughter of Leda or Nemesis.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Tyche is usually considered a daughter of Aphrodite and Hermes.

Zeus played a dominant role, presiding over the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] Olympian pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes &lt;!--"and heroines" was sweetly motivated, but can we name even one sired by Zeus?--&gt; and was featured in many of their [[Cult (religion)|local cults]]. Though the Homeric "cloud collector" was the god of the sky and thunder like his Near-Eastern counterparts, he was also the supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek [[religion|religious]] beliefs and the [[archetype|archetypal]] Greek deity.

Aside from local epithets that simply designated the deity as doing something random at some particular place, the [[epithet]]s or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:

*'''Zeus Aegiduchos''' or '''Aegiochos''': Usually taken as Zeus as the bearer of the [[Aegis]], the divine shield with the head of [[Medusa]] across it,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' i. 202, ii. 157, 375, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' iv. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'' ii. 13&lt;/ref&gt; although others derive it from "goat" ({{lang|grc|αἴξ}}) and ''okhē'' ({{lang|grc|οχή}}) in reference to Zeus's nurse, the divine goat [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]].&lt;ref&gt;Spanh.

==Cults of Zeus==

===Panhellenic cults===

The major center where all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.

Outside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.

====Zeus Velchanos====

With one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: "by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new", Will Durant observed,&lt;ref&gt;Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster) 1939:23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, "a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort",&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', "The Minoan belief-system" (Routledge) 1990:125&lt;/ref&gt; whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' ("boy-Zeus"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.

In [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.&lt;ref&gt;Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.&lt;/ref&gt; On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', "the great youth". Ivory statuettes of the "Divine Boy" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period — [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] — so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos" (Castleden 1990:125&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.

The myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).&lt;/ref&gt; together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth" (Dietrich 1973:15).&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion.

====Zeus Lykaios====
{{details|Lykaia}}

[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360–340 BC ([[Cabinet des Médailles]]).]]
The epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' ("wolf-Zeus") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] ("Wolf Mountain"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection&lt;ref&gt;In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]]. Zeus overturned the table and struck the house of Lyceus with a thunderbolt; his patronage at the Lykaia can have been little more than a formula.&lt;/ref&gt; with the rituals and myths of this primitive [[rite of passage]] with an ancient threat of [[cannibalism]] and the possibility of a [[werewolf]] transformation for the [[ephebos|ephebes]] who were the participants.&lt;ref&gt;A morphological connection to ''lyke'' "brightness" may be merely fortuitous.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place&lt;ref&gt;Modern archaeologists have found no trace of human remains among the sacrificial detritus, [[Walter Burkert]], "Lykaia and Lykaion", ''Homo Necans'', tr. by Peter Bing ([[University of California]]) 1983, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' 565d-e&lt;/ref&gt;  a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.

There is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|λύκη}}, "light", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|ἀμφιλύκη}}, "twilight", {{lang|grc|λυκάβας}}, "year" (lit. "light's course") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as "starry-eyed", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional cults of Zeus====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' ("kindly" or "honeyed") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' ("earthy"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' ("under-the-earth") and '''Zeus Plousios''' ("wealth-bringing"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.

In some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' ("the nurturing"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]'''.

===Non-panhellenic cults===

In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men.  With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ''ad Pind. Ol.'' vi. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are listed below. As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''', he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oracles of Zeus===
[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', 1st century AD ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome).]]

Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Baʿal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.

====The Oracle at Dodona====

The cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 14.326-7&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] ("doves") had replaced the male priests.

Zeus's consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] — whose name is a feminine form of "Zeus". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.

====The Oracle at Siwa====
The [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].

Zeus was identified with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'') with various other deities, such as the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[Amun|Ammon]] and the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] [[Tinia]]. He, along with [[Dionysus]], absorbed the role of the chief [[Phrygia]]n god [[Sabazios]] in the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] deity known in Rome as [[Sabazius]]. The Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 6:2&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;David Syme Russel. ''Daniel''. (Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press, 1981) 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zeus and the sun==

Zeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic [[sun god]], [[Helios]], who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus' eye,&lt;ref&gt;Sick, David H. (2004), "Mit(h)ra(s) and the Myths of the Sun", Numen, 51 (4): 432–467, {{JSTOR|3270454}}&lt;/ref&gt; or clearly implied as such. [[Hesiod]], for instance, describes Zeus's eye as effectively the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Ljuba Merlina Bortolani, Magical Hymns from Roman Egypt: A Study of Greek and Egyptian Traditions of Divinity, Cambridge University Press, 13/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; This perception is possibly derived from earlier [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']] (see [[Hvare-khshaeta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin Litchfield|authorlink=Martin Litchfield West|title=Indo-European Poetry and Myth|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-928075-9|url=http://library.globalchalet.net/Authors/Poetry%20Books%20Collection/Indo-European%20Poetry%20and%20Myth.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2017|pages=194–196|ref=harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crete|Cretan]] Zeus [[Talos|Tallaios]] had solar elements to his cult. "Talos" was the local equivalent of Helios.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks 1951:110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zeus in philosophy==

In [[Neoplatonism]], Zeus's relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the [[Demiurge]] or Divine [[nous|Mind]]. Specifically within [[Plotinus]]'s work the ''[[Enneads]]''&lt;ref&gt;In Fourth Tractate 'Problems of the Soul' The Demiurge is identified as Zeus.10. "When under the name of Zeus we are considering the Demiurge we must leave out all notions of stage and progress, and recognize one unchanging and timeless life."&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Platonic Theology'' of [[Proclus]].

==Zeus in the Bible==

Zeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice, first in Acts 14:8–13: When the people living in [[Lystra]] saw the [[Apostle Paul]] heal a lame man, they considered Paul and his partner [[Barnabas]] to be gods, identifying Paul with [[Hermes]] and Barnabas with Zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. Two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchgodsword.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T5958 The translation of Hermes]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the inscriptions refers to the "priests of Zeus", and the other mentions "Hermes Most Great"" and "Zeus the sun-god".&lt;ref&gt;The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, edited by J. Orr, 1960, Vol. III, p. 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second occurrence is in Acts 28:11: the name of the ship in which the prisoner Paul set sail from the island of Malta bore the [[figurehead]] "Sons of Zeus" aka [[Castor and Pollux]].

The deuterocanonical book of [[2 Maccabees]] 6:1, 2 talks of King [[Antiochus IV]] (Epiphanes), who in his attempt to stamp out the Jewish religion, directed that the temple at Jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to Zeus (Jupiter Olympius).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__9-Second-of-Maccabees.html#Chapter%206|title=The Second Book of the Maccabees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Iliad]]'' is a poem by [[Homer]] about the [[Trojan war]] and the battle over the City of [[Troy]].

==Zeus's notable conflicts==
The most notable conflict in Zeus's history was his struggle for power. Zeus's parents [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] ruled the Ancient World after taking control from [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], Cronus's father. When [[Cronus]] realized that he wanted power for the rest of time he started to eat his children, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. When [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] realized what was going on, she quickly saved their youngest child, Zeus. Having escaped, Zeus was spared because of the swiftness of Rhea tricking Cronus into thinking she consumed Zeus. She wrapped a stone in a blanket, and [[Cronus]] swallowed it thinking he was swallowing his last child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zeus|url = http://www.ancient.eu/zeus/|website = Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Zeus was shipped off to live on the island of [[Crete]].

When Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he grew upset with mankind and the sacrifices they were performing on one another. Furiously, he decided it would be smart to wipe out mankind with a gigantic flood using the help of his brother [[Poseidon]], King of the Seas. Killing every human except [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], Zeus flooded the entire planet but then realized he then had to restore society with new people. After clearing all the water, he had Deucalion and Pyrrah create humans to repopulate the earth using stones that became humans. These stones represented the "hardness" of mankind and the man life. This story has been told different ways and in different time periods between Ancient Greek Mythology and The Bible, although the base of the story remains true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Gods|url = http://www.allabouthistory.org/greek-gods.htm|website = AllAboutHistory.org|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history Zeus has used violence to get his way, or even terrorize humans. As god of the sky he has the power to hurl lightning bolts as his weapon of choice. Since lightning is quite powerful and sometimes deadly, it is a bold sign when lightning strikes because it is known that Zeus most likely threw the bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zeus • Facts and Information on Greek God of the Sky Zeus|url = http://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/gods/zeus/|website = Greek Gods &amp; Goddesses|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
