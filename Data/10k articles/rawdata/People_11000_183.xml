      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9538">'''Barent Gardenier''' (July 28, 1776 – January 10, 1822) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer and politician from [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was a [[United States Representative]] from 1807 to 1811.

==Biography==
Barent Gardenier was born in [[Kinderhook, New York]] on July 28, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Hollace Carey Gordinier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSxMAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22barent+gardenier%22+born+1776&amp;dq=%22barent+gardenier%22+born+1776&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=82ZAUpjIHYi89QSsgYHwAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Gardenier: Ephraim Gordinier, 1785-1860: His Ancestors and Descendants Including the First Two Generations of Gardeniers in America] (1990), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a liberal education, studied law at [[Litchfield Law School]]&lt;ref&gt;Marian C. McKenna, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4mdAUoyWB4u49gS6x4CYBw&amp;id=tfqwAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22barent+gardenier%22+litchfield+law+school&amp;q=%22barent+gardenier%22#search_anchor Tapping Reeve and the Litchfield Law School] (1986), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; and was admitted to the bar.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rodman Drake, Fitz-Greene Halleck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1s4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=%22barent+gardenier%22+admitted+bar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LmhAUvG2G4zi8gTY4YHwBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22barent%20gardenier%22%20admitted%20bar&amp;f=false The Croakers] (1860), pp. 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 he married Sally (Sarah) Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Bonaparte Holgate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VUNnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22barent+gardenier%22+sarah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J2lAUsibGZGo9gT1lYCAAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22barent%20gardenier%22%20sarah&amp;f=false American Genealogy: Being a History of Some of the Early Settlers of North America] (1851), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore: Genealogical Pub. Co., [http://genealogytrails.com/ny/ulster/baptisms5.html Baptismal and Marriage Registers of the Old Dutch Church of Kingston, Ulster County, New York, 1660-1809] (1980), submitted to Genealogy Trails by Foxie Hagerty.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardenier practiced in [[Kingston, New York]] and was also editor and publisher of a Federalist newspaper, the ''New York Courier''.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow Weed Barnes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=558MAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22Barent+Gardenier%22+born&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X2RAUuHJHYK88ASr54G4CQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barent%20Gardenier%22%20born&amp;f=false Life of Thurlow Weed Including His Autobiography and a Memoir] (1884), volume 1, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a [[Federalist]] to the [[10th United States Congress|10th]] and [[11th United States Congress]]es, and served from March 4, 1807, to March 3, 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Weed, Parsons and Company, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iD1DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=%22Barent+Gardenier%22+Congress+1807+1811&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iGtAUvvEFoWC8gTQ5YH4Bw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barent%20Gardenier%22%20Congress%201807%201811&amp;f=falseCivil List and Forms of Government of the Colony and State of New York] (1879), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a heated controversy with Senator [[John Armstrong, Jr.|John Armstrong]] relating to the latter's alleged authorship of the famous [[Newburgh conspiracy|Newburgh letters]], anonymous circulars in which the author (presumably Armstrong) had attempted unsuccessfully to instigate [[Continental Army]] soldiers to act against Congress at the end of the [[American Revolution]] in order to secure back pay, pensions and land grants that had been promised but were not immediately forthcoming. Armstrong denied writing the letters, but historians are of the view that Armstrong was the author. By the early 1800s Armstrong was a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] politician and follower of [[Thomas Jefferson]], which caused the Federalist Gardenier to highlight Armstrong's supposed authorship of the Newburgh letters as a campaign issue.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Fredriksen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dM_AIslBqh4C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22john+armstrong%22+newburgh+conspiracy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7G1AUpP3Co-89QTX8YCAAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20armstrong%22%20newburgh%20conspiracy&amp;f=false The United States Army: A Chronology, 1775 to the Present] (2010), p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Judd, editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=apRYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22john+armstrong%22+newburgh+conspiracy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7G1AUpP3Co-89QTX8YCAAg&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20armstrong%22%20newburgh%20conspiracy&amp;f=false The Van Cortlandt Family Papers], 1976, vol. 1, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Edward Skeen, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=om5AUpnpAZTO9ASq3oC4CQ&amp;id=rxJ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+armstrong%22+newburgh+gardenier&amp;q=Gardenier#search_anchor John Armstrong, Jr., 1758-1843: A Biography] (1981), pp. 48 and 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808 Gardenier fought a [[duel]] with [[George W. Campbell]], a congressman from [[Tennessee]], resulting from Gardenier's opposition to the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] administration's [[Embargo Act of 1807|trade embargo]] with [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. Campbell was angered at Gardenier's speech, and in Gardenier's view included personal insults in his rebuttal speech. Gardenier challenged Campbell, and their duel was notable as being the first to be fought on what became the [[Bladensburg Dueling Grounds]]. Gardenier was wounded, but subsequently recovered and won reelection.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Buel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cqcGDHOMh9oC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=gardenier+campbell+duel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bm9AUtXpGom49QTxrICACg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=gardenier%20campbell%20duel&amp;f=false America on the Brink] (2005), p. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Chamberlain, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FF1GmybMOZoC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=gardenier+campbell+duel+bladensburg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fnBAUoiGOIa49QTz3YD4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gardenier%20campbell%20duel%20bladensburg&amp;f=false Pistols, Politics and the Press: Dueling in 19th Century American Journalism] (2009), p 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper &amp; Brothers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SzSV2jeAhwMC&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=gardenier+campbell+duel+first+bladensburg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wHBAUtqgJono8gSp4IGQBA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=gardenier%20campbell%20duel%20first%20bladensburg&amp;f=false Harper's Encyclopedia of United States History from 458 A. D. to 1909] (1905), vol. 1, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1813 to 1815, Gardenier was [[District Attorney]] of the First District which included [[New York County, New York|New York]], [[Queens County, New York|Queens]], [[Kings County, New York|Kings]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]], [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] Counties.&lt;ref&gt;John Thomas Scharf, editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EkgVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA653&amp;dq=%22barent+gardenier%22+%22first+district%22+new+york&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_3JAUpHkJYKs9ATS6IG4DA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22barent%20gardenier%22%20%22first%20district%22%20new%20york&amp;f=false History of Westchester County, New York] (1925), vol. 1, part 2, p. 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardenier died in [[New York City]] on January 10, 1822.&lt;ref&gt;New York Newspaper Death Notice Extracts, 1801-1890 (Barber Collection), entry for Barent Gardenier, retrieved via Ancestry.com, September 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale Cemetery Inscriptions, 1675-1934, entry for Barent Gardenier, retrieved via Ancestry.com, September 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at Kingston's First Reformed Church.

[[File:Goya - Que viene el coco (Here Comes the Bogey-Man).jpg|thumb|[[Goya]]'s ''Que viene el Coco'' ("Here Comes the Bogeyman / The Boogeyman is Coming") c. 1797]]

'''Bogeyman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|g|i|m|æ|n|,_|ˈ|b|ʊ|g|i|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Safire|first=William| authorlink = William Safire|title=Bogeyman or boogeyman? If mispronounced, he's gonna getcha!|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/02/01/2003097080|work=[[New York Times News Service]]|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=1 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually spelled '''boogeyman''' in the U.S.; also spelled '''bogieman''' or '''boogie man'''; see [[American and British English spelling differences]]) is a common allusion to a mythical creature in many cultures used by adults to frighten children into good behaviour. This [[monster]] has no specific appearance, and conceptions about it can vary drastically from household to household within the same community; in many cases, it has no set appearance in the mind of an adult or child, but is simply a non-specific embodiment of terror. Parents may tell their children that if they misbehave, the bogeyman will get them. Bogeymen may target a specific mischief—for instance, a bogeyman that punishes children who [[thumb sucking|suck their thumbs]]—or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving. In some cases, the bogeyman is a [[nickname]] for the [[Devil]].  Bogeyman tales vary by region. The bogeyman is usually a masculine entity, but can be of any gender, or simply be [[Androgyny|androgynous]].&lt;ref&gt;Shimabukuro, Karra (2014). "The Bogeyman of Your Nightmares: Freddy Krueger's Folkloric Roots". ''Studies in Popular Culture'', '''36''' (2), 45–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|bogey}}
The word ''bogey'' is believed to be derived from the [[Middle English]] ''bogge'' / ''bugge'' ("something frightening", "scarecrow"). Theories on its origin include a root meaning "goat", or a cognate of the [[German language|German]] ''bögge'', ''böggel-mann'' ("goblin"). It could be influenced in meaning by Old English -budda used in compounds for "beetle". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/bug&lt;/ref&gt;

A related word, ''[[bugbear]]'', from ''bug'', meaning goblin or scarecrow, and ''[[bear]]'', was imagined as a demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, and was also used to mean a general object of dread.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bugbear}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:bug-a-boo|bugaboo]]'', with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of ''bugbear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bugaboo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other putative origins===
In [[Southeast Asia]], the term is popularly supposed to refer to [[Bugis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Indonesia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012600613.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-10-17 |first=John |last=Auchard | authorlink = John Auchard |date=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bugis|Buganese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |title=The Buginese of Sulawesi |accessdate=2007-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102743/http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pirates]], ruthless seafarers of southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]'s third-largest island. These pirates often plagued early English and Dutch trading ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and [[Dutch East India Company]]. It is popularly believed that this resulted in the European sailors bringing their fear of the "bugi men" back to their home countries. However, etymologists disagree with this, because words relating to ''bogeyman'' were in common use centuries before European colonization of Southeast Asia.

In [[Luo dialects]] in Eastern Africa the term 'bwogo' (with pronunciation sound like 'booga') means to scare. This correlation is most likely spurious as [[Nilotic language]] roots predate the modern concept of civilization itself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Analogues in other cultures==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Bogeyman-like beings are almost universal, common to the folklore of many countries.

===Sack Man===
{{Main article|Sack Man}}
In many countries, a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. This is true for many Latin countries, such as [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the countries of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], where he is referred to as ''el "Hombre del costal"'', ''el "hombre del saco"'', or in Portuguese, ''o "homem do saco"'' (all of which mean "the sack/bag man"), or el roba-chicos, meaning ''child-stealer''. Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian ''Torbalan'', "sack man"), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.

===El Coco===
{{Main article|Coco (folklore)}}
El Coco (also ''El Cuco'' and ''Cucuy'', sometimes called ''El Bolo'') is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries.

In [[Spain]], parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, ''El Coco'' will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning. [[Coconut]]s (Spanish: ''coco'') received that name because their brownish hairy surface reminded Portuguese explorers of ''coco'', a ghost with a pumpkin head. Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is usually quite different, commonly mixed with native beliefs, and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States. However, the term ''El Coco'' is also used in Spanish-speaking [[Latin America]]n countries, such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Venezuela]], although there it is more usually called ''El Cuco'', as in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. Among Mexican-Americans, ''El Cucuy'' is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so. However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes ''El cucuy'' as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. "Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not," Medrano said, citing [[Xavier Garza]]'s 2004 book ''Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/ts_comments.php?id=P67839_0_10_0_C "El cucuy has roots deep in border folklore"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazilian folklore, a similar character called ''Cuca'' is depicted as a female humanoid alligator. There's a famous lullaby sung by most parents to their children that says that the ''Cuca'' will come to get them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The ''Cuca'' is also a character of [[Monteiro Lobato]]'s ''[[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]]'', a series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of characters from Brazilian folklore.

===Babau===
{{Redirect|Babau}}

In the countries of central and eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as "babau" (or "baubau", "baobao", "bavbav", or similar). In [[Italy]], the Babau (in Romania, Bau-bau) is also called ''l'uomo nero'' (Romanian: ''omul negru'') or "black man". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: "Here comes ''l'uomo nero''! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: "Ninna nanna ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo darò all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero." (English: "Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year")  ''L'uomo nero'' is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filastrocche.it/nostalgici/ninne/ninna5.htm|title=Ninna Nanna, Ninna oh|work=filastrocche.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Slovenia]], the "Bavbav" is described as a formless spirit. In [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], the equivalent of the Bogeyman is known as ''Baboulas'' ({{lang-el|Μπαμπούλας}}). Typically, he is said to be hiding under the bed, although the details of his story are adapted by the parents in a variety of ways.  In [[Egypt]] "al-Bu'bu'" (البعبع) is often depicted as a night creature dressed in black who haunts children that misbehave.

===Butzemann===
Germanic folklore has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil) and are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at water bodies, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the ''[[:de:Butzemann|Butzemann]]'', which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the ''Buhmann'' (who is mostly proverbial) and ''der schwarze Mann'' ("the black man"), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game [[:de:Wer hat Angst vorm Schwarzen Mann?|"Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?"]] ("Who is afraid of the bogeyman?").

In [[Denmark]], the creature is known as the ''bussemand'' or ''bøhmand''. It hides under the bed and grabs children who will not sleep. As in the English equivalent, ''bussemand'' is also a slang term for nasal mucus. In [[Norway]], he is referred to as the ''Busemann''. In the [[Netherlands]], the ''Boeman'' is portrayed as a creature that resembles a man, dressed completely black, with sharp claws and fangs. He hides under the bed or in the closet. The Bogeyman takes bad children or those that refuse to sleep and locks them in his basement for a period of time.

In the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, used in those areas of Pennsylvania colonized by Swiss and Germanic peoples during the eighteenth century, "der Butzemann" is the term for a male scarecrow. A female scarecrow is a "Butzefrau".

*[[Bahamas]] – "Small man" is the name given to a man who rides in a cart drawn by itself and picks up any child seen outside after sundown; the term "rollin' cart" has been used to scare children who misbehave. Anyone taken by the small man becomes a small person and has to ride on the back of his cart with him forever.
*[[Belgium]] – A faceless bogeyman called "[[Oude Rode Ogen]]" ("Old Red Eyes") was known throughout the Flanders region and said to originate in [[Mechelen]]. It is said to have been a cannibalistic [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] that was able to change between human form and that of a black dog. It later became a children's story in the early 1900s called "The Nikker", in which the creature devoured young children who stayed up past their bedtime.
*[[Belize]] – ''[[Tata Duende]]'' is a mythical [[goblin]] described as being of small stature, with a beard, wrinkles, backwards feet, a large brimmed hat, and lacking thumbs. It is a protector of the forests and animals and was used to scare children from going out to play at night or going into the jungle.
*In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], the Bogeyman is called ''Babaroga'', ''baba'' meaning ''old woman'' and ''rogovi'' meaning ''horns'', literally meaning ''old woman with horns''. The details vary from one household to another. In one version, ''babaroga'' takes children, [[sack Man|puts them in a sack]], and then, when it comes to its cave, eats them. In another version, it takes children and pulls them up through tiny holes in the ceiling.
*[[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]] – A monster more akin to the Bogeyman is called ''Bicho Papão'' ("Eating Beast") or ''Sarronco'' ("Deep-Voiced Man"). A notable difference between it and the ''homem do saco'' is that the latter is a daytime menace and "Bicho Papão" is a nighttime menace. Another important difference is that "Homem do Saco" usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization, while "Bicho Papão" scares naughty children and hides under their beds.
*[[Bulgaria]] – In some villages, people used to believe that a hairy, dark, ghost-like creature called a ''talasam'' (Ta-lah-SUMM) lived in the shadows of the barn or in the attic and came out at night to scare little children. 
*[[Canada]]:
**[[Quebec]] – in this French-speaking province of Canada, the ''Bonhomme Sept-Heures'' ("7 o'clock man") is said to visit houses around 7 o'clock to take misbehaving children who will not go to bed back to his cave where he feasts on them.
**[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] – The "Old Hag" is a demonic entity from Newfoundland folklore. According to legend, the Old Hag appears in the bedrooms of naughty children late at night and suffocates them by sitting on their stomachs. The Old Hag then takes the children to her lair in the woods where she eats their bodies. Supposedly, the myth of the Old Hag was inspired by experiences caused by [[Sleep Paralysis]], in which an individual would awake to the hallucination of an old woman sitting on them, cutting off their breathing.
**[[Yukon]] – "Quankus" is a bogeyman-like creature that places naughty children in a large sock and carries them away, particularly at night. Children are typically threatened with the Quankus to encourage them to go to bed.
**In [[Inuit mythology]], there is a [[shapeshifting]] creature called the [[Ijiraq (mythology)|Ijiraq]], that kidnaps children, to hide them away and abandon them. If the children can convince the Ijiraq to let them go, they can use [[inukshuk]] of stone to find their way home. Also from Inuit Mythology there is the [[Qalupalik]], which are human-like creatures with long fingernails, green skin, and long hair that live in the sea. They carry babies and children away in their [[Amauti]], if they disobey their parents and wander off alone. The Qalupalik adopt the children and bring them to live with them underwater.
*[[DR Congo|Congo]] – In the [[Lingala language|Lingala]] language, the ''Dongola Miso'' or "Creature with Scary Eyes" is used to discourage children from staying up beyond bedtime. It is also used to warn children or even adults about the potential danger in speaking to or dealing with strangers.
*[[China]] – "Ou-wu" is usually described as a witch or a scary woman who kidnaps children who misbehave. It is popular among southern regions of China and places like Hong Kong. The origin of the term is a pronoun for "monster" and it is widely used as a synonym for "ugly" or "hideous" even today.
*[[Cyprus]] – In the Cypriot dialect, the Bogeyman is called Kkullas (Κκουλλάς); a man (vaguely described as hooded and/or deformed) who will put misbehaving children in a bag and take them away from their homes.
*[[Czech Republic]] – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in the Czech Republic is bubák or ''[[:cs:Strašidlo|strašidlo]]''.
*[[Egypt]] – The "Abu Rigl Maslukha" (ابو رجل مسلوخة), which translates to the "Man With Burnt/Skinned Leg". It is a very scary story that parents tell their children when they misbehave. The "Abu Rigl Maslukha" is a monster that got burnt when he was a child because he did not listen to his parents. He grabs naughty children to cook and eat them.

*[[Finland]] – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in Finland is ''mörkö'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Mårran''). The most famous usage of the word these days takes place in [[Moomin]]-stories (originally written in Swedish) in which ''mörkö'' ([[the Groke]]) is a large, frightening, dark blue, ghost-like creature. The children's game "Kuka pelkää Mustaa Pekkaa?" ("Who's Afraid of Black Peter?") was also commonly played among children through to the 1960s and '70s, especially in urban settings, as a backyard game (see Germany's "Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?").
*[[France]] – The French equivalent of the Bogeyman is ''le croque-mitaine'' ("the [[mitten]]-biter" or rather "the hand-cruncher"—''mitaine'' means mitt in an informal way).&lt;ref&gt;Edouard Brasey, L'encyclopédie du merveilleux, T3 : Des peuples de l'ombre, Le Pré aux Clercs, 2006, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] – In addition to a "Bag Man" very similar to its namesakes from other cultures, in Georgia, a fictional creature called "Bua" is sometimes used by parents to (lightly) scare little children (up to preschool age) when misbehaving; e.g., "If you don't eat well now, Bua will come", or "Do you hear Bua knocking? It asks why you don't want to go to bed." It's usually not specified what Bua looks like or what it does to children; nevertheless, Bua can "bite you", or "take you away". It also can "steal" something: "You can't have more candies now—Bua took them." There may be an etymological link to "bu", the Georgian word for owl, which makes night sounds scary to children.
*[[Germany]] – The Bogeyman is known as ''Der schwarze Mann'' ("the black man"). "Schwarz" does not refer to the color of his skin (most Germans had never met a real black person during the time these legends developed), but to his preference for hiding in dark places, like the closet, under the beds of children, or in forests at night. There is also an active game for little children which is called ''Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?'' ("Who is afraid of the black man?"), and an old traditional folk song ''Es tanzt ein Bi-Ba-Butzemann in unserm Haus herum'' ("A Bi-Ba-Bogeyman Dances Around in Our House").
*[[Greece]] – In Greek, the common translation of "Bogeyman" is "Baboulas" (Μπαμπούλας), which is pronounced babʊlas. It's used by the parents to scare their children so they won't misbehave, probably. This creature is supposed to be some kind of cannibal that eats the children. That's why the most used phrase about the creature is "Ο Μπαμπούλας θα έρθει και θα σε φάει", which means "The Bogeyman will come and eat you".
*[[Guyana]] – In Guyana, the "Bogeyman" is known as a "Jumbi". It is a popular belief that he only lives in the dark. It is said that he lives in the closet and under the bed. He is used to scare children to eat their food, so they can defend themselves against him. "Jumbies" eat little boys and girls, starting with the leg, and ending with the brains.
*[[Haiti]] – In Haiti, there is a popular belief that a tall man, with legs two floors high, walks around the towns at midnight to catch and eat the people that stay outside. He is called Mètminwi, which seems to be a contraction of mèt (from French "maître", English "master", and minwi from French "minuit", English "midnight", hence meaning the "master of midnight").
**[[Tonton Macoute]] or Uncle Gunnysack was a Haitian bogeyman who would snare misbehaving children and eat them for breakfast. The [[Tonton Macoute|MVSN]], a secret police force of Haiti, used this myth as a tool for control as many Tonton Macoutes were [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] adherents. 
**[[François Duvalier|Papa Doc]] was an alter-ego of Former Haitian President Francois Duvalier. He parlayed Haitian mythology and presented himself as [[Baron Samedi]] the Voodoo Loa of Death. His fashion was designed to enforce the mystique of his personality cult, as he dressed like Baron Samedi and hid his eyes with sunglasses.
*[[Hejaz]], [[Saudi Arabia]] – ''أمنا الغولة والدوجيرة'' or "Dojairah and Umna al Ghola", which means "Our mother the Monster", is used to scare children when they misbehave or walk alone outside.
*[[Hungary]] –  The Hungarian equivalent of the Bogeyman is the ''Mumus'', which is a monster-like creature, and the ''Zsákos Ember'', a man with a sack, which is the literal meaning of his name. A third creature is the ''Rézfaszú bagoly'' ("Copperpenis Owl"), a giant owl with a copper penis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0xAAAAIAAJ | title=A mágia | publisher=Magvető | author=Makra, Sándor | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iceland]] – The Icelandic equivalent of the Bogeyman is [[Grýla]], a female troll who would take misbehaving children and eat them during [[Christmas Eve]]. However, as the story goes, she has been dead for some time. She is also the mother of the [[Yule Lads]], the Icelandic equivalent of [[Santa Claus]].
*[[India]] – In India, the entity is known by different names.
**[[Urdu]] speaking population refer to the bogeyman-like creature by names such as ''[[Shaitan]]/[[Shaytaan]]'', ''Bhoot'', ''Jin Baba'', which mean satan, ghost, Djinn respectively.
**[[Hindi]] speaking population refer to the bogeyman-like creature as ''Baba'' and ''Bhoot''.
**[[Bihar]]  – Parents use the demon name ''Bhakolwa'' for this purpose. The terms ''Petona'' and ''Kaatu'' are also used.
**[[South India]] – In [[Karnataka]], the demon "Goggayya" (roughly meaning 'terrible man') can be treated as counterpart of the bogeyman. In the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], children are often mock-threatened with the ''Rettai Kannan'' (the two-eyed one) or ''Poochaandi'' (பூச்சாண்டி), a monster or fearsome man that children are sometimes threatened with if they are not obedient or refuse to eat. In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the equivalent of the bogeyman is ''Boochodu''. In central [[Kerala]], the bogeyman is referred to as "Kokkachi", who will "take away" children for disobeying their parents or misbehaving in any manner. In South Kerala, the bogeyman is called "Oochandi". Among Konkani-speaking people of the Western Coast of India, "Gongo" is the Bogeyman equivalent.
**Among [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language speaking people (predominantly of [[Maharashtra]]), parents threaten the misbehaving children with a male ghost called "Bāgul Buā" (बागुल बुवा). In general, the "Buā" is supposed to kidnap children when they misbehave or do not sleep.
*[[Indonesia]] – In Indonesia, [[Wewe Gombel]] is a ghost that kidnaps children mistreated by their parents. She keeps the children in her nest atop an ''[[Arenga pinnata]]'' palm tree and does not harm them. She takes care of the children as a grandmother until the parents become aware of what they have done. If the parents decide to mend their ways and truly want their children back, Wewe Gombel will return them unharmed. This ghost is named Wewe Gombel because it originated in an event that took place in Bukit Gombel, [[Semarang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariapriskamarvina.wordpress.com/2011/12/|title=Desember - 2011 - mariapriskamarvina|work=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iran]] – In [[Persian people|Persian]] culture, children who misbehave may be told by their parents to be afraid of ''lulu'' (لولو) who eats up the naughty children. Lulu is usually called ''lulu-khorkhore'' (bogeyman who eats everything up). The threat is generally used to make small children eat their meals.
*[[Iraq]]'s ancient folklore has the ''saalua'', a half-witch half-demon ghoul that "is used by parents to scare naughty children". She is briefly mentioned in a tale of the [[One Thousand and One Nights|1001 Nights]], and is known in some other Persian Gulf countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=61135 ‘Ghoul’ re-emerges in Iraq]. Sep 5, 2013 news article.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Italy]] – In Italy, "L'uomo nero" (meaning "the black man") is a demon that can appear as a black man or black ghost without legs, often used by adults for scaring their children when they don't want to sleep. In some parts of the country, it's known also as "[[:it:babau|babau]]".&lt;ref name=Tidona&gt;{{cite web|last=Tidona|first=Carmelo Massimo|title=L'Uomo Nero (Boogeyman)|url=http://www.latelanera.com/mostri-creature-leggendarie/creatura-leggendaria.asp?id=222|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=circular referencing|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stampalibera.com/?p=3585|title=Stampalibera - Home|author=olmis|work=stampalibera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Marabbecca]] is a malevolent water monster from the mythology of [[Sicily]] that lived in wells and reservoirs and was said to come up and drag children that played too close down into the water to drown.
*[[Japan]] – ''[[Namahage]]'' are demons that warn children not to be lazy or cry, during the Namahage Sedo Matsuri, or "Demon Mask Festival", when villagers don demon masks and pretend to be these spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto Yoshiko: The Namahage: a festival in the northeast of Japan. Institute for the Study of Human Issues, Philadelphia 1978, {{ISBN|0-915980-66-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Korea]] – ''Mangtae harabeoji,'' ([[:ko:망태 할아버지|망태 할아버지]]) which translates to "Straw sack grandpa," is an old man that puts misbehaving children into his straw sac and takes them away.
*[[Lithuania]] – referred to as the [[Baubas]], an evil spirit with long lean arms, wrinkly fingers and red eyes. He harasses people by pulling their hair or stifling them.
*[[Luxembourg]] – ''De béise Monni'' (the evil uncle), ''De Kropemann'' (the hookman), ''De Bö'', and ''de schwaarze Mann'' (the black man) are Luxembourg's equivalents of the Bogeyman. Luxembourg's many variations of the bogeyman may be the result of its strong cultural attachment to its neighbour countries due to the country's small size. The Kropemann lives in the sewerage and uses his hook to catch children by the nose if they stand too close to a storm drain, drawing them down to him.  Parents warn their naughty children that the ''béise Monni'' alias ''Bö'' alias ''schwaarze Mann'', will come to take them away if they don't behave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kropemann.lu/ kropemann], kropemann.lu&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] – Apart from babaroga, Macedonian people have a bogeyman called Strasilo (which means something like "frightener" because "strav" means [[fear]]/[[scare]]) which only comes out at night, hides under beds, in [[forests]], [[caves]], [[basements]], etc. It is said to grab and eat children (usually bad ones).
*[[Malaysia]] – in the East Coast state of Kelantan the word  "Mmugo" is used to describe the unknown entity to scare children and teenagers. Mmugo doesn't have any specific shape or appearance and could be anything from unknown savage animals or mythical creatures. Sometimes the word Mmugo is also use to refer unknown animals that caused damage to crops and fruits in the orchards.
*[[Malta]] – Kaw Kaw or Gaw Gaw, was a grey, slimy creature that roamed the streets at night. It could smell a person's guilt and enter their homes, through cracks and fissures, by extending and contracting its snail-like body. Once it was inside their rooms, it would flash them a ghastly grin, with its huge, toothless mouth, scaring them witless. 
*[[Mexico]] – There is the ''Robaniños'' ("kidnapper of kids"), a person with whom a child is warned about going out without supervision.
*[[Myanmar]] – Children are threatened with ''Pashu Gaung Phyat'' ({{my|ပသျှူးခေါင်းဖြတ်}}), meaning Malayu [[headhunting|Headhunter]]. In Burmese, [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] were called "Pashu", which may come from ''[[Bajau]]'' or ''[[Bugis]]''. Even [[Peninsular Malaysia]] was called Pashu Peninsula. It is common knowledge that some ethnic groups in Eastern Malaysia, [[Iban people|Iban]] and [[Dayak people|Dayak]], were notorious headhunters. Although the [[Va people|Wa]] tribe of Burma was famous through to the 1970s as ferocious headhunters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101021216/story.html Soldiers of Fortune], TIME Asia&lt;/ref&gt; it is a mystery why Burmese use the faraway Pashus as bogeymen.
[[File:Gurumapa eating rice.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[Itum Bahal]], [[Kathmandu]] showing Gurumapa]]
*[[Nepal]] – In Nepali, a popular bogeyman character is the 'hau-guji'. Among the [[Newar]]s, the "[[Gurumapa]]" is a mythological ape-like creature who was supposed to enjoy devouring children. Itum Bahal of inner [[Kathmandu]] and the Tinkhya open space in front of the Bhadrakali temple in the centre of Kathmandu are associated with the fable of Gurumapa.&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary Shepherd (1982). ''Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691031282}}, 9780691031286. Page 364.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pakistan]] – The Mamma is a large apelike creature that lives in the mountains and ventures forth to kidnap young girls. He will carry them back to his cave where he licks their palms and the soles of their feet which makes them permanently unable to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Claus, Sarah Diamond and Margaret Mills (2015) [2003]. ''South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia''. Routledge. p. 375. {{ISBN|0415866928}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Panama]] – In Panama, children are warned that if they are naughty, La Tulivieja will come to get them. She was a spirit who was cursed by [[God]] for drowning her child, and transformed into a hideous monster with a pockmarked face, long and bristly hair, clawed hands, a cat's body and hooved feet. She was also cursed to forever look for her drowned child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparent.com/learn-spanish/articles/oct_99.html|title=Read Spanish Language Articles to Help You Learn Spanish|work=transparent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippines]] – ''[[Pugot]]'' (only in most [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] regions), ''[[Sipay]]'', ''Mamu'', or ''Mumu''. In [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] culture it is known as the ''[[Mánguang Anak]]'' or the ''Child-Snatcher''.
*[[Poland]] – ''"Baba Jaga"'' or ''"Muma"'' is a monster (often portrayed as a witch living in the forest) that kidnaps badly behaving children and presumably eats them. It is referenced in a children's game of the same name, which involves one child being blindfolded, and other children trying to avoid being caught.
*[[Roman Republic]] – The military successes of [[Hannibal]] Barca's Campaign on the Italian Peninsula during the [[Second Punic War]] had caused so much damage and distress to the Romans that mothers began to threaten their children with brutal tales of Hannibal and warnings of being taken away by Hannibal if they misbehaved, making him the Roman Bogeyman by definition.
*[[Russia]] – Children are warned that Babayka (or [[Baba Yaga]]) will come for them at night if they behave badly.
*[[Saudi Arabia]] – ''Abu Shalawlaw'' (أبو شلولو) is a Bogeyman-like creature said by parents to come to eat children who are disobedient, e.g. by not going to sleep on time or not completing their homework. 
*[[Scotland]]:
**Misbehaving children were warned that a goblin or demon known as the [[bodach]] would come down the chimney and take them.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1976), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
**The [[each-uisge]] is the Scottish version of the [[water horse]], a monster that lives in seas and [[lochs]] and usually takes the form of a horse. A [[cautionary tale]] tells how the each-uisge persuaded seven little girls to get on its back before carrying them into the water to be devoured.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1976), pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Serbia]] – ''Bauk'' is an animal-like mythical creature in Serbian mythology. Bauk is described as hiding in dark places, holes or abandoned houses, waiting to grab, carry away, and devour its victim; it can be scared away by light and noise. It has clumsy gait (bauljanje), and its onomatopoeia is bau (Serbian pronunciation: [bau]).
*[[Singapore]] – The locals have a similar reference to the Bogeyman, typically told to young children as "Ah Bu Neh Neh", or in some cases, "Matah", catching them when they are guilty of naughty acts. Although "Matah" actually stands for "Mata-Mata" in Malay, which means a spy or spies, it is generally used by the locals as a nickname for the police. 
*[[South Africa]] – The [[Tokoloshe]] or Tikoloshe is a dwarfish creature of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] mythology conjured up by [[sangoma]]s (traditional healers). It wanders around causing mischief and frightening children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africasacountry.com/2014/01/we-send-our-tokoloshe-to-battle-with-those-trying-to-make-us-forget-the-atrocities-of-marikana/ "We send our Tokoloshe to battle with those trying to make us forget the atrocities of Marikana"] ''africasacountry.com.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described as a small, muscular, hairy [[familiar spirit|witch-familiar]] with an unusually large penis. It may visit women in their dreams and sexually assault them.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, Philip and Yankah, Kwesi (2004). ''African Folklore: An Encyclopedia''. Routledge. p. 202. {{ISBN|0-415-93933-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Spain]] – ''El ogro'' (the Spanish word for [[ogre]]) is a shapeless figure, sometimes a hairy monster, that hides in closets or under beds and eats children that misbehave when they are told to go to bed. ''El [[Sacamantecas]]'' ("Fat extractor" in Spanish) is a kind of bogeyman or criminal characterized by killing for human fat and has been used to scare children into behaving. 
*[[Sweden]] – In Sweden, there is no counterpart to the Bogeyman. The common reference to ''Monstret under sängen'', which essentially means "the monster under the bed", refers to children's own excuses for not being able to go to sleep.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} ''Näcken'' and ''Brunnsgubben'' were previously used to scare children away from wells and dangerous water.
*[[Switzerland]] – In Switzerland, the Bogeyman is called ''Böllima'' or ''[[Böögg]]'' (''pron.''{{IPA|ˈbøk}}) and has an important role in the springtime ceremonies. The figure is the symbol of winter and death, so in the [[Sechseläuten]] ceremony in the City of [[Zürich]], a figure of the [[Böögg]] is burnt. In Southern Switzerland, people have the same traditions as in Italy.
*[[Taiwan]] – Among Minnan Taiwanese, ''Grandmother Tiger'' (虎姑婆 / Hóo-koo-pô) is a figure used to scare disobedient children.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh}}[http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/index.html 虎姑婆], ''twblg.dict.edu.tw''. 28-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Trinidad and Tobago]] – Most Trinbagonians (mostly in the rural demographic) use folklore to scare disobedient children. The most common word that is used is [[Jumbie]]. Some "jumbies" are the [[Soucouyant]], [[Lagahoo]], [[La Diabless]], [[Papa Bois]], etc. "Bogeyman" is also used in the same context as its origin but by mostly urbanised citizens, and it can also can be called "The Babooman".
*[[Turkey]] – The "Öcü" ({{IPA-tr|/ø.d͡ʒy/|}}) is an equivalent monster in Turkish culture. Much like its English language counterpart, the form, powers, or even general temperament of the creature is undefined to the degree that it is unclear whether the word refers to a single being or a category or species of mythological creatures.  Perhaps appropriately, the Öcü does not appear in traditional stories or folklore as a character, but is more relegated to the role of convenient parenting tool used by parents to get children to behave. The short and easy-to-pronounce nature of the word helps younger children learn and express the idea easily, in contrast to mythological figures with longer, more complicated names like ghosts ("hayalet") or the giant wandering ghoul known as "Gulyabani". The name "Öcü" is believed to be the corrupted form of the imported Arabic word al-jinnī (الجني), which is anglicized as [[Genie]] – the supernatural creatures in early Arabian and later Islamic mythology and theology, often described as beings created from a "smokeless" and "scorching fire".  While genies exist in Turkish folklore as "cin" ({{IPA-tr|/d͡ʒin/|}}, singular) ("cinler", {{IPA-tr|/d͡ʒinˈleɾ/|}}, plural), they are separate beings from the Öcü. 
*[[Ukraine]] – ''Babay'' is a monster who is believed to punish naughty children. 
*[[United Arab Emirates]] – Children were scared with (''Om Al- Khadar wa Alleef'') ('''أم الخضر واللّيف''') which means (''Mother of green and leef "bark"''), which takes the appearance of a tall woman with very long hair that flows in the wind. This name is used both in the [[UAE]] and in some neighboring countries like [[Bahrain]]. This mythical creature is usually used by parents to make their children stay inside after sunset and go to sleep (scaring them with her). The name was inspired by the [[Palm tree]] because of the scary sounds that come out of it when the wind blows, and also because it's high and its leaves are so long that it resembles a woman.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
*[[United States]] – The Bogeyman may be called "Boogerman" or "Boogermonster" in rural areas of the [[American South]] ("[[Dried nasal mucus|booger]]" being the American English equivalent of the British English "bogey"), and was most often used to keep young children from playing outside past dark, or wandering off in the forest. During the [[Green Corn Ceremony|Corn Festival]], young [[Cherokee]] males wearing caricature masks would make fun of politicians, frighten children into being good, and shake their masks at young women and chase them around. Male participants in this "[[Booger Dance]]" were referred to as the "Booger Men".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120722020938/http://www.cherokeeheritagemuseum-gallery.org/Friends.html Cherokee Heritage Museum and Gallery, Friends] "The Meaning behind the Booger Dance Masks", by Dr. R. Michael Abram.&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Midwestern]] states, the boogeyman scratches at the window. In Eastern [[Iowa]] he is called the Korn Stalker &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2015/10/haunted-corn-mazes-hayrides/|title=13 Creepy Corn Mazes and Haunted Hayrides - Modern Farmer|date=27 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pacific Northwest]], he may manifest in "green fog". In other places he hides or appears from under the bed or in the closet and tickles children when they go to sleep at night, while in others he is a tall figure in a black hooded cloak who [[Sack Man|puts children in a sack]]. It is said that a [[wart]] can be transmitted to someone by the boogeyman.&lt;ref name="McNab"&gt;McNab, Chris(Chris McNab). ''Ancient Legends/Folklore''. New York: Scholastic, Inc., 2007.

**The [[Jersey Devil]], which originated in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] of [[New Jersey]] in the early 18th century, was originally described as having a horse's head, bat wings, cloven hooves, and a serpent's tail. Regarding the famous Jersey Devil sightings of 1909, [[Loren Coleman]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] offered the explanation that they were part of an elaborate real estate hoax, used by developers as a boogeyman figure to frighten residents into selling their property at lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Loren and Clark, Jerome (1999).

**[[Bloody Bones]], also known as Rawhead or Tommy Rawhead, is a boogeyman of the American South.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Gomes Cassidy]] and Joan Houston Hall (1985). ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawhead and Bloody Bones are sometimes regarded as two individual creatures or two separate parts of the same monster. One is a bare skull that bites its victims and its companion is a dancing headless skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deepsouthmag.com/2014/10/17/bloody-bones-a-history-of-southern-scares/ "Bloody Bones: A History of Southern Scares"] ''Deep South Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody Bones tales originated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Elizabeth Mary (1913).

**The Nalusa Falaya ("Long Black Being") is a ghost being of [[Choctaw mythology]] described as a tall spindly humanoid that can slither like a snake or become a shadow. It may frighten children from staying out too late and can bewitch hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/morelegends/nalusa-falaya.htm|title=Nalusa Falaya (Long Black Being)|work=native-languages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Cipelahq (or Chebelakw) is a dangerous bird spirit of [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]] folklore, used in stories to scare children into obeying their parents. Chebelakw has an unearthly cry and resembles a large diving owl, with only its head and talons visible. Similar monsters called Stinkini and Big Owl were found in [[Seminole]] and [[Apache]] mythologies, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/cipelahq.htm|title=Cipelahq (Chebelakw)|work=native-languages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Briton Rivière''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (14 August 1840 in [[London]]{{snd}}20 April 1920 in [[London]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://ann-lauren.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/19-20th-cent-briton-riviere.html Ann Lauren: Biography of Rivière]&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[artist]] of [[Huguenot]] descent. He exhibited a variety of paintings at the [[Royal Academy]], but devoted much of his life to animal paintings.

==Biography==
Briton's father, [[William Rivière]] (1806–1876), was for some years drawing-master at [[Cheltenham College]], and then an art teacher at the [[University of Oxford]]. Briton was educated at Cheltenham College and Oxford, where he took his degree in 1867. For his art training he was indebted almost entirely to his father.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Riviere, Briton |volume=23 |page=387  }} This cites [[Walter Armstrong (art historian)|Sir Walter Armstrong]], "Briton Riviere, R.A.: His Life and Work", ''Art Annual'' (1891).&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal uncle [[Henry Parsons Rivière]] (1811–1888) was also a noted watercolourist, exhibiting works at the [[Royal Watercolour Society]], London and the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]].

His first pictures appeared at the [[British Institution]], and in 1857 he exhibited three works at the [[Royal Academy]], but it was not until 1863 that he became a regular contributor to the Academy exhibitions. In that year he was represented by ''The eve of the [[Spanish Armada]]'', and in 1864 by a ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. However, subjects of this kind did not attract him long, for in 1865 he began, with ''Sleeping Deerhound'', a series of paintings of animal-subjects which occupied much of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In a lengthy interview in ''[[Chums Boys Annual]]'', entitled "How I paint animals", Rivière explained some of the practicalities of painting both tame and wild animals:

{{quote|I have always been a great lover of dogs but I have worked at them so much that I've grown tired of having them about me. However, you can never paint a dog unless you are fond of it. I never work from a dog without the assistance of a man who is well acquainted with animals ... Collies, I think, are the most restless dogs ...[[greyhounds]] are also very restless, and so are [[fox terriers]] ... The only way to paint wild animals is to gradually accumulate a large number of studies and a great knowledge of the animal itself, before you can paint its picture ... I paint from dead animals as well as from live ones. I have had the body of a fine lioness in my studio ... I have done a great deal of work in the dissecting rooms at the Zoological Gardens from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;"How I paint animals", ''Chums Boys Annual'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early in his career, Rivière made some mark as an illustrator, beginning with ''[[Punch magazine]]''. He was elected an [[Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1878, and a [[Royal Academician]] in 1881, and received the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law]] at Oxford in 1891.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was narrowly defeated in the election for President of the Royal Academy in 1896. His wife, Mary Alice Rivière (née Dobell; 1844–1931) whom he married in 1867, was a painter and exhibited briefly at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1869–70. After his death she presented the [[British Museum]] with four of his drawings (and an etching "The king drinks"), which complements the dozens of prints made after his work housed there, especially by [[Frederick Stacpoole]] and [[William Henry Simmons]]. The artist and his wife had seven children; five sons and two daughters. One of the sons, [[Hugh Goldwin Rivière]] (1869–1956), became a portraitist; another son (Evelyn) married the eminent psychoanalyst and translator of Sigmund Freud known as [[Joan Riviere]].

'''Chinese surnames''' are used by [[Han Chinese]] and [[Sinicization|Sinicized]] ethnic groups in [[Mainland China]], Hong Kong, [[Macau]], Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities. In ancient times two types of surnames existed, namely ''xing'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:姓|姓]]|p=xìng}}) or '''clan names''', and ''shi'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:氏|氏]]|p=shì}}) or '''lineage names'''.

Chinese family names are [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], passed from father to children (in adoption, the adoptee usually also takes the same surname). Women do not normally change their surnames upon marriage, except in places with more Western influences such as Hong Kong. Traditionally Chinese surnames have been [[exogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Society in Singapore, The Study of Chinese Society: Essays, Maurice Freedman, George William Skinner, Stanford University Press, 1979, pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art, Volume 38; Volume 101, Harry Houdini Collection, John Davis Batchelder Collection, Leavitt, Trow, &amp; Company, 1883  p. 852&lt;/ref&gt;

The colloquial expressions ''laobaixing'' (老百姓;  lit. "old hundred surnames") and ''bǎixìng'' ([[Wikt:百|百]] [[Wikt:姓|姓]], lit. "hundred surnames") are used in Chinese to mean "ordinary folks", "the people", or "[[commoner]]s".

==Origin of Chinese surnames==
Prior to the [[Warring States period]] (fifth century BC), only the ruling families and the aristocratic elite had surnames. Historically there was also a difference between '''clan names''' or '''''xing''''' ({{linktext|姓}}) and '''lineage names''' or '''''shi''''' ({{linktext|氏}}). '''''Xing''''' were surnames held by the noble clans. They generally are composed of a nü ({{linktext|女}}, "female") radical which has been taken by some as evidence they originated from [[matriarchal]] societies based on [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Neolithic|maternal lineages]]. Another hypothesis has been proposed by sinologist Léon Vandermeersch upon observation of the evolution of characters in oracular scripture from the [[Shang dynasty]] through the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]. The "female" radical seems to appear at the Zhou period next to Shang [[Chinese character|sinograms]] indicating an ethnic group or a tribe. This combination seems to designate specifically a female and could mean "lady of such or such clan". The structure of the ''xing'' sinogram could reflect the fact that in the royal court of Zhou, at least in the beginning, only females (wives married into the Zhou family from other clans) were called by their birth clan name, while the men were usually designated by their title or fief.

Prior to the [[Qin dynasty]] (3rd century BC) China was largely a ''[[fengjian]]'' (feudal) society. As fiefdoms were divided and subdivided among descendants, so additional sub-surnames known as  ''shi'' were created to distinguish between noble lineages according to seniority, though in theory they shared the same ancestor. In this way, a nobleman would hold a ''shi'' and a ''xing''. After the states of China were unified by [[Qin Shi Huang]] in 221 BC, surnames gradually spread to the lower classes and the difference between ''xing'' and ''shi'' blurred.

Many ''shi'' surnames survive to the present day. According to [[Jiang Kanghu|Kiang Kang-Hu]], there are 18 sources from which Chinese surnames may be derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= On Chinese Studies |author=Kiang Kang-Hu |pages=127–8 |year=1934 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Chinese_studies.html?id=rSYhAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggested at least 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Your Asian Roots : Genealogical Research on Chinese Surnames |author=Sheau-yueh J. Chao |isbn=978-0806349466 |publisher=Clearfield |year= 2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t26Iv0Octa0C&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be names associated with a ruling dynasty such as the various titles and names of rulers, nobility and dynasty, or they may be place names of various territories, districts, towns, villages, and specific locations, the title of official posts or occupations, or names of objects, or they may be derived from the names of family members or clans, and in a few cases, names of contempt given by a ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese names |author=Russell Jones |publisher=Pelanduk Publications |pages=1–3 |year=1997|isbn= 978-9679786194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are some of the common sources:

# '''''Xing''''': These were usually reserved for the central lineage of the royal family, with collateral lineages taking their own ''shi''.  The traditional description was what were known as the "Eight Great ''Xing''s of High Antiquity" ({{linktext|上|古|八|大|姓}}), namely [[Jiang (surname)#姜|Jiāng]] ({{linktext|姜}}), [[Jī]] ({{linktext|姬}}), [[Yao (surname)|Yáo]] ({{linktext|姚}}), [[Yíng]] ({{linktext|嬴}}), [[Si (surname)|Sì]] ({{linktext|姒}}), Yún ({{linktext|妘}}), [[Gui (surname)|Guī]] ({{linktext|媯}}) and Rèn ({{linktext|妊}}), though some sources quote [[Ji (surname 姞)|Jí]] ({{linktext|姞}}) as the last one instead of Rèn.  Of these ''xing''s, only Jiang and Yao have survived in their original form to modern days as frequently occurring surnames.
# '''Royal decree by the Emperor''', such as [[Kuang (surname)|Kuang]] ({{linktext|鄺}}).
# '''State name''': Many nobles and commoners took the name of their state, either to show their continuing allegiance or as a matter of national and ethnic identity.  These are some of the most common Chinese surnames.
# '''Name of a fief or place of origin''': Fiefdoms were often granted to collateral branches of the aristocracy and it was natural as part of the process of sub-surnaming for their names to be used. An example is Di, Marquis of Ouyangting, whose descendants took the surname [[Ouyang (surname)|Ouyang]] ({{linktext|歐陽}}). There are some two hundred examples of this identified, often of two-character surnames, but few have survived to the present.
# '''Names of an ancestor''': Like the previous example, this was also a common origin with close to 500 or 600 examples, 200 of which are two-character surnames. Often an ancestor's [[courtesy name]] would be used. For example, [[Yuan Taotu]] took the second character of his grandfather's courtesy name Boyuan ({{linktext|伯爰}}) as his surname. Sometimes titles granted to ancestors could also be taken as surnames.
# '''Seniority within the family''': In ancient usage, the characters of ''meng'' ({{linktext|孟}}), ''zhong'' ({{linktext|仲}}), ''shu'' ({{linktext|叔}}) and ''ji'' ({{linktext|季}}) were used to denote the first, second, third and fourth (or last) eldest sons in a family. These were sometimes adopted as surnames. Of these, [[Meng (surname)|Meng]] is the best known, being the surname of the philosopher [[Mencius]].
# '''Occupation'''
## From official positions, such as [[Shi (surname)|Shǐ]] ({{linktext|史}}, "historian"), Jí ({{linktext|籍}}, "royal librarian"), [[Ling (surname)|Líng]] ({{linktext|凌}}, "ice master"), Cāng ({{linktext|倉}}, "granary manager"), Kù ({{linktext|庫}}, "store manager"), Jiàn ({{linktext|諫}}, "[[adviser]]"), Shàngguān ({{linktext|上官}}, "high official"), [[Taishi (surname)|Tàishǐ]] (太史}}, "grand historian"), Zhōngháng ({{linktext|中行}}, "commander of middle [[column (formation)|column]]"), Yuèzhèng ({{linktext|樂正}}, "chief musician"), and in the case of [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]'s "Five Officials" ({{linktext|五官}}), namely [[Sima (Chinese surname)|Sīmǎ]] ({{linktext|司馬}}, "minister of horses", akin to [[defence minister]]), [[Situ (surname)|Sītú]] ({{linktext|司徒}}, "[[Situ (office)|minister of the masses]]", akin to treasurer), Sīkōng ({{linktext|司空}}, "minister of works", akin to minister of infrastructure), Sīshì ({{linktext|司士}}, "minister of [[yeomen]]", akin to chief [[ombudsman]]) and Sīkòu ({{linktext|司寇}}, "minister of bandits", akin to [[attorney general]]);
## From [[noble title]]s, such as [[Wang (surname)|Wáng]] ({{linktext|王}}, "king"), [[Hou (surname)|Hóu]] ({{linktext|侯}}, "marquis"), [[Xiahou|Xiàhóu]] ({{linktext|夏侯}}, "[[Marquis]] of [[Xia County|Xia]]") and [[Gongsun|Gōngsūn]] ({{linktext|公孫}}, "Duke's descendant");
## From more lowly occupations, as with [[Tao (surname)|Táo]] ({{linktext|陶}}, "[[pottery|potter]]"), [[Tu (surname)|Tú]] ({{linktext|屠}}, "butcher"), Bú ({{linktext|卜}}, "[[divination|diviner]]"), Jiàng ({{linktext|匠}}, "[[Artisan|craftsman]]"), [[Wu (surname)|Wū]] ({{linktext|巫}}, "[[Wu (shaman)|shaman]]") and Chú ({{linktext|廚}}, "cook").
# '''Ethnic and religious groups''': [[Ethnic minorities in China|Non-Han Chinese peoples in China]] sometimes took the name of their ethnic groups as [[Sinicization|sinicized]] surnames, such as [[Hu (surname)|Hú]] ({{linktext|胡}}, "barbarian"), [[Jin (Chinese surname)|Jīn]] ({{linktext|金}}, "[[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]"), Mǎn ({{linktext|滿}}, "[[Manchu]]"), [[Di (surname)|Dí]] ({{linktext|狄}}, "[[Beidi|Di people]]"), Huí ({{linktext|回}}, "[[Hui people]]") and [[Murong|Mùróng]] ({{linktext|慕容}}, a [[Xianbei]] tribe).  Many [[Hui Muslim]]s adopted the [[Ma (surname)|surname Ma]] ({{linktext|馬}}), an old Chinese surname, when they were required to use Chinese surnames during the Ming dynasty as it sounded close to the first syllable of Mohammad; it was also fitting for some of those who were caravaneers as the word means "horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 |title=Muslim Diversity: Local Islam in Global Contexts |author= Leif Manger |page=132 |publisher= Routledge |isbn=9781136818578 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many also changed their surnames throughout history for a number of reasons.  A ruler may bestow his own surname on those he considered to have given outstanding service to him, for example the surname [[Liu]] ({{linktext|劉}}) was granted by emperors in the [[Han dynasty]], [[Li (surname 李)|Li]] ({{linktext|李}}) during the Tang dynasty, and [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] ({{linktext|趙}}) from the [[Song dynasty]].  Others however may avoid using the name of a ruler, for example [[Shi (surname)|Shi]] ({{linktext|師}}) was changed to Shuai ({{linktext|帥}}) to [[naming taboo|avoid conflict]] with the name of [[Sima Shi]].  Others may modify their name in order to escape from their enemies at times of turmoil, for example Duanmu ({{linktext|端木}}) to Mu ({{linktext|木}} and {{linktext|沐}}), and Gong ({{linktext|共}}) to [[Gong (surname)|Gong]] ({{linktext|龔}}).  The name may also be changed by simplification of the writing (e.g. Mu ({{linktext|幕}}) to [[Mo (Chinese surname)|Mo]] ({{linktext|莫}})), or reducing from double or multiple character names to single character names (e.g. Duangan ({{linktext|段干}}) to Duan ({{linktext|段}})).  It may also have occurred through error, or changed due to a dissatisfaction with the name (e.g. {{linktext|哀}}, "sorrow", to {{linktext|衷}}, "heartfelt feeling").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Your Asian Roots : Genealogical Research on Chinese Surnames |author=Sheau-yueh J. Chao |isbn=978-0806349466 |publisher=Clearfield |year= 2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t26Iv0Octa0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames are not evenly distributed throughout China's geography. In northern China, Wáng ([[Wiktionary:王#Chinese|王]]) is the most common surname, being shared by 9.9% of the population. Next are Lĭ ([[Wiktionary:李#Chinese|李]]), Zhāng ([[Wiktionary:张#Chinese|张]]/[[Wiktionary:張#Chinese|張]]) and Liú ([[Wiktionary:刘#Chinese|刘]]/[[Wiktionary:劉#Chinese|劉]]). In the south, Chén ([[Wiktionary:陈#Chinese|陈]]/[[Wiktionary:陳#Chinese|陳]]) is the most common, being shared by 10.6% of the population. Next are Lĭ (李), Huáng ([[Wiktionary:黄#Chinese|黄]]/[[Wiktionary:黃#Chinese|黃]]), Lín ([[Wiktionary:林#Chinese|林]]) and Zhāng (张/張). Around the major crossing points of the [[Yangtze River]], the most common surname is Lĭ (李), taking up 7.7%, followed by Wáng (王), Zhāng (张/張), Chan/Chén (陈/陳) and Liú (刘/劉).

A 1987 study showed over 450 family names in common use in Beijing, but there were fewer than 300 family names in [[Fujian]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A study by [[geneticist]] [[Yuan Yida]] has found that of all the people with a particular surname, there tends to be a population concentration in a certain province,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} as tabulated to the right. It does not show, however, the most common surnames in any one province.

The 55th most common family name "Xiào" ([[Wiktionary:肖#Chinese|肖]]) appears to be very rare in Hong Kong. This is explained by the fact Hong Kong uses [[Traditional Chinese character]]s rather than [[Simplified Chinese character]]s. Originally, the surname [[Wiktionary:蕭#Chinese|蕭]] (Xiāo) was rather common while the surname 肖 (Xiào) was extremely rare, if not non-existent (it is mentioned only sporadically in historical texts). The first round of simplification in 1956 simplified 蕭 into [[Wiktionary:萧#Chinese|萧]], keeping 蕭/萧 and 肖 distinct. However the [[Second round of simplified Chinese characters|second-round]] in 1977, which has long been abolished, merged 萧 and 肖 into 肖. Despite the retraction of the second round, some people have kept 肖 as their surname, so that there are now two separate surnames, 萧 and 肖.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Chén ([[Wiktionary:陈#Chinese|陈]]/[[Wiktionary:陳#Chinese|陳]]) is perhaps the most common surname in Hong Kong and [[Macau]], where it is romanized as Chan, and is also common in Taiwan, where it is romanized as Chén.

Fāng ([[Wiktionary:方#Chinese|方]]), which is only the 47th most common overall, is much more common in San Francisco's Chinatown in the United States, although the surname is more often than not romanized as Fong, as based on the [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] dialect. As with the concentration of family names, this can also be explained statistically, as a person with an uncommon name moving to an unsettled area and leaving his family name to large number of descendants.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

After the [[Song Dynasty]], surname distributions in China largely settled down.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The [[Kuang (surname)|Kuàng]] ([[Wiktionary:邝#Chinese|邝]]/[[Wiktionary:鄺#Chinese|鄺]]) family, for example, migrated from the northern capital and settled in [[Guangdong]] after the Song Dynasty revolts.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Villages are often made up of a single [[patrilineage]] with individuals having the same surname, often with a common male ancestor. They usually intermarry with others from nearby villages, creating genetic clusters.

==Surnames at present==
Of the thousands of surnames which have been identified from historical texts prior to the modern era, most have either been lost (see [[extinction of family names]]) or simplified. Historically there are close to 12,000 surnames recorded (including those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups), of which only about 3,100 are in current use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Economist|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor of almost 4:1 (about 75%) reduction. Surname extinction is due to various factors, such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, and others. A recent example of near surname extinction is the rare surname Shan (𢒉).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=电脑打不出来 山东200村民被迫改姓|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/10/8/15/n2996024.htm|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The character is not able to be displayed on a computer and people born after the system change as well as people who didn't want a hassle had to change their name to another character such as Xian (冼). The name still exists for those who were grandfathered but some people from the village are concerned that future generations will forget their name origin.

While new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing. The most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names.&lt;ref name="du1992"&gt;{{Harv|Du et al.|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent centuries some two-character surnames have often dropped a character. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, moreover, some surnames have been graphically simplified.

Although there are thousands of Chinese family names, the [[List of common Chinese surnames|100]] most common, which together make up less than 5% of those in existence, are shared by 85% of the population.  The three most common surnames in Mainland China are [[Li (surname 李)|Li]], [[Wang (surname)|Wang]] and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]], which make up 7.9%, 7.4% and 7.1% respectively. Together they number close to 300 million and are easily the most common surnames in the world. In Chinese, the phrase "third son of Zhang, fourth son of Li" ({{zh|c={{linktext|张|三|李|四}}|p={{linktext|zhāng| sān| lǐ| sì}}}}) is used to say "just anybody".

In a 1990 study, the top 200 family names accounted for over 96% of a random sample of 174,900 persons, with over 500 other names accounting for the remaining 4%.  In a different study (1987), which combined data from Taiwan and China (sample size of 570,000 persons), the top 19 names covered 55.6%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2005/12/chinese-and-korean-family-names.html|title=Sun Bin: Chinese and Korean Family Names|author=Sun Bin|date=19 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302091859/http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2005/12/chinese-and-korean-family-names.html |archivedate=2 March 2006 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the top 100 names covered 87% of the sample. Other data suggest that the top 50 names comprise 70% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113025139/http://www.diversity-whatworks.gov.uk/publications/pdf/hmlandregistryculturaldiversity.pdf |url=http://www.diversity-whatworks.gov.uk/publications/pdf/hmlandregistryculturaldiversity.pdf |title=Cultural Diversity |archivedate=13 January 2006 |work=HM Land Registry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most commonly occurring Chinese family names have only one character; however, about twenty [[Chinese compound surname|double-character family names]] have survived into modern times.  These include [[Sima (Chinese surname)|Sima]] ([[Wiktionary:司|司]] [[Wiktionary:馬|馬]], simp. [[Wiktionary:司|司]] [[Wiktionary:马|马]]), [[Zhuge]] ([[Wiktionary:諸|諸]] [[Wiktionary:葛|葛]], simp. [[Wiktionary:诸|诸]] [[Wiktionary:葛|葛]]), [[Ouyang]] ([[Wiktionary:歐|歐]] [[Wiktionary:陽|陽]], simp. [[Wiktionary:欧|欧]] [[Wiktionary:阳|阳]]), occasionally romanized as ''O'Young'', suggesting an Irish origin to English-speakers, and [[Situ (surname)|Situ]] (or Sito [[Wiktionary:司|司]] [[Wiktionary:徒|徒]]). Sima, Zhuge, and Ouyang also happen to be the surnames of four extremely famous premodern Chinese historical figures. There are family names with three or more characters, but those are not ethnically Han Chinese.  For example, Aixinjueluo ([[Wiktionary:愛|愛]] [[Wiktionary:新|新]] [[Wiktionary:覺|覺]] [[Wiktionary:羅|羅]], also romanized from the [[Manchu language]] as [[Aisin Gioro]]), was the family name of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] royal family of the [[Qing dynasty]].

===Variations in romanization===
[[Transliteration]] of Chinese family names (see [[List of common Chinese surnames]]) into foreign languages poses a number of problems. Chinese surnames are shared by people speaking a number of dialects and languages which often have different pronunciations of their surnames. The spread of the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] into all parts of the world resulted in the [[Romanization]] of the surnames based on different languages. As a result, it is common for the same surname to be transliterated differently. In certain dialects, different surnames could be [[homonyms]] so it is common for family names to appear ambiguous when transliterated. Example: 鄭/郑 (pinyin: Zheng) can be romanized into Chang, Cheng, Chung, Teh, Tay, Tee, Tsang, Zeng or Zheng,  (in [[pinyin]], Chang, Cheng, Zheng and Zeng are all different names). Translating Chinese surnames from foreign transliteration often presents ambiguity. For example, the surname "Li" are all mandarin-based pinyin transliteration for the surnames 黎 (Lí); 李, 理 and 里 (Lǐ); 郦/酈, 栗, 厉/厲, and 利 (Lì) depending on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] which are often omitted in foreign transliterations.

Due to the different pronunciation and romanizations, it is sometimes easy to tell whether a Chinese person has origins in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, or Taiwan. In general people who are Mainland descent will have both their surnames and names in [[pinyin]]. Those who are Taiwanese descent use [[Wade-Giles]] romanization. People from Southeast Asia (mainly Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines) and Hong Kong usually base their romanization of surnames and names on the [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] languages. The younger generation from Singapore predominantly have their surname in dialect and given name in English.

There are also people who use non-standard romanizations, e.g. the Hong Kong [[media mogul]] 邵逸夫  [[Run Run Shaw]]'s surname 邵 is spelt as Shaw, pinyin: Shao.

The use of different systems of romanization based on different Chinese language variants from 1900~1970 also contributed to the variations.

==Sociological use of surnames==
[[File:TongshanXian-G106-G316-junction-0018.jpg|thumb|Many village names in China are linked to surnames. Pictured is Jiajiayuan (贾家源), i.e. "[[Jia (surname)|Jia Family]]'s Spring", in Honggang Town, [[Tongshan County, Hubei]]]]
Throughout most of Chinese history, surnames have served sociological functions. Because of their association with the aristocratic elite in their early developments, surnames were often used as symbols of nobility. Thus nobles would use their surnames to be able to trace their ancestry and compete for seniority in terms of hereditary rank. Examples of early [[genealogy|genealogies]] among the royalty can be found in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''Historical Records'', which contain tables recording the descent lines of noble houses called ''shibiao'' ({{zh|c=世表|p=shìbiǎo}}).

Later, during the Han dynasty, these tables were used by prominent families to glorify themselves and sometimes even to legitimize their political power. For example, [[Cao Pi]], who forced the abdication of the last Han emperor in his favor, claimed descent from the [[Yellow Emperor]]. Chinese emperors sometimes passed their own surnames to subjects as honors. Unlike European practice in which some surnames are obviously noble, Chinese emperors and members of the royal family had regular surnames except in cases where they came from non-Han ethnic groups. This was a result of Chinese imperial theory in which a commoner could receive the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and become emperor. Upon becoming emperor, the emperor would retain his original surname. Also as a consequence, many people also had the same surname as the emperor, but had no direct relation to the royal family.

The Tang dynasty was the last period when the great aristocratic families, mostly descended from the nobility of pre-Qin states, held significant centralized and regional power. The surname was used as a source of prestige and common allegiance. During the period a large number of genealogical records called ''pudie'' ({{zh|s=谱牒|t=譜牒|p=pǔdié}}) were compiled to trace the complex descent lines of clans and their marriage ties to other clans. A large number of these were collected by [[Ouyang Xiu]] in his ''New History of Tang''. To differentiate between different surnames, the Tang also choronyms before stating beforehand, for example Lǒngxī Lǐshì 隴西李氏, meaning Li of Longxi. These were generally the names of commanderies used prior to the reorganization during the Tang, so that they became exclusively associated to clans as their common use had died out. Cadet branches were also listed for further differentiation, such as Gūzāng Fáng 姑臧房, meaning Clan Li of Guzang. 

During the Song dynasty, ordinary clans began to organize themselves into corporate units and produce genealogies. This trend was led by the poet [[Su Shi]] and his father. As competition for resources and positions in the bureaucracy intensified, individuals used their common ancestry and surname to promote solidarity. They established schools to educate their sons and held common lands to aid disadvantaged families. Ancestral temples were also erected to promote surname identity. Clan cohesion was usually encouraged by successive imperial governments since it aided in social stability. During the Qing dynasty surname associations often undertook extrajudicial roles, providing primitive legal and social security functions. They played important roles in the Chinese diaspora to South-East Asia and elsewhere, providing the infrastructure for the establishment of trading networks. In southern China, however, clans sometimes engaged in armed conflict in competition for land. Clans continued the tradition of tracing their ancestry to the distant past as a matter of prestige. Most of these origin myths, though well established, are spurious.

As a result of the importance of surnames, rules and traditions regarding family and marriage grew increasingly complex. For example, in Taiwan, there is a clan with the so-called "double Liao" surname.  The story is that "Chang Yuan-zih of Liao's in Siluo married the only daughter of Liao San-Jiou-Lang who had no son, and he took the oath that he should be in the name of Liao when alive and should be in the name of Chang after death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yunlin.gov.tw/english/from/index-1.asp?m=2&amp;m1=15&amp;m2=113&amp;gp=71&amp;id=35|title=
Siluo Liao's Family Temple (3rd grade relic)|publisher=Yunlin County Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, there are additional taboos against marriage between people of the same surname, considered to be closely related. Conversely, in some areas, there are different clans with the same surname which are not considered to be related, but even in these cases surname [[exogamy]] is generally practiced.

Surname identity and solidarity has declined markedly since the 1930s with the decline of [[Confucianism]] and later, the rise of [[Communism]] in Mainland China. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], surname culture was actively persecuted by the government with the destruction of ancestral temples and genealogies. Moreover, the influx of Western culture and forces of [[globalization]] have also contributed to erode the previous sociological uses of the Chinese surnames.

Names in Taiwan{{spaced ndash}}both among the immigrant [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] and [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aborigines]]{{spaced ndash}}are similar to those in southeast China but differ somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese.

Taiwanese surnames include some local variants like [[Tu (surname)|Tu]] (塗) which do not even appear among the ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]''. However, names in Taiwan show less diversity than China as a whole: the top ten comprise 52.63% of the Taiwanese population and the top hundred 96.11%.&lt;ref name="TaiRank"/&gt; There were also only 1,989 surnames recorded by the Ministry's survey,&lt;ref name="TaiRank"/&gt; against China's four or five thousand.

As is typical of China as a whole, these surnames conflate many different lineages and origins, although tradition may bind them to the same [[ancestral temple]]s and rituals or [[incest taboo|ban intermarriage]]. For example, some Taiwanese converts to [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan|Presbyterianism]] adopted the name [[Kai (surname)|Kai]] (偕, [[pinyin]] ''Xié'') in honor of the Canadian missionary [[George Leslie Mackay]] (馬偕, [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] ''Má-kai'').{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Rear Admiral]] '''David Anumle Hansen''' (17 May 1923 – 28 January 2008) was the first [[Ghana]]ian to be appointed [[Chief of Naval Staff (Ghana)|Chief of Naval Staff]] of the [[Ghana Navy]].

==Education and training==
David Hansen trained at the [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] Officer Cadet School in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=barracks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawodu.com/barrack8.htm |title=Barracks: The History behind those names |accessdate=2007-06-12 |work=PART 7 – EPILOGUE Section 3 |publisher=Segun Toyin Dawodu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In earlier years he had attended [[Accra Academy]] and upon completion had worked briefly for [[Ghana Post]] .

Prior to his viceregal appointment, Onley was a television journalist. He worked primarily for [[CITY-DT|Citytv]] as a weather reporter, before moving on to cover science and technology stories. Later on, he worked with the 24-hour news station [[CP24|CablePulse 24]] as a news anchor and host of a weekly technology series, ''[[Home Page (TV series)|Home Page]]''. A published author, he was founding president of the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada.

His seven-year term makes him the longest serving Lieutenant Governor of Ontario since [[Albert Edward Matthews]] (1937–1946) and the province's second longest serving viceroy since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]].

==Early life==
Onley was born in [[Midland, Ontario]], and raised in West Hill on Orchard Park Drive in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]],&lt;ref name="PMO"&gt;{{cite press release  | title =Prime Minister announces appointment of David C.

Beginning at the age of three,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/253480 Oliveria, Michael; ''Toronto Star'': Onley vows focus on access; September 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Onley battled with [[polio]], resulting in partial paralysis. However, as a result of extensive physical therapy, he regained the use of his hands and arms, and partial use of his legs.  Onley is able to walk using leg braces and canes or crutches, but he generally prefers to get around using his electric scooter.  He is able to drive a car using hand controls for acceleration and braking.

==Career==
Onley began his career in radio, hosting a weekly science show for Toronto radio station [[CFRB]], subsequently joining the [[CKO]] network in 1983. He then joined Citytv in 1984 as [[weather]] specialist, a position he held until 1989. In a 2004 interview with Link Up, a Toronto employment agency for people with disabilities, Onley stated that {{cquote|At the time I remember saying to my mother, ‘I don't know if I should take this job (at Citytv). I don’t know if they’re hiring me because I’m disabled.’ My mother said, ‘You’ve been turned down enough times because of your disability, so take it!’ I thought to myself, ‘Damn it, she’s right’ and that’s how my career at Citytv began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkup.ca/onley-appointment.html "David Onley: A Success Story"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1989 to 1995, he was the first news anchor on the then-new ''[[Breakfast Television]]'', Citytv's morning show. He served as [[education]] specialist for Citytv and CablePulse 24 from 1994 to 1999. Onley became an anchor on CP24, when the station launched in 1999, and both hosted and produced ''[[Home Page (television series)|Home Page]]'' on CP24.&lt;ref name="PMO" /&gt;

He was one of Canada's first on-air television personalities with a visible disability;&lt;ref name="PMO" /&gt; he uses a [[mobility device]] due to his paralysis. Camera shots began with only upper body shots, but Onley demanded that the shot include him in his mobility device. In honour of his contributions to the advancement of disability issues in Canada, he has received awards from the [[Terry Fox Hall of Fame]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="PMO" /&gt; and the [[Clarke Institute]]'s Courage to Come Back award.&lt;ref name="PMO" /&gt; He was appointed Chair of the Accessibility Standards Advisory Council to the Minister of Community and Social Services in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lt.gov.on.ca/20070711_DavidOnleyENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730120522/http://lt.gov.on.ca/20070711_DavidOnleyENG.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was most recently inducted into the [[Scarborough Walk of Fame]] in 2006.

Onley wrote ''Shuttle: A Shattering Novel of Disaster in Space'', a bestselling novel about [[Human spaceflight|space travel]], published in 1981. It was nominated by the Periodical Distributors of Canada as book of the year. He was founding president of the [[Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada]].

Onley returned to his acting roots, with a cameo appearance in the sixth season of the Canadian TV series ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]''. The episode, "The Ghost of Queens Park" aired in Canada on February 25, 2013.  In it he played the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Sir [[Oliver Mowat]].&lt;ref name="DO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/TV/ontario-lt-gov-david-onley-films-cameo-for-cbc-drama-murdoch-mysteries-162432496.html|title=Ontario Lt.-Gov.

==As Lieutenant Governor==
[[Image:David Onley with Her Majesty.jpg|thumb|right|Queen [[Elizabeth II]] holds audience with [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]] [[David C. Onley]] at [[Buckingham Palace]], 2008]]
Onley's appointment as Lieutenant Governor was announced on July 10, 2007; he was privately informed of this after a July 4, 2007, taping of ''Home Page'': "I just had reached the top of the [[Don Valley Parkway]]... and there was no place to pull over. And when the Prime Minister of your country calls, all you can try to do is stay in the same lane, avoid any fender-benders and have a meaningful conversation, which I did."&lt;ref name=citynews-12727 /&gt;

He was sworn in on September 5, 2007, at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in Toronto. As the province's first Lieutenant Governor with a disability, Onley said he would use his vice-regal position to help remove physical barriers to Ontario's 1.5 million people with disabilities, as well as focus on other issues affecting the disabled, including obstacles to employment and housing.  Onley also stated, in his installation speech, that he would expand on his immediate predecessor [[James Bartleman]]'s [[First Nations]] literacy initiatives, his aim being to see computers on every student's desk in northern schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/253577 Editorial; ''Toronto Star'': Vice-regal role model; September 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  For his installation, Onley approached the legislature on his [[Mobility scooter|electric scooter]], however he ascended the Throne on foot, using [[Brace (orthopaedic)|leg braces]] and [[Cane (medical device)|cane]]s. Onley also travelled to [[China]] to represent the Queen and Canada at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release| title=Statement by the Prime Minister of Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=26 August 2008| url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=3&amp;id=2245| accessdate=8 March 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309102203/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=3&amp;id=2245| archivedate=9 March 2010| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onley delivered his last speech from the throne to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on July 3, 2014; his last full day in office was September 22, 2014 with his successor sworn in the following afternoon.

Since 2009, the business magazine, ''[[Forbes]]''  had compiled an annual '''list of the world's most powerful people'''. The list has one slot [[World population|for every 100 million people]], meaning in 2009 there were 67 people on the list and by 2018 there were 75. Slots are allocated based on the amount of human and financial resources that they have sway over, as well as their influence on world events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Michael Noer and Nicole Perlroth|title=The World's Most Powerful People |work=[[Forbes]] |page= |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-16 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/09/world-most-powerful-leadership-power-09-intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Ford Coppola''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|əl|ə}}; born April 7, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|136867}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film composer]]. He was a central figure in the [[New Hollywood]] wave of filmmaking.

After directing ''[[The Rain People]]'' (1969), he co-wrote the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', earning the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] along with co-writer [[Edmund H. North]]. His directorial prominence was cemented with the release in 1972 of ''[[The Godfather]]'', a film which revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Langford|title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond|year=2005|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning praise from both critics and the public before winning three Academy Awards—including his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] ([[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], with [[Mario Puzo]]), [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and his first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

He followed with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' in 1974, which became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, it brought him three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Picture, and made him the second director, after [[Billy Wilder]], to be honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which he directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. He next directed 1979's ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. While notorious for its lengthy and strenuous production, the film is widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. It won the Palme d'Or at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]], making Coppola [[Palme d'Or#Multiple award winners|one of only eight filmmakers to win two Palme d'Or awards]].

While a number of Coppola's ventures in the [[1980s in film|1980s]] and [[1990s in film|1990s]] were critically lauded, he has never quite achieved the same commercial success with films as in the [[1970s in film|1970s]].&lt;ref name="Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola"&gt;[http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola – IGN].

==Early life==
Coppola was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, to father [[Carmine Coppola]] (1910–1991),&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Carmine Coppola, 80, Conductor And Composer for His Son's Films|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|date=April 27, 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/obituaries/carmine-coppola-80-conductor-and-composer-for-his-son-s-films.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[flautist]] with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], and mother [[Italia Coppola]] (née Pennino; 1912–2004). Coppola is the middle of three children: his older brother was [[August Coppola]], his younger sister is actress [[Talia Shire]].

Having contracted [[polio]] as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, allowing him to indulge his imagination with homemade puppet theater productions.

It was at this time Coppola decided he would go into cinema rather than theater.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 1" /&gt; Coppola says he was tremendously influenced to become a writer early on by his brother, August,&lt;ref name=bravo /&gt; in whose footsteps he would also follow by attending both of his brother's alma maters: Hofstra and [[UCLA]]. Coppola also gives credit to the work of [[Elia Kazan]] and for its influence on him as a director.&lt;ref name=bravo /&gt; Amongst Coppola's classmates at Hofstra were [[James Caan]], [[Lainie Kazan]] and radio artist [[Joe Frank]].&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristine McKenna |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-09-18/stage/off-the-radio |title=Joe Frank: Off the Radio – Page 1 – Stage – Los Angeles |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later cast Lainie Kazan in ''[[One from the Heart]]'' and Caan in ''[[The Rain People]]'' and ''[[The Godfather]]''.

While pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of the university's drama group, The Green Wig, and its musical comedy club, the Kaleidoscopians. He then merged the two into The Spectrum Players and under his leadership, they staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola" /&gt; He won three D. H.

==Career==

===1960s===
After earning his theater arts degree from Hofstra in 1960, Coppola enrolled in [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|UCLA Film School]] for graduate work in film.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hofstra.edu/home/news/ur/points-pride.html|title=Points of Pride - Hofstra University, New York|website=www.hofstra.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he directed a short horror film called ''The Two Christophers'', inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[William Wilson (short story)|William Wilson]]", and ''Ayamonn the Terrible'', a film about a sculptor's nightmares coming to life,&lt;ref name="The Gods of Filmmaking "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambidextrouspics.com/html/francis_ford_coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola biography |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710050242/http://www.ambidextrouspics.com/html/francis_ford_coppola.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before directing the experimental [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] comedy ''[[Tonight for Sure]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt;

At UCLA, Coppola met [[Jim Morrison]]. He later used Morrison's song "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" in ''Apocalypse Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/apocalypsenow/section3.rhtml |title=SparkNotes: Apocalypse Now: Score and Soundtrack |publisher=www.sparknotes.com |accessdate=2010-10-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ACoT59mH?url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/apocalypsenow/section3.rhtml |archivedate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company that hired him for ''Tonight for Sure'' brought him back to re-cut a German film titled ''Mit Eva fing die Sünde an'' directed by [[Fritz Umgelter]]. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for ''[[The Bellboy and the Playgirls]]'', also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by [[Roger Corman]] and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, ''Nebo zovyot'', which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled ''[[Battle Beyond the Sun]]'', released in 1962.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt; Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on ''[[Tower of London (1962 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1962), sound man for ''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) and associate producer of ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Biography" /&gt;

While on location in Ireland for ''The Young Racers'' in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Biography" /&gt; Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-3 |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213223755/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-3 |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3" /&gt; Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].

In 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola" /&gt; This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt; This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLATFT"&gt;[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ "Profile: Francis Ford Coppola"], UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television, Executive Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', starring [[Petula Clark]] in her first American film and veteran [[Fred Astaire]]. Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, "hippie" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt{{According to whom|date=March 2014}} contributed to her [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt; The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].

In 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio "Zoetrope" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]]. In his book ''The American Cinema'', [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote, "[Coppola] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making... [He] may be heard from more decisively in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Sarris|Sarris, Andrew]] (1968). ''The American Cinema'' (Paperback ed.). New York, NY: EP Dutton and Co., Inc. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Francis Ford Coppola -1976.jpg|thumb|Coppola in 1976]]
Coppola epitomized a group of filmmakers known as the "[[New Hollywood]]" that emerged in the early 1970s with ideas that challenged conventional film-making. The group included [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[Terrence Malick]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Woody Allen]], [[William Friedkin]], [[Philip Kaufman]] and [[George Lucas]].&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture|title=The kid stays in the Picture|date=|accessdate=2010-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091642/http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert-travers/the-kid-stays-in-the-picture|archivedate=2011-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Patton'' (1970)====
{{Main|Patton (film)}}
Coppola co-wrote the script for ''Patton'' in 1970 along with [[Edmund H. North]]. This earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] that [[Patton (film)#Opening|the opening scene]] would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-4 |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |publisher=achievement.org |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213223651/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-4 |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation| I wrote the script of ''Patton''. And the script was very controversial when I wrote it, because they thought it was so stylized. It was supposed to be like, sort of, you know, ''The Longest Day''. And my script of ''Patton'' was—I was sort of interested in the reincarnation. And I had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an American flag and gives this speech. Ultimately, I wasn't fired, but I was fired, meaning that when the script was done, they said, "Okay, thank you very much," and they went and hired another writer and that script was forgotten. And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene.}}"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|title=Godfather The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola|year=2004|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2304-6|page=32|chapter=1 Point of Departure}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military "Pep Talk" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monologue, the word "fornicating" replaced "fucking" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.

====''The Godfather'' (1972)====
{{Main|The Godfather}}
The release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Christopher Frayling| title = Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA215| year = 1981| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-7100-0503-8| page = 215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, "smell the spaghetti". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]), documentary film about Evans' life&lt;/ref&gt;

There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that "Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).&lt;ref name="Look"&gt;''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3" /&gt;{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}
After it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]  and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time }}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] "He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Conversation'' (1974)====
{{Main|The Conversation}}
Coppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time" /&gt; The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)&lt;ref&gt;Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation,'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[United States Presidential election, 1968|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].

====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====
{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}
During the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, "I don't think that script was [actually] made."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====
{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}

Coppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: "You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use "Part II" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the #1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's "50 Best Movies of All Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ranked at #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the "100 Greatest Movies of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Roger Ebert's "Great Movies" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured on [[Sight &amp; Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at #4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight &amp; Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first in 1939 with ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' and ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: [[Herbert Ross]] in 1977 with ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'', and [[Steven Soderbergh]] in 2000 with ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' and ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''. Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures.

====''Apocalypse Now'' (1979)====
{{Main|Apocalypse Now}}
Following the success of ''The Godfather'', ''The Conversation'' and ''The Godfather Part II'', Coppola began filming ''Apocalypse Now'', an adaptation of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' set in [[Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]] (Coppola himself briefly appears as a TV news director). The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels and an unprepared [[Marlon Brando|Brando]] with a bloated appearance (which Coppola attempted to hide by shooting him in the shadows). It was delayed so often it was nicknamed ''Apocalypse When?''&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola: The RT Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1920998/news/1920998/francis-ford-coppola-the-rt-interview/ |title=Francis Ford Coppola: The RT Interview.

After filming ''Apocalypse Now'', Coppola famously stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE0D91530F934A15752C1A967958260 |title=Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991)|date= 1991-11-27|accessdate=2010-10-18|work=The New York Times|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane."

The film was overwhelmingly lauded by critics when it finally appeared in 1979 and was selected for the 1979 [[Cannes Film Festival]], winning the [[Palme d'Or]] along with ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', directed by [[Volker Schlöndorff]]. When the film screened at Cannes, he quipped:&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola: The RT Interview" /&gt; "My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam." ''Apocalypse Now'''s reputation has grown in time and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the [[New Hollywood]] era and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/apoc.html |title=Apocalypse Now (Redux) (1979) (2001)|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Apocalypse_Now.html|title=Apocalypse Now (1979)|date=|accessdate=2010-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129074942/http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Apocalypse_Now.html|archivedate=2010-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreview1/a/apocalypsenowra.htm |title=DVD Pick: Apocalypse Now – The Complete Dossier|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] considers it to be the finest film on the Vietnam War and included it in his list for the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics' poll of the greatest movies ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Roger&amp;surname=Ebert|title=How the directors and critics voted|date=|accessdate=2010-10-18|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5icZTFHiW?url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Roger&amp;surname=Ebert|archivedate=2009-07-29|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991128/REVIEWS08/911280301/1023 |title=Apocalypse Now (1979) by Roger Ebert|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Coppola re-released ''Apocalypse Now'' as ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'', restoring several sequences lost from the original 1979 cut of the film, thereby expanding its length to 200&amp;nbsp;minutes.

===1980s===

====''One from the Heart'' (1981)====
{{Main|One from the Heart}}
''Apocalypse Now'' marked the end of the golden phase of Coppola's career.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt; His musical fantasy ''One from the Heart'', although pioneering the use of video-editing techniques which are standard practice in the film industry today, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of $636,796 against a US$26 million budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=onefromtheheart.htm |title=One from the Heart |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; far from enough to recoup the costs incurred in the production of the movie and he was forced to sell his 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983.&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola Biography" /&gt; He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. (Zoetrope Studios finally filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in 1990, after which its name was changed to [[American Zoetrope]]).&lt;ref name="Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)" /&gt;

====''Hammett'' (1982)====
{{Main|Hammett (film)}}
Following the disastrous ''One from the Heart'', Coppola co-directed ''Hammett'' along with [[Wim Wenders]] in the same year. Although Coppola was not credited for his effort, according to one source, "by the time the final version was released in 1982, only 30 percent of Wenders' footage remained and the rest was completely reshot by Coppola, whose mere 'executive producer' credit is just a technicality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hammett review |author=Noel Murray |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/42688 |publisher=The Onion A.V.

====''The Outsiders'' (1983)====
{{Main|The Outsiders (film)}}
In 1983, he directed ''The Outsiders'', a film adaptation of the [[The Outsiders (novel)|novel]] of the same name by [[S. E. Hinton]]. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. ''The Outsiders'' is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars. These included major roles for [[Matt Dillon]], [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[C. Thomas Howell]]. Also in the cast were [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Diane Lane]] and [[Tom Cruise]]. Matt Dillon and several others also starred in Coppola's related film, ''[[Rumble Fish]]'', which was also based on a S. E. Hinton novel and filmed at the same time as ''The Outsiders'' on-location in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the musical score, including the title song "Stay Gold", which was based upon a famous [[Robert Frost]] poem and performed for the movie by [[Stevie Wonder]]. The film was a moderate box-office success, drawing a revenue of $25 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=outsiders.htm |title=The Outsiders|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; against a budget of $10 million.

====''Rumble Fish'' (1983)====
{{Main|Rumble Fish}}
''Rumble Fish'' was based on the [[Rumble Fish (novel)|novel]] of the same name by [[S. E. Hinton]], who also co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionist films, ''Rumble Fish'' centres on the relationship between a revered former gang leader ([[Mickey Rourke]]) and his younger brother, Rusty James ([[Matt Dillon]]). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meagre $2.5 million against a budget of $10 million and once again aggravated Coppola's financial troubles.

====''The Cotton Club'' (1984)====
{{Main|The Cotton Club (film)}}
In 1984 Coppola directed the [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]]-produced ''The Cotton Club''. The film was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction. However, the film failed miserably at the box-office, recouping only $25.9 million of the $47.9 million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani.&lt;ref name="Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time"&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/greatestflops10.html Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time].

====''Rip Van Winkle'' (1984)====
{{Main|Rip Van Winkle#Adaptations|l1=Rip Van Winkle}}
The same year he directed an episode of ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'' entitled ''Rip Van Winkle'', where [[Harry Dean Stanton]] played the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/faerie_tale_theatre_rip_van_winkle/ |title=Faerie Tale Theatre – Rip Van Winkle (1984) |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204145606/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/faerie_tale_theatre_rip_van_winkle/ |archivedate=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Captain EO'' (1986)====
{{Main|Captain EO}}
In 1986, Coppola directed ''Captain EO'', a 17-minute space fantasy for [[Disney theme parks]] executive produced by [[George Lucas]], starring singer [[Michael Jackson]].

====''Peggy Sue Got Married'' (1986)====
{{Main|Peggy Sue Got Married}}
In [[1986 in film|1986]] Coppola released the comedy ''Peggy Sue Got Married'' starring [[Kathleen Turner]], Coppola's nephew [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Jim Carrey]]. Much like ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'', ''Peggy Sue Got Married'' centered around teenage youth. The film earned Coppola positive feedback and provided Kathleen Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was the first box-office success for Coppola since ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=peggysuegotmarried.htm |title=Peggy Sue Got Married |publisher=Box Office Mojo |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61GbMt1sI?url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=peggysuegotmarried.htm |archivedate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the film ranked number 17 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s list of "50 Best High School Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1532588_1_0_,00.html |title=Entertainment Weekly's 50 Best High School Movies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905083021/http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0%2C6115%2C1532588_1_0_%2C00.html |archivedate=September 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Gardens of Stone'' (1987)====
{{Main|Gardens of Stone}}
The following year, Coppola re-teamed with [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] for ''Gardens of Stone'', but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola's eldest son [[Gian-Carlo Coppola]] during the film's production. The movie was not a critical success and performed poorly at the box office, earning only $5.6 million against a budget of $13 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gardensofstone.htm |title=Gardens of Stone|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988)====
{{Main|Tucker: The Man and His Dream}}
Coppola directed ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' the following year. A biopic based on the life of [[Preston Tucker]] and his attempt to produce and market the [[Tucker automobile|Tucker '48]], Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with [[Marlon Brando]] after the release of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Ultimately it was [[Jeff Bridges]] who played the role of Preston Tucker. Budgeted at $24 million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the [[62nd Academy Awards]], although its $19.65 million box office was a disappointment. Two awards came its way: [[Martin Landau]] won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Dean Tavoularis]] took [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|BAFTA's honors for Best Production Design]].

====''New York Stories'' (1989)====
{{Main|New York Stories#Life Without Zoë|l1=New York Stories}}
In 1989, Coppola teamed up with fellow [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning directors [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Woody Allen]] for an [[anthology film]] called ''[[New York Stories]]''. Coppola directed the ''Life Without Zoë'' segment, starring his sister [[Talia Shire]] and also co-wrote the film with his daughter [[Sofia Coppola]]. ''Life Without Zoë'' was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered the segment that brought the film's overall quality down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currentfilm.com/dvdreviews4/newyorkstoriesdvd.html|title=New York Stories: DVD Information|date=|accessdate=2010-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123144435/http://currentfilm.com/dvdreviews4/newyorkstoriesdvd.html|archivedate=2010-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890303/REVIEWS/903030306/1023 |title=New York Stories by Roger Ebert|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Hinson of [[The Washington Post]] wrote a particularly scathing review, stating that "It's impossible to know what Francis Coppola's ''Life Without Zoë'' is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it's by far the director's worst work yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/newyorkstoriespghinson_a0a8de.htm |title=New York Stories (PG)|date= 1989-03-03|accessdate=2010-10-18|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved October 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, ''The Godfather Part III'' went on to gather 7 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film failed to win any of these awards, the only film in the trilogy not to do so.

====''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' (1992)====
{{Main|Bram Stoker's Dracula}}
In 1992, Coppola directed and produced ''Bram Stoker's Dracula''. Adapted from [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula|novel]], it was intended to be more faithful to the book than previous film adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic-horror.com/reviews/bram_stokers_dracula_1992 |title=Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola cast [[Gary Oldman]] in the film's title role, with [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1992&amp;p=.htm |title=1992 Domestic Grosses |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It fared even better overseas grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1992/0BRMS.php Movie Dracula – Box Office Data, News, Cast Information] from The Numbers&lt;/ref&gt; making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=1992&amp;p=.htm|title=Dracula box-office collections|accessdate=2010-11-30|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69lXuFalH?url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=1992&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=2012-08-08|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Editing]].

====''Jack'' (1996)====
{{Main|Jack (1996 film)}}
Coppola's next project was ''Jack'', which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred [[Robin Williams]] as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so at the age of ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With [[Diane Lane]], [[Brian Kerwin]] and [[Bill Cosby]], ''Jack'' also featured [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Fran Drescher]] and [[Michael McKean]] in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', in which [[Tom Hanks]] also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for ''Jack'', he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.

====''The Rainmaker'' (1997)====
{{Main|The Rainmaker (1997 film)}}
The last film Coppola directed in the 90s, ''The Rainmaker'', was based on the [[1995 in literature|1995]] [[The Rainmaker (John Grisham)|novel]] of the same name by [[John Grisham]]. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics, earning an 88% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1080867-rainmaker/|title=The Rainmaker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''The Rainmaker'' three stars out of four, remarking: "I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971121/REVIEWS/711210304/1023 ''The Rainmaker'' review] by [[Roger Ebert]], Chicago Sun-Times, November 21, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that "the intelligence and subtlety of ''The Rainmaker'' took me by surprise" and that the film "stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/r/rainmaker.html ''The Rainmaker'' review] by [[James Berardinelli]], ReelViews.net, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Grisham said of the film, "To me it's the best adaptation of any of [my books]...

====''Pinocchio'' dispute with Warner Bros.====
In the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th century novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and in 1991, Coppola and [[Warner Bros.]] began discussing the project as well as two others involving the life of [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the children's novel ''[[The Secret Garden#Dramatic adaptations|The Secret Garden]]''. These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the ''Pinocchio'' project for Warners, as well as ''[[The Secret Garden (1993 film)|The Secret Garden]]'' (which was made in 1993 and produced by [[American Zoetrope]], but directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]]) and ''Hoover'', which never came to fruition. (A film was eventually to be made by [[Clint Eastwood]] in 2011 as ''[[J. Edgar]]'', which was distributed by Warners.)

But, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warners came to disagreement over the compensation to be paid to Coppola for his directing services on ''Pinocchio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schleimerlaw.com/CourtAppealCoppola.htm |title=In the Court of Appeal of the State of California Second Appelate District |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties deferred this issue and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the ''Pinocchio'' film project. However, they also awarded him a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. This is the largest civil financial verdict ever against a Hollywood studio.

{{Main|Youth Without Youth (film)}}
After a 10-year hiatus, Coppola returned to directing with ''Youth Without Youth'' in 2007, based on the [[Youth Without Youth (novella)|novella]] of the same name by Romanian author [[Mircea Eliade]]. The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/youth_without_youth/ |title=Youth Without Youth (2007)|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=youthwithoutyouth.htm |title=Youth Without Youth|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films that results in trying to make films appeal to too wide an audience.

====''Tetro'' (2009)====
{{Main|Tetro}}
In 2009, Coppola released ''Tetro''. It was "set in Argentina, with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic Italian immigrant family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=39343 | title=Tetro | work=ComingSoon.net | publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P. | accessdate=August 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received generally positive reviews from critics.

Ebert also praised [[Vincent Gallo]]'s performance and claimed that [[Alden Ehrenreich]] is "the new [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?ID=/20090617/REVIEWS/906179993 |title=Tetro Movie Review – Roger Ebert |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=June 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111859/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?ID=%2F20090617%2FREVIEWS%2F906179993 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a B+ judging that "when Coppola finds creative [[nirvana]], he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940242.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=tetro | title=Tetro Review – Variety | publisher=Variety | date=May 14, 2009 | accessdate=June 23, 2009 | first=Todd | last=McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola "has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904079,00.html | title=Coppola's Tetro: An Offer You Can Refuse | accessdate=June 23, 2009 | publisher=TIME Magazine | date=June 11, 2009 | first=Richard | last=Corliss}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has made $2,636,774 worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tetro (2009) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tetro.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate = July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against a budget of $5,000,000.

==Commercial ventures==

===American Zoetrope===
In 1971, Coppola and [[George Lucas]] co-produced the latter's first film, ''[[THX 1138]]''. Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to [[Warner Bros.]], along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, [[American Zoetrope]]. However, studio executives strongly disliked all the scripts, including ''THX'' and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to reluctantly focus on ''[[The Godfather]]''.&lt;ref name="Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola" /&gt;

===Zoetrope Virtual Studio===
His company [[American Zoetrope]] also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000, the culmination of more than four years work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, plus new departments for other creative endeavours. Filmmaker members can workshop a wide range of film arts, including music, graphics, design and film and video.

===Inglenook Winery===
Coppola, with his family, expanded his business ventures to include winemaking in California's [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], when in 1975 he purchased the former home and adjoining vineyard of [[Gustave Niebaum]] in [[Rutherford, California]] using proceeds from the first movie in the ''[[Godfather Trilogy|Godfather]]'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He had planned to direct an epic movie named ''Megalopolis'', a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, but after the city was hit by the real life disaster of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the project was seen as being too sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangstyle.com/2012/04/best-films-never-made/ |title=10 Best Films Never Made |publisher=Bangstyle.com |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2013-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531165626/http://www.bangstyle.com/2012/04/best-films-never-made/ |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Coppola stated that "I have abandoned that as of now.

'''Frederic''' "'''Fred'''" '''Whitehurst''' is an American chemist and attorney who served as a [[Supervisory Special Agent]] in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory]] from 1986 to 1998. Concerned about problems he saw among agents, he went public as a [[whistleblower]] to bring attention to procedural errors and misconduct by agents. The FBI agreed to 40 reforms to improve the forensic reliability of its testing.

Based on new concerns about the reliability of hair analysis and learning that agents oversold it in court, the Department of Justice conducted a

== Biography ==

===Vietnam===
Whitehurst served as an intelligence specialist at the [[Americal]] base in [[Duc Pho|Đức Phổ]], [[Vietnam]] during the early 1970s. He was tasked with reviewing seized documents and destroying any that had no military value. Working with translator Sergeant Nguyen Trung Hieu and following his advice, he saved two diaries written by Dr. [[Dang Thuy Tram|Đặng Thùy Trâm]], a civilian woman doctor working for North Vietnam. He kept them for 35 years, with the intention of eventually returning them to Trâm's family, if possible.

===FBI career===
Dr. Whitehurst received a Ph.D. in chemistry from [[Duke University]], and a J.D. from [[Georgetown University]]. He joined the [[FBI]] in 1982 and served as a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI crime lab from 1986-1998.

While he was employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory, the FBI officially rated Dr. Whitehurst as the leading national and international expert in the science of explosives and explosives residue. Concerned about a number of issues that he observed and by the behavior of agents in the laboratory, he began to investigate their procedures. He eventually uncovered and reported what he thought were cases of scientific misconduct, alleging that the agents were biased toward the prosecution. In the OIG's report of Whitehurst's allegations, it was concluded that,"most of Whitehurst allegations were not substantiated," and that Mr, Whitehurst had, "common sense and judgement to serve as forensics examiner. The FBI crime lab finally agreed to forty major reforms, including undergoing an accreditation process. During this period, to protect himself in administrative proceedings, Whitehurst hired [[Kohn, Kohn &amp; Colapinto]], a Washington, D.C. law firm specializing in defending [[whistleblowers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PpjvumZdqo8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20fbi&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The FBI Laboratory: An Investigation Into Laboratory Practices and Alleged ...]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-FBI years==
Dr. Whitehurst currently serves as the Executive Director of the [http://www.forensicjustice.org/ ''Forensic Justice Project''] (FJP). The FJP was formed in 1998 as a project of the [[National Whistleblower Center]], a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The goal of the FJP is to lead a national effort to accomplish the following:
* Review cases to make sure that innocent people have not been wrongfully convicted through the misuse of forensic science;
* Provide expert testimony in cases in order to assure that forensic science is not misused in civil and criminal prosecutions impacting on the public interest or the rights of individuals;
* Offer objective scientific evaluations of forensic evidence;
* Publish and distribute information necessary for an objective analysis of the quality and objectivity of forensic science and crime laboratories nationwide.

Dr. Whitehurst practices criminal law in [[Bethel, North Carolina]]. He was elected to the commission of the town of Bethel.

===The Diaries===
In March 2005, he and his brother Robert (also a Vietnam War veteran) brought the Đặng Thùy Trâm diaries to a conference on the Vietnam War at [[Texas Tech University]]. There, they met photographer Ted Engelmann (also a Vietnam veteran), who offered to look for the family during his trip to Vietnam the next month. With the assistance of Đỗ Xuân Anh, a staff member in the Hanoi [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] office, Engelmann was able to locate Trâm’s mother, Doãn Ngọc Trâm. He obtained connections to the rest of her family.[http://www.vir.com.vn/Client/TimeOut/index.asp?url=content.asp&amp;doc=7080]

In July 2005, Trâm’s diaries were published in Vietnamese under the title ''Nhật ký Đặng Thùy Trâm'' (''Đặng Thùy Trâm’s Diary''), which quickly became a bestseller. In less than a year, the volume sold more than 300,000 copies, and comparisons were drawn between Trâm’s writings and that of [[Anne Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=252470&amp;rel_no=1|title=Vietcong Doctor's Diary of War, Sacrifice - OhmyNews International|website=english.ohmynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/diary-of-a-vietcong-doctor-the-anne-frank-of-vietnam-317801.html|title=Diary of a Vietcong doctor: The Anne Frank of Vietnam|date=7 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Fred and Robert Whitehurst traveled to [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, to meet Trâm’s family. In October of the same year, the Vietnamese family came to [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]], to view the diaries, which are archived at Texas Tech University's [http://archive.vietnam.ttu.edu/vietnamarchive/index.htm Vietnam Archive]. They visited Fred Whitehurst and his family in his home state of [[North Carolina]].

The diaries have been [http://archive.vietnam.ttu.edu/vietnamcenter/diary/index.htm translated into English] and published in September 2007. The book includes photographs of Đặng during high school and with her family. Additional translations have been made and the book has been published in at least sixteen different languages.

In 2009 a film about Đặng Thùy Trâm by Vietnamese director [[Đặng Nhật Minh]], entitled ''Đừng Đốt'' (''Do Not Burn It''), was released.

==Legacy==
During his military service in Vietnam, Whitehurst saved [[Dang Thuy Tram|Dr. Đặng Thùy Trâm]]'s diaries, which were first published in 2005 and are the basis for the 2009 film ''Đừng Đốt'' (Don't Burn It).  In addition, as noted above, he investigated, uncovered and reported scientific misconduct which forced the FBI crime lab to agree to forty major reforms, including undergoing an accreditation process.

'''Gilbert Austin''' (1753–1837) was an Irish educator, clergyman and author. Austin is best known for his 1806 book on [[chironomia]], ''Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery''. Heavily influenced by classical writers, Austin stressed the importance of voice and gesture to a successful oration.

==Biographical information==
Gilbert Austin was born in 1753 in [[County Louth]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. Educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Austin received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1774 and his Master of Arts degree in 1780. After graduating, Austin established a private school in [[Dublin]] where he taught the sons of Ireland's elite, including [[Augustus Frederick FitzGerald]], later Third [[Duke of Leinster]] (Robb and Thonssen 1966:xv-xvi). Austin inscribed his best-known work, ''Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery'', to another of his former pupils, [[Francis William Caulfeild]], [[Earl of Charlemont]].

An active member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], Austin wrote several scientific papers describing his inventions. In 1789, Austin edited and published a collection of poems by Irish writer [[Thomas Dermody]]. Austin also published a number of his sermons, including the collection ''Sermons on Practical Subjects''. Austin began work on his most famous book, ''Chironomia'', in the 1770s but it was not published until 1806.

Austin held several clerical appointments in the [[Church of Ireland]]. In 1798, Austin became a minor canon of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]]. From 1816 until his death in 1837, Austin was [[Vicar]] of Laraghbryan (or [[Maynooth]]), a living to which he was presented by his former pupil, the [[Duke of Leinster]]. Austin also held the [[prebendary]] of [[Blackrath]] from 1821 to 1835 (Robb and Thonssen 1966:xvi).

==Works==

===Scientific articles===
Between 1790 and 1803, Austin published three articles in the ''Transactions of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]''. Philippa Spoel (1998) writes, "these articles, which describe the construction and application of chemical apparatus invented by Austin, demonstrate his involvement...with the flourishing field of chemistry" (7). The inventions Austin described include a portable [[barometer]], a mechanism for filling water with [[carbon dioxide]], and an apparatus for collecting gasses over water and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. In 1813, Austin published "On a New Construction of a Condenser and Air-Pump" in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the [[Royal Society of London]]''.

===Sermons and other writing===
In 1789, Austin edited and published [[Thomas Dermody]]'s first collection of poetry, ''Poems''.
In 1794, Austin published ''A Sermon on a Future State: Combating the Opinion that "Death is Eternal Sleep."'' American author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (1844) described Austin's sermon as "nearly, if not quite the best 'Essay on a Future State' " (584). Austin published ''Sermons on Practical Subjects'' in 1795 and ''A Sermon for the Support of [[Mercer's Hospital]]'' in 1796.

===''Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery''===
In the preface to ''Chironomia'', Austin writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;...it is a fact, that we do not possess from the ancients, nor yet from the labours of our own countrymen, any sufficiently detailed and precise precepts for the fifth division of the art of [[rhetoric]], namely rhetorical delivery, called by the ancients ''[[actio]]'' and ''[[pronuntiatio]]''. (ix)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Austin observed that British [[orators]] were skilled in the first four divisions of [[rhetoric]]: [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[memoria]]. However, the fifth division, [[pronuntiatio]] or delivery, was all but ignored. Delivery, which is often improperly referred to as [[elocution]] ([[elocutio]]), concerns the use of voice and [[gesture]] in an oration. Rather than study the art of delivery, [[orators]] trusted to the inspiration of the moment to guide their voices and gestures. Austin describes this as a reliance on "gestures imperfectly conceived...which will consequently be imperfectly executed" (5).

''Chironomia'' is a treatise on the importance of good delivery. Good delivery, Austin notes, can "conceal in some degree the blemishes of the composition, or the matter delivered, and...add lustre to its beauties" (187). In the first part of the book, Austin traces the study of the art of delivery from the classical world to the 18th century. The second part of the book is devoted to a description of the notation system Austin designed to teach students of [[rhetoric]] the management of [[gesture]] and voice. The system of notation is accompanied by a series of illustrations depicting positions of the feet, body and hands.

Throughout ''Chironomia'', Austin instructs speakers to avoid the appearance of vulgarity or rusticity. Austin first developed the system of notation described in ''Chironomia'' at his school for privileged young men. Austin's goal was to prepare his students for a life in the church or politics by training them to become better orators. Although Austin's system was eventually dismissed as too rigidly prescriptive, ''Chironomia'' was a highly influential book during the 19th century.

====Influences====
Discussing the need for a treatise on delivery, Austin writes "during my examination of modern writers, it has appeared to me, that, with little exception, they have neglected to pay due attention to the precepts and authority of the great and ancient masters" (v). Austin remedies this oversight by compiling a collection of classical sources on the art of delivery. Austin was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]]. [[Cicero]] refers to action as the "language of the body" and the art of delivery as "corporeal eloquence" (Austin [1806] 1966:1). Austin attributes to [[Quintilian]] the use of the word ''chironomia'' to refer to the art of gesture (2). In ''Chironomia'', Austin quotes extensively from [[Cicero]]'s ''De oratore'' and [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio oratoria''.

Austin also cites [[Ludovicus Cressolius]]'s 1620 book ''Vacationes Autumales sive de perfecta Oratoris, Actione, et Pronuntiatione'' and the work of [[Caussinus]] as influences. Despite their use of the term elocution for the art Austin calls delivery, Austin refers to [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]]'s ''Lectures on Elocution'' (1762) and John Walker's ''Elements of Elocution'' (1781) in his discussion of voice and countenance.

Austin's work would appear to be a direct descendent of [[John Bulwer]]'s book ''Chirologia, or, the Natural Language of the Hand'' which, when it was published in 1644, also included Bulwer's work ''Chironomia; or, the Art of Manual Rhetoricke''. However, Austin does not mention Bulwer anywhere in his ''Chironomia''. Robb and Thonssen (1966) suggest this is because Austin was unfamiliar with Bulwer's book (xi).

====Voice and countenance====
Austin was concerned with both the quality and management of the voice; he considered the former a gift of nature and the latter a matter of art (29). Austin developed rules for the management of articulation, pronunciation and emphasis. On articulation, Austin writes &lt;blockquote&gt;[words] are to be delivered out from the lips, as beautiful coins newly issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, sharp, in due succession and of due weight. (38)&lt;/blockquote&gt; Austin agreed with [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Sheridan]]'s advice that good articulation consisted of pronouncing each syllable distinctly and with proper emphasis (37). Austin's rules for pronunciation address the issue of the provincial accent, something Austin labels "a stain of rusticity" (47). Austin encouraged his students to rid themselves of their provincial accent in favour of a courtly accent.

In addition to his rules for the management of the voice, Austin also addresses issues of vocal quality including pitch, volume and variety. Austin was also concerned with the management of facial expression. Austin stresses the importance of using appropriate tones of voice, facial expressions and gestures to convey sincerity.

====Gesture====
Austin describes [[gesture]] as the "action and position of all the parts of the body" (133) and attributes to gesture the power to convey meaning. During the 18th century, speakers preferred the natural style of gesture but Austin warns against this style saying that speakers who rely on nature run the risk of displaying "the untutored extravagance and uncouth motions of the vulgar" (138 see ''Plate 2, Figures 8 and 9'' below). By following Austin's guidelines, speakers could improve their delivery by matching their gestures to their words. Austin advises his students, however, that gesture should be used with restraint and only when appropriate (137).

====System of notation====
Austin's system of notation begins with the placement of the body in an imaginary sphere (see ''Plate 2, Fig. 18'' below). The speaker then moves his or her body, feet or hands toward one of the points on the sphere. Each movement is assigned a notation that specifies the direction and manner in which the speaker should move. The speaker should include these notations in the text of his or her speech so that he or she knows when and how to move. Notation regarding the hands is written above the sentence; notation regarding the feet is written below. For instance, the notation ''Bcl. e f sh.'' above a word indicates that the speaker should clasp both hands and extend them forward at shoulder height in a shaking motion (see ''Plate 8, Fig. 75'' below).  The notation ''L 1 x'' under a word indicates that the speaker should advance the left foot and bend the right knee. Austin also provides a notation system for the voice. Notation marks are placed at the beginning of a passage and then throughout the text whenever the speaker is to change the tone or rapidity of his or her vocal delivery.

====Illustrations====
The text of ''Chironomia'' is accompanied by 12 engraved plates depicting various positions of the feet, arms and body. Austin credits [[George Chinnery]] as the original artist but claims that he could not afford to pay Chinnery to complete the engravings. An anonymous young man was employed to alter and complete the plates (Austin [1806] 1966:viii).

[[Image:Chironomia StandingFigures.PNG|150px|thumb|left|"The position of the orator is equally removed from the awkwardness of the rustic with toes turned in and knees bent, and from the affectation of the dancing-master, constrained and prepared for springing agility and for conceited display" (''Chironomia'' Plate 1, Figures 8, 9).]]

[[Image:Chironomia Sphere.jpg|150px|thumb|left|"The human figure being supposed to be so placed within this sphere, that the centre of the breast shall coincide with its centre, and that the diameter of the horizontal circle perpendicular to a radius drawn to the projecting point, shall pass through the shoulders, the positions and motions of the arms are referred to and determined by these circles and their intersections" (''Chironomia'' Plate 2, Figure 18.)]]

====Influence and criticism====
Robb and Thonssen (1966) write, "until the teaching of [[François Delsarte|[François] Delsarte]]...Austin was the authority on teaching gesture" (xvii). With the publication of ''Chironomia'', Austin's influence extended beyond his own school to classrooms throughout Britain and America. By the end of the 19th century, however, ''Chironomia'' had fallen from favour. Austin's method was considered too mechanical for modern tastes. G. P. Mohrmann (1968) claims the misperception of ''Chironomia'' as rigidly prescriptive is due to a lack of critical analysis of Austin's method (18). Spoel (1998) describes ''Chironomia'' as "a unique socially and historically situated representation of bodily discipline" (5). ''Chironomia'' remains of interest to scholars not only for its insight into late-18th and early-19th century rhetorical practices but also for its collection of classical writings on delivery.

'''Giuseppe Di Vittorio''', also known under the [[pseudonym]] ''Nicoletti'' (August 11, 1892 – November 3, 1957), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[syndicalist]] and [[communist]] politician. He was one of the most influential [[trade union]] leaders of the [[labour movement]] after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Di Vittorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of  Di Vittorio|url=http://www.casadivittorio.it/biografia.html|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born at [[Cerignola]], [[Apulia]], into a family of poor agricultural day laborers. As an [[autodidacticism|autodidact]], Di Vittorio became active in the [[socialist]] movement in adolescence. At 15, he was a member of the Socialist Youth Circle in Cerignola, and in 1911, he moved to lead the [[Camera del Lavoro]] in [[Minervino Murge]] and then the one in [[Bari]].

He was among the most influential union leaders in the history of the labour movement, leading the Confederazione Generate Italiana dei Lavoratori (CGIL) in its refounding after fascism and the powerful World Federation of Trade Unions(FSM) after World War II.

After his father's death, Di Vittorio was forced to leave school and work as a day laborer. He joined the May 1904 general strike during which five workers were killed by troops in Cerignola. Di Vittorio was strongly influenced by the growth of peasants' organizations and the spread of socialist ideas, giving rise to his participation in the local young socialist organization in Cerignola. He was radicalised by affiliating with the national Federazione Giovanile Socialista (Federation of Young Socialists), led by syndicalists in opposition to the official Socialist Party Youth Federation.

As a native of the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'', Di Vittorio became involved in the syndicalist plans for solving the region's acute problems in the manner illustrated by the [[Fasci Siciliani]] in final decade of the 19th century. A partisan of [[insurgence]], Di Vittorio became a leader of an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union, [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]], after its formation in 1912. Unlike the majority of the group, which opposed [[militarism]] and Italy's entry into [[World War I]]), Di Vittorio, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Filippo Corridoni]] advocated [[irredentism]]. He then fought in the conflict and was discharged after he had been gravely wounded.

==Antifascism==
In 1921, after the [[Italian Socialist Party]]'s split at the Congress of [[Livorno]], he joined the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCd'I). Di Vittorio joined the militant antifascist organization ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', and hevwas then elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] on the PCI list in 1924. The new situation after the rise of [[fascism]] and the [[March on Rome]] made him an enemy of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime. Sentenced to twelve years in prison by a fascist special tribunal in 1925, he managed to flee to [[France]], where he refounded the dissolved [[Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro]] (CGIL) and led it into the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-managed [[Profintern]]. Di Vittorio lived in the Soviet state from 1928 to 1930, representing Italy to the [[Red Peasant International]]. He then returned to [[Paris]], where he entered the [[Politburo]] of the PCI.

He joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side fighting [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936. He was Political Commissar of the [[XI International Brigade]]. After the fall of the Republic, he headed the board of a Paris-based antifascist newspaper. During the [[World War II]], after the [[Fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]], Di Vittorio was arrested by Nazis, taken in custody by the Italian police and detained on [[Ventotene]]. In 1943, as the Fascist regime fell in most of Italy, he was set free by [[partisan (military)|partisans]], and he joined the [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]] in fighting against Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]], in Northern Italy.

==Postwar==
When war ended in 1945, he was elected secretary of the CGIL, which he had helped return to politics through a pact signed the previous year with [[Achille Grandi]] and [[Oreste Lizzardi]] in [[Rome]]. The pact recreated CGIL as a representative of all currents of trade unionism in Italy [[Partito Comunista Italiano|communist]], [[Partito Socialista Italiano|socialist]], [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian-democrats]] and anarcho-syndicalists. In 1948, the organisation split after a [[general strike]], protesting the [[assassination]] attempt on PCI leader [[Palmiro Togliatti]]. The Christian Democrats left to form the [[Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori]]. On March 5, 1950, the Social Democrats, who would join the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]], left to form the [[Unione Italiana del Lavoro]].

Di Vittorio led the CGIL, as a group favoured by the PCI and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], until his death at [[Lecco]], in 1957. He was also a longtime leader of the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. His strong charisma made him the most popular myth of the Italian workers. His funeral was attended by more than three million people coming to Rome from all over Italy. 

He was followed in his position at the CGIL by [[Agostino Novella]].

The cutting of the '''Hands of Perón''' refers to a 1987 incident where the tomb of [[Juan Perón]], former [[President of Argentina]], was broken into and his hands dismembered and removed by persons unknown.

==The incident==

Perón died in July 1974. His casket remained in the ''[[Quinta de Olivos]]'' presidential residence until the [[March 1976 coup]]. The coffin was then placed in the Perón family tomb in [[Chacarita Cemetery]], located in the [[Chacarita, Buenos Aires|Chacarita]] ward of the city of [[Buenos Aires]].

In July 1987, 13 years after his death, the Peronist [[Justicialist Party]] received an anonymous letter claiming Perón's hands had been removed from his tomb along with his army cap and sword; the letter demanded the party pay an US$8 million ransom for their return.&lt;ref name=times1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/world/peron-hands-police-find-trail-elusive.html "Peron Hands: Police Find Trail Elusive."] The ''New York Times'', September 6, 1987. Accessed October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cst"&gt;"Grave robbers cut off hands of Juan Peron". The ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 3, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; When authorities checked Perón's tomb, they discovered that it had indeed been broken into and the hands and other items removed.&lt;ref name=times1/&gt; Forensic experts who examined the body said the mutilation had occurred only a short time before the discovery. One source&lt;ref name=lyman&gt;Johnson, Lyman L. ''Death, Dismemberment and Memory: Body Politics in Latin America.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8263-3201-3}}. Pp. 251-253.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the tomb was broken into on June 23, 1987, and that a poem written to him by his last wife, [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], had also been removed from the tomb.  At the time, some news reports stated that the hands had been removed with "a surgical instrument",&lt;ref name=times1/&gt; but later reports state that the dismemberment had been done with an electric saw.&lt;ref name="lyman"/&gt;

The head of the Justicialist Party, [[Vicente Saadi]], refused to allow the ransom to be paid.&lt;ref name=times1/&gt; A criminal investigation was begun under the leadership of judge Jaime Far Suau: although six men were arrested and five arraigned,&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;"5 Arraigned in Theft of Juan Peron's Hands". ''The Los Angeles Times'', September 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; none were charged in relation to the incident.&lt;ref name=times1/&gt; No suspect has ever been charged, and the hands have never been recovered.&lt;ref name=lyman/&gt;

Many of those involved in the investigation of the disappearance of Perón's hands (including Judge Far Suau) have since died, some under circumstances considered questionable.&lt;ref name=lyman/&gt; There is evidence that the theft had some sort of official support, as the robbers used a key to enter the tomb.&lt;ref name=lyman/&gt;

Argentinian anthropologist&lt;ref name=guberstatus&gt;Verdery, Katherine. ''The Political Lives of Dead Bodies: Reburial and Post-Socialist Change.'' New York, Columbia University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-231-11230-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosana Guber has written that Perón's hands were seen by Argentinians as a symbol of his power, and that their theft was not just a simple criminal matter but also had deep cultural meaning; she viewed the debate about the hands as symbolic of the attempt to promote democracy in the country.&lt;ref name=lyman/&gt; Lyman Johnson viewed the dismemberment as "a catalyst to destroy the symbolic cult of Perón".&lt;ref name="lyman"/&gt; With Perón's hands gone, Lyman wrote, his body became less important and his importance as a religious figure also decreased in comparison to that of his second wife, [[Eva Perón]].

In their book ''Second Death: Licio Gelli, The P2 Masonic Lodge and The Plot to Destroy Juan Peron'', writers [[Damian Nabot]] and David Cox write that the [[Masonic lodge]] [[Propaganda Due|P2]], also known as the Propaganda Due, were involved in the theft, and that there was a ritual involved in the cutting of Peron's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Nabot, Damian, and Cox, David. ''Second Death: Licio Gelli, The P2 Masonic Lodge and The Plot to Destroy Juan Peron'' Amazon, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other people - like writer Ciriaco Offeddu - put forward the idea that in fact Perón did not belong to the Peron family but that he was a Sardinian orphan from Mamoiada, adopted when very young. To hide his true identity his hands were removed. People of Mamoiada are famous for their ferocity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Iacob C. Negruzzi''' (December 31, 1842 – January 6, 1932) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n poet and prose writer.

Born in [[Iași]], he was the son of [[Constantin Negruzzi]] and his wife Maria (''née'' Gane). Living in Berlin between 1853 and 1863, he attended high school, followed by the [[University of Berlin]], from which he obtained a doctorate in 1863. He was a professor at the [[University of Iași]] from 1864 to 1884, and at the [[University of Bucharest]] from 1885 until his retirement in 1897. He was elected to the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]] in 1870, and later joined the [[Romanian Senate]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; He was elected a titular [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=N Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; was later its general secretary,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; and served three terms as Academy president: 1893-1894, 1910-1913 and 1923-1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/academia2002/acadrom/pag04.htm Președinți ai Academiei Române (1867-1901)] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/academia2002/acadrom/pag04b.htm Președinți ai Academiei Române (1901-1959)] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; Negruzzi was among the founders of ''[[Junimea]]'', and became its secretary in 1868. He played a very significant role as editor of ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', ensuring the magazine's regular appearance by investing an immense amount of energy and making significant sacrifices, including material ones. He continued as editor for ten years after moving to [[Bucharest]] in 1885. He wrote reviews and notes in ''Convorbiri''; published selections from ''Copii de pe natură'' (which appeared in book form in 1874), as well as the novel ''Mihai Vereanu'' (which appeared in 1873); and initiated a column called "Corespondență", probably the country's first true [[letter to the editor]] section.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

His press debut came in 1866, with a one-act play that appeared in ''Foaia Soțietății pentru Literatura și Cultura Română în Bucovina''; his first book was the 1872 ''Poezii''. Although written starting in 1889, ''Amintirile din "Junimea"'' was only published in 1921. He translated several plays by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (''[[The Robbers]]'', ''[[Fiesco (play)|Fiesco]]'' and ''[[Intrigue and Love]]'' appeared in book form in 1871; ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' in ''Convorbiri Literare'' in 1883; ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' and ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'' in the last of his six-volume complete works that came out between 1893 and 1897). Other translations included Romantic poetry, both French ([[Victor Hugo]]) and German (Schiller and [[Heinrich Heine]]), published in ''Poezii''.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol.

'''Jackie Wallace''' (born March 13, 1951) is a former American college and professional [[American football|football]] [[cornerback]]. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Arizona]] from 1970 through 1972 and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Baltimore Colts]], and [[Los Angeles Rams]] from 1974 through 1979. Wallace appeared in two [[Super Bowl]]s.

Since the end of his NFL career, Wallace has periodically struggled with [[substance abuse]] and experienced bouts of homelessness. In 2014, he joined a class-action [[concussion]] lawsuit against the NFL. As of February 2018, his whereabouts were unknown.

==Early life==
Wallace was born in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he lived in the [[St. Bernard Projects]].&lt;ref name=nola&gt;{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Ted |authorlink=Ted Jackson |url=http://www.nola.com/living/index.ssf/2018/02/jackie_wallace_ted_jackson.html#incart_2box_nola_river_orleans_news |title=The search for Jackie Wallace |newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] |location=[[New Orleans]] |date=February 3, 2018 |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Wallace attended [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] in New Orleans. He enrolled at the [[University of Arizona]] and played [[college football]] for the [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona Wildcats]] from 1970 through 1972.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; [[United Press International]] and ''[[Sporting News]]'' named him a first-team [[All-America]] in 1972, while the [[Associated Press]] named him a third-team All-American. He was named to the All-[[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) team in his junior and senior years. Wallace had 20 [[interception]]s with the Wildcats, the second-most in school history, with 19 of those coming in his junior and senior years. His 11 interceptions in 1971 is a WAC record.&lt;ref name=tucson&gt;{{cite news |last=Gimino |first=Anthony |title=Top 50 football players in Arizona Wildcats history: No. 13 Jackie Wallace |format=site works without JavaScript |location=[[Arizona]] |newspaper=[[The Tucson Citizen]] (Gannett Co.

The [[Minnesota Vikings]] selected Wallace in the second round, with the 34th overall pick, in the [[1973 NFL draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steadman |first=John |authorlink=John Steadman |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-17/sports/1990290178_1_jackie-wallace-crack-cocaine-new-orleans |title=Ex-Colt Wallace is bridging gap back to society |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=October 17, 1990 |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace played six professional seasons as a [[Defensive back|cornerback]] from 1974 through 1979. He spent his [[rookie]] season on the Vikings' [[practice squad]], including [[Super Bowl VIII]]. He became a starter for the Vikings the next year, and started in [[Super Bowl IX]].&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt;

Wallace played for the [[Baltimore Colts]] in 1975 and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] from 1976 through 1979. His 52 [[punt return]]s and 618 punt return yards led the NFL in 1978. His final game in the NFL was [[Super Bowl XIV]] as a member of the Rams. After the game, he berated his coach in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] locker room for not using him in the game, saying the coach could "kiss his ass".&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt; That offseason, he was disinvited from the [[Super Bowl ring]] party and cut from the team.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt; He retired with 11 career interceptions in 70 [[games played]].&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt;

==Post-football life==
Out of the NFL, Wallace worked on an [[oil platform]]. The year after his football career ended, his mother died and he began to abuse alcohol and use [[crack cocaine]]. He has battled addictions to numerous drugs, including crack, alcohol, and heroin, throughout his life, and has disappeared for years at a time.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt;

[[Ted Jackson]], a photojournalist for ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'', discovered him homeless on the streets of New Orleans in 1990, which inspired Wallace to make an attempt at recovery; at the time, his whereabouts had been unknown for roughly a decade. He became sober, got married, and bought a house in the northeastern suburbs of [[Baltimore]]. His sobriety lasted until 2002, when a domestic dispute with his wife led to him fleeing back to the streets of New Orleans. After several years of drug use, he was jailed in 2008 for check fraud, serving half of a seven-year sentence; released early for good behavior.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt; On June 5, 2012, the [[WDSU]] television channel in New Orleans ran an article about the New Orleans Mission (a [[homeless shelter]]) closing its doors due to financial problems. In the article, Wallace stated that he was homeless and had been frequenting the shelter for two months.&lt;ref name="WDSU"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Orleans Mission to close Saturday amid financial woes |format=Page may require JavaScript |publisher=[[WDSU]] |date=June 5, 2012 |url= http://www.wdsu.com/article/new-orleans-mission-to-close-saturday-amid-financial-woes-1/3357337 |accessdate=February 5, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205234753/http://www.wdsu.com/article/new-orleans-mission-to-close-saturday-amid-financial-woes-1/3357337 |archivedate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace achieved sobriety again in 2014 and joined [[Narcotics Anonymous]]; the same year, Wallace took part in a [[Concussions in American football#Federal_NFL_concussion_litigation|lawsuit against the NFL]] regarding [[concussion]]s.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tomasson |first=Chris |title=Former Vikings Super Bowl starter among those filing concussion suit against NFL |newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |location=[[Minnesota]] |date=June 2, 2014 |url=http://blogs.twincities.com/vikings/2014/06/02/former-vikings-super-bowl-starter-among-those-filing-concussion-suit-against-nfl |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Wallace disappeared again, having relapsed and returned to the streets. Since then, his exact whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="nola"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9884">'''Jan Salick''' is an American [[botanist]] who researches the interaction between humans and plants ([[ethnobotany]]) and [[conservation biology]]. Her specialisms include [[alpine climate|alpine environment]]s, [[climate change]], [[indigenous peoples]] and [[traditional knowledge]]. She is a past-president of the [[Society for Economic Botany]] and holds their Distinguished Economic Botanist award. As of 2017, she is the Curator of Ethnobotany at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].

==Education==
Salick gained her BA at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1973 and her MS from [[Duke University]] in 1977, both in biology. Her PhD in [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] was from [[Cornell University]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=Conservation_Forum_2001&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.umsl.edu/~hwec/Whitney%20R.%20Harris%20World%20Ecology%20Center/assets/pdfs/forum/Program2001.pdf |title=Conservation Forum Program |publisher=Conservation Forum |date=2001 |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.swchina.wisc.edu/cvs/cvsalick.pdf |title=Jan Salick: Curator of Ethnobotany, Missouri Botanical Garden and Professor, Biology Department, Washington University &amp; University of Missouri |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was a student of [[Richard B.

==Career and research==
Salick worked at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (1983–89), rising to Assistant Curator. She then joined the Department of Plant Biology at [[Ohio University]] (1989–2000) as assistant and then associate professor of tropical ecology and [[ethnobotany]]. She has since been Curator of Ethnobotany at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] in [[St. Louis]],&lt;ref name=Conservation_Forum_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CV /&gt; and is also an adjunct professor of biology at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://wubio.wustl.edu/people/jan-salick |title=Jan Salick: Honorary Adjunct Professor of Biology |publisher=[[Washington University in St. Louis]] |accessdate=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the focuses of her recent research has been the [[alpine climate|alpine environment]] of the [[Himalayas]], and in particular, the effects of [[climate change]] and human activities.&lt;ref name=MBG&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/plant-science/plant-science/research-staff/article/510/salick-jan.aspx |title=Research Staff |publisher=[[Missouri Botanical Garden]] |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with partners in China, Nepal and Bhutan to establish the Himalayan team of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA), an international network that aims to document plant life diversity in alpine regions globally and to study how it is affected by climate change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5222199 |title=Breathless Work in the High Himalayas |author=Elizabeth Arnold |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gloria.ac.at/about_involved.html |title=Persons involved in GLORIA |publisher=Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments |accessdate=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants used in [[traditional medicine]] and other forms of [[traditional knowledge]] are another interest.&lt;ref name=MBG /&gt; With Wayne Law, Salick documented how the [[Saussurea laniceps|cotton-headed snow lotus]] (''Saussurea laniceps''), a rare species of Himalayan snow lotus used in traditional [[Chinese medicine]] and also often collected by tourists, has decreased in height over a century, apparently in response to pressure from humans selectively picking taller plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/science/earth/the-case-of-the-shrinking-lotus.html |title=The Case of the Shrinking Lotus |author=James Gorman |journal=[[New York Times]] |date=5 July 2005 |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Law W, Salick J | title=Human-induced dwarfing of Himalayan snow lotus, ''Saussurea laniceps'' (Asteraceae) | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume= 102| issue=29 | year=2005 | pages=10218–10220 | pmid=16006524 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0502931102 | pmc=1177378}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also published on the impact of traditional agricultural and forestry practices, for example, among the [[Yanesha people|Yanesha]] (or Amuesha) people living on the upper [[Amazon River|Amazon]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=J Salick, N Cellinese, S Knapp |year=1997 |title=Indigenous diversity of cassava: generation, maintenance, use and loss among the Amuesha, Peruvian upper Amazon |journal=[[Economic Botany]] |volume=51 |pages=6–19 |doi=10.1007/bf02910400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Javanese Malaysians''' are people of full or partial [[Javanese people|Javanese]] descent who were born in or immigrated to [[Malaysia]]. They form a significant part of Malaysia's population and Malaysian law considers most of them to be [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. Malaysia is home to the largest Javanese population outside Indonesia.

The majority of Javanese Malaysians originated from [[Central Java]], via migrants from the [[Dutch East Indies]] looking for new opportunities in [[British Malaya]]. Despite many of them arrived through the colonial era, there are also who arrived through the [[World War II]] to both Japanese-occupied British Malaya and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] as [[forced labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shigeru Sato|title=War, Nationalism and Peasants: Java Under the Japanese Occupation, 1942-45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta_ACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|date=June 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45236-2|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Wallace Braithwaite|title=Fighting Monsters: An Intimate History of the Sandakan Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HD63DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT278|year=2016|publisher=Australian Scholarly Publishing|isbn=978-1-925333-76-3|pages=278–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, they live predominantly in the [[West Malaysia]]n states of [[Johor]], [[Perak]] and [[Selangor]] with significant minorities found in [[East Malaysia]] especially in the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/17000/MY|title=Javanese, Orang Jawa in Malaysia|author=Joshua Project|work=joshuaproject.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Malaysians of Javanese descent have [[Malayisation|assimilated into the local Malay culture]], and speak [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] as a native tongue and first language rather than the [[Javanese language]] of their ancestors. This occurs through usual assimilation, as well as intermarriages with other ethnic groups. This qualifies them as [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]] under Malaysian law. The situation is identical with the Javanese in [[Singapore]], where they are considered [[Malay Singaporean|Malay]].

[[File:JerryPotts.jpg|thumb|250px|Jerry Potts]]
'''Jerry Potts''' (1840 – July 14, 1896), (also known as ''Ky-yo-kosi'', meaning "Bear Child"), was an [[Americans|American]] - [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[:wikt:plainsman|plainsman]], [[buffalo hunter]], [[horse trader]], [[interpreter]], and [[Reconnaissance|scout]] of [[Kainai (Blood) and Scots]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=40494] Jerry Potts, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Forty years In Canada: Reminiscences of the Great North-West' by S.B. Steele, ed M. G Niblett (Toronto and London, 1918, reprinted 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Potts was born near Fort McKenzie,  the only child of his [[Kainai Nation|Kainai]] (''Akáínaa'' - "Many Chief", while ''Káína'' - "Many Chief people")&lt;ref&gt;The enemy Plains Cree called the Kainai ''Miko-Ew'' - "stained with blood", i.e. "the bloodthirsty, cruel", therefore, the common English name for the tribe is the "Blood tribe."&lt;/ref&gt; mother ''Namo-pisi'' (Crooked Back) and Andrew R. Potts, a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fur trade]]r. 1840; . Upon the death of his father in 1840, Jerry was given to American Fur Company trader Alexander Harvey by Namo-pisi prior to her rejoining her tribe. A violent, vindictive man, Harvey neglected and mistreated Potts before deserting him in 1845. [[American Fur Company]] trader Andrew Dawson of [[Fort Benton, Montana]], a gentle man who was called "the last king of the Missouri," then adopted young Potts. He taught the boy to read and write and allowed him to mix with the Indians who visited the trading post to learn their customs and languages. In his late teens Potts, who adopted the carefree mannerisms of the frontier, joined his mother’s people and from then on drifted between them and Dawson. As a person of mixed blood, he had to prove to both Métis and whites that he could cope in their respective cultures, and was well served by his quick wits, reckless bravery, skills with the knife and lethal accuracy with both a revolver and a rifle.

==Adulthood==
When he became an adult through puberty, Potts was employed for several years by the [[American Fur Company]], and from 1869 to 1874 he worked as a hunter for various whiskey traders. Much of this period of his life was shadowed by violence. He gained fame as an Indian warrior, and almost legendary accounts of his battles with the traditional enemies of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], to which his mother's people belonged - the [[Sioux]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], and the mighty [[Iron Confederacy|Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat)]] ([[Cree]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney)]] abound.

Potts married two members of the [[Piegan Blackfeet]] (or ''Aamsskáápipikani'' - ″Southern Piikáni/Peigan″) named Panther Woman and Spotted Killer. Between the pair he sired several sons and several daughters. He considered himself a Piegan but he kept his Kainai name, Kyi-yo-Kosi (Bear Child).

By the time Potts was twenty-five, he was a wealthy man because of his [[horse trading]]. His herd rarely averaged less than 100 horses which made him the second wealthiest Indian in the area as wealth was measured by the Plains Indians in the number of horses a man owned. That his horses carried a number of diverse brands meant nothing. He could always produce bills of sale (even though he could not read them himself) for most of them. Those without papers, if they were American horses, were sold in Canada while paperless Canadian horses were sold south of the Medicine Line. Those branded with the markings of the US Cavalry were sold as far north as possible unless he had papers proving they had been purchased legally.

The going rate for a good horse at the time ranged between $75.00 to $150.00 so his large inventory showed his wealth. When he journeyed to Montana Territory to buy horses he would carry cash - often as much as a thousand dollars - with which to make the transactions. People knew he carried such amounts but they also knew he was Jerry Potts so he was left alone.

He became a minor chief with the [[Kainai Nation|Kainai]] when he was perhaps twenty-five in recognition of his bravery in battle, his unquestioned leadership abilities, and his knowledge of the prairies. It is said he knew every trail from [[Fort Edmonton]] to the lands of the [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] and [[Apache]] and every hill between those trails. He could find game when all others had returned to camp empty-handed. He spent much of his time in what is now Montana, guiding, trading horses, and drinking.

Potts could speak several languages. He was fluent in [[American English]], [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], and [[Crow language|Crow (Apsáalooke aliláau)]], had a better than average ability in [[Plains Cree|Plains Cree (nēhiyawēwin)]] (which he would speak only when necessary), and was passable in [[Lakota language|Lakota-Sioux (Lakȟótiyapi)]], [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine (Nakona or A' M̆oqazh)]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin]].

For all his ability to get along with white men Potts was very much an Indian. He never fully understood the white man's reasoning. For instance, he could never understand the reason that white settlers equipped their houses with [[chamber pot]]s. "Why," he once asked a Mountie, "would anyone piss in a perfectly good eating bowl when the entire prairie lay before him"?

During his teens Potts passed all the Indian rites of passage including the final agony of the [[Sun Dance]] wherein the fledgling brave is tied to a pole by thongs threaded through his chest muscles. Successful completion of this rite meant the youth had achieved glory by tearing himself loose either immediately or by staying tied to the pole in absolute silence for up to three days and then tearing loose. Potts chose to remain the full three days for such was his nature. He also belonged to several of the secret warrior societies which prevailed in large numbers throughout the Blackfoot nation.

Potts wore his "magic" talisman - a cat skin - next to his body at all times and hung his captured scalps on the lodge pole of his main teepee in Indian fashion. Still, he wore the clothing of the white man most of the time including a fashionable hat that sported a wide headband. His bushy, drooping mustache was as stylish as that of any white man.

From a distance the stocky, bow-legged Potts looked like a white trapper in his buckskin clothing, his Stetson at a jaunty angle upon his head. Two .44 pistols hung from his gun belt complimenting the [[Henry rifle]] which never left his side. On his leg was strapped a long-bladed skinning knife. He always kept a small gun inside a hide-away pocket, a practice that saved his life on several occasions.

The Cree and Assiniboine lived just like the Blackfoot people by the dwindling herds of the buffalo and their hunters followed their prey, which was about 1850 found almost exclusively on the territory of the Blackfoot and caused the so-called buffalo wars between these two confederacies. In 1861, the [[Gros Ventres]] left the Blackfoot Confederacy, being part of it for some 90 years, allying with the Crow. Together they fought the Blackfoot Confederacy but by the 1867, they were defeated and became allies of the Assiniboine, members of the Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat).

Therefore, in 1870 various ''Nehiyaw-Pwat'' bands of Plains Cree and Plains Assiniboine began a final effort to get hold of their prey, by beginning a war. They hoped to defeat the Blackfoot weakened by [[smallpox]]. An advance party of Cree and Assiniboine under the lead of Plains Chief Chief [[Big Bear|Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa)]] and [[Piapot|Piapot (Hole in the Sioux)]], Chief of the Cree-Assiniboines (Young Dogs), had stumbled upon a Peigan camp near [[Fort Whoop-Up]] (called by the Blackfoot ''Akaisakoyi'' - "Many Dead") and decided to attack instead of informing the main Cree body of their find. Just in nick of time Jerry Potts with a group of Peigans and 2 Blood bands who armed with repeating rifles came to their assistance. In the daylong so-called [[Battle of the Belly River]] on October 25, 1870 near present-day [[Lethbridge]] (called by the Blackfoot ''Assini-etomochi'' – "where we slaughtered the Cree") the combined Cree-Assiniboine force, who lost over 300 warriors, was defeated. The slaughter was such that Jerry Potts said; "You could fire with your eyes shut and be sure to kill a Cree."

The next winter the hunger compelled the Nehiyaw-Pwat to negotiate with the Blackfoot, and in 1873 [[Crowfoot|Crowfoot (Isapo-Muxika)]] (''Issapóómahksika'' - "Crow-big-foot"), chief of the [[Siksika]] (''Siksikáwa'' - ″Blackfoot People″), adopted [[Pitikwahanapiwiyin|Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker)]] of mixed Cree and Assiniboine parentage, creating a final peace between the ''Nehiyaw-Pwat'' (Cree-Assiniboine) and Blackfoot. The Battle of the Belly River was the last major conflict between the Cree and the Blackfoot Confederacy, and the last major battle between First Nations in Western Canada.
   
In 1871, Potts was about thirty-one when his mother was murdered. Her killer had been an Indian who was drunk on "firewater" so he declared his own personal war on the whiskey runners. By the time Potts was 36 he had killed at least 40 men, mostly whiskey runners.

In September 1874, Potts was trading horses in [[Fort Benton, Montana]]. He was hired as a guide, interpreter and scout by the [[North-West Mounted Police]]. His contract as a guide for the [[North-West Mounted Police]] was to last twenty-two years. He was paid $90 per month, which was quite a bit higher than a regular guide, and three times a police constable's salary. Even City Marshals in large cities such as Abilene or Dodge City often earned less than that amount. He also picked the location for the first [[North-West Mounted Police]] post, called [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]].

He only ceased working for the force at age fifty-eight because the pain of throat cancer made it so that he could no longer ride. He died a year later, on 14 July 1896 at [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]].

Jerry Potts was buried at [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] with full honors in 1896 having served with the [[North-West Mounted Police]] for twenty-two years and being given the rank of special constable.

Potts always received more salary than any other guide/interpreter because as a guide he had no equal. He was useful as an interpreter because he spoke all the Indian languages of the prairies. He could also speak passable Sioux - if he felt like it. He also understood the differing cultures of the Indians and the North-West Mounted Police. He was able to instruct the police in the proper procedures for receiving a chief. His interpretations would also be different, depending on who he was speaking to. His interpretations of the long, verbose speeches of the Indians were always short and concise. Long speeches would be reduced to only a few words. His interpretations into the Indian languages, however, were always long and passionate. Potts did this because he understood that long speech in Indians cultures was meant to show respect, while for whites, it was only a way to show off.&lt;ref&gt;Fardy, Bernard D. ''Jerry Potts: Paladin of the Plains.'' Langley, B.C., 1984, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, following a Blackfoot chief's extremely long, flowery, impassioned speech to a delegation of visiting officials who had arrived from Ottawa to sign an historic treaty with the Blackfoot people, Potts remained silent as if fully digesting the colorful language. Finally, when asked what the chief had said, the laconic Potts shrugged and replied, "He says he's damned glad you're here." On another occasion, when asked by Inspector MacLeod what lay beyond a high rising hill ahead, Potts muttered, "Nuther hill."

Potts had two wives, who blessed him with several sons and a couple of daughters. He named one of his sons Blue Gun in commemoration of his favorite rifle. His many descendants still live mainly in Alberta and Saskatchewan with a few in Montana. Three of his descendants, one a young woman named Janet Potts, became [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers during the middle years of this century.

==Recognition==
The city of [[Lethbridge]], Alberta, Canada, east of [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]], has named a boulevard in Jerry Potts' honour. In about 1867 Jerry was elected king of fire (okmakak) while he was staying at the Peigan (Piikani) encampment.

On 8 September 1992 Canada Post issued 'Jerry Potts, Legendary Plainsman' as part of the Folklore, Legendary Heroes series. The stamps were designed by Ralph Tibbles, based on illustrations by 
Deborah Drew-Brook and Allan Cormack. The 42¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(military.A790,C790.)+Or+(null.B742.)&amp;l=100&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=59&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP Canada Post stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sam Peckinpah's 1965 western film, [[Major Dundee]], the character of the scout Samuel Potts, played by James Coburn, was inspired in part by the persona of Jerry Potts himself

==Major League Baseball career==

===1960s===
Born and raised in [[Oklahoma]], Bench is one-eighth [[Choctaw]]; he played baseball and [[basketball]] and was class [[valedictorian]] at Binger-Oney High School {{nowrap|in [[Binger, Oklahoma|Binger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082237/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=March 31, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher. At age seventeen, Bench was selected 36th overall by the [[1965 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in the second round of the [[1965 Major League Baseball draft|1965 amateur draft]], playing for the minor-league {{nowrap|[[Buffalo Bisons]]}} in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August [[1967 Cincinnati Reds season|1967]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/1965/Round-2-1.shtml|title=Amateur Baseball Draft - The Baseball Cube|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit only [[batting average|.163]], but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]]. Williams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be "a Hall of Famer for sure!"&lt;ref name="Johnny Bench at The Baseball Library"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmemorabilia.com/articles/johnny-bench-memorabilia-buying-guide |title=Johnny Bench Memorabilia Buying Guide &amp;#124; Autographed Sports Memorabilia and Sports Collectibles at Sports Memorabilia |publisher=Sportsmemorabilia.com |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Bench was elected to Cooperstown.

During a [[spring training]] game in [[1968 Cincinnati Reds season|1968]], Bench was catching for eight-year veteran [[right handedness|right-hander]] [[Jim Maloney]]. Maloney was once a hard thrower, but by this time injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball. Maloney insisted on repeatedly "shaking off" his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the [[breaking ball]]s that Bench had called for. An exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, "Your fastball's not popping". Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball wasn't effective anymore, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher's mitt and comfortably caught the fastball barehanded.&lt;ref name="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/fastest-pitcher-in-baseball.shtml |title=Fastest Pitcher in Baseball by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bench was the Reds' catcher on April 30, [[1969 Cincinnati Reds season|1969]] when Maloney pitched a [[no hitter]] against the [[1969 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN196904300.shtml|title=April 30, 1969 Houston Astros at Cincinnati Reds Box Score and Play by Play - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age twenty in 1968, Bench impressed many in his first full season.&lt;ref name=rcpr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XbdWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YukDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2327%2C2392877 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review|agency=Associated Press |title=Rookie Catcher Praised |date=July 23, 1968 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and batted .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs.

During the 1960s, Bench also served in the [[United States Army Reserve]] as a member of the 478th Engineer Battalion, which was based across the [[Ohio River]] from Cincinnati at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]].  This unit included several of his teammates, among them Pete Rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gavin |first= Lapaille |date=July 24, 2014 |title=Charlie Hustle: As Rose Sported Red, He Marched in Army Green |url=http://www.army.mil/article/130526/Charlie_Hustle__as_Rose_sported_red__he_marched_in_Army_green/ |newspaper=www.army.mil |location=Arlington, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the winter of 1970–1971 he was part of [[Bob Hope]]'s [[United Service Organizations|USO]] Tour of [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=William A. |date=2012 |title=Big Klu: The Baseball Life of Ted Kluszewski |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFUgLGv6RnIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=%22johnny+bench%22+%22vietnam%22+%22bob+hope%22+1971&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A5bSVKaZEoyqggSYjYTQAw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johnny%20bench%22%20%22vietnam%22%20%22bob%20hope%22%201971&amp;f=false |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |page=144 |isbn=978-0-7864-6999-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
The year 1970 was Bench's finest [[Baseball statistics|statistical]] season. At age 22, he became the youngest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He hit .293, led the National League with 45 [[home run]]s and a franchise-record 148 [[runs batted in]] as the Reds won the NL West Division.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bench career statistics at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1970.shtml#NLmvp|title=1970 Awards Voting - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reds swept the [[1970 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the [[1970 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], but lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in five games in the [[1970 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1970_NLCS.shtml|title=1970 NLCS - Cincinnati Reds over Pittsburgh Pirates (3-0) - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1970_WS.shtml|title=1970 World Series - Baltimore Orioles over Cincinnati Reds (4-1) - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bench had another strong year in [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|1972]], winning the MVP Award for a second time. He led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the [[1972 National League Championship Series|NL pennant]] in the deciding fifth game over the [[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name="Johnny Bench career statistics at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1972.shtml#NLmvp|title=1972 Awards Voting - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most dramatic home runs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_lcs.jsp?feature=this_day |title=League Championship Series Overview &amp;#124; MLB.com: History |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was likely his ninth-[[inning]], [[lead off]], [[opposite field]] home run in that fifth NLCS game.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bench: Number 1 Home Run Hitter of All Catchers"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=baseball%20digest%20johnny%20bench#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20johnny%20bench&amp;f=false|title=|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN197210110.shtml|title=October 11, 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) Game 5, Pirates at Reds - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1972_NLCS.shtml|title=1972 NLCS - Cincinnati Reds over Pittsburgh Pirates (3-2) - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hailed after the game as "one of the great [[Clutch hitter|clutch]] home runs of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c61a5e96-6143-48a2-9557-575f50fabea9 |title=GC1GQAB FP Series #226 – Johnny Bench (Traditional Cache) in Texas, United States created by drives |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Reds lost the [[1972 World Series|World Series]] to a strong [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] team in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1972_WS.shtml|title=1972 World Series - Oakland Athletics over Cincinnati Reds (4-3) - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1972 season, Bench had a growth removed from his lung; he remained productive, but never again hit forty home runs in a season. In [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|1973]], Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10½-game deficit to the [[1973 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown. In the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], Cincinnati met a [[1973 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that won the NL East with an unimpressive {{nowrap|{{winning percentage|82|79|record=y}}}} record, 16½ games behind the Reds. But the Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer [[Tom Seaver]], [[Jerry Koosman]], and [[Jon Matlack]]. Bench's bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning {{nowrap|7–2}} to put the Mets into the [[1973 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1973.shtml 1973 National League Team Statistics and Standings] won the series in five games win advance to the World Series against the Oakland A's.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1974 Cincinnati Reds season|1974]], Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season. The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=darrel%20porter%20baseball%20digest&amp;lr=&amp;rview=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|1975]], the Reds finally broke through in the post season.

Bench bounced back in [[1977 Cincinnati Reds season|1977]] to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs but the [[1977 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] won two straight NL pennants. The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in [[1979 Cincinnati Reds season|1979]], but were swept in three straight in the [[1979 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] by the [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1979_NLCS.shtml|title=1979 NLCS - Pittsburgh Pirates over Cincinnati Reds (3-0) - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
For the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out of the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base). The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, [[1983 Cincinnati Reds season|1983]], "Johnny Bench Night" at [[Riverfront Stadium]], in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd.&lt;ref name=obsn83&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qflVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PeIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6855%2C4847428|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|agency=wire services|title=On Bench's special night, Houston spoils finish 4-3|date=September 18, 1983 |page=7C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN198309170.shtml|title=September 17, 1983 Houston Astros at Cincinnati Reds Box Score and Play by Play - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired at the end of the season at age 35.

The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch.&lt;ref name="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com"/&gt; By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/view.asp?infoID=1915&amp;photo=image3|title=|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.&lt;ref name="Are Catchers Today As Good Defensively As In The Past?"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Bench has been married four times. Once hailed as "baseball's most-eligible bachelor," he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who'd previously dated [[Joe Namath]]. Four days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Johnny suggested Vickie accept ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine's offer for her to pose nude for $25,000. They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, "Now I'm done with two things I hate: baseball and you"), divorcing after just 13 months. "I tried. I even hand-squeezed orange juice," she told [[Phil Donahue]] in December 1975. "I don't think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like." After returning to Manhattan, Vickie said, "Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person."&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, Tom, ''The Long Ball'' (Little, Brown and Company, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor. They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named for [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bobby Knight]], and Bench's hometown), before divorcing in 1995. They shared custody of the boy. "He was, and is, a great dad," says Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. Bench's third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997, while his fourth came in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in [[Palm Springs]] with their two sons, Justin (born 2006) and Josh (born 2010), Johnny had the urge to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014-17, so the family scouted homes in [[Palm Beach Gardens]]. In the end, Lauren decided she wasn't going to move to Florida, so she and Johnny divorced; as of 2018, Bench has primary custody of the boys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/07/05/johnny-bench-cincinnati-reds Johnny Bench Is Already a Hall-of-Famer, But He's Looking For a New Distinction, ''Sports Illustrated'', July 2, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]'', which also included [[Gwen Verdon]] and [[Gary Sandy]]. He also hosted the television series ''[[The Baseball Bunch]]'' from 1982 to 1985. A cast of boys and girls from the [[Tucson, Arizona]], area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats. [[The San Diego Chicken|The Chicken]] provided comic relief and former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] appeared as "The Dugout Wizard."

In 1986, Bench and [[Don Drysdale]] did the backup contests or [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]'s Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts ([[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]] were the primary commentating crew). Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with [[Steve Busby]] filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the [[1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Astrodome|Houston]] as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to [[Major League Baseball|CBS Radio]] to help [[Brent Musburger]] call that year's [[1986 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio's World Series coverage alongside [[Jack Buck]] and later [[Vin Scully]] from [[1989 World Series|1989]]-[[1993 World Series|1993]]. In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]/[[The Baseball Network]]'s coverage of the [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] from [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]].

After turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the [[Champions Tour|Senior PGA Tour]].&lt;ref name=jbatmmst&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sG5hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eT8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2970,1104388 |newspaper=Catoosa County News |location=Ringgold, Georgia |agency=Knight-Ridder Newspapers |last=Carter |first=Ivan |title=Johnny Bench attempts to make mark on Senior Tour |date=August 12, 1998 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msswg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/weekly/971208/gp1208/i.html |publisher=CNNSI.com |title=My Shot: Still Swinging |last=Bench |first=Johnny |date=December 3, 1997 |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahspjb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/golf/champions/players/Johnny+Bench/1127/log |publisher=Yahoo!

In 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ |title=Johnny Bench at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players |publisher= |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227144518/http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ |archivedate=February 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] as the top vote-receiving catcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp|title=The All-Century Team|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the [[All-time Gold Glove Team|All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/about/all_time_winners|title=Gold Glove :: Rawlings.com|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 2000 [[college baseball]] season, the best collegiate catcher annually receives the [[Johnny Bench Award]].  Notable winners include [[Buster Posey]] of [[Florida State University]], [[Kelly Shoppach]] of [[Baylor University]], [[Ryan Garko]] of [[Stanford University]], and [[Kurt Suzuki]] of [[Cal State Fullerton]].

[[File:Johnny Bench signs autographs in May 2014.jpg|thumb|Bench signs autographs in Houston in May 2014.]]
In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book ''Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches'' with Paul Daugherty, published by [[Orange Frazer Press]].  An autobiography published in 1979 called ''Catch You Later'' was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid [[golf]]er, having played in several [[Champions Tour]] tournaments.

In a September 2008 interview with [[Heidi Watney]] of the [[New England Sports Network]], Johnny Bench, who was watching a [[Cleveland Indians]]/[[Boston Red Sox]] game at [[Fenway Park]], did an impression of late [[Chicago Cubs]] announcer [[Harry Caray]] after [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] [[third base]]man [[Kevin Youkilis]], a native of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], made a tough play. While [[knuckleball]]er [[Tim Wakefield]] was on the mound for the Red Sox, he related a story that then-Reds manager [[Sparky Anderson]] told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer [[Phil Niekro]]. Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro's catcher, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soxanddawgs.com/2008/09/24/johnny-bench-does-a-harry-caray-impression|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=June 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104164711/http://soxanddawgs.com/2008/09/24/johnny-bench-does-a-harry-caray-impression/|archivedate=January 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at [[Great American Ball Park]]. The larger-than-life bronze statue by [[Tom Tsuchiya]], shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner.&lt;ref name= CE &gt;{{cite news| work = The Cincinnati Enquirer| title= Johnny Bench Bronze Age| date=September 17, 2011|url= http://news.cincinnati.com/videonetwork/1163895329001/Johnny-Bench-Statue| accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NYT &gt;{{cite news |work= The New York Times| title=In Baseball's Bronze Age, Statues are Becoming Bigger Part of the Landscape| date=September 21, 2011|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/sports/baseball/baseballs-bronze-age.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bench called the unveiling of his statue his "greatest moment."&lt;ref name= MLB&gt;{{cite news|work=MLB.com| title=Bench calls statue his 'greatest moment' |date=September 17, 2011|url= http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110917&amp;content_id=24847440&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb | accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Vincent was a playwright and actress before being elected to parliament. She wrote and appeared in several "No Strings Attached" productions, a company dedicated to people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="NoStrings"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostringsattached.org.au/index.php |title= No Strings Attached Theatre of Disability|date= |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook high school [[work experience]] with the company in 2004, and has worked with the company on and off. She is also fluent in French and Spanish, and began language studies at university after year 12 before returning to writing plays.

==Parliament==
The party's upper house vote doubled from 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent at the [[South Australian state election, 2010|2010 state election]], and after receiving preferences, Vincent was elected to the eleventh and last upper house seat. Vincent was listed second on the party's upper house ticket, but received the preferences of first candidate Paul Collier who died of a brain haemorrhage eleven days before the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/08/2867319.htm |title=Youngest woman MP elected in SA: ABC News, 8 April 2010 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was defeated in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]] even as the [[Dignity Party SA|Dignity Party]] increased their primary vote. She blamed the introduction of [[optional preferential voting]] for her defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-23/kelly-vincent-robert-brokenshire-lose-sa-upper-house-seats/9687872 |title=SA election: Kelly Vincent and Robert Brokenshire lose Upper House seats, 23 April 2010 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">'''Krabat''' is a character in  [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] folklore, also dubbed the "[[Wends|Wendish]] [[Faust]]".
First recorded in 1837,&lt;ref&gt; Joachim Leopold Haupt, ''Von einem bösen Herrn in Groß-Särchen'' (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; the character developed from an evil sorcerer into a folk hero and beneficial trickster in the course of the 19th century.

The historical nucleus of the folk tale is Johannes Schadowitz (1624&amp;ndash;1704), a   [[Croats (military unit)|Croat (Crabat)]] cavalry commander, who was granted an estate in Groß Särchen (now part of [[Lohsa]]) near  [[Hoyerswerda]] in 1691 by [[John George III, Elector of Saxony]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The folk tale  is centered around the area of [[Lusatia]], most notably the settlement of Čorny Chołmc, which today is a district of the city of [[Hoyerswerda]], where Krabat is said to have learned his sorcerous powers.  

The Krabat story has been adapted into several novels, notably:
* ''[[Mišter Krabat]] (Master Krabat)'' (1954) by [[Měrćin Nowak-Njechorński]].
* ''[[Čorny młyn]] (The Black Mill)'' (1968) by [[Jurij Brězan]], on which the film [[Die Schwarze Mühle (film)|Die Schwarze Mühle]] was based.
* ''[[Krabat (novel)|Krabat]]'' (1971) by [[Otfried Preußler]], which inspired the Czech film [[Krabat – The Sorcerer's Apprentice|Čarodějův učeň (1977)]] and the German film [[Krabat (film)|Krabat (2008)]]. The ''Krabat'' album by German [[Gothic music|Goth]] band [[ASP (band)|ASP]] is also inspired by this version of the legend.

[[Laurence Olivier]] (1907–1989) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries [[Ralph Richardson]] and [[John Gielgud]], dominated the [[Theatre of the United Kingdom|British stage]] of the mid-20th century. He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. From 1935 he performed in radio broadcasts and, from 1956, had considerable success in television roles.

After attending drama school, Olivier began his professional career with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by [[Sybil Thorndike]] and her husband, [[Lewis Casson]], as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company.{{sfn|Beckett|2005|pp=18–19}} In 1926 he joined the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham Repertory Company]],{{sfn|Jackson|2013|p=67}} where he was given the chance to play a wide range of key roles.{{sfn|Holden|1988|p=455}} In 1930 he had his first important [[West End theatre|West End]] success in [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Private Lives]]'', and in 1935 he played in a celebrated production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' alongside Gielgud and [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and [[John Burrell (theatre director)|John Burrell]], Olivier was the co-director of [[the Old Vic]], building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]] and [[Sophocles]]'s [[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the ''avant garde'' [[English Stage Company]] in 1957 to play the title role in ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]''. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in ''[[Othello]]'' (1964) and [[Shylock]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1970).{{sfn|Billington|2004}}

In 1930, to gain money for his forthcoming marriage, Olivier began his film career with small roles in two films.{{sfn|Olivier|1994|pp=81–82}} In 1939 he appeared as [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] in ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' in a role that saw him nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. The following year he was again nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Maxim de Winter in ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''. In 1944 he produced, directed and appeared as [[Henry V of England]] in ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]''. There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and the film instead won a "Special Award".&lt;ref name="Oscar: Henry" /&gt; He won the Best Actor award for the 1948 film ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', which became the first non-American film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="BFI: Hamlet" /&gt;{{sfn|Munn|2007|pp=145–147}}{{efn|The film also won Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and was nominated for awards for Best Actress ([[Jean Simmons]] as Ophelia), Best Score and Olivier as Best Director.&lt;ref name="Oscar: Hamlet" /&gt;}} He later received Oscar nominations for roles in ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' (1955), ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), ''[[Othello (1965 British film)|Othello]]'' (1965), ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' (1978). In 1979 he was also presented with an Honorary Award, at the Academy Awards, to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction.&lt;ref name="LO: Oscars" /&gt; Throughout his career Olivier appeared in radio dramas and poetry readings, and made his television debut in 1956.

During the making of the 1983 movie ''[[The Jigsaw Man]]'' Olivier walked away from the film after receiving no pay, with Michael Caine following not long after. They returned only when $4 million was secured as finance by Pakistani businessman, filmmaker and best seller author Mahmud Sipra.

After being ill for the last twenty-two years of his life, Olivier died of renal failure on 11 July 1989.{{sfn|Billington|2004}} In reflection, and about Olivier's pioneering of Britain's National Theatre,&lt;ref name="times-obit"/&gt; the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]] wrote: "[N]o one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument".{{sfn|Bragg|1989|p=103}} Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in the words of the English theatre director [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]], "the supreme man of the theatre of our time".{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=ix}}

'''Lena Söderberg''', born '''Sjööblom''' (born 31 March 1951) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] model who appeared as a [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] in the November 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date = November 1972 |title = Playmate of the Month |journal = Playboy Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Lenna Sjööblom'''. Her [[centerfold]] was photographed by [[Dwight Hooker]].

A head and shoulder section of her centerfold, this cropped section itself known as [[Lenna]], is often used to test algorithms in [[digital image processing]].&lt;ref name=JH&gt;Jamie Hutchison, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf "Culture, Communication, and an Information Age Madonna"], ''IEEE Professional Communication Society Newsletter'' Vol. 45, No. 3, May/June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] in 1997, where she gave a presentation about herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml Imaging Experts Meet Lenna in Person].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the ubiquity of her ''Playboy'' photo scan, she has been called the "first lady of the internet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19260550 BBC News].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/playboy_backups/lena.html |title=Playboy Newsdesk - Lena |newspaper=Cs.cmu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was given to her by Jeff Seideman in a press release he issued announcing her appearance at the 50th annual IS&amp;T Conference.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Söderberg is married and has three children.

[[File:Lise Mayer and Angus Deayton 1.jpg|thumb|Angus Deayton (right) was the original host from series 1 to 24 (1990–2002)]]
'''''[[Have I Got News for You]]''''' was originally presented by British comedian [[Angus Deayton]] between 1990 and 2002. Following a string of tabloid allegations about his personal life, he was dismissed in October 2002 after presenting two shows of the 24th series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2371021.stm |title=Was the BBC right to sack Angus Deayton? |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |date=4 November 2002 |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular team captain [[Paul Merton]] stood in as the host of the first episode following Deayton's departure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm |title=Quiz host Deayton fired by BBC |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following which the programme was presented by a different [[guest host]] each week (many of which have presented several editions of the show). This was initially intended as a short-term solution while producers were looking for a full-time replacement; however, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2984669.stm |title=TV quiz denies Clunes is new host |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue.
As of 30 November 2018, '''112''' people (not including Deayton himself) have presented, or co-presented, at least one episode of ''Have I Got News for You''.

==List of guest presenters==
&lt;!--Correct up to 30 November 2018. Please only update the listings once the episode has aired!--&gt;
[[File:Alexander Armstrong.jpg|upright|thumb|Alexander Armstrong has made the most appearances as guest presenter having hosted 32 episodes.]]

[[File:Jeremy Clarkson.jpg|upright|thumb|Jeremy Clarkson was the first person to make their first appearance on the show as a guest host.]]
[[File:Charlotte Church by Law Keven.jpg|upright|thumb|Charlotte Church is the youngest person to present an episode, being 17 years old at the time.]]
[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|upright|thumb|John Torode and Gregg Wallace were the first co-hosts of an episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s127/masterchef/news/a315813/masterchef-duo-for-have-i-got-news-for-you.html |title=MasterChef duo for Have I Got News For You |last=Love |first=Ryan |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Roger Moore - Monte-Carlo Television Festival.JPG|upright|thumb|Sir Roger Moore was the oldest person to present an episode, being 85 at the time.]]
The following is a list of the guest presenters in the order they first appeared. Many have previously appeared as guest panellists; apart from Merton, who continued his regular role as team captain after hosting the first post-Deayton episode, there are twelve other people who have appeared as a panellist after being a guest presenter: [[Clive Anderson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Marcus Brigstocke]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (who subsequently appeared as a guest host again), [[Alan Johnson]], [[Charles Kennedy]], [[Richard Madeley]], [[Richard Osman]], [[Robert Peston]], [[John Prescott]] and [[Liza Tarbuck]]. Of these, Clarkson, Johnson, Madeley and Prescott had not appeared as panellists before being guest presenters.

{{Dynamic list}}
This is a partial list of confirmed '''famous people who were or are [[gay]], [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]]'''. Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.

The historical concept and [[definition]] of [[sexual orientation]] varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word "gay" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term "sexual orientation" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shively |first=M.G. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=DeCecco |first3=J. P. |year=1984 |title=Research on sexual orientation: definitions and methods |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume= 9 |issue= 2/3 |pages=127–137 |doi=10.1300/J082v09n02_08 |pmid=6376622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gerdes |first=L.

Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. See [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual ([[LGBT|LGB]]) people.

The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]]. The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree.

This is a list of '''[[monetary reform]]ers''' from the past to the present according to several schools of thought. 

Monetary reformers primarily belong to the following groups:
*Supporters of publicly issued money who oppose charging [[interest]] on issuance of money, formerly called "Greenbackers" in late 19th century United States, 
*the [[Austrian School]] who generally support a return to the [[gold standard]] or [[full-reserve banking]], and  
*the [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian School]] who{{who|date=July 2018}}&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;indeed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; generally wish to regulate or reduce leverage and debt in the economy or direct it to "productive, non-speculative" uses.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Most of these groups{{vague|date=July 2018}} are critical of [[fractional-reserve banking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pibel |first=Doug |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/the-new-economy/how-banks-make-money |title=How Banks Make Money Creating Money Out of Thin Air |publisher=Yesmagazine.org |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polleit |first=Thorsten |url=http://mises.org/daily/4880/The-Faults-of-FractionalReserve-Banking |title=The Faults of Fractional-Reserve Banking |publisher=Mises Daily |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice which is described by critics as "creating money out of thin air". According to the [[Bank of England]] "rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with them, the act of lending creates deposits – the reverse of the sequence typically described in textbooks".&lt;ref&gt;Jem Bendell, [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jem-bendell/magic-money-tree_b_16936322.html "There is a magic money tree, but it's only magic for banks"], ''[[HuffPost]]'', 5 June 2017 (page visited on 25 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|History of Montana}}
[[File:Map of USA MT.svg|thumb|right|250px|State of Montana]]
This is a '''list of notable figures in the history of pre-territorial Montana, [[Montana Territory]] and the state of [[Montana]].'''  Individuals listed played significant roles in the exploration and settlement of the region as well as the cultural, economic, military, political, and social development of Montana.

Montana is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Western United States]]. Added to the U.S. in 1803 and shortly thereafter explored by [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]], the territory was home to numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American peoples]] for millennia. In the mid-19th century the [[Gold rush|discovery of gold]] and other valuable minerals led to successive mining booms. Settlement by farmers and ranchers expanded as railroads raced to build networks of tracks linking Montana to Utah to the south, Minneapolis to the east, and Seattle to the west. Montana produced numerous important politicians from both political parties, as well as entrepreneurs who founded cities and built large mining, timber, cattle and other related industries. Individuals have been placed in the period in which they most contributed to Montana history.

His paintings and glasswork use a vivid palette that is found in his beadwork. He has even create giant beads out of glass.

Amerman's first foray into realism in beadwork was his 1993 ''Iron Horse Jacket'', a studded leather jacket featuring a highly detailed and modeled image of Brooke Shields in beadwork.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he added portrait bracelets to his repertoire. He has portrayed many historical heroes in his beadwork, such as [[Lloyd Kiva New]]; as well a pop icons, such as Janet Jackson, and imagery inspired by comic superheroes is a current running throughout his work.

His paintings are expressive and often reflect his Choctaw roots, with [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] imagery. His work in glass also includes Mississippian ceramic designs, but more often reflects contemporary designs, such as globes of the earth.

==Honors==
Amerman's work is in such public collections as the [[George Gustav Heye Center]], the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Heard Museum]], the [[Portland Art Museum]], the Sequoyah National Research Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the [[Museum of Arts and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadden and Taubman, 240&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only artist to have his beadwork featured in [[Playboy]] magazine.&lt;ref name="Bates, 96"/&gt;

==Personal==
Amerman's brother, Roger Amerman, is also an award-winning beadworker, inspired by [[Southeastern Woodland]] designs. Their first cousin, [[Linda Lomahaftewa]] is renowned for her printmaking and painting, as was her brother and Amerman's cousin, the late Dan Lomahaftewa.

==Equestrian career==
Phillips was a reserve member of the British equestrian team for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. He was part of the British three-day event teams that won a world title in 1970, a European title in 1971 and Olympic gold medals in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]; individually, he finished in 35th place in 1972. At the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] his horse sustained a pulled muscle and could not complete the individual three-day event, but Phillips won a silver medal with the British team. Phillips was a four-time champion at the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], in 1971–72 on ''Great Ovation'', in 1974 on ''Colombus'' and in 1981 on ''Lincoln''. It was through his equestrian activities that he met Princess Anne, the only daughter of Elizabeth II and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Their own daughter [[Zara Tindall|Zara]] won a silver medal in the three-day event with the British team at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]].&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ph/mark-phillips-1.html|title=Mark Phillips|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Phillips designed the cross-country venue for the [[Red Hills Horse Trials]], a qualifying event for the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] located in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], United States. He is now a regular columnist for ''[[Horse &amp; Hound]]'' magazine. He also remains a leading figure in British equestrian circles, and serves as ''Chef d'Equipe'' of the [[USEA|United States Eventing Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usef.org/media/press-releases/7987_phillips-and-ransehousen-named--usef-coaches-of-the-year|title=Phillips and Ransehousen Named 2011 USEF Coaches of the Year|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://useventing.com/news/captain-mark-phillips|title=Captain Mark Phillips|publisher=United States Eventing Association|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips}}
Phillips married Princess Anne on 14 November 1973, at [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="BBC-Marriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/14/newsid_2519000/2519003.stm|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=12 February 2015|title=1973: Crowds cheer marriage of Princess Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children: [[Peter Phillips|Peter]] (born 1977) and Zara (born 1981). It is believed that Phillips declined a [[peerage]] from the Queen which would have allowed his children to use [[courtesy titles]].{{refn|As female-line grandchildren of the Sovereign, Princess Anne's children were never eligible for the style "Royal Highness" or the title "Prince/Princess" under the terms of [[George V]]'s [[letters patent]] of 1917. If Phillips held a peerage, however, his children with [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] would have been entitled to be addressed as "The Honourable", or as "Lord" or "Lady", depending on the substantive peerage created.}} The Queen bought [[Gatcombe Park]], near [[Minchinhampton]], for the couple as a wedding present.

'''John Michael Broadbent''', [[Master of Wine|MW]] (born 2 May 1927 in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]) is a British [[wine]] [[critic]], writer and [[auctioneer]] in a capacity as a Master of Wine. He is an authority on [[wine tasting]] and old wines.&lt;ref name="JANCIS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robinson  | first = Jancis  | authorlink = Jancis Robinson  | title = The Oxford Companion to Wine, third edition  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 2006  | location =    | isbn = 0-19-860990-6| page = 105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Broadbent was educated at [[Oundle School]] and trained as an architect but changed career, in 1952, at the age of twenty-five, and entered the wine trade first with Layton’s, next with the West End Wine merchants, Saccone and Speed, and, from 1955 with Harvey's of Bristol. In 1960 he received the qualification of [[Master of Wine]].&lt;ref&gt;mastersofwine.org, [http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/about/meet-the-masters/profile/index.cfm/id/D193383B-DE6C-4877-813761FCEDFF4A34 Masters of Wine, Michael Broadbent profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926134747/http://mastersofwine.org/en/about/meet-the-masters/profile/index.cfm/id/D193383B-DE6C-4877-813761FCEDFF4A34 |date=2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCW-brdb&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''|title= Broadbent, J.

In 1966 he resigned as Sales Director to start wine auctions at the London [[auction]] house [[Christie's]] which would lead him to trade in and taste a greater number of fine and rare wines than anyone else in the world. His tasting notes are estimated to number over 90,000 in more than 140 notebooks.&lt;ref name=OCW-brdb/&gt; Until 1992 he was the senior director of Christie's wine department,&lt;ref name="JANCIS"/&gt; and he remained a senior consultant with the firm until 2009.

Broadbent awards a wine up to five stars, a system unlike the numerical score of the American wine critic [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]].&lt;ref name=OCW-brdb/&gt;

As a wine writer, Broadbent is noted for publications of his records from a life of tasting wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-tns&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''|title= tasting notes|url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=3164|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080808232401/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=3164|archivedate= 2008-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Great Vintage Wine Book'' is a reference work with tasting notes from more than 6,000 wines dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=OCW-low&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last=''The Oxford Companion to Wine'' |title=literature of wine |url=http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=1816 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727111948/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=1816 |archivedate=2008-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to authoring several wine books, he has been a regular contributor to the wine magazines ''Vinum'' and ''Falstaff '', and still writes monthly for ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]'' since its inception in 1975.&lt;ref name=OCW-brdb/&gt; Broadbent has lectured on the subject since the mid-1950s.

In 1979 Broadbent was appointed Chevalier of the [[Ordre National du Mérite]], as well as an honorary member of the Académie du Vin de [[Bordeaux]] and numerous other French wine associations. Among other positions held, Broadbent has been chairman of The Institute of Masters of Wine in 1970, Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Distillers]], president of The International Wine and Food Society in 1986, president of the [[Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust]] (WSET) 2007-2009 and Chairman of The Wine &amp; Spirit Trades' Benevolent Society in 1991, and has stood as [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Sheriff of the City of London]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=OCW-brdb/&gt; In 2006 he participated as a judge in the [[The Judgment of Paris 30th Anniversary|30th anniversary repetition]] of the original [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|"Judgment of Paris"]] wine tasting competition.

===Personal life===

Michael Broadbent is widowed to the late Daphne Broadbent (1931-2015). Their son [[Bartholomew Broadbent]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadbent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is a wine importer in the United States who also makes Port, Madeira and Vinho Verde in Portugal and was a 50% owner of Dragon's Hollow winery in China. Michael Broadbent's daughter Emma, now The Lady Arbuthnot of Edrom, is the Senior Magistrate in England &amp; Wales, married to The Right Honourable The Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom  [[James Arbuthnot]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europ|accessdate=18 March 2016|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p12487.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Broadbent was also among the wine industry experts  whose association with alleged [[wine fraud|wine forger]] [[Hardy Rodenstock]] during the 1980s led to some embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Wallace |first= Benjamin, ''The Independent'' |title= A vintage mess: How Hardy Rodenstock became the most notorious name in wine | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/a-vintage-mess-how-hardy-rodenstock-became-the-most-notorious-name-in-wine-949116.html |date= October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 it was announced that Broadbent would sue [[Random House]], the publishers of ''[[The Billionaire's Vinegar]]'' by [[Benjamin Wallace]], an account of the "Jefferson bottles affair" and its court cases, for [[defamation|defamation of character]], on claims that the book asserts Broadbent invented an auction bid and contains references to him colluding with Rodenstock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">'''Nathan (Nata) ben Moses Hannover''' ({{lang-he-n|נתן נטע הנובר}}) was a [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] Jewish historian, [[Talmudist]], and [[kabbalist]]; he died, according to [[Leopold Zunz]] (''Kalender,'' 5623, p.&amp;nbsp;18), at [[Uherský Brod|Ungarisch-Brod]], [[Moravia]], on 14 July 1663. [[Jacob Aboab]], however, in a letter to [[Unger]] (Wolf, ''Bibl. Hebr.'' iii., No. 1728), gives [[Pieve di Sacco]], [[Italy]], as the place of Hannover's death, without indicating the date. The place of his birth is equally uncertain. According to [[Graziadio Nepi]]-[[Mordecai Ghirondi]], (''Toledot Gedole Yisrael,'' p.&amp;nbsp;270) he was born at [[Kraków|Cracow]], but [[Moritz Steinschneider|Steinschneider]] says that Nathan Hannover and Nathan of Cracow were two different persons.

== Biography ==
Hannover lived for a time at [[Iziaslav, Ukraine|Zaslav]], [[Volhynia]], and [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|when that town was attacked by the Cossacks]] he fled from [[Poland]]. He went first to [[Prague]], then to [[Venice]], where he studied [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] under [[Hayyim Cohen]], [[Moses Zacuto]], and [[Samuel Aboab]]. Later he became rabbi of [[Iaşi]], [[Moldavia]], and afterward, according to [[Jacob Aboab]], he returned to [[Italy]].

== ''Yeven Mezulah'' ==
Hannover is chiefly known for his work entitled ''Yeven Mezulah'' (Venice, 1653), which describes the course of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from a Jewish perspective. Hannover in this work gives a brief description of the Polish government of the time and of the relations between the Poles, Jews and Cossacks, and the causes which led to the uprising. He also gives a very vivid picture of Jewish life in Poland and the [[yeshivot]].

This work, owing to its literary value, was translated into [[Yiddish]] (1687), into [[German language|German]] (1720), and into [[French language|French]] by Daniel Levy (published by [[J.J. Benjamin|Benjamin II]], Tlemçen, 1855). This last translation was revised by the historian J. Lelewel, and served as a basis for [[Meyer Kayserling]]'s German translation (also published by Benjamin II, Hanover, 1863). [[Nikolai Kostomarov|Kostomarov]], utilizing [[Salomon Mandelkern]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] translation, gives many extracts from it in his ''Bogdan Chmielnicki'' (iii. 283-306).

''Yeven Mezulah'' came under criticism in the late 20th century, due to its severe overstatment of casualties during the [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] rebellion in 1648 and 1649, and it is no longer considered a reliable historical source in spite of its literary qualities. ''Yeven Mezulah'' was criticized in particular by [[Shaul Stampfer]], Edward Fram, [[Paul Robert Magocsi]]'s "Ukraine: A History", and [[Petro Mirchuk]].&lt;ref&gt;Stampfer, Shaul. "What Actually Happened to the Jews of Ukraine in 1648?" Jewish History 17, no. 2 (2003): 207–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fram, Edward. "Creating a Tale of Martyrdom in Tulczyn, 1648." Jewish History and Jewish Memory, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirchuk, Petro. "My Meetings and Discussions in Israel: Ukrainian-Jewish Relations throughout the Ages." Accessed March 21, 2014. http://exlibris.org.ua/mirchuk/r08.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other works ==
Hannover's other works are: 
* ''Ṭa'ame Sukkah,'' a homiletic explanation of the [[Succot|Feast of Tabernacles]] (Amsterdam, 1652)
* ''Safah Berurah,'' a dictionary of the Hebrew, German, Italian, and Latin languages, and arranged in Hebrew alphabetical order (Prague, 1660) – in a second edition, by [[Jacob Koppel ben Wolf]] (Amsterdam, 1701), French was included
* ''Sha'are Ẓiyyon,'' a collection of mystical prayers, religious customs, and ascetic reflections; it was taken chiefly from cabalistic works, and was very popular among the Eastern Jews. It appeared first in Prague in 1662, and enjoyed such popularity that it was several times reedited (see [[Benjacob]], ''Oẓar ha-Sefarim,'' p.&amp;nbsp;604). 
* Reference is also made by Hannover in his books to the following three unpublished works: 
** ''Neṭa' Sha'ashu'im,'' homilies on the Pentateuch
** ''Neṭa' Ne'eman,'' a cabalistic work
** A commentary on the ''Otiyyot de R. Aḳiba.''

Wisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, [[Iran]] and many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, particularly in [[Albania]] where his films were the only ones by Western actors permitted by dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] to be shown.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8042823/Sir-Norman-Wisdom.html|title=Sir Norman Wisdom|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Chaplin]] once referred to Wisdom as his "favourite clown".&lt;ref name="BBCFool"/&gt;

Wisdom later forged a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City|New York]] and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently'' in 1981. He toured [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"/&gt; After the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], a hospice was named in his honour.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; In 1995 he was given the [[Freedom of the City]] of London and of [[Tirana]].&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; The same year he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt;

==Early life==
Norman Joseph Wisdom was born in the [[Marylebone]] district of London. His parents were Frederick, a [[chauffeur]], and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a [[dressmaker]] who often worked for West End theatres, and had made a dress for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Don't Laugh at Me, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas "Fred" Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, [[Maida Vale]], London W9, where they slept in one room.&lt;ref name="MyTurn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wisdom| first1=Norman |last2=Hall |first2=William |title= My Turn|publisher=Arrow Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-09-944676-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother were raised in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their father.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

After a period in a [[Foster care|children's home]] in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Kent]], Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but returned to become an [[errand boy|errand]] boy in a [[grocery store|grocer's shop]] on leaving school at 13. Having been kicked out of his home by his father and become homeless,&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;''[[Norman Wisdom: My Story]]'', [[BBC Two]], 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in 1929 he walked (by his own account) to [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], where he became a [[cabin boy]] in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]]. He later also worked as a [[coal mining|coal miner]], [[waiting staff|waiter]] and [[Page (occupation)|page boy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Military service==
Wisdom first enlisted into the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)]], but his mother had him discharged as he was under age. He later re-enlisted as a [[drummer#In the military|drummer boy]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in the [[10th Royal Hussars]] of the [[British Army]]. In 1930, he was posted to [[Lucknow]], in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] of [[British Raj|British India]],&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; as a [[Military band|bandsman]]. There he rode horses, became the [[flyweight]] boxing champion of the [[British Indian Army|British Army in India]]&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; and learned to play the trumpet and clarinet.&lt;ref name="MyTurn"/&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Wisdom was sent to work in a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. He met [[Winston Churchill]] on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls,&lt;ref name="MyTurn"/&gt; Wisdom then joined the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]].

Whilst performing a [[shadow boxing]] routine in an army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3751896.stm|title=Sir Norman takes final stage bow|date=18 October 2004|work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop his skills as a musician and [[performance art|stage entertainer]].&lt;ref name="BBCFool"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/779888.stm|title=Sir Norman: Nobody's fool|date=6 June 2000|work=BBC News |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 aged 25, at a [[NAAFI]] entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the [[orchestra pit]], and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of facial expressions. He later described the reaction as: "They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing."&lt;ref name=GuardWordsWis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/25/features.magazine1|title=Words of Wisdom|first=Burhan |last=Wazie|work=[[The Observer]] |date=25 February 2001|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom later said this was where he first patented his persona as "The Successful Failure".&lt;ref name=GuardWordsWis/&gt; Over the next few years, until he was demobilized in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at [[Cheltenham Town Hall]], actor [[Rex Harrison]] came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/3086186.stm|title=Plaque marks comic's time in forces|date=6 September 2003|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic entertainer==
After being demobilised Wisdom worked as a [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom|private hire car driver]]. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]].&lt;ref name="MyTurn"/&gt;

Wisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31; his rise to the top was phenomenally fast. Initially the [[Double act|straight man]] to the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] [[David Nixon (magician)|David Nixon]],&lt;ref name="BBCFool"/&gt; he had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed [[flat cap]] askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume—known as "the Gump"—was to dominate Wisdom's film career. A [[West End theatre]] star within two years, he honed his performance skills mainly between theatres in London and [[Brighton]]:&lt;ref name=GuardWordsWis/&gt;
{{quote|I spent virtually all of those years on the road. You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.}}
 
Wisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in ''[[A Date with a Dream]]'' released in the same year.

==Starring film roles for the Rank Organisation==
Wisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the [[Rank Organisation]], beginning with ''[[Trouble in Store]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/450916/|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK |isbn=0-413-77301-9|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film earned him a [[BAFTA Award]] for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1953|title=Film Nominations 1953|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.&lt;ref name="Wayne"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27253063 |title=John Wayne Heads Box-Office Poll |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=31 December 1954 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His films' cheerful, unpretentious appeal make them the direct descendants of those made a generation earlier by [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFarlane|first1=Brian|last2=Slide|first2=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of British Film|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/450806/|accessdate=22 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|location=London, UK |isbn=0-413-77301-9|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Never highly thought of by the critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom's films were among Britain's biggest box-office successes of their day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by [[Edward Chapman (actor)|Edward Chapman]] (as Mr Grimsdale) or [[Jerry Desmonde]]. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical [[slapstick]] comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.

Wisdom's second film as star, ''[[One Good Turn (1955 film)|One Good Turn]]'' (1955), was the seventh most popular movie of 1955 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;'Dirk Bogarde favourite film actor', ''The Irish Times'' (1921–Current file) [Dublin, Ireland] 29 Dec 1955: 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a cameo in ''[[As Long as They're Happy]]'' (1955) then returned in ''[[Man of the Moment (1955 film)|Man of the Moment]]'' (1955).

Wisdom was a window cleaner in ''[[Up in the World]]'' (1956) and worked in a jewellery store in ''[[Just My Luck (1957 film)|Just My Luck]]'' (1957). The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but ''[[The Square Peg]]'' (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"Year Of Profitable British Films." Times [London, England] 1 January 1960: 13. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Less successful was ''[[Follow a Star]]'' (1959). ''[[There Was a Crooked Man (film)|There Was a Crooked Man]]'' (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. ''[[The Bulldog Breed]]'' (1960) was more conventional. The film also starred a young [[Michael Caine]] who later recalled he not enjoy working with Wisdom because he "wasn't very nice to support-part actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/michael-caine-interview-my-generation-venice-film-festival-films-london-a7928461.html|title=Michael Caine interview: Every single person I knew became rich|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=9 November 2017| location=London, UK| date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.

Wisdom was in ''[[The Girl on the Boat (film)|The Girl on the Boat]]'' (1961) from a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], a second film away from the Rank formula. ''[[On the Beat (1962 film)|On the Beat]]'' (1962) as a car cleaner. and ''[[A Stitch in Time (film)|A Stitch in Time]]'' (1963), in which he was cast as an apprentice butcher, returned him to the regular format.

''[[The Early Bird]]'' (1965), his first colour film, had Wisdom as a milkman. After a cameo in ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), Wisdom starred in ''[[Press for Time]]'' (1966), the last film in this sequence of starring vehicles.&lt;!-- &amp; implicitly of films for Rank. --&gt; Wisdom was still voted the 5th most popular star at the British box office.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Most popular star for third time |date=31 December 1966 |page_number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst Wisdom's stage performances often involved musical numbers, he wrote only a few of them. He has seven songs attributed to him in the [[ASCAP]] database, which are: "Beware", "Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)", "Falling in Love", "Follow a Star", "I Love You", "Please Opportunity", and "Up in the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&amp;mode=results&amp;searchstr=9735600&amp;search_in=c&amp;search_type=exact&amp;search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&amp;results_pp=25&amp;start=1|title=Works Written by Wisdom Norman|work=The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:Norman Wisdom 2 (1965).jpg|thumb|left|Norman Wisdom demonstrating a typical expression (1965)]]
In 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in a Broadway production of the [[Jimmy Van Heusen]] and [[Sammy Cahn]] [[musical comedy]] ''Walking Happy''. His performance was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

This led to Wisdom's being cast in his first Hollywood movie, ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]'' (1968). Back in England he tried to change his image slightly in ''[[What's Good for the Goose]]'' (1969), which featured a topless scene, but it was financially unsuccessful.

Wisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', however he turned the role down and it eventually went to [[Michael Crawford]]. The creator of the series [[Raymond Allen (scriptwriter)|Raymond Allen]] later stated "Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didn't find it funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/646955/Frank-Spencer-Raymond-Allen-sports-relief-some-mothers-do-ave-em|title=The man who made Frank Spencer|first=Peter|last=Robertson|date=24 February 2016|newspaper=[[Daily Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 1976, Wisdom performed his theme song "Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)" on [[BBC1]]'s ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4227445.stm |work=BBC News |title=In pictures: Sir Norman Wisdom |date=4 February 2005 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisdom had performed in front of the Queen at many Royal Command Performances, the first being in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|title=1952, London Palladium|work=The Royal Variety Performance|publisher=Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund|accessdate=11 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009061416/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1950s/1952|archivedate=9 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also completed his first American film as a [[vaudeville]] comic in ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. After a typical performance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCFool"/&gt; further US opportunities were denied him when he had to return to London after his second wife left him. His subsequent career was largely confined to television, and he toured the world with a successful cabaret act. He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play ''Going Gently''.

After touring South Africa and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent. He spent much of the 1980s in seclusion on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary|title=Sir Norman Wisdom obituary|first=Stephen|last=Dixon|date=4 October 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom's career revived in the 1990s, helped by the young comedian [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], whose act was often compared to Wisdom's work.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3626118/%27All-I%27ve-ever-felt-on-stage-is-pain%27.html|title=All I've ever felt on stage is pain|last=Rees|first=Jasper|date=25 October 2004|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London, UK |accessdate=11 October 2010|quote=I saw his films as a kid. It surprises me because if you watch my act it's nothing like his really. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His films for Rank were playing to new audiences via television screenings, with young fans in the United Kingdom and abroad. The high point of this new popularity was the [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55710 |date=30 December 1999 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/04/norman-wisdom-dies-aged-95|title=Norman Wisdom dies aged 95|date=4 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=5 October 2010  | first=Jo | last=Adetunji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 until 2004 he appeared in the recurring role of Billy Ingleton in the long-running [[BBC]] comedy ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''. The role was originally a one-off appearance, but proved so popular that he returned as the character on a number of occasions. In 1996, he received a Special Achievement Award from the [[London Film Critics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticscircle.org.uk/film/award.asp?CAT=sa&amp;title=Special%20Awards |title=Film – Special Awards |work=London Film Critics Circle |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207041912/http://criticscircle.org.uk/film/award.asp?CAT=sa&amp;title=Special%20Awards |archivedate=7 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom was a guest on a ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' special in 2000 for actor and director [[Todd Carty]]. He appeared as a half-time guest at the England vs [[Albania]] 2002 World Cup qualifier at [[St James' Park]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and scored a penalty at the Leazes End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/albania/724796/Albania-Stormin-Norman.html|title=Albania: Stormin' Norman|last=Labes|first=Lucinda |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 February 2009 | location=London, UK | date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Wisdom filmed a cameo role as a butler in a low-budget horror film. In 2004, he made an appearance on ''[[Coronation Street]],'' playing fitness fanatic pensioner Ernie Crabbe. In 2007 he came out of retirement to take a role in a short film called ''[[Expresso (film)|Expresso]]''.&lt;ref name="newfilm-bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/articles/2007/05/03/expresso_feature.shtml |title=New film: Expresso|date=7 May 2007 |work=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity in Albania===
Wisdom was a well-known performer in [[Albania]], where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country during the [[dictatorship]] of [[Enver Hoxha]]. From Hoxha's misconceived view, proletarian Norman's ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as "Mr Pitkin" after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, [[Sali Berisha]]. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by ''[[Newsnight]]'' as he visited a children's project funded by ChildHope UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9063102.stm|title=Norman Wisdom mobbed by Albanian fans on 1995 trip |date=5 October 2010 |work=Newsnight |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a visit in 2001, which coincided with the [[England national football team|England football team]] playing [[Albania national football team|Albania]] in the city of [[Tirana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He appeared on the pitch before the start of the Albania v England match wearing a half-Albanian and half-English football shirt. He was well received by the crowd, especially when he performed one of his trademark trips on his way out to the centre circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1251406.stm |title=Sir Norman Wisdom: Clown Prince of Albania |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2001 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Wisdom was made an honorary citizen of Tirana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tirana.gov.al/common/images/NORMAN%20WISDOM%20.pdf |title=Per Dhenien e Titullit "Qytetar Nderi I Qytetit Te Tiranes" |trans-title=For Issue of Title "Honorary Citizen of the city of Tirana" |date=18 January 1995 |work=Tirana Municipal Council |language=Albanian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324053146/http://www.tirana.gov.al/common/images/NORMAN%20WISDOM%20.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book and TV series ''One Hit Wonderland'', [[Tony Hawks]] united with Wisdom and, along with [[Tim Rice]], released a single, "Big in Albania", in an attempt to enter the Albanian pop charts. It reached number 18 on the Top Albania Radio chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julia |last=Stuart |title=Tony Hawks: Big in Albania |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tony-hawks-big-in-albania-648516.html |date=16 July 2002 |accessdate=29 December 2008 | newspaper=The Independent | location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
[[File:Norman Wisdom Peel IoM 2005 -CCR27366-.jpg|thumb|Wisdom in [[Peel, Isle of Man]], in 2005]]
In October 2004 Wisdom announced he would retire from the entertainment industry on his 90th birthday (4 February 2005). He announced that he intended to spend more time with his family, playing golf and driving around the Isle of Man, where he was living.&lt;ref name="BBC retires"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3735104.stm|title=Sir Norman Wisdom to retire at 90|date=11 October 2004|work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Wisdom returned to acting in a short film directed by Kevin Powis, ''[[Expresso (film)|Expresso]]''. The film, which Wisdom later announced (reported BBC/ITV News) was to be officially his last film role, is set during one day in a coffee shop and was funded by the UK Film Council and ScreenWM. Shot in January, it premièred at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity [[Macmillan Cancer Support|Macmillan]] and released on DVD in aid of the charity.

In the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.&lt;ref name="BBCEspres"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6965560.stm|title=Sir Norman's swansong is released|date=27 August 2007|work=BBC News |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wisdom was married twice. His first wife was Doreen Brett, whom he married in 1941. By 1944 they had separated when Doreen gave birth to a son, Michael (born 1944), fathered by Albert Gerald Hardwick, a telephone engineer.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The marriage was dissolved in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1318107/Sir-Norman-Wisdom-remembered-underdog-world-laugh.html|title=How Norman Wisdom really did laugh all the way to his grave|date=6 October 2010|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=8 October 2010 |location=London, UK | first=Michael | last=Thornton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married his second wife, Freda Isobel Simpson in 1947;&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; they had two children: [[Nicholas Wisdom|Nicholas]] (born 1953, who later played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]){{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and Jacqueline (born 1954).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The couple divorced in 1969,&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; with Wisdom granted full custody of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1317750/Sir-Norman-Wisdom-beloved-comic-dies-95.html|title=Sir Norman Wisdom, the beloved comic who spent a lifetime playing the fool, dies at 95|date=5 October 2010|newspaper=Daily Mail |accessdate=8 October 2010 |location=London, UK | first1=Emily | last1=Sheridan | first2=Paul | last2=Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freda Wisdom died in [[Brighton]] in 1992.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Popular in the Isle of Man, he lived for 27 years in a house in [[Andreas, Isle of Man|Andreas]] named Ballalough ([[Manx language]] for "lake farm", also a humorous corruption of the English "belly laugh"). A supporter of various charities including [[Mencap]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in 2005 Wisdom starred in a video for the [[Manx people|Manx]] girl group Twisted Angels, for their single "LA", in support of the local charity Project 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/4275924.stm|title=Sir Norman 'launches punk career'|date=23 September 2005 |work=BBC News |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, he was involved in a famous legal case (''Wisdom v Chamberlain'', 1968) in which he was pursued by the [[Inland Revenue]] for tax on profits made from the sale of silver bullion he had bought when concerned about the further devaluation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]]. He contended that it was an investment but the court held that it had been a trading venture and was duly chargeable to [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wisdom v Chamberlain (Inspector of Taxes) (8 November 1968) |date=21 February 2017 |url=http://swarb.co.uk/wisdom-v-chamberlain-inspector-of-taxes-ca-8-nov-1968/ |website=Swarb.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lover of cars, his collection included a 1956 [[Bentley S1#Bentley Continental|Bentley S1 Continental R Type fastback]], which he first bought in 1961, and then again in the late 1980s.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/685318.stm|title=Wisdom's classic car farewell|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 March 2000|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' In 1969, he purchased, after the divorce from Freda Simpson, a Shelby Cobra 427, CSX3206, in New York, which he kept until 1986, when it was sold to another car enthusiast in Brighton, UK. Until his age and declining mental health meant he failed a [[Department of Transport (Isle of Man)|Department of Transport]] fitness-to-drive test, he owned and drove a 1987 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit]] and a [[Jaguar S-Type]], which were sold in September 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1963, he bought a new motor yacht. The {{convert|94|ft}} long hull and superstructure were built in [[Spain]] for £80,000, before being towed to [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], [[West Sussex]], for fitting-out. After three years of extensive works and sea trials, she was named M/Y ''Conquest'' and valued at £1.25 million by insurers. It was available for charter at £6,000 a month but Wisdom later sold it, saying that he was "no sailor".&lt;ref name=GuardWordsWis/&gt;

===Allegations of inappropriate behaviour===
Actress [[Fenella Fielding]], who worked with Wisdom on his 1959 film ''[[Follow a Star]]'', said he was "not a very pleasant man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day's filming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/08/fenella-fielding-carry-on-screaming-kenneth-williams-norman-wisdom-interview|title=Carry on Screaming's Fenella Fielding on fighting with Kenneth Williams and bouncing back after bankruptcy|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 November 2017| location=London, UK| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynda Bellingham]], who worked with Wisdom on ''[[A Little Bit of Wisdom]]'', recalled a comedy sketch where "for ten minutes I stood there while he basically touched me up and you couldn't say anything because he was the master of comedy."&lt;ref name="chortle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2017/11/20/38474/youd_never_get_away_with_it_today...|title=You'd never get away with it today...|publisher=www.chortle.co.uk|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]], who had a [[number one]] with "[[I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)|I Love To Love]]" in 1976, alleged that Wisdom molested her in his dressing room when she was 16.&lt;ref name="chortle" /&gt;

==Health decline==
In mid-2006, after he suffered an irregular heart rhythm, Wisdom was flown by helicopter to hospital in [[Liverpool]] and was fitted with a [[heart pacemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/5165764.stm |title=Comedian recovers after heart op |accessdate=12 October 2010 | date=10 July 2006 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, newspapers of the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] group and the [[Isle of Man Newspapers]] reported that Wisdom was in the Abbotswood [[nursing home]] in [[Ballasalla]], where he had been resident from 12 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news?articleid=3107897 |title=Comic legend needs time to settle in home, says son |date=12 August 2007 |work=Isle of Man Today |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309092127/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news?articleid=3107897 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the release of ''Expresso'' to DVD in the same month, BBC News confirmed that Wisdom lived in a care home, because of his suffering from [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]].&lt;ref name="BBCEspres"/&gt; It was also reported that he had granted his children [[power of attorney]] over his affairs and, having sold off his flat in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], they were now in the process of selling his Isle of Man home to raise money to fund his longer term care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1619398.mostviewed.comedy_legend_leaves_epsom_flat_for_good.php|title=Comedy legend leaves Epsom flat for good|date=18 August 2007|newspaper=[[Surrey Comet]] |publisher=Newsquest Media Group|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exclusive interview on 27 August 2007 with the ''[[News of the World]]'', journalists were given access to Wisdom's room at the home. He said he was happy and content in a routine which his family and carers considered kept him safe in spite of the memory losses associated with his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/1908_norman.shtml |title=Grim?

His family said that Wisdom's memory loss had become so severe that he no longer recognised himself in his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=508495&amp;in_page_id=1879|title=Norman Wisdom's family reveal how dementia has left him not knowing who he is |newspaper=Daily Mail |first=Sabine |last=Durrant|date=15 January 2008|accessdate=16 January 2008 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In the six months prior to his death, Wisdom suffered a series of strokes, causing a decline in his physical and mental health.  He died on 4 October 2010 at Abbotswood nursing home on the Isle of Man at the age of 95.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedy actor Sir Norman Wisdom dies aged 95|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11473192 |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2010|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His publicist, Phil Day, said, "I have never met anyone in the profession who didn't like him, right up to royalty."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/oct/05/norman-wisdom-dies-aged-95 |title=Norman Wisdom, last survivor of the music halls, dies aged 95|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK | first=Maev | last=Kennedy |authorlink=Maev Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1911">'''Peter Greene (Mayor)''' (October 1895 – 21 December 1963) was [[Mayor of Galway]] from 1954 to 1960.

Greene was born at the family home at the Fishmarket Pub, Spanish Arch. His father was Coleman Greene of [[Carna, County Galway|Carna]] and his mother was Julia McGrath from Newcastle. He was a member of the Old [[Irish Republican Army]] from 1917 to 1926, when he joined [[Fianna Fáil]]. The following year he married and subsequently fathered three children. He represented the East Ward on the Urban Council from 1934.

As Mayor, he opened the first [[Galway Oyster Festival]] in September 1954. He was also Mayor during the [[K.L.M.]] ''Hugo de Groot'' disaster in August 1958, of which there were no survivors. Only thirty-four bodies were recovered. In 1960 [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] awarded Mayor Greene the Insignia of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]], in recognition of the efforts of the Mayor and people of Galway. It was formally presented to the Mayor by the Dutch Ambassador in the city's Great Southern Hotel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">'''Rondell "Fineman" Rawlins''' (c. 1975 &amp;ndash; August 28, 2008) was a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] [[gang]] leader and [[fugitive]] believed responsible for a number of crimes in that [[South America]]n nation. Rawlins was responsible for the murder of Guyanese Agriculture Minister [[Satyadeow Sawh]] on April 22, 2006, along with Sawh's brother and a security guard.{{Verify source|date=September 2013}} On January 26, 2008, Rawlins and his men killed eleven people, including five children, in an attack on the village of Lusignan in what is known as the [[Lusignan Massacre]].{{Verify source|date=September 2013}} On February 17, the gang carried out the [[Bartica Massacre]], when they  attacked the town of Bartica, Essequibo, and killed 12 people including three police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ramoutar |first= Paras |title=Bartica in Guyana turns into ghost town after massacre |publisher=[http://www.thaindian.com Thaindian news] |date=2008-02-19 |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/bartica-in-guyana-turns-into-ghost-town-after-massacre_10019139.html |accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawlins believed that his missing girlfriend had been abducted by the government, thus motivating the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Korten |first=Tristram |title=Gang's Terror Spree was Years in the Making |publisher=[[Miami Herald]] |date=2008-06-15 |url=http://www.pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id=919 |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617050101/http://pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id=919 |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guyanese government put a reward of 50 million [[Guyanese dollar]]s (US$250,000) on Rawlins and launched a nationwide manhunt. The search for Rawlins came to an end on August 28, 2008, when police caught up with Rawlins at one of his hideouts near the capital [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. Police shot and killed Rawlins and two other gang members in the shootout that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Associated Press]] |title=Guyana agents kill massacre suspect in raid |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=2008-08-29 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/29/news/CB-Guyana-Fugitive-Killed.php |accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakuntala Devi''' (4 November 1929&amp;nbsp;– 21 April 2013) was an Indian writer and [[mental calculator]], popularly known as the "human computer".&lt;ref name=HINDU&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakuntala Devi strove to simplify maths for students |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mathematical-genius-shakuntala-devi-no-more/article4640134.ece?homepage=true |newspaper=The Hindu |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakuntala Devi, 'Human Computer' Who Bested the Machines, Dies at 83 |first=Haresh |last=Pandya |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/asia/shakuntala-devi-human-computer-dies-in-india-at-83.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Shakuntala Devi |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10011281/Shakuntala-Devi.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JENSEN&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jensen |first=Arthur R. |date=July–September 1990 |title=Speed of information processing in a calculating prodigy |journal=Intelligence |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=259–274 |location=University of California, Berkeley, United States |url=http://stepanov.lk.net/mnemo/jensen.html |accessdate=9 July 2013 |doi=10.1016/0160-2896(90)90019-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: India's 'human computer' Shakuntala Devi |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-22244118 |newspaper=BBC News |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her talent earned her a place in the 1982 edition of ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]''.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;

As a writer, Shakuntala Devi wrote a number of books, including novels as well as texts about mathematics, puzzles, and astrology. She wrote the book, ''The World of Homosexuals'',  which is considered the first study of [[homosexuality]] in India. She treated homosexuality in an understanding light and is considered a pioneer in the field.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===

Shakuntala Devi was born in [[Bangalore]], [[Madras province]],  British India,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt; to an orthodox [[Brahmin]] family.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news |title=Science: Numbers Game |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822325,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=14 July 1952 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father rebelled against becoming a temple priest&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=ib/&gt; and instead joined a circus where he worked as a [[trapeze]] artist, [[lion tamer]], [[tightrope walker]] and [[magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=BANGALORE&gt;{{cite news |title=She made learning maths as thrilling as magic |author1=Aditi Mishra |author2=Siddarth Kumar Jain |url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/others/She-made-learning-maths-as-thrilling-as-magic/articleshow/21204048.cms?&amp;subsite= |newspaper=The Bangalore Mirror |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered his daughter's ability to memorise numbers while teaching her a card trick when she was about three years old.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Her father left the circus and took her on road shows that displayed her ability at calculation.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; She did this without any formal education.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt; At the age of six, she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the [[University of Mysore]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;

In 1944, Shakuntala Devi moved to London with her father.

=== Mental calculation ===

Shakuntala Devi travelled the world demonstrating her [[arithmetic]] talents, including a tour of Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by [[Arthur Jensen]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the [[cube root]] of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375.&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=JENSEN/&gt; Jensen reported that Shakuntala Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook.&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=JENSEN/&gt; Jensen published his findings in the academic journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=JENSEN/&gt;

In 1977, at [[Southern Methodist University]], she gave the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=JENSEN/&gt; Her answer—546,372,891—was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards by the [[UNIVAC 1101]] computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation.&lt;ref name="Smith 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Steven Bradley |title=The Great Mental Calculators: The Psychology, Methods, and Lives of Calculating Prodigies, Past and Present |year=1983 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0231056400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 1980, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers—7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779—picked at random by the Computer Department of [[Imperial College London]]. She correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730 in 28 seconds.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt; This event was recorded in the 1982 ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt; Writer Steven Smith said, "the result is so far superior to anything previously reported that it can only be described as unbelievable".&lt;ref name="Smith 1983"/&gt;

Shakuntala Devi explained many of the methods she used to do mental calculations in her book 'Figuring: The Joy of Numbers', that is still in print.  See the Works section below.

=== Book on homosexuality ===

In 1977, she wrote ''The World of Homosexuals'', the first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Globalizing queer?

This book treated homosexuality in a positive light and reviewed the socio-cultural and legal situation of homosexuality in India and contrasted that with the gay liberation movement then taking place in the USA."&lt;/ref&gt; study of [[homosexuality in India]].&lt;ref name="worldoh"/&gt; In the documentary ''For Straights Only'', she said that her interest in the topic came out of her marriage to a homosexual man and her desire to look at homosexuality more closely to understand it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orinam.net/r-i-p-shakuntala-devi-math-evangelist-and-ally-of-the-queer-community/ R.I.P.

The book, considered "pioneering",&lt;ref name=sslii&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P2nprDLPRLwC&amp;pg=PT247&amp;dq=%22mathematical%20wizard%22 | editor1 = Ruth Vanita | editor2 = Saleem Kidwai | title = Same-Sex Love in India: A Literary History | publisher= Penguin UK | year=2008 | isbn= 9788184759693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; features interviews with two young Indian homosexual men, a male couple in Canada seeking legal marriage, a temple priest who explains his views on homosexuality, and a review of the existing literature on homosexuality.&lt;ref name=swpmsm/&gt; It ends with a call for decriminalization of homosexuality, and "full and complete acceptance—not tolerance and sympathy".&lt;ref name=sslii/&gt; The book, however, went mostly unnoticed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue16/chandra_review.htm | author = Subhash Chandra | title = Review of "The Construction of Queer Culture in India: Pioneers and Landmarks" | journal = Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific | issue = 16 | date = March 2008 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[...] The reason for this book not making its mark was because Shakuntala Devi was famous for her mathematical wizardry and nothing of substantial import in the field of homosexuality was expected from her. Another factor for the indifference meted out to the book could perhaps be a calculated silence because the cultural situation in India was inhospitable for an open and elaborate discussion on this issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===

She returned to India in the mid-1960s and married Paritosh Banerji, an officer of the [[Indian Administrative Service]] from [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref name=YAHOO&gt;{{cite news |title=India's math wizard, Shakuntala Devi |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/india-s-math-wizard--shakuntala-devi-102612575.html |newspaper=Yahoo!

In addition to her work as a mental calculator, Devi was an [[Astrology|astrologer]] and an author of several books, including cookbooks and novels.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=BANGALORE/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==

In April 2013, Shakuntala Devi was admitted to a hospital in [[Bengaluru]] with respiratory problems.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt; Over the following two weeks she suffered from complications of the heart and kidneys.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; She died in the hospital on 21 April 2013.&lt;ref name=HINDU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; She was 83 years old then.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt; She is survived by her daughter, Anupama Banerjee.&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=BANGALORE/&gt;

On 4 November 2013, Shakuntala Devi was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]] for what would have been her 84th birthday (https://www.google.com/doodles/shakuntala-devis-84th-birthday).&lt;ref&gt;TNN (4 November 2013) [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/internet/Shakuntala-Devis-84th-birthday-celebrated-with-a-doodle/articleshow/25203546.cms "Shakuntala Devi's 84th birthday celebrated with a doodle"].

'''Sigismund of Luxembourg''' (15 February 1368 in [[Nuremberg]] – 9 December 1437 in [[Znojmo|Znaim]], [[Moravia]]) was  [[Prince-elector]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] from 1378 until 1388 and from 1411 until 1415, [[King of Hungary]] and [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia]] from 1387, [[King of Germany]] from 1411, [[King of Bohemia]] from 1419, [[King of Italy]] from 1431, and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1433 until 1437, and the last male member of the [[House of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543594/Sigismund|title=Sigismund - Holy Roman emperor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1396 he led the disastrous [[Battle of Nicopolis|Crusade of Nicopolis]], which attempted to liberate [[Bulgaria]] from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. Afterwards, he founded the [[Dragon Order|Order of the Dragon]] to fight the [[Turkish people|Turks]]. He was regarded as highly educated, spoke several languages (among them French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin) and was an outgoing person who also took pleasure in the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]]. Sigismund was one of the driving forces behind the [[Council of Constance]] that ended the [[Western Schism|Papal Schism]], but which also led to the [[Hussite Wars]] that dominated the later period of Sigismund's life.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born in [[Nuremberg]], Sigismund was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], and of his fourth wife, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], who was the granddaughter of [[King of Poland|King]] [[Casimir III of Poland]] and the great-granddaughter of the [[List of rulers of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Gediminas]]. He was named after [[Saint Sigismund of Burgundy]], the favourite saint of Sigismund's father. From Sigismund's childhood he was nicknamed the "ginger fox" (''liška ryšavá'') in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], on account of his hair colour.

[[File:Mary (Chronica Hungarorum).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sigismund's first wife, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary I, Queen of Hungary]].]]

King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great of Hungary and Poland]] always had a good and close relationship with Emperor Charles IV, and Sigismund was [[Betrothal|betrothed]] to Louis' eldest daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], in 1374, when he was six years old. Upon his father's death in 1378, young Sigismund became [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] and was sent to the Hungarian court, where he soon learnt the Hungarian language and way of life, and became entirely devoted to his adopted country. King Louis named him as his heir and appointed him his successor as [[King of Hungary]].

In 1381, the then 13-year-old Sigismund was sent to [[Kraków]] by his eldest half-brother and guardian [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia]], to learn [[Polish language|Polish]] and to become acquainted with the land and its people. King Wenceslaus also gave him [[Neumark]] to facilitate communication between Brandenburg and Poland.

The disagreement between Polish landlords of [[Lesser Poland]] on one side and landlords of [[Greater Poland]] on the other, regarding the choice of the future King of Poland, finally ended in choosing the Lithuanian side. The support of the lords of Greater Poland was however not enough to give Prince Sigismund the Polish crown. Instead, the landlords of Lesser Poland gave it to Mary's younger sister [[Jadwiga I of Poland]], who married [[Jogaila]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]].

=== King of Hungary ===
[[File:765572.jpg|thumb|Gold coin of Sigismund of Hungary with his coat of arms (right), and the image of the King Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] (left).]]

On the death of her father in 1382, his betrothed, Mary, became queen of Hungary and Sigismund married her in 1385 in Zólyom (today [[Zvolen]]). The next year, he was accepted as Mary's future co-ruler by the [[Treaty of Győr (1386)|Treaty of Győr]]. However, Mary was captured, together with her mother, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], who had acted as regent, in 1387 by the rebellious [[House of Horvat]], Bishop [[Paul Horvat]] of [[Mačva]], his brother [[John Horvat]] and younger brother Ladislav. Sigismund's mother-in-law was strangled, while Mary was liberated.

Having secured the support of the nobility, Sigismund was crowned [[King of Hungary]] at [[Székesfehérvár]] on 31 March 1387.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, "The Kingdoms of Central Europe in the Fourteenth Century", p. 743.&lt;/ref&gt; Having raised money by pledging [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to his cousin [[Jobst of Moravia|Jobst, margrave of Moravia]] (1388), he was engaged for the next nine years in a ceaseless struggle for the possession of this unstable throne. The central power was finally weakened to such an extent that only Sigismund's alliance with the powerful Czillei-Garai League could ensure his position on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/hunhist_II.html|title=ungarische geschichte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not for entirely selfless reasons that one of the leagues of barons helped him to power: Sigismund had to pay for the support of the lords by transferring a sizeable part of the royal properties. (For some years, the baron's council governed the country in the name of the [[Holy Crown]]). The restoration of the authority of the central administration took decades of work. The bulk of the nation headed by the [[House of Garai]] was with him; but in the southern provinces between the [[Sava]] and the [[Drava]], the Horvathys with the support of King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]], Mary's maternal uncle, proclaimed as their king [[Ladislaus, king of Naples]], son of the murdered [[Charles II of Hungary]]. Not until 1395 did [[Nicholas II Garay]] succeed in suppressing them. Mary died heavily pregnant in 1395.

To ease the pressure from Hungarian nobles, Sigismund tried to employ foreign advisors, which was not popular, and he had to promise not to give land and nominations to other than Hungarian nobles. However, this was not applied to [[Stibor of Stiboricz]], who was Sigismund's closest friend and advisor. On a number of occasions, Sigismund was imprisoned by nobles, but with help of the armies of Garai and Stibor of Stiboricz, he would regain power.

==== Crusade of Nicopolis ====
[[File:Zsigmond Nikápolyban.jpg|275px|thumb|King Sigismund of Hungary during the [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396. Painting by Ferenc Lohr (1896), main hall of the Castle of Vaja.]]

In 1396, Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Turks, who had taken advantage of the temporary helplessness of Hungary to extend their dominion to the banks of the [[Danube]]. This crusade, preached by [[Pope Boniface IX]], was very popular in Hungary. The nobles flocked in their thousands to the royal standard, and were reinforced by volunteers from nearly every part of Europe. The most important contingent being that of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] led by [[John the Fearless]], son of [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy]]. Sigismund set out with 90,000 men and a flotilla of 70 galleys. After capturing [[Vidin]], he camped with his Hungarian armies before the fortress of [[Nicopolis, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]]. Sultan [[Bayezid I]] raised the siege of Constantinople and, at the head of 140,000 men, completely defeated the [[Christianity|Christian]] forces in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] fought between the 25 and 28 September 1396. Sigismund returned by sea and through the realm of [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]], where he ordained a local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] lord [[Đurađ II]] with the islands of [[Hvar]] and [[Korčula]] for resistance against the Turks; the islands were returned to Sigismund after Đurađ's death in April 1403.

The disaster at Nicopolis angered several Hungarian lords, leading to instability in the kingdom. Deprived of his authority in Hungary, Sigismund then turned his attention to securing the succession in [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was recognized by his childless half-brother [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]] as Vicar-General of the whole Empire. However, he was unable to support Wenceslaus when he was deposed in 1400, and [[Rupert of Germany]], Elector Palatine, was elected [[King of Germany|German king]] in his stead.

[[File:Sigismundof Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sigismund of Luxembourg, official imprint.]]

==== Return to Hungary ====
On his return to Hungary in 1401, Sigismund was imprisoned once and deposed twice. In 1401, Sigismund helped an uprising against Wenceslaus, during the course of which the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]n king was taken prisoner, and Sigismund ruled Bohemia for nineteen months. He released Wenceslaus in 1403. In the meantime, a group of Hungarian noblemen swore loyalty to the last Anjou monarch, [[Ladislaus of Naples]], putting their hands on the relic of Saint Ladislas of Hungary in Nagyvárad. Ladislaus was the son of the murdered [[Charles II of Hungary]], and thus a distant relative of the long dead King [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Ladislaus captured [[Zadar]] in 1403, but soon stopped any military advance. This struggle in turn led to a war with the [[Republic of Venice]], as Ladislaus had sold the [[Dalmatia]]n cities to the Venetians for 100,000 ducats before leaving for his own land. In the following years Sigismund acted indirectly to thwart Ladislaus' attempts to conquer central Italy, by allying with the Italian cities resisting him and by applying diplomatic pressure on him.

Due to his frequent absences attending to business in the other countries over which he ruled, he was obliged to consult Diets in Hungary with more frequency than his predecessors and institute the office of Palatine as chief administrator while he was away.&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/HUNGARY.htm#LajosIdied1382B |title=Hungary Kings |title-date= |accessdate=22 May 2010 |date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1404, Sigismund introduced the ''Placetum Regium''. According to this decree, [[Papal bull]]s could not be pronounced in Hungary without the consent of the king.

During his long reign, the royal castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late [[Middle Ages]].

==== King of Croatia ====
[[File:Drinking horn of Sigismund of Luxemburg.PNG|166px|thumb|[[Drinking horn]] of Sigismund of Luxembourg, before 1408.]]

In about 1406, Sigismund married Mary's cousin [[Barbara of Celje]] (Barbara Celjska, nicknamed the "[[Messalina]] of Germany"), daughter of Count [[Hermann II of Celje]]. Hermann's mother Katarina Kotromanić (of the House of [[Kotromanic]]) and Mary's mother Queen Elizabeta ([[Elisabeth of Bosnia]]) were sisters, or cousins who were adoptive sisters. Tvrtko I was their first cousin and adopted brother, and perhaps even became heir apparent to Queen Mary. Tvrtko may have been murdered in 1391 on Sigismund's order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Sigismund managed to establish control in [[Slavonia]]. He did not hesitate to use violent methods (see [[Bloody Sabor of Križevci]]), but from the river Sava to the south his control was weak. Sigismund personally led an army of almost 50,000 "crusaders" against the [[Bosnians]], culminating with the [[Battle of Dobor]] in 1408, a massacre of about 200 [[nobility|noble]] families.

====Order of the Dragon====
Sigismund founded his personal order of knights, the [[Order of the Dragon]], after the victory at Dobor. The main goal of the order was fighting the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Members of the order were mostly his political allies and supporters. The main members of the order were Sigismund's close allies [[Nicholas II Garay]], [[Hermann II of Celje]], [[Stibor of Stiboricz]], and [[Pippo Spano]].  The most important European monarchs became members of the order. He encouraged international trade by abolishing internal duties, regulating tariffs on foreign goods and standardizing weights and measures throughout the country.

=== King of the Romans ===
After the death of King [[Rupert of Germany]] in 1410, Sigismund – ignoring the claims of his half-brother Wenceslaus – was elected as successor by three of the [[prince-elector|elector]]s on 10 September 1410, but he was opposed by his cousin [[Jobst of Moravia]], who had been elected by four electors in a different election on 1 October. Jobst's death 18 January 1411 removed this conflict and Sigismund was again elected king on 21 July 1411. His [[coronation]] was deferred until 8 November 1414, when it took place at [[Aachen]].

=== Anti-Polish alliances ===
On a number of occasions, and in 1410 in particular, Sigismund allied himself with the [[Teutonic Knights]] against [[Jogaila|Władysław II]] of Poland. In return for 300.000 ducats he would attack [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]] from the south after the truce on St. John's Day, 24 June expired. Sigismund ordered his most loyal friend [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] to set up the attack on Poland. Stibor of Stiboricz was of Polish origin and from the main line of the powerful [[Clan of Ostoja]] that had also been against choosing Jagiello as King of Poland. With the support of Sigismund, Stibor become one of the most influential men in late medieval Europe, holding titles as [[Duke]] of [[Transylvania]] and owning about 25% of modern-day [[Slovakia]], including 31 castles of which 15 were situated around the 406&amp;nbsp;km long [[Váh]] river with surrounding land that was given to him by Sigismund. In the diplomatic struggle to prevent war between Poland-Lithuania, which was supported by the Muscovites, and the Teutonic Knights, Sigismund used Stibor's fine diplomacy to gain financially. The Polish side appointed several negotiators and most of them were also from the Clan of Ostoja, distant relations of the Stibors. However, those "family meetings" could not prevent the war and an alliance of twenty-two western states formed an army against Poland in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in July 1410. Stibor attacked then [[Nowy Sącz]] and burned it to the ground, but after that he returned with his army back to the [[Beckov Castle]]. After the Polish-Lithuanian victory in the [[Battle of Grunwald]], the Teutonic knights had to pay a huge sum of silver to Poland as reparation and again, through diplomacy of his friend Stibor, Sigismund was able to borrow all this silver from King Władysław II of Poland on good conditions. In the light of facts about the diplomatic work of Stibor and the Clan of Ostoja that was following the politics of King Sigismund, one can question whether Sigismund actually joined the anti-Polish alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Dvořáková, Daniela : Rytier a jeho kráľ. Stibor zo Stiboríc a Žigmund Lucemburský. Budmerice, Vydavatel'stvo Rak 2003, {{ISBN|978-80-85501-25-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Council of Constance ===
[[File:Meister der Chronik des Konzils von Konstanz 001.jpg|thumb|Sigismund and Barbara of Celje at the Council of Constance.]]

From 1412 to 1423, Sigismund campaigned against the [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]]ns in [[Italy]]. The king took advantage of the difficulties of [[Antipope John XXIII]] to obtain a promise that a [[council of Constance|council]] should be called in [[Constance]] in 1414 to settle the [[Western Schism]]. He took a leading part in the deliberations of this assembly, and during the sittings made a journey to [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in a vain attempt to secure the abdication of the three rival popes. The council ended in 1418, solving the Schism and — of great consequence to Sigismund's future career — having the [[Czech people|Czech]] religious reformer, [[Jan Hus]], [[execution by burning|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] in July 1415. The complicity of Sigismund in the death of Hus is a matter of controversy. He had granted him a [[safe conduct|safe-conduct]] and protested against his imprisonment; and the reformer was burned during his absence.

It was also at this Council that a cardinal ventured to correct Sigismund's [[Latin]] (he had construed the word ''schisma'' as feminine rather than neuter). To this Sigismund replied, in Latin:
{{quote|I am king of the Romans and above grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Original Latin: ''Ego sum rex Romanus et super grammaticam'' {{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Carlyle |year=1858 |title=History of Friedrich II of Prussia, Called Frederick the Great (Volume II) |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/02frd10.txt |publisher=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This utterance prompted historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] to give him the nickname "Super Grammaticam" from the response that he had given ("Ego sum rex Romanus et super grammaticam").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GRUNDY|first=T. R.|date=1872-12-28|title=SIGISMUND "SUPER GRAMMATICAM"|url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/s4-X/261/524-c.extract|journal=Notes and Queries|language=en|volume=s4-X|issue=261|doi=10.1093/nq/s4-X.261.524-c|issn=0029-3970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSISDAAAQBAJ|title=Jacob Wackernagel, Lectures on Syntax: With Special Reference to Greek, Latin, and Germanic|last=Wackernagel|first=Jacob|last2=Langslow|first2=David|date=2009-04-30|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198153023|page=456|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alliance with England against France, and a failed attempt, owing to the hostility of the princes, to secure peace in Germany by a league of the towns, were his main acts during these years. Also, Sigismund granted control of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] (which he had received back after Jobst's death) to [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] of [[Hohenzollern]], burgrave of [[Nuremberg]] (1415). This step made the Hohenzollern family one of the most important in Germany.

Sigismund began to shift his alliance from France to England after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. The Treaty of Canterbury (August 15, 1416) culminated diplomatic efforts between [[Henry V of England]] and Sigismund and resulted in a defensive and offensive alliance against France. This, in turn, led the way to the resolution of the [[Western Schism|papal schism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Guenee |authorlink=Bernard Guenée |title=Between Church and State: The Lives of Four French Prelates in the Late Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9Qwkh0DKxwC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=treaty+of+canterbury+1415&amp;source=web&amp;ots=x2TyfxPNa5&amp;sig=cHl8BNegXsPS0NY3xe0peB3uLB0&amp;hl=en#PPA245,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer 082.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Emperor Sigismund, painted by [[Albrecht Dürer]] after the emperor's death.]]

In 1419, the death of [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] left Sigismund titular [[King of Bohemia]], but he had to wait for seventeen years before the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] would acknowledge him. Although the two dignities of King of the Romans and King of Bohemia added considerably to his importance, and indeed made him the nominal temporal head of [[Christianity|Christendom]], they conferred no increase of power and financially embarrassed him. It was only as [[King of Hungary]] that he had succeeded in establishing his authority and in doing anything for the order and good government of the land. Entrusting the government of Bohemia to [[Sofia of Bavaria]], the widow of Wenceslaus, he hastened into [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].

The Bohemians, who distrusted him as the betrayer of [[Jan Hus|Hus]], were soon in arms; and the flame was fanned when Sigismund declared his intention of prosecuting the war against heretics. Three campaigns against the [[Hussites]] ended in disaster although the army of his most loyal ally [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] and later his son [[Stibor of Beckov]] could hold the Hussite side away from the borders of the Kingdom. The Turks were again attacking Hungary. The king, unable to obtain support from the German princes, was powerless in Bohemia. His attempts at the diet of [[Nuremberg]] in 1422 to raise a mercenary army were foiled by the resistance of the towns; and in 1424 the electors, among whom was Sigismund's former ally, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I of Hohenzollern]], sought to strengthen their own authority at the expense of the king. Although the scheme failed, the danger to Germany from the Hussites led to the Union of Bingen, which virtually deprived Sigismund of the leadership of the war and the headship of Germany.

===Final years===
In 1428, Sigismund led another campaign against the Turks, but again with few results. In 1431, he went to [[Milan]] where on 25 November he received the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] as King of Italy; after which he remained for some time at [[Siena]], negotiating for his [[coronation]] as emperor and for the recognition of the Council of Basel by [[Pope Eugenius IV]]. He was crowned emperor in [[Rome]] on 31 May 1433, and after obtaining his demands from the Pope returned to Bohemia, where he was recognized as king in 1436, though his power was little more than nominal. Shortly after he was crowned, Pope Eugenius began attempts to create a new anti-Ottoman alliance.&lt;ref name="Buda2"&gt;{{harvnb|Buda|2002|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was sparked{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} by an [[Albanian Revolt of 1432–36|Albanian revolt]] against the Ottomans, which had begun in 1432. In 1435, Sigismund sent [[Fruzhin]], a Bulgarian nobleman, to negotiate an alliance with the Albanians. He also sent Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, in early 1436.&lt;ref name="Islami4"/&gt; However, following the defeat of the rebels in 1436, plans for an anti-Ottoman alliance ended.&lt;ref name="Islami4"&gt;{{harvnb|Islami|Anamali|Korkuti|Prendi|2002|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigismund died on 9 December 1437 at [[Znojmo]] ({{lang-de|Znaim}}), [[Moravia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]), and as ordered in life, he was buried at [[Nagyvárad]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] (today [[Oradea]], [[Romania]]), next to the tomb of the king Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who was the ideal of the perfect monarch, warrior and Christian for that time and was deeply venerated by Sigismund.&lt;ref&gt;Bertényi Iván. (2000). A Tizennegyedik Század története. Budapest: Pannonica kiadó.&lt;/ref&gt; By his second wife, [[Barbara of Celje]], he left an only daughter, [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], who was married to [[Albert II of Germany|Albert V, duke of Austria]] (later German king as Albert II) whom Sigismund named as his successor. As he left no sons, his line of the [[House of Luxembourg]] became extinct on his death.

== Family and issue ==
Sigismund married twice but had little luck in securing the succession to his crowns. Each of his two marriages resulted in the birth of one child. His [[Childbirth|first-born]] child, probably a son, was born prematurely as a result of a horse riding accident suffered by Queen [[Mary of Hungary]] when she was well advanced in pregnancy. Mother and child both died shortly after the birth in the hills of [[Buda]] on 17 May 1395. This caused a deep succession crisis because Sigismund ruled over [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] by right of his wife, and although he managed to keep his power, the crisis lasted until his second marriage to [[Barbara of Celje]]. Barbara's only child, [[born in the purple]] on 7 October 1409, probably in the castle of [[Visegrád]], was [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], the future [[queen consort]] of Hungary, Germany, and Bohemia. Queen Barbara was unable to give birth to any further issue. [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1409–1442)|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] was thus the only surviving legitimate offspring of Sigismund.

=== Hungarian affiliations ===
[[File:Coa Hungary Family Hunyadi János (extended) v2.svg|right|thumb|Coat of arms of John Hunyadi.]]

Sigismund was known to speak fluent [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], wore Hungarian-style royal clothes, and even grew his beard in the Hungarian fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Hóman Bálint: Magyar középkor II. Attraktor, Gödöllő, Hungary, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent huge amounts of money during his reign to rebuild the Gothic castles of [[Buda Castle|Buda]] and [[Visegrád]] in the Kingdom of Hungary, ordering the transportation of materials from Austria and Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;Mályusz Elemér: Zsigmond király uralma Magyarországon 1387–1437, Gondolat, Budapest, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

His many affairs with women led to the birth of several [[legend]]s, as the one that existed decades later during the reign of the King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. According to this, [[John Hunyadi]] was Sigismund's illegitimate son. Sigismund gave a ring to the boy's mother when he was born, but one day in the forest a raven stole it from her, and the ring was only recovered after the bird was hunted down. It is said that this incident inspired the coat of arms of the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadi]]s, and later also appeared in the coat of arms of Matthias "Corvinus".&lt;ref&gt;Dümmerth Dezső: A két Hunyadi. Panoráma, Budapest, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigismund adopted the Hungarian reverence for Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who was considered to be an ideal Christian knight at that time. He went on pilgrimage several times to his tomb in Nagyvárad. Before Sigismund died, he ordered to be buried next to the king saint.&lt;ref&gt;C.

== Reformatio Sigismundi ==
{{main article|Reformatio Sigismundi}}
The '''''Reformatio Sigismundi''''' appeared in connection with efforts to [[Imperial Reform|reform]] the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the reign of Emperor Sigismund (1410–1437). It was presented in 1439 at the [[Council of Basel]], published by an anonymous author, and referred to the injustice of the German rulers. It included a [[vision (religion)|vision]] of Sigismund's about the appearance of a priest-king, Frederick, as well as plans for a wide [[reform]] of the monarchy and emperorship and the German empire.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, she became the first Algerian woman to publish a novel.&lt;ref name="Ilahiane" /&gt;

== Biography ==
She was born to a family of [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] [[Roman Catholic]] converts, the only daughter in a family of six sons.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/21866/Marguerite-Taos-Amrouche "Marguerite Taos Amrouche",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family had moved to Tunisia to escape persecution after their conversion.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

[[File:The tomb of Taos Amrouche at the Cemetery, Saint-Michel l'Observatoire, France.jpg|thumb|The grave of Taos Amrouche in the Cemetery, Saint-Michel l'Observatoire.]]

Her mother [[Fadhma Aït Mansour]], who was a famous Kabyle singer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.osu.edu/literary-map-of-africa/authors/amrouche-marguerite-taos "Amrouche, Marguerite Taos (Algeria)", Literary Map of Africa], University Libraries, Ohio State University.&lt;/ref&gt; had a great impact on her life, and her literary style would reflect the oral traditions of the [[Kabylie]] Berber people of her mother's heritage.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Amrouche received her elementary and secondary education in Tunis,&lt;ref name="Ilahiane"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0E8qp_k515oC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Marguerite+Taos+Amrouche+biography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qBVjwUwNeQ&amp;sig=BUjO7wnRhZEB-1n56y5sa29OmXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rk36UcCNDsqc0wXS4IHACg&amp;ved=0CJwBEOgBMBM#v=onepage&amp;q=Marguerite%20Taos%20Amrouche%20biography&amp;f=false "Taos-Amrouche, Marguerite (Marie-Louise)", in Hsain Ilahiane, ''Historical Dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen)''], Scarecrow Press, 2006, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1935 went to France for studies at the École Normale at [[Sèvres]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; From 1936, in collaboration with her elder brother [[Jean Amrouche]] and her mother, Amrouche collected and began to interpret Kabyle songs.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1939, at the Congrès de Chant de Fès, she received a scholarship to study at the Casa Velasquez in [[Spain]], where she researched the ties between Berber and Spanish popular songs.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Her autobiographical first novel, ''Jacinthe noir'', was published in 1947 and is one of the earliest ever published in French by a North African woman writer. With her compilation of tales and poems ''La Grain magique'' in 1966, she took the ''nom de plume'' '''Marguerite-Taos''', Marguerite being her mother's [[Christian name]].

While she wrote in [[French language|French]], she sang in [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]. Her first album ''Chants berbères de Kabylie'' (1967), which was a great success, was a collection of traditional Kabyle songs that had been translated into French by her brother Jean. She recorded several other albums, including ''Chants sauvés de l’oubli'' ("Songs Saved from Oblivion"), ''Hommage au chant profond'' ("Homage to a Profound Song"),&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; ''Incantations, méditations et danses sacrées berbères'' (1974), and ''Chants berbères de la meule et du berceau'' (1975).&lt;ref name="Ilahiane" /&gt;

She was an activist in [[Berber people|Berber]] issues and was among the founders of [[Académie berbère]] in 1966.

She died in Saint-Michel-l'Observatoire in France.&lt;ref name="Ilahiane" /&gt;

'''Theresa Elizabeth (Chandler) White Weasel Walker Lamebull''' (April 19, 1896 &amp;ndash; August 10, 2007) was reputedly  a supercentenarian believed to have been the oldest living member of the [[Gros Ventres|Gros Ventre]] Tribe of Montana and possibly the oldest [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Ogden |title=Gros Ventre woman, 110, a living bridge to the 'buffalo days' |url=http://milkriver.blogspot.com/2006/09/nat-living-bridge.html |format=Reprint |work=Great Falls Tribune |date=2006-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Indian name was "Kills At Night" (BeeKanHay).

Lamebull's family hadn't known exactly how old she was until some time around 2005 when they found a baptismal certificate which may be hers. A priest translated the Latin on the certificate as saying she was a year old when she was baptised in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays woman dies at 111 |url=http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2007/08/14/news/state/90-hays.txt |work=Billings Gazette |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamebull was a fluent speaker of the [[Gros Ventre language]], spoken by only a handful of other people. She taught the language at [[Fort Belknap College]], and helped develop a dictionary using the [[Phraselator]] when she was 109.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was likely Montana's longest-lived teacher since statehood.

The Hays Education Resource Center on the Fort Belknap Reservation was named the 'Kills At Night Center' in her honor and at the naming ceremony Terry Brockie, an A'aninin (Gros Ventres) language teacher sang her a traditional song in the A'aninin language.

She died in August 2007 at the claimed age of 111.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lamebull leaves behind strong legacy, example |url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070816/OPINION/708160306 |work=Great Falls Tribune |date=2006-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral Mass was held at St. Paul's Catholic Gymnasium in [[Hays, Montana]], and she was buried at Mission Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Tituba''' was an enslaved woman, owned by [[Samuel Parris]]&lt;ref name="Schiff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiff|first=Stacy|date=November 2015|title=The Devil's Tongue|journal=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=46|issue=7|pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Danvers, Massachusetts]]. Although her origins are debated, research has suggested that she was a [[South America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] and sailed from [[Barbados]] to [[New England]] with Samuel Parris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiff|first=Stacy|year=2015|title=The Devil's Tongue|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.login.library.coastal.edu:2048/eds/detail/detail?sid=6e2ee932-599a-4d45-883f-bf018fb7b1c8@sessionmgr105&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=110592162&amp;db=f5h|journal=Smithsonian|volume=46|pages=|via=MasterFILE premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tituba was the first to be accused of practicing [[witchcraft]] during the 1692 [[Salem witch trials]]. Little is known regarding Tituba's life prior to her enslavement. However, she became a pivotal figure in the witch trials when she confessed to witchcraft while also making claims that both [[Sarah Good]] and [[Sarah Osborne]] participated in said witchcraft. She was imprisoned and later released by Samuel Conklin, but little to nothing is known about Tituba's life following her subsequent release.

==Early life and accusations against her==
Tituba's husband was John Indian, a Native American man whose origins are unknown, but he may have been from Central America. Tituba as well may have been originally from Central America before Barbados.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Salem Witch Trials Reader (Cambridge, Massachusetts2009), 228.|last=Hill|first=Frances|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=228|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are arguments made that Tituba was African American but this has been contradicted by historians, including Elaine Breslaw, who partially blames Charles Upham, who got false information from Samuel Drake, for the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Tituba, Reluctant Witch by Elaine Breslaw p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly she was born in Barbados but, regardless, she was a descendant of captives on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Tituba, Reluctant Witch by Elaine Breslaw p.&amp;nbsp;3 - 20&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband went on to become one of the accusers in the Witch Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salem Story: Reading the Witch Trials of 1692|last=Rosenthal|first=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=60|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear documented together in Samuel Parris's church record book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tituba was the first person to be accused by [[Betty Parris (Salem witch trials)|Elizabeth Parris]] and [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]] of witchcraft. It has been theorized that Tituba told the girls tales of [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] and witchcraft prior to the accusations.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Shapiro |first=Laura |date=31 August 2016 |title=The Lesson of Salem |url=http://gnauss.hrsbteachers.ednet.ns.ca/sites/gnauss.hrsbteachers.ednet.ns.ca/files/documents/The%20Lesson%20of%20Salem.pdf |magazine=Newsweek |location=New York City, New York |publisher= |access-date= |pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the first to confess to witchcraft in [[Salem Village, Massachusetts|Salem Village]] in March 1692. Initially denying her involvement in witchcraft, Tituba later confessed to making a "witchcake", due to being beaten by [[Samuel Parris]] with the intention of getting a confession. When questioned later, she added that she knew about occult techniques from her mistress in Barbados, who taught her how to ward herself from evil powers and how to reveal the cause of witchcraft. Since such knowledge was not meant for harm, Tituba again asserted to Parris she was not a witch, but admitted she had participated in an occult ritual when she made the witchcake in an attempt to help Elizabeth Parris.&lt;ref name="Breslaw"&gt;Breslaw, Elaine G. ''Tituba, Reluctant Witch of Salem: Devilish Indians and Puritan Fantasies''. New York: New York University Press, 1996, pp. 107, 170, et al.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acab"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Parris, Samuel|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne were sent to jail in Boston to await trial and punishment on March 7, 1692 &lt;ref name="Breslaw" /&gt;. Despite these confessions, there is no proof that she did the things to which she confessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Salem Witch Trials Reader|last=Hill|first=Frances|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other women and men from surrounding villages were accused of witchcraft and arrested at the Salem witchcraft trials. Not only did Tituba accuse others in her confession, but she talked about black dogs, hogs, a yellow bird, red and black rats, cats, a fox and a wolf. Tituba talked about riding sticks to different places. She confessed that Sarah Osborne possessed a creature with the head of a woman, two legs, and wings. Since it mixed various perspectives on witchcraft, Tituba's confession confused listeners, and its similarities to certain stock tropes of [[demonology]] caused some Salem Village residents to believe that [[Satan]] was among them.&lt;ref name="Breslaw" /&gt;

==Fiction==
[[Image:TitubaandtheChildren-Fredericks.jpg|thumb|right|Tituba, as portrayed in the 19th century by artist Alfred Fredericks in W.C. Bryant's ''A Popular History of the United States'']]

The majority of fictional pieces that artistically or historically depict Tituba's life portray her as an "other" or an "outgroup" by Puritan society, due to her racial and socioeconomic status as a South American Native Indigenous and an indentured servant woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cakirtas|first=Onder|year=2013|title=Double Portrayed: Tituba, Racism and Politics|url=http://oaji.net/articles/2014/505-1393081090.pdf|journal=International Journal of Language Academy|volume=1|pages=13–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not explicitly discussed in all of the movies, plays and books, that account for Tituba's conviction, it is quite possible that the "fear of strangers" in combination with the Western European traditional belief and understanding of witchcraft, made Tituba a prime target for witchcraft conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last=Tierney|first=H|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Westpot, CT|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to the historical understanding of Tituba and why she was convicted, it has been argued that the pre-existing ideas about "out groups" and stereotypical ideas of foreign cultures combined with fictional portrayals of witchcraft and sorcery works, has created a case where history and fiction shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jalalzai|first=Zubeda|year=2009|title=Historical Fiction and Maryse Condéś, "I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem"|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=7f489e7a-2523-42cc-9905-ebf5e1ba4d74%40sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4205&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=khh&amp;AN=59830080|journal=African American Review|volume=43|pages=419|via=History Reference Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the fictional works have assisted in the idea of what the Salem Witch Trials were like and what events lead to the convictions, trials and confessions, but without factoring in racial, political, religious and economic influences of the time, the portrayals of Tituba in media remain, for the most part, fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spellbound: Women and Witchcraft|last=Reis|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Scholarly Resources|year=1998|isbn=|location=Wilmington, Del|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], in his 1868 play entitled ''[[Giles Corey]] of the Salem Farms'', describes Tituba as "the daughter of a man all black and fierce…He was an Obi man, and taught [her] magic." [[Obeah]] (also spelled Obi) is a specifically African and Afro-American system of magic."&lt;ref name="Hansen Meta"&gt;Hansen, Chadwick. "The Metamorphosis of Tituba, or Why American Intellectuals Can't Tell a Native Witch from a Negro", ''The New England Quarterly'' 47 (March 1974), pp. 3–12.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She featured prominently in the 1953 play ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]] as well as the [[The Crucible (1957 film)|1957]] and [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996]] film adaptations of the play. Tituba is played by American born actress, [[Charlayne Woodard]], in the 1996 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940128/|title=Charlayne Woodard|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Tituba as the instigator of witchcraft at Salem was reinforced by the opening scene of ''The Crucible'', which owes much to [[Marion L. Starkey]]'s work ''The Devil in Massachusetts'' (1949).&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Harold|title=Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations – Arthur Miller's The Crucible|date=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780791098288|page=209|edition=New|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp3P5Vk6bUYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%22the+crucible%22+%22The+Devil+in+Massachusetts%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aI1Rf0RvVd&amp;sig=L3V122fp2Th3XhiqpWeemEbRLHk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8l8bGnvXJAhVBdT4KHcI9A5YQ6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20crucible%22%20%22The%20Devil%20in%20Massachusetts%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play, Tituba was brought to Salem from Barbados, was taught how to conjure up spirits, and had allegedly dabbled in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], witchcraft, and [[Satanism]]. These fictional accounts hold that [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]] and the other girls tried to use her knowledge when dancing in the woods before the trials began; it was, in fact, their being caught that led to those events. With the original intention of covering up their own [[sin]]ful deeds, Tituba was the one to be accused by Abigail, who had in fact drunk from a magic cup Tituba made to kill John Proctor's wife, Elizabeth, and to bewitch him into loving her. She and the other girls claimed to have seen Tituba "with the [[Devil]]". It is ironic that the belief that Tituba led these girls astray has persisted in popular lore, fiction and non fiction alike. The charge, which is seen by some as having barely disguised racist undertones, is based on the imagination of authors like Starkey, who mirrors Salem's accusers when she asserts that "I have invented the scenes with Tituba .... but they are what I really believe happened."{{r|Bloom}}

Tituba is also the main character in the 1956 book ''[[Tituba of Salem Village]]'' by [[Ann Petry]]. Written for children 10 and up, it portrays Tituba as a black West Indian woman who tells stories about life in Barbados to the village girls. These stories are mingled with existing superstitions and half-remembered pagan beliefs on the part of Puritans (for instance, it is a white neighbor who makes the witch cake, rather than Tituba herself), and the witchcraft hysteria is partly attributed to a sort of [[cabin fever]] during a particularly bitter winter.

Tituba is the subject of the award-winning novel ''[[I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem]]'' (1986) by [[Maryse Condé]], a novel version of Tituba's life which creates a biography for her, beginning and ending in Barbados, and including supernatural elements.

Tituba appears in the novel ''Calligraphy of the Witch'' (2007) by [[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]] as an Arawak Native American Indigenous from [[Guyana]] fluent in several languages, and the only person in the Boston area who understands Spanish.  She is a friend and English tutor to the indentured servant Concepción Benavidez who is accused of witchcraft in the Boston area because of her Mexican and Catholic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serendipitylit.com/clients/item/calligraphy-of-the-witch-a-novel |title=Calligraphy of the Witch: A Novel |last=|first= |publisher= |date= |website=Serendipity Lit |access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also featured as a main character on WGN's television series ''[[Salem (TV series)|Salem]]'' (2013). The show portrays her as being a powerful witch, along with other historical figures from the Salem Witch Trials who also are portrayed as having supernatural powers.

In ''[[American Horror Story: Coven]]'' (2013-2014), young African-American witch [[Queenie (American Horror Story)|Queenie]] states that she is a descendant of Tituba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/american-horror-story-which-witch-was-the-most-badass-1447254644 |title=American Horror Story: Which Witch Was the Most Badass This Week? |last=Davies|first=Madeleine |publisher=Gawker Media |date=17 October 2013 |website=Jezebel |access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the series, Voodoo Queen [[Marie Laveau (American Horror Story)|Marie Laveau]] and Supreme witch [[Fiona Goode]] have an in-depth discussion of Tituba's history and legacy. They suggest her magic came from her [[Arawak]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/471066/american-horror-story-coven-witches-and-bitches-lowdown |title=American Horror Story: Coven: Witches and Bitches Lowdown! |last=Bricker |first=Tierney |publisher=E!

'''Thomas J. Peters''' (born November 7, 1942) is an American writer on [[business management]] practices, best known for ''[[In Search of Excellence]]'' (co-authored with [[Robert H. Waterman Jr]]).

==Life and education==
Peters was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He went to [[Severn School]] a private, preparatory high school, graduating in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.severnschool.com/page/News-Detail?pk=785157] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peters then attended [[Cornell University]], receiving a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[civil engineering]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornell.edu/video/kindness-is-free-and-turns-a-profit-says-tom-peters|title=Kindness is free and turns a profit, says business guru Tom Peters '64 - CornellCast|website=CornellCast.edu|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a master's degree in 1966.

He returned to academia in 1970 to study business at [[Stanford Business School]]&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tompeters.com/2011/03/a-brief-history-of-the-7-s-mckinsey-7-s-model/|title=A Brief History of the 7-S ("McKinsey 7-S") Model - Tom Peters|date=March 8, 2011|website=Tompeters.com|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=January 2017}} receiving an [[MBA]] followed by a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1977. The title of his dissertation was "Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaJEAAAAIAAJ|title=Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies|last=Peters|first=Thomas J.|date=1977-01-01|publisher=Stanford University|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Weick credited Peters' dissertation with giving him the idea for his 1984 article:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0hZAAAAYAAJ|title=Management Laureates: A Collection of Autobiographical Essays|last=Bedeian|first=Arthur G.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Jai Press|isbn=9781559384711|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Small wins: Redefining the scale of social problems." &lt;ref&gt;Weick, K. E. (1984). Small wins: redefining the scale of social problems. American Psychologist, 39 (1), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While at Stanford, Peters was influenced by [[James G. March|Jim G. March]], [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] (both at Stanford), and [[Karl Weick]] (at the University of Michigan). Later, he noted that he was influenced by [[Douglas McGregor]] and [[Einar Thorsrud]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/44077/tom-peterss-true-confessions|title=Tom Peters’s True Confessions|date=November 30, 2001|website=Fastcompany.com|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he also received an honorary doctorate from the [[State University of Management]] in Moscow.

==Career==
From 1966 to 1970, he served in the [[United States Navy]], making two deployments to [[Vietnam]] as a Navy [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]], then later working in [[the Pentagon]].  From 1973 to 1974, he worked in the [[White House]] as a senior drug-abuse advisor, during the [[Nixon administration]]. Peters has acknowledged the influence of military strategist Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] on his later writing.

From 1974 to 1981, Peters worked as a [[management consultant]] at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], becoming a partner and Organization Effectiveness practice leader in 1979. In 1981, he left McKinsey to become an independent consultant.

In 1990, Peters was referred to in a British [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) publication as one of the world's ''Quality Gurus''.

In 1995, the ''New York Times'' referred to Peters as one of the top three business gurus in the highest demand as a speaker along with [[Daniel Burrus]] and [[Roger Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Leslie. (8 September 1995). Leaping to the Lectern. Business Day. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Thinkers50 awarded Peters with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his paving the way for the 'thought leadership' and 'business book industries'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thinkers50.com/media/tom-peters-receive-thinkers50-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=Tom Peters to Receive Thinkers50 Lifetime Achievement Award|website=Thinkers50|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


===''In Search of Excellence''===
The publication of the popular business book ''In Search of Excellence'' in 1982 marked a turning point in Peters' career.

Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford in 1977, and returning to McKinsey, the new managing director, [[Ron Daniel]], handed him a "fascinating assignment."&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=January 2017}} Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's [[Boston Consulting Group]], Daniel noted that businesses often failed to effectively implement new strategies, so Peters "was asked to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office."&lt;ref name="tompeters.com"/&gt;{{Self-published source|date=January 2017}}

''[[In Search of Excellence]]'' was published in 1982. It became a bestseller, gaining exposure in the United States at a national level when a series of television specials based on the book and hosted by Peters appeared on [[PBS]]. The primary ideas espoused solving business problems with as little [[business process overhead|business-process overhead]] as possible, and empowering decision-makers at multiple levels of a company.

The December 2001 issue of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' quoted Peters admitting that he and Waterman had falsified the underlying data for ''In Search of Excellence''. He is quoted as saying, " This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/44077/tom-peterss-true-confessions|title=Tom Peters's True Confessions|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later insisted that this was untrue and that he was the victim of an "aggressive headline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{O.K. Corral}}

'''Virgil Walter Earp''' (July 18, 1843 – October 19, 1905) was both deputy U.S. Marshal and [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] City Marshal when he led his brothers [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] and [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]] and [[Doc Holliday]] in a confrontation with outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboys]] at the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881. They killed brothers [[Tom McLaury|Tom]] and [[Frank McLaury]] and [[Billy Clanton]]. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. All four lawmen were charged with murder by [[Ike Clanton]], who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge [[Wells Spicer]] exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty.

But two months later on December 28, friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, ambushing Virgil. They shot him in the back, hitting him with three shotgun rounds, shattering his left arm and leaving him permanently maimed. The Cowboys suspected were let off for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt;{{rp|242}} His brother [[Morgan Earp]] was assassinated in March 1882. Charges against those suspected were dismissed on a technicality.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; Wyatt Earp, appointed as deputy U.S. sheriff to replace Virgil, concluded he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands.&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm |title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |publisher=HistoryNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wgbh/&gt;  Wyatt assembled a federal posse that included their brother [[Warren Earp]] and set out on a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|vendetta]] to kill those they felt were responsible. Virgil left Tombstone to recuperate from his wounds in [[Colton, California]] where his parents lived.

Virgil married before he left to serve in the Union Army during the [[American Civil War]]. When he returned, his wife and child had left. He held a variety of other jobs throughout his life, though he primarily worked in law enforcement.  His younger brother [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], who spent most of his life as a gambler, became better known as a lawman because of writer [[Stuart N. Lake]]'s fictionalized 1931 biography ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' and later portrayals of him in movies and fiction as [[American Old West|Old West's]] "toughest and deadliest gunmen of his day."&lt;ref name=earpnet&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Gatto |url=http://www.wyattearp.net/ |title=Wyatt Earp History Page |publisher=WyattEarp.Net |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film—first-action-hero-wyatt-earp-was-an-elderly-movie-groupie-who-failed-to-make-it-as-an-extra-then-stuart-n-lake-wrote-his-spurious-biography-and-the-starspangled-hero-of-the-o-k-corral-was-born-as-two-new-films-strip-the-myth-to-its-bones-david-ashford-charts-the-making-of-a-hollywood-cowboy-1446479.html |title=First action hero: Wyatt Earp was an elderly movie groupie who failed to make it as an extra... |accessdate=January 10, 2011 |first=David |last=Ashford|date=September 3, 1994 |location=London |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Virgil learned that his first wife Ellen Rysdam and their daughter were living in Oregon and reestablished contact with them. After suffering from pneumonia for six months, Virgil died on October 19, 1905.

==Early life==
Virgil Earp was born in [[Hartford, Kentucky]], the second son of [[Nicholas Porter Earp|Nicholas Earp]] and Virginia Ann Cooksey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virgil Earp|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WWearpV.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marries Ellen Rysdam===

In February 1860, while living in [[Pella, Iowa]], 16-year-old Virgil [[elope]]d with 17-year-old Dutch immigrant Magdalena C. "Ellen" Rysdam (October 25, 1842 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands – May 3, 1910 in [[Cornelius, Oregon]]&lt;ref name=scholton&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scholten |first1=Ju |title=Magdalena C Ellen RYSDAM (1842-1910) » Stamboom Berenpas Scholten » Genealogie Online |url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-scholten/I10239.php |website=Genealogie Online |accessdate=8 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;). One report states that they saw each other only occasionally and kept their marriage secret until Ellen was about to deliver their first child. When her parents Gerrit Rysdam and Magdalena Catrina Van Velzen learned of the marriage, they were furious, as they preferred that she marry a man who was also Dutch.&lt;ref name=gfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Virgil Walter Earp|url=http://www.gfo.org/deaths_ore/virgil-w-earp.htm|website=Genealogy Forum of Oregon|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil's father thought he was too young to marry. Both parents wanted to get the marriage annulled. One source reports that Rysdam was successful, but another says her father failed because Virgil and Ellen refused to reveal where they had been married. They also claimed they had used false names, which would have made the marriage invalid in any case.&lt;ref name=gormley/&gt;

Virgil and Ellen remained together for a year in spite of his and her parents' disapproval. On July 26, 1861, Virgil enlisted at age 18 in the [[Union Army]]. Ellen had a daughter named Nellie Jane, born January 7, 1862&lt;ref name=scholton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ralph |last1=Friedman |edition= Photos by Phoebe L. Friedman |title=Tracking Down Oregon|date=1978|publisher=Caxton Printers|location=Caldwell, Idaho|isbn=9780870042577|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XK9G3wcnmrUC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 |page=71|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|40289053|Nellie Jane Earp Bohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in July 1862.&lt;ref name=gfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt; Virgil was mustered in to the Illinois Volunteer Infantry for three years on September 21, 1862.&lt;ref name=gormley/&gt;

===Serves in Civil War===

Virgil was assigned to the [[83rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|83rd Illinois Infantry]] on August 21, 1863. The 83rd was primarily on garrison duty in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earps Were Shooting Long Before the OK Corral|url=http://www.civilwarprimer.com/2010/07/earps-were-shooting-long-before-the-ok-corral/|publisher=CivilWarPrimer.com|first1=Pat |last1=Granstra|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virgil was court martialed for a minor offense and docked two weeks pay as punishment.&lt;ref name=gormley/&gt;

In the summer of 1863 while Virgil was on active duty, Ellen's father told her that Virgil had been killed in Tennessee. In early 1864, Ellen married a Dutch man named John Van Rossum, and in May of that year they joined a large group who relocated from Pella, Iowa, to the [[Oregon Territory]].&lt;ref name="Beltman"&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.aadas.nl/sites/default/files/proceedings/1997_12_Beltman.pdf  |title=Nineteenth-Century Dutch Migrants Extraordinaire on the Prairie-Plans|first=Brian W. |last=Beltman |publisher=Association for the Advancement of Dutch Americans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Virgil was discharged from the military on June 26, 1865, he returned to Iowa but could not find his wife and daughter. He hired on at a local farm and helped operate a grocery store, before leaving for California to join the rest of the Earp family.  In 1868, Nicholas Earp took the family east again, eventually settling in [[Lamar, Missouri]]. On August 28, 1870, Virgil married Rosella Dragoo (born in France in 1853) in Lamar.&lt;ref name=gormley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gormley|first=Myra Vanderpool|title=Wild West Personalities Produce Bang-Up Pedigree|url=http://www.genealogymagazine.com/wyattearp.html|accessdate=February 20, 2014 |journal=American Genealogy Magazine |volume= 9 |number= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father as [[justice of the peace]] married them, but there are no further records of Rosella.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp|url=http://www.historynet.com/frontier-lawman-virgil-earp.htm|date=June 12, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2015 |first1=Jan S. |last1=Paul |first2=Gene |last2=Carlisle |work=Wild West |publisher=HistoryNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meets Allie Sullivan===
[[File:Allie Packingham Sullivan Earp.jpg|thumb|Alvira "Allie" P Sullivan, Virgil's Earp's future wife, at age 16. They met in Council Bluffs, Iowa, when she was 25 in 1874.]]
Virgil later met Alvira "Allie" Sullivan from [[Florence, Nebraska]] in 1874. She was a waitress at the Planter's House Hotel in Council Bluffs, Iowa.&lt;ref name=waitress&gt;{{cite web |title=Just what is Virgil Earp's connection to Prescott ? {{!}} Prescott Reenactors |url=http://www.prescottreenactors.com/just-what-is-virgil-earps.html |website=www.prescottreenactors.com |accessdate=7 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They never married but remained together the rest of his life. During the remainder of his life, Virgil worked at a variety of jobs, including peace officer, farmer, rail construction in [[Wyoming]], [[stagecoach]] driver, [[sawmill]] sawyer in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott, Arizona Territory]], mailman, and later in life, prospector. The Earp brothers were close and often moved together, seeking a better life. Virgil spent time in [[Dodge City, Kansas]] in 1877 with his younger brother Wyatt, and though there is no record of Virgil ever holding any law enforcement position there, Allie claimed he briefly worked as a deputy town marshal with Wyatt.

===Arrival in Arizona===
From Dodge City, Virgil and Allie moved to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in July 1877, the capital of the [[Arizona Territory]].&lt;ref name=arizonaaffairs&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview With Virgil W. Earp|work=Arizona Affairs|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423122018/http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewtwo.html|archivedate=April 23, 2009|url=http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewtwo.html}} First published in ''Real West'' Magazine in January 1982.

In October 1877, [[U.S. Marshal]] Wiley Standifer, [[Yavapai County]] Sheriff [[Edward Franklin Bowers]], Prescott [[Constables in the United States#Arizona|Constable]] Frank Murray, Virgil Earp, and a man named McCall attempted to arrest John Tallos and an accused murderer named Wilson. While the others road on horseback or carriages, Virgil ran on foot after the posse that pursued the two men to the edge of town, where a gun fight broke out. Virgil spotted one of the two men under a tree, reloading his pistol. Using a Henry rifle from a distance, Virgil shot him through the head, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isenberg|first1=Andrew C.|title=Wyatt Earp: A Vigilante Life|date=June 25, 2013|publisher=Macmillan|asin=B009LRWHV8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=R.

Virgil was shortly afterward offered a job as a driver for Patterson, Caldwell &amp; Levally, a local freight company, during which he met [[John J. Gosper]], Secretary of the Arizona Territory, and usually acting in the place of Governor [[John C. Frémont]], who was usually absent. When Crawley Dake was appointed U.S. Marshal, he and Virgil became friends. In 1878, Virgil was appointed as Prescott's night watchman, which paid $75 a month. In November 1878, he was elected as [[Constables in the United States#Arizona|constable]] for Prescott, for which he received fees for issuing licenses, collecting fees, and serving summonses.&lt;ref name=guinn/&gt; While constable, Virgil wrote his brother Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining [[boomtown]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. In September 1879, Wyatt resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] [[Mattie Blaylock]], his brother [[James Earp|Jim]] and his wife Bessie, "[[Doc Holliday]]"  and [[Big Nose Kate]], they left for Arizona Territory.&lt;ref name=guinn/&gt;&lt;ref name=monahan&gt;{{cite book |title=Mrs. Earp | first= Sherry |last=Monahan |year=2013 |publisher=TwoDot |edition=First |asin= B00I1LVKYA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

==Appointed deputy U.S. marshal==
Knowing Virgil was moving to Tombstone, and knowing of his peace officer background, U.S. Marshal [[Crawley P. Dake|Crawley Dake]] appointed Virgil  as deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone District of Pima County, on November 27, 1879. He was instructed by Dake to help resolve ongoing problems with outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboys]]. But the job didn't pay much. He was mostly on call helping county and city officials.&lt;ref name=marks/&gt;{{rp|113}}

In an interview after he left Tombstone, Virgil said that "The first stage that went out of Prescott toward Tombstone was robbed. Robberies were frequent and became expensive."&lt;ref name=arizonaaffairs/&gt; Virgil and his brothers Wyatt and [[James Earp|Jim]] and their wives arrived together in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] on December 1, 1879.

===Tombstone City Marshal===
On October 30, 1880, after [[Town Marshal#law enforcement#united states#old west|town marshal]] [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]] was accidentally shot and killed by outlaw and gunman [[William Brocius|"Curly Bill" Brocius]], Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone. Virgil now held both the more powerful local town marshal position and the prestigious federal law enforcement appointment. As town marshal, Virgil earned a regular salary of $100 a month plus a percentage of city taxes he collected.&lt;ref name=marks/&gt;{{rp|114}}

But Virgil did not hold the job for long. The city held a special election on November 13, and Tombstone city policemen James Flynn and [[Ben Sippy]] competed for the job. But then Flynn dropped out of the race and Sippy beat Virgil for the office, 311 votes to Earp's 259. On January 4, 1881, the city held its first regular election, and Virgil lost to Sippy once again.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams Jr.|first1=Ramon F.|title=Burs Under the saddle: A Second Look at Books and Histories of the West|date=1989|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0806121703|page=336|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sippy was known to be in financial trouble. He requested a two-week leave of absence on June 6, 1881, and never returned. The city council once again appointed Virgil as temporary city marshal. On June 22, the center section of Tombstone was devastated by a fire. Virgil kept looting under control and chased off lot jumpers who tried to take over property. On June 28, it was learned that Sippy had left about $3,000 in bad debt and financial improprieties in his office.

{{details|Cochise County in the Old West}}

To reduce crime in Tombstone, the City Council enacted an [[Cochise County Cowboys#Weapon ordinance|ordinance]] in April 1881 that prohibited anyone from carrying a deadly weapon in town. Everyone was required to deposit their weapons at a [[livery stable|livery]] or saloon soon after entering town. A long-simmering feud between the Earps and some of the Cowboys played a big role in a gunfight that broke out when Virgil decided to enforce the ordinance on Wednesday, October 26, 1881.&lt;ref name="ordinance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/ordinances.html|title=Ordinances Enforced by the Earps in the OK Corral Shoot-out|accessdate=February 6, 2011|year=2005|author=Douglas Linder|work=Famous Trials: The O.

Virgil was told by several concerned citizens that several [[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboys]], who had been threatening the Earps for several months, were in town and armed in violation of the ordinance. Assisted by his deputy Morgan Earp and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and [[Doc Holliday|John "Doc" Holliday]], Virgil went to disarm [[Frank McLaury|Frank]] and [[Tom McLaury]], [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], and [[Billy Claiborne]]. That confrontation turned into a shootout now known as the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]].

===Gunfight at the O.K. Corral===
{{main|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral}}

The gunfight and later media portrayals made Wyatt Earp a legend. He is often depicted as the central lawman, but he was only Virgil's temporary assistant. Wyatt had acted as city marshal the week prior when Virgil was out of town. Virgil was the city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal. Although Wyatt had previously served in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and Dodge City as a lawman, Virgil had three years of Civil War service, which had given him more combat and shooting experience. He had also served as a lawman off and on since the war.

Before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt had been in only one shootout and Morgan had never been in any gun battles. [[Billy Claiborne]] had been in one gunfight prior to the shootout and was the only member of the Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting experience (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other than a couple of drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holliday|first=Karen Tanner|title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait|year=2001|publisher=University Of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=978-0806133201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from having been [[pistol whip|pistol-whipped]] by the Earps earlier that morning, and at least Ike was still drunk.&lt;ref name=wgbh&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |title=WGBH American Experience: Wyatt Earp, Complete Program Transcript |date = January 25, 2010 |series =22 |volume=2 |type=Television production}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Fred | title = The Historical Atlas of American Crime | date = June 30, 2005| publisher = Facts on File | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8160-4841-0 | page =298}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138|date=November 2012}}

Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had arrived in town early that afternoon and had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable soon after their arrival, as required by [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)#Cowboys and the law|ordinance #9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Law in Tombstone|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/ordinances.html/|accessdate=8 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213174105/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/ordinances.html|archivedate=December 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=John Ringo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mT_E8MS2koC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1996|publisher=Barbed Wire Press|location=Stillwater, OK|isbn=978-0-935269-23-9|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; But around 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a miner named Ruben F. Coleman told Virgil that the Cowboys had left the Dunbar and Dexter Stable for the O.K. Corral and were still armed, and Virgil decided he had to disarm them.&lt;ref name="virgiltestimony"/&gt;

Virgil testified after the shootout that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges at Spangenberg's gun shop beforehand.&lt;ref name="virgiltestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/vearptestimony.html|title=Testimony of Virgil Earp in the Preliminary Hearing in the Earp Case|accessdate=6 February 2011|year=2005|editor-first=Douglas|editor-last=Linder|work=Famous Trials: The O.

To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.&lt;ref name="virgiltestimony"/&gt;

Virgil, his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday confronted the Cowboys in a narrow lot on Fremont Street. Virgil was not expecting a fight. He later testified that when he saw the Cowboys, he immediately commanded them to "Throw up your hands, I want your guns!"&lt;ref name="virgiltestimony"/&gt; But general shooting broke out almost immediately. Witnesses were conflicted about who fired first. During the gunfight, Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Virgil was shot through the calf (he thought by Billy Clanton). Three days after the O.K. Corral gunfight, the city council suspended Virgil as city marshal pending outcome of the [[O.K. Corral hearing and aftermath|preliminary hearing]]. Virgil was eventually exonerated of wrongdoing, but his reputation suffered thereafter.

===Assassination attempt===

After the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] the Earps relocated their families to the Cosmopolitan Hotel for mutual support and protection.&lt;ref name=explorers/&gt; At about 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm on December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room. The ''Sacramento Daily Record-Union'' reported that "he was fired upon with double-barreled shotguns, loaded with buckshot, by three men concealed in an unfinished building diagonally across on Allen street."&lt;ref name=sacrecord&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Sacramento Daily Record-Union |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1881-12-30/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1872&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Earp+Wyatt&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=California&amp;date2=1881&amp;proxtext=wyatt+earp+&amp;y=20&amp;x=15&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1  |page=3|date=December 30, 1881 |volume=56 |number=9594 |title=Attempted Assassination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons|George Parsons]] wrote that he heard "four shots in quick succession." Critically wounded, Virgil staggered into the hotel.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; "One short struck him above the groin, coming out near the spine." The humerus bone in his upper arm was longitudinally fractured.&lt;ref name=sacrecord/&gt;

Dr. [[George E. Goodfellow]] removed {{convert|4|in}} of shattered [[humerus]] bone from Virgil's left arm, leaving his arm permanently crippled, and twenty buckshot from his side. While the doctor worked on his arm, Virgil told his wife Allie, "Never mind, I've got one arm left to hug you with."&lt;ref name=explorers&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose|first=John|url=http://www.wyattearpexplorers.com/wyatts-house.html  |title=Wyatt's House |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil was also shot through the back above the hip, which penetrated his body and lodged near the hip bone above the groin. The ''Los Angeles Daily Herald'' reported that the "cow-boys are bent on vengeance for the slaughter of their companeros a few weeks ago." "The doctor says there are four chances in five that he will die."&lt;ref name=laherald/&gt;

George W. Parsons, who had been treated by Goodfellow for an injury he received, was staying in Goodfellow's office while he recuperated. He kept a journal, in which he recorded:&lt;ref name=bell2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Bob Boze|title=Shotguns at Midnight|journal=True West|date=June 1, 2005|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/shotguns-at-midnight/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others threatened===

Wyatt, assuming that Virgil was dying, telegraphed U.S. Marshal [[Crawley P. Dake|Crawley Dake]] asking him to name Wyatt as Virgil's replacement as deputy U.S. marshal:&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

Commenting on the telegram received by Dake, the ''Weekly Arizona Miner'' wrote about the repeated threats received by the Earps and others. "For some time, the Earps, Doc Holliday, Tom Fitch and others who upheld and defended the Earps in their late trial have received, almost daily, anonymous letters, warning them to leave town or suffer death, supposed to have been written by friends of the Clanton and McLowry boys, three of whom the Earps and Holliday killed and little attention was paid to them as they were believed to be idle boasts but the shooting of Virgil Earp last night shows that the men were in earnest."&lt;ref name=azminer&gt;{{cite journal|title=Weekly Arizona Miner|date=December 30, 1881|volume=3|issue=3|url=http://www.ahfweb.org/sacks/node/24925|accessdate=May 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725183753/http://www.ahfweb.org/sacks/node/24925|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Herald'' reported on December 30 that "the "local authorities are doing nothing to capture the assassins so far as is known...

===Suspects===

The suspected shooters were later identified as [[Phineas Clanton|Phin Clanton]], [[Ike Clanton]], Johnny Barnes, [[Johnny Ringo]], Hank Swilling and [[Pete Spence]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Virgil|title=Warren Earp: The Little Brother|url=http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/tombstone/earp3.html|accessdate=May 26, 2011 |work=the Spell of the West}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, January 31, 1882 Ike and Phin were brought before Judge William H. Stilwell on suspicion of shooting Virgil. The district attorney asked that bail be set at $5,000, but the judge released both men on $1,500 bond, indicating he thought the prosecution's case was weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=John Ringo|year=1996|publisher=Barbed Wire Press|location=Stillwater, OK |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7mT_E8MS2koC&amp;pg=PA241|isbn=978-0-935269-23-9|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241}}

Although a hat that Wyatt later claimed belonged to Ike Clanton was found near the shooting, the evidence was circumstantial.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; [[Sherman McMaster]] provided the most convincing evidence. He testified that he saw Ike later that night in nearby Charleston. He said he asked Clanton "about the shooting, at which Clanton replied that he 'would have to go back and do the job over.'"&lt;ref name=bell2005/&gt; On February 2, Clanton's attorney brought in seven witnesses who provided an [[alibi]] for Clanton.

===Departs for California===

After his shooting, Virgil spent the next three months recuperating. He was just starting to get back on his feet when on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Virgil's younger brother [[Morgan Earp]] was killed in another ambush.&lt;ref name=guinn&gt;{{cite book|last=Guinn|first=Jeff|title=The last Gunfight: the Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K.

On Monday, March 20, Virgil and Allie were escorted by Wyatt and deputies [[Warren Earp]], [[Doc Holliday]], Sherman McMaster, and [[Jack Johnson (gunfighter)|"Turkey Creek" Jack Johnson]] to Contention, where they drove two wagons to the Arizona and New Mexico Railroad terminal {{convert|25|mi}} away in [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]]. Wyatt and his deputies had initially planned to travel only as far as Benson. Wyatt reported later that he received word in Contention that [[Ike Clanton]], [[Frank Stilwell]], [[Hank Swilling]], and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson with the aim to kill Virgil. Wyatt and the rest of the posse remained with Virgil and Allie through to Tucson.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

The men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil's pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Casey |last=Tefertiller|title=Wyatt Earp: the Life Behind the Legend|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-28362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Virgil told the ''San Francisco Examiner'' two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, "Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth."

Virgil was so weak he had to be carried up the steps of the train. Once they were safely seated, the rest of the guards kept watch for the Cowboys.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

As Virgil's train was pulling out of Tucson on its way to California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave contradictory accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Paula Mitchell|title=And Die in the West: the Story of O.K.

Virgil and Allie along with James accompanied Morgan's body to the Earp family home in [[Colton, California]].

When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell may have stumbled or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the ''Denver Republican'', said "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Miller |title=Arizona:The Last Frontier |publisher=Hastings House |date=January 1, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said Stilwell cried "Morg!" before he was killed. Stilwell's body, riddled with buckshot from two shotgun rounds, one in his leg and the second in his chest with powder burns, and four other bullet wounds, was found the next morning near the tracks.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stilwellmurder&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Tombstone Epitaph|date=March 27, 1882|title=Another Assassination Frank Stilwell Found Dead this Morning Being Another Chapter in the Earp-Clanton Tragedy|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021939/1882-03-27/ed-1/seq-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ike Clanton got away. When the Tucson sheriff learned who was responsible for Stilwell's death, he issued warrants for the lawmen's arrest.

Clanton gave an interview afterward to the newspapers in which he claimed that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to federal charges about interfering with a U.S. mail carrier, stemming from his alleged involvement in robbing the Sandy Bob line of the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph |last=Miller |title=Arizona: The Last Frontier |publisher=Hastings House |date=January 1, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Karen Holliday|last2=DeArment|first2=Robert K.|title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait|date=March 2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clanton said that they had heard that the Earps were coming via the train and they had plans to kill Stilwell. According to Clanton, Stilwell disappeared from the hotel before he was found several blocks away, shot dead by the tracks.

==Later life and death==

After receiving his injuries in Tombstone, Virgil spent the next two years recovering from his injuries, primarily at his parents' home in [[Colton, California]]. He sought treatment for his wounds in San Francisco and was interviewed on the Southern Pacific train by a reporter whose story was printed in the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' on May 27, 1882. The reporter described Virgil's appearance:

{{quote|His face, voice and manner were prepossessing. He is close to six feet in height, of medium build, chestnut hair, sandy mustache, light eyebrows, quiet, blue eyes and frank expression. He wore a wide-brimmed, slate-colored slouch hat, pants of a brown and white stripe, and a blue diagonal coat and vest, both the latter with bullet holes in them, bearing testimony of a recent fight when he was shot in the back, the bullet coming out of the front of his vest. His left arm was carried in a sling, also a memento of his last fight, when he received a bullet in his arm, since causing the loss of about six inches of bone which crippled him for life. The wounded arm is the cause of his visit to this city, where he seeks surgical aid in hope of so far recovering its use that he may be able to dress himself unaided.}}

Despite the use of only one arm, Virgil was hired by the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] to guard its tracks in Colton's famous "[[Colton Crossing|battle of the crossing]]". Virgil joined in the [[frog war]] as the Southern Pacific attempted to stop the [[California Southern Railroad]], a subsidiary of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]], from installing a crossing over the Southern Pacific tracks in Colton to gain access to California. Governor Waterman deputized a posse from [[San Bernardino, California]] and came down in person to enforce construction of the crossing, ending the Southern Pacific's railroad monopoly in Southern California.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;

In 1884 Virgil's father, [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] was elected [[justice of the peace]]. Two years later, Virgil Earp opened a [[private investigator|private detective]] agency, which by all accounts was abandoned in 1886, when he was elected village [[constable#california|constable]] in July.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;

When Colton was incorporated as a city, Virgil was elected as Colton's first City Marshal on July 11, 1887. He was paid $75 a month and was re-elected to another term in 1888. Among other duties, he was reported to have cleared blocked sewers and kept track of the electric light bulbs.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt; Virgil and Allie's Colton home still stands at 528 West "H" Street.

In 1888 Virgil resigned as city marshal and he and Allie left Colton for [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. Five years later, in 1893, he and his wife moved to the short-lived mining town [[Vanderbilt, California]]. He owned and operated the only two story building in town, Earp's Hall, a saloon and meeting hall used for public gatherings and even the town's church services. His business success in Vanderbilt did not match his success in politics, and he lost the election for town constable in 1894.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;

In 1895, Virgil and Allie traveled to Cripple Creek, [[Colorado]], where they met Virgil's brother Wyatt.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt; They stayed briefly and soon moved back to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in [[Yavapai County, Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Arizona, Voter Registrations, 1866-1955 |url=https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/60875/43146_542797-00095 |date=15 Jul 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Virgil became involved in mining. Virgil started mining in the Hassayampa district in partnership with W.H. Harlon. They leased the Grizzly mine owned by W.C. Hanson. The Prescott ''Weekly Journal Miner'' reported on November 8, 1896 that the day before "a serious accident had occurred at this mine. Virgil Earp and W. H. Harlon were working in a tunnel. The ground caved catching Mr. Earp and pinning him to the ground. He was unconscious for several hours and Dr. Abbott, was called to dress his wounds." The doctor told Earp he had dislocated his right hip. Both his feet and ankles were badly crushed, he had a serious cut on his head and bruises all over his body. The doctor said it would be several weeks before Virgil would be able to move around again, but it took him much longer to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Just what is Virgil Earp's connection to Prescott ? {{!}} Prescott Reenactors |url=http://www.prescottreenactors.com/just-what-is-virgil-earps.html |website=www.prescottreenactors.com |accessdate=8 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They moved south after that and began ranching in the [[Kirkland Valley, Arizona|Kirkland Valley]]. Virgil was nominated as a candidate for [[Yavapai County, Arizona]] sheriff in 1900, but pulled out of the election for health reasons.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;

===Reunites with first wife===

In 1898 Virgil received a startling letter from a Mrs. Levi Law. After returning from the Civil War as a young man, his wife Ellen was told by her family that Virgil had been killed. Her family took her and their daughter Nellie to Walla Walla, Washington, where she married Thomas Eaton and had four more children. Mrs. Levi Law was Virgil's daughter, Nellie. The next year, encouraged by his wife, Virgil traveled to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he was reunited with Ellen and Nellie Jane Law.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt; On April 22, 1898, [[The Oregonian]] reported that Virgil "...is now enjoying a very pleasant visit with her and his two grandchildren at her home, which is near that of Mrs. Eaton, in North Portland." He also met three grandchildren he never knew existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Before 1904, Virgil and Allie returned to Colton, where city records show that he along with three others unsuccessfully petitioned the city leaders to repeal a temperance law that only allowed one [[Western saloon|saloon]] in town. In 1904, they left California for the last time and joined Wyatt in the boom town of [[Goldfield, Nevada]], where Virgil became a deputy sheriff for [[Esmeralda County, Nevada]]. But Virgil caught  [[pneumonia]] during a local epidemic and couldn't shake it for six months. He had broken bones from a mine cave-in some years previously and his health was weakened.

In her memoirs, Allie wrote that Virgil's last words were, "Light my cigar, and stay here and hold my hand." He died on October 19, 1905,&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SOODALTER, RON [http://nevadamagazine.com/home/inside-the-magazine/history/the-earps-in-nevada/ Wyatt Earp: Law, Order, and a Game of Chance] March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his brother Wyatt as the last surviving participant of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Virgil was also survived by his father [[Nicholas Porter Earp|Nicholas]], brothers [[James Earp|James]] and [[Newton Earp|Newton]], wife Allie, and daughter Nellie.

At the request of his daughter, Nellie Jane Bohn, Allie sent his remains to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], and he was buried in the [[River View Cemetery (Portland, Oregon)|River View Cemetery]] there.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil/&gt;

'''Vitali Dyomochka''', also known as ''Bondar'', is a Russian mobster and crime boss in the [[Vladivostok]] area. He is notable for writing, directing, producing and starring in a short [[TV series]] called ''[[Spets]]'', which aimed to show viewers the reality of the [[Russian mafia|Russian underworld]].

==Biography==
Although Dyomochka was an A-grade student,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} he was expelled from school and later college.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As the Soviet era drew to a close, he started his criminal career collecting [[protection money]] from local clothing stores as capitalism started to take off.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Vitali was convicted of several crimes including extortion and shooting a rival gangster, and after his release from prison in 1997 became the head of the [[Podstava]] criminal group.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The gang specialized in [[blackmail]]ing money from passing drivers by setting up car accidents.

Dyomochka was also interviewed in the 2010 documentary ''[[Thieves by Law]]''.

==''Spets'' TV show==
Unsatisfied with the way organized crime was depicted in [[film]] and [[television]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Vitali set about creating his own [[TV series]]. Largely financed by his own money, the seven-part series finished production in 2003 and became a huge success, getting close to 100% ratings on a local television station.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The series drew a lot upon Vitali's own experiences, such as when a driver he had attempted to blackmail turned out to be a judge.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
Over the course of the series ten members of his gang were arrested and one was murdered by rivals.

==Early life==

Deschanel lived in Los Angeles, but spent much of her childhood traveling because her father shot films on location; she later said that she "hated all the traveling ...

==Acting career==
===1999–2002: Early acting credits===
Deschanel had a guest appearance on the television series ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'' in 1998 and made her film debut in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s comedy ''[[Mumford (film)|Mumford]]'' (1999), revolving around the neurotic residents in a small town and co-starring [[Hope Davis]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Alfre Woodard]] and [[Mary McDonnell]]. Also in 1999, she appeared (non-singing) in the music video for [[The Offspring]]'s single "[[She's Got Issues]]". Deschanel co-starred in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s semi-autobiographical ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), where she played Anita Miller, the rebellious older sister of a teenage journalist. Despite a modest box office response, the film received critical praise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/almost_famous/ |title=Almost Famous&amp;nbsp;— Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures&amp;nbsp;— Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes&lt;! |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy]]. Deschanel appeared in the independent drama ''[[Manic (2001 film)|Manic]]'' (2001), as the love interest of a troubled teen ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]). The film was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a limited theatrical release. ''[[The New York Times]]'' found Deschanel to be "particularly spontaneous, unaffected and emotionally direct" in her role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E6D8173DF936A15757C0A9659C8B63|title=Movie Review - 'Manic'|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=April 25, 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following early notice, Deschanel took on supporting parts in four feature films released throughout 2002: [[Big Trouble (2002 film)|''Big Trouble'']], ''[[The New Guy]]'', ''[[The Good Girl]]'', and ''[[Abandon (2002 film)|Abandon]]''. In the comedy ''Big Trouble'', with [[Tim Allen]] and [[Rene Russo]], she played the daughter of a devoted and reluctant woman, and in the teen comedy ''The New Guy'', starred as a guitar player in a band. Deschanel portrayed a cynical, plain-spoken young woman working in a [[big-box store]] in the black dramedy ''The Good Girl'', opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]. The psychological thriller ''Abandon'' saw her play the roommate of a woman involved in her boyfriend's disappearance. Deschanel also made a one-episode appearance in ''[[Frasier]]'', as an out-of-control young woman. ''The New York Times'' reported that Deschanel was "one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars",&lt;ref name="nite"/&gt; in 2002, and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable [[typecasting (acting)|type]], due to "her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances" as the protagonist's best friend.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, "A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now."&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;

===2003–2010: Breakthrough===
Deschanel obtained her first leading film role debut in the independent drama ''[[All the Real Girls]]'' (2003) as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old [[virgin]] who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her performance received wide critical acclaim,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and ''Variety'' remarked: "Performances are all credible and naturalistic, but standing out from the rest is Deschanel's work, which evinces an impressively direct connection to her character's emotions. The actress does a wonderful job presenting a young woman who is trying, with varying degrees of success, to give voice to all sorts of things she has never felt or expressed before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/all-the-real-girls-1200543799/|title=All the Real Girls|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=January 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an [[Independent Spirit Award]] nomination for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Best Female Lead: Zooey Deschanel - Actor - All the Real Girls |url=http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results |publisher=Spirit Awards |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212000547/http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results |archivedate=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, Deschanel starred opposite [[Will Ferrell]] in the Christmas comedy ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' as a deadpan department store worker and the love interest of a man raised by Santa's elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schwartz |first=Missy |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1225341,00.html |title=''Talledega Nights'' is a return to the top for Will Ferrell1 &amp;#124; Movies |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers found the film to be a "spirited, good natured family comedy", as part of an overall positive critical response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elf/|title=Elf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and budgeted at US$33 million, ''Elf'' made US$220.4 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=elf.htm|title=Elf (2003) - Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
