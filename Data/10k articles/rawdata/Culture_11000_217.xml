== Plot ==
Marley Corbett is a quickwitted, carefree ad executive living in New Orleans, who embraces her easy going attitude, shuns any major responsibilities, and gains support and strength from a close circle of friends. She also enjoys casual dating and refuses to fall in love. One day, after an appointment, she is told by Dr. Julian Goldstein that she has terminal cancer. He is deeply impressed by the way Marley accepts the news with humour and dignity. While under anesthetic, God appears to Marley in heaven and asks her to make three wishes. She chooses to fly, to win a million dollars (not tax free), and a third that is later revealed.

Marley tells her friends the news, including her parents who separated years earlier and don't speak now. Her mother is persistent and overbearing, and instantly begins to smother Marley by visiting too often and making her meals to keep her strength up. Marley's father is the opposite; distant and reserved, and doesn't seem bothered with reconnecting with Marley with the time she has left. While driving through town one morning, Marley and her friend Sarah decide to take part in a radio call game where the 97th caller wins a prize. They get through and Marley is told she's won flying lessons - her first wish granted. Her other friend Renee is pregnant with her second child.

As the weeks go by, Marley's health starts to deteriorate and she visits Julian more and more. One night, they see each other at a band night at their local bar and decide to spend the rest of the night by going on a date. They start to develop feelings for one another.

Marley tells her boss about the cancer and he asks her about her life insurance plans, since their company has a policy that anybody who has a life-threatening illness can cash out, gaining a million dollars ($500,000 dollars after tax) instantly - her second wish.

After another date, Marley and Julian sleep together and begin a relationship. However, she soon starts to feel dismayed when she comes to the realisation that they won't have a future together, and flees quickly one morning before he wakes. That afternoon, they argue in the park and Marley breaks it off. She becomes distant from and jealous of her friends who are all going through positive changes. After visiting heaven in her dreams for a second time, God makes her realise that she needs to cherish what she has while she's still alive and, for the first time, Marley admits to being in love. Later that day, she visits Julian to rekindle their relationship, apologizes to the friends she has pushed away and even makes peace with her father.

At home over the following weeks, Marley is able to do nothing but lie in bed, and starts focusing on all of the things she is going to miss. She writes cards for special occasions she won't be around for in the future and writes letters to her loved ones, giving them all to her mother for her to give out at the right times.

One morning, Marley and Sarah sit in the park. Marley confesses to Sarah that she is no longer afraid to die, even though Sarah is terrified at the prospect of having to live without her. Marley drifts off and Sarah is unable to wake her. Knowing it's almost time, Marley is visited by everyone in the hospital who surround her bed and wait with her until the end. The exception is Renee, who is in labor with her son. Julian makes it in the nick of time to say goodbye and, in that final moment, Marley realizes her third wish was to fall in love. The film ends with Marley's funeral, a colorful celebration of her life with all of her friends and family.

The '''Academy of Performing Arts''' is a theatre centre and a school of theatre and performance, operating since 2010 in Tel Aviv, in collaboration with the Open University of Israel.

==Faculty==
The Academy of Performing Arts was established in 2010 in Tel Aviv by a group of theatre practitioners, among them Professor [[Avraham Oz]]; Professor Ahuva Belkin; actress Sandra Sadeh; directors and actors [[Moni Moshonov]] and [[Oded Kotler]]; director Amit Gazit; and theatre designer and translator [[Tal Itzhaki]], who functions as the general director of the Academy since its establishment; Roni Pisker, actor, director and puppeteer, lighting designer Professor Ben-Tzion Munitz; and Dr [[Chen Alon]], director of community theatre. This nucleus of founders was later joined by many other members of faculty, among them actress and film director [[Michal Bat-Adam]]; director and musician Shosh Reisman; international opera singer Gabi Sadeh; dancer and choreographer Ran Ben-Dror; directors and mime artists Gnady Babitsky and Ophira Laniado; director Mouneer Bakri; Street theatre and performance creators Avi Gibson-Barel and Yinon Zafrir; playwrights Ala Hlehel, Dr Michael Morris-Reich and Gour Koren; Film directors Yankul Goldwasser and Kehat Finkel; directors and actors Amnon Meskin, Sharon Alexander, [[Muhammad Bakri]], Shalom Shmuelov, Dor Peles, Gita Munte and Tahel Ran; actresses Keren Tsur and Ahuva Keren.
Actor and director [[Juliano Mer-Khamis]], the founder of [[the Freedom Theatre]] at the [[Jenin]] refugee camp, was a member of faculty until his assassination on April 4, 2011. The Academy Theatre commemorates him by the "Annual Juliano Mer-Khamis Production."

==Program of studies==
The Academy's curriculum is not unified, and does not operate according to built-in program. Each student selects her/his personal curriculum, consulted by the faculty, reflecting one's proclivities and abilities. The Academy's program is varied in acting and performance methods and styles, attempting to expose the students to a large variety of approaches to theatre and film performance and become, as much as possible, a multi-styled creators and performers. Thus many of the Academy's classes aim both as training workshops as well as performance targeted, leading to a final project finally performed in front of internal or external audience. 
In addition to the regular curriculum, the Academy operates the Academy Theatre which regularly mounts productions of professional standards, involving professional actors, some of whom are the Academy graduates and others graduates of other schools. The Academy also holds public discussions and lectures on cultural and artistic matters, and the Academy bar hosts musical programs and small scale shows. Assembled from donations from various sources, the Academy has one of the largest theatre and culture library in Tel Aviv, and in 2015 the Gideon Tamir reading corner was inaugurated, for the use of students, faculty and the general public.

==Academic degree==
The Academy of Performing Arts, Tel Aviv is not recognized as a higher education institution conferring degrees, yet it collaborates with the Israeli Open University of which it is an official study centre (no. 698). Each semester, according to demand, several classes of the Open University are given, tutored by the faculty of the Open University. Students who graduated from the Academy of Performing Arts, provided they have completed the full curriculum of the Academy, are entitled to apply for recognition of several credits from the studies towards a bachelor's degree. The recommended regular  curriculum of each of the Academy's six semesters consists of at least 20 weekly hours of the Academy classes, plus optional 2 classes from the studies of the open University, all to be selected from the choice of classes offered that semester. 
In addition to the three years full program of studies, the Academy holds shorter programs designed to enable completion of studies for students who studied partial studies at other recognized schools of drama, while recognizing the classes studied in the former frameworks as parts of them full program. Also, the Academy holds on demand basic preparatory programs for students who would like to be admitted later for full programs of studies, whether in the Academy itself or elsewhere.

==Alpha 13 Festival==

As of summer 2017 the Academy theatre has launched the Alpha 13 annual festival, to be held every year celebrating the end of the summer, including a prize competition of stage performances, house and guest productions, as well as music and film events. The 2017 festival consisted of 5 competition shows (selected by an artistic committee from about 30 applying groups and artists), 4 house productions, 7 guest shows and 4 special events of music and film. Most of these shows and events first opened in the festival, and others had their Tel Aviv debut during the four weeks of the festival. The festival major theme was "languages": a frivolous, festive and undisciplined variety of semantic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic and English), of performance styles, and of artistic genres.

==Theatre productions==
Over the years the repertory of the Academy theatre consisted of a variety of shows, covering various areas of theatre and performance. Some of the most successful shows were ''Split Screen'', a combined intertwined dramatization of short stories by Israeli poet Dalia Rabikowitz and Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]; [[Commedia dell'Arte]] adaptations of [[Carlo Goldoni]]'s ''Military Lover'' and Leon Katz' ''The Three Cuckolds'';  ''Krum''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKqxBsxuc4 (Excerpts)] and ''Heffets'' by [[Hanoch Levin]]; [[Federico García Lorca]]'s ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFbsGCxlYUc (Excerpts)]; [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7wzoZx0pmw (Excerpts)]; [[Sarah Daniels]]' ''Neaptide''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAV1eri-bgw (Excerpts)] ''Woyzeck'' by [[Büchner]]; [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' and ''[[Mountain Language]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mUFhoyC6i0 (Excerpts)]; ''Good'' by C. P. Taylor [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX8VUhowpeY (Who by Fire by Leonard Cohen, Hebrew lyrics by Avraham Oz, musical arrangement by Yuval Messner, from the production of ''Good'' at the Academy Theatre)]; Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUR2FLbMYgU (Jessica's departure, to the lyrics of Serge Reggiani's Ma fille)]; Pam Gems' ''Dusa, Fish, Vy, Stas'' (in Arabic); ''Back River'' by Rachel Shalita; ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' by [[Paul Zindel]], [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s ''[[Beautiful Thing (play)|Beautiful Thing]]'', and many others, as well as "playlects" ("play cum lecture"), such as Avraham Oz and his players performing and discussing love, courtship and marriage in Shakespeare [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMF4K1M0Yc (Oz and players in Shakespeare playlect)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9046">[[File:Alcohol free zone Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Signage for an alcohol-free zone in [[Liverpool]], England]]

An '''alcohol-free zone''' is a geographic area, location or establishment where the public consumption and sale of [[alcoholic beverage]]s is prohibited.&lt;ref name="Barclay 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saggers Gray 1998"/&gt; Alcohol-free zones have been established in some areas to address problems with drinking- and binge drinking-related crime, antisocial behavior, assaults and disorderly behavior.&lt;ref name="Mazerolle Ransley 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Lancer 2015"/&gt; Alcohol-free zones have been opposed in some communities, such as in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, which has "a tradition of open-air bars and restaurants."&lt;ref name="Mazerolle Ransley 2006"/&gt;

==Alcohol-free zones==
===Australia===
In [[New South Wales]], Australia, some streets are designated as alcohol-free zones, which is demarcated with signage stating such.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2010"/&gt; Police may issue a warning to violators, and those who continue to drink can be fined and have their alcoholic beverages seized.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2010"/&gt; Many parks in New South Wales are designated as alcohol-free zones.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2010"/&gt; [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]] in New South Wales, Australia established an alcohol-free zone in the city in 2004 in efforts to reduce assaults and antisocial behavior influenced by street drinking.&lt;ref name="Mazerolle Ransley 2006"/&gt;

As of April 2016, [[Sydney]], Australia has over 60 alcohol-free zones.&lt;ref name="Barclay 2016"/&gt; The City Council of Sydney proposed to eliminate the alcohol-free zones in April 2016.&lt;ref name="Barclay 2016"/&gt;

===Azerbaijan===
Alcohol-free zone networks have been established in areas of Azerbaijan since at least 1996.&lt;ref name="White 1996"/&gt; These zones are located in areas such as cafes, tea shops and recreation centers.&lt;ref name="White 1996"/&gt;

===England===
[[File:Lickey Hills, Valley Farm Road, Rubery - Alcohol Free Zone sign.jpg|thumb|An alcohol-free zone sign at [[Lickey Hills]], [[Rubery]] in Birmingham, England]]

The first alcohol-free zone established in the United Kingdom was in [[Coventry]], England in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bentley 2015"/&gt; Initially, the entire city center was declared to be an alcohol-free zone.&lt;ref name="Bentley 2015"/&gt; The zone was later expanded to include the entire city.&lt;ref name="Bentley 2015"/&gt;

[[Boston, Lincolnshire]] established a street drinking ban in January 2015 to address concerns with the antisocial problems associated with public alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt; The street drinking ban includes the town center and other areas.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt; Under rules of the ban, those caught drinking in these areas can be fined £100 for a first offense.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt; A second offense within six months after having committed a first one can be fined up to £500.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt; Additionally, those that are requested to stop drinking and continue to do so can receive a fine of up to £500.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt; In January 2015 to commemorate the event, various town council members and city police attended an event where cans of beer were poured down a city street drain.&lt;ref name="Target 2015"/&gt;

In 2009, [[Knowsley, Merseyside]] established alcohol-free zones in some of its parks to address problems with binge drinking-related crime and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="Martin Lancer 2015"/&gt; Drinking in licensed [[drinking establishment]]s was not affected by the zones.&lt;ref name="Martin Lancer 2015"/&gt;

[[Liverpool]], England has some alcohol-free zones in areas of the city.&lt;ref name="Wright 2015"/&gt;

===India===
The entire region of [[Attappadi]], [[Kerala]], India was established as an alcohol-free zone in 1996 by Chief Minister AK Antony.&lt;ref name="The News Minute 2016"/&gt; Despite the ban, alcohol has been illegally brought into the region by community residents who travel to [[Annaikatti]] to purchase liquor from [[TASMAC]] stores.&lt;ref name="The News Minute 2016"/&gt;

===United States===
Some parks and recreation areas in the United States are alcohol-free zones, such as in [[Johnson County, Iowa]], where alcohol consumption is allowed in some park and recreation areas but not others.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2016"/&gt; For example, alcoholic beverages may be consumed in some day use areas and campgrounds in parks, but not in beach areas within some parks.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2016"/&gt;

The riverfront at [[Covington, Ohio]] was established as an alcohol-free zone circa 1989 by Covington police.&lt;ref name="Pulfer 1989"/&gt;

In countries outside the [[United States of America]], '''Americanization''' or '''Americanisation''' is the influence American culture and business have on other countries, such as their media, cuisine, business practices, [[popular culture]], technology, or political techniques. The term has been used since at least 1907. While not necessarily a pejorative term, it is most often used by critics in the target country who are against the influences.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Moffett, ''The Americanization of Canada'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EJsOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:americanization&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=1 full text online]; see also Ralph Willett, ''The Americanization of Germany, 1945–1949'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Americanization has become more prevalent since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1989–91, and especially since the advent of widespread [[high speed Internet]] use starting in the mid-2000s.  In Europe, in recent years there is growing concern about Americanization through [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Apple Inc.]], and [[Uber (company)|Uber]], among many other Internet-oriented corporations based in the U.S.  European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star 8 April 2015"&gt;See ["Google under fire in Europe over user privacy concerns" [https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/04/08/google-under-fire-in-europe-over-user-privacy-concerns.html ''Toronto Star '' 8 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' in 2015 reported "deep concerns in Europe’s highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;Tom Fairless, "Europe’s Digital Czar Slams Google, Facebook," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-digital-czar-slams-google-facebook-over-selling-personal-data-1424789664 ''Wall Street Journal'' 24 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the United States, the [[Americanization (immigration)|term Americanization]] refers to the process of [[acculturation]] by immigrants or annexed populations (e.g. the [[Californios]]) to [[Culture of the United States|American customs and values]].  

==Media and popular culture==
Hollywood (the [[American film and television industry]]) since the 1920s has dominated most of the world's media markets. It is the chief medium by which people across the globe see American fashions, customs, scenery and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Hoynes|author2=David Croteau|author3=Stefania Milan|title=Media/Society: Industries, Images, and Audiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2jVgDIaV3QC&amp;pg=PA333|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|page=333|isbn=9781412974202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Pokorny and John Sedgwick|title=Economic History of Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9ExFAmL-3EC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=25|isbn=9781134344307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the United States government plays only a facilitating role in the dissemination of films, television, books, journals and so on. However, during the occupation of former Axis enemies countries after World War II, the government played a major role in restructuring the media in those countries to eliminate totalitarianism and promote democracy, against communism. For example, In Germany, the American occupation headquarters,  Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) in 1945 began its own newspaper based in Munich. ''Die Neue Zeitung'' was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who fled to the United States before the war.  Its mission was to destroy Nazi cultural remnants, and encourage democracy by exposing Germans to how American culture operated. There was great detail on sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica C.E. Gienow-Hecht, "Art is democracy and democracy is art:  Culture, propaganda, and the Neue Zeitung in Germany," ''Diplomatic History'' (1999) 23#1 pp. 21–43&lt;/ref&gt; Americanization would continue to spread out over the [[Iron Curtain]] even before [[the fall of the Soviet Union]] and periodically after.

Copies of American-based [[television show|TV programs]] are re-broadcast around the world, many of them through American broadcasters and their subsidiaries (such as [[HBO Asia]], [[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNN International]]). Many of these distributors broadcast mainly American programming on their TV channels.  In 2006, a survey of 20 countries by ''[[Radio Times]]'' found seven American shows in the ten most-watched: ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm | title=CSI show 'most popular show in the world' | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2006-07-31 | accessdate=2013-10-23 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070902205017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm| archivedate= 2 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American films are also extremely popular around the world (even animated films, most notably those from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]], [[Pixar]], [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]], [[Illumination Entertainment|Illumination]], [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]]), often dominating cinemas as a result of a high demand of US product exported to consumers to clear away the outlook of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=978-0-19-937102-0|location=New York|pages=96–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the top-50 [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing films of all time]], all of them were made entirely or partially in the United States. Often part of the negotiating in [[free trade agreement]]s between the U.S. and other nations involves [[screen quotas]]. One such case is [[Mexico]], which abolished screen quotas following the establishment of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://x.adelantesi.com/news/story.php?ID=387 |title=Dual forces fuel Mexican film industry |publisher=Adelante |accessdate=2007-08-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131415/http://x.adelantesi.com/news/story.php?ID=387 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently South Korea has agreed to reduce its quota under pressure from the U.S. as part of a free trade deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1085923.php/South_Korea_cuts_local_film_quotas_to_meet_US_FTA%A0demand|title = South Korea cuts local film quotas to meet US FTA demand|publisher = M&amp;C|accessdate=2007-08-29}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S.-based artists, such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Michael Jackson]] are recognized worldwide and have sold over 500 million albums each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/faq/faq.asp?qid=8 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Elvis.com |accessdate=2007-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225542/http://www.elvis.com/elvisology/faq/faq.asp?qid=8 |archivedate=26 September 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Jackson's album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', at 100 million sales, is the best-selling album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/16112006/jackos_back|title=Jackos Back|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2007-08-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070916112432/http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/16112006/jackos_back| archivedate= 16 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the study of vocabulary and spelling of English words in books and tweets, American English is more common in communities in European Union compared to British English. This trend is more apparent in the events following World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Gonçalves|first=Bruno|last2=Loureiro-Porto|first2=Lucía|last3=Ramasco|first3=José J.|last4=Sánchez|first4=David|date=2017-07-03|title=The Fall of the Empire: The Americanization of English|eprint=1707.00781|class=cs.CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and brands==

[[Fast food]] is also often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as [[McDonald's]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen DeBres, "A Cultural Geography of McDonald's UK," Journal of Cultural Geography, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burger King]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] and [[Domino's Pizza]] among others have numerous outlets around the world.

Many of the world's biggest computer companies are also U.S.-based, such as [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Intel]], [[HP Inc.]], [[Dell]] and [[IBM]], and much of the software bought worldwide is created by U.S.-based companies. Carayannis and Campbell note that "The USA occupies, also in global terms, a very strong position in the software sector."&lt;ref&gt;Elias G. Carayannis and David F. J. Campbell, ''Mode 3 Knowledge Production in Quadruple Helix Innovation Systems'' (2011) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 observers saw "Americanization" as synonymous with progress and innovation.&lt;ref name="stead1901"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/392/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany in the 1920s, the American [[efficiency movement]] was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Noland (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; "Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as [[public administration]]. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp. 549+&lt;/ref&gt;  Department stores threatened the more local businesses, with low prices and chain-managed stores. The small businesses were determined and fought back to protect their source of income from the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world Transformed: 1945 to the present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York, New York|page=105|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Americanization was the method to counter the processes of Sovietization around the world. Education, schools, and universities in particularly, became the main target for Americanization. However, the resistance to Americanization of the university community restrained it.&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Tsvetkova.

==Visibility==
During the 15 years from 1950 to 1965, American investments in Europe soared by 800% to $13.9 billion, and in the [[European Economic Community]] rose 10 times to $6.25 billion. Europe's share of American investments increased from 15% to 28%. The investments were of very high visibility and generated much talk of Americanization. Even so, American investments in Europe represented only 50% of the total European investment and American-owned companies in the European Economic Community employ only 2 or 3% of the total labor force. The basic reason for the U.S. investments is no longer lower production costs, faster economic growth, or higher profits in Europe, but the desire to maintain a competitive position based largely American technological superiority. Opposition to U.S. investments, originally confined to France, later spread to other European countries. Public opinion began to resent American advertising and business methods, personnel policies, and the use of the English language by American companies. Criticism was also directed toward the international currency system which was blamed for inflationary tendencies as a result of the dominant position of the U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Grosse, "American Investments In Europe," ''Europa-Archiv,'' 1967, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp. 23–32&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1970s European investments in the U.S. increased even more rapidly than vice versa, and Geir Lundestad finds there was less talk of the Americans buying Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geir Lundestad|title=The United States and Western Europe since 1945: from "Empire" by invitation to transatlantic drift|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zv6wUcVwNsUC&amp;pg=PA221|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928397-2|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
Americanization has become more prevalent since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Until the late 1980s, the Communist press could be counted on to be especially critical of the United States. To some extent Russia continued that role under [[Vladimir Putin]] and there are similar tendencies in China. Putin in 2013 published an op-ed{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in ''The New York Times'' attacking the American tendency to see itself as an exceptional, indispensable nation. "It is extremely dangerous", Putin warned, "to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."&lt;ref&gt;
Zachary Karabell, "The Upside of a 'De-Americanized' World: A reduced U.S. role is still a lot more powerful than 100 emerging markets, but it would force even greater internal focus for the U.S." [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/the-upside-of-a-de-americanized-world/280652/ ''The Atlantic''  17 Oct. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new dimension of [[anti-Americanism]] is fear of the pervasiveness of American Internet technology. Americanization has arrived through widespread [[high speed Internet]] and [[smart phone]] technology since 2008, with a large fraction of the new apps and hardware being designed in [[Silicon Valley]]. In Europe, there is growing concern about excess Americanization through [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], the [[iPhone]] and [[Uber (company)|Uber]], among many other American Internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern about privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants. There is a fear that they are significantly evading taxes, and posting information that may violate European privacy laws.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star 8 April 2015"/&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' in 2015 reported "deep concerns in Europe's highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

==Historiography==
Berghahn (2010) analyzes the debate on the usefulness of the concepts of 'Americanization' and 'Westernization'. He reviews the recent research on the European–American relationship during the Cold War that has dealt with the cultural impact of the United States upon Europe. He then discusses the relevant work on this subject in the fields of economic and business history. Overall, the article tries to bring out that those who have applied the concept of 'Americanization' to their research on cultural or economic history have been well aware of the complexities of trans-Atlantic relations in this period, whether they were viewed as a two-way exchange or as a process of circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Volker R. Berghahn, "The debate on 'Americanization'  among economic and cultural historians," ''Cold War History'', Feb 2010, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp. 107–30

'''Apergy''' is a fictitious form of [[anti-gravity|anti-gravitational]] energy first described by [[Percy Greg]] in his 1880 [[sword and planet]] novel ''[[Across the Zodiac]]''.

It is also used by [[John Jacob Astor IV]] in his 1894 science fiction novel, ''[[A Journey in Other Worlds]]''.

Apergy can also be found in an 1896 article by [[Clara Jessup Moore|Clara Jessup Bloomfield-Moore]], called "Some Truths About Keely".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=t7POAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA321 ''The New Science Review'' vol. 2, num. 3, Jan. 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, apergy is used to describe the [[:wikt:latent|latent]] force [[John Keely]] harnessed, by using frequency to release the latent force found within all atomic [[matter]].

In an 1897, ostensibly non-fictitious, article in [[San Francisco Call|''The San Francisco Call'']] titled "The Secret of Aerial Flight Revealed",&lt;ref&gt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1897-01-17/ed-1/seq-20/ ''The San Francisco Call'', January 17, 1897, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; science correspondent [[Frank M. Close]], D. Sc., visits an unnamed Hindu man masquerading as a [[viticulturist]] somewhere on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] who claims to have invented a flying boat that uses an "apergent" -- a rare metal called "radlum" -- to produce controlled apergic force, allowing the vessel to ascend and descend. The inventor describes apergy as "a force obtained by blending positive and negative electricity with ultheic, the third element or state of electric energy" and calls apergy a "second phase of gravity", hinting at a third phase as well.

In [[S. P. Meek]]'s short story "Cold Light", which appeared in ''Astounding Stories of Super-Science'', March 1930,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29607/29607-h/29607-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt; apergy is mentioned as the opposite force of gravity.

In [[Chris Roberson (author)|Chris Roberson]]'s short story "Annus Mirabilis" from the 2006 second volume of ''[[Tales of the Shadowmen]]'', [[Doctor Omega]] and [[Albert Einstein]] investigate apergy. Apergy is also mentioned in the [[Warren Ellis]] comic ''[[Aetheric Mechanics]]'', as being generated by [[Cavorite]] technology from ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6869">The '''Beta Phi Mu Award''' is an annual award  to a library school faculty member or to an individual for distinguished service to education for librarianship. The first award was made in 1954 to [[Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness]], Dean of the University of Michigan's Library Science Department from 1940 to 1964. The Award  is sponsored by the International Honorary Society, [[Beta Phi Mu]]. Prominent Leaders in the field of Librarianship include those who were  selected for the Beta Phi Mu Award.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Bobinski (2007) ''Libraries and Librarianship: Sixty Years of Chaallenge and Change, 1945-2005'', pp. 129-146.  Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;
Beta Phi Mu  (ΒΦΜ or βφμ) was founded in 1948 by a group of leading librarians and library educators to recognize and encourage scholastic achievement among library and information studies students. The motto, "Aliis inserviendo consumor," meaning “Consumed in the service of others” was selected by the founders based on the concept of dedication of librarians and other information professionals to the service of others. Eligibility for membership in Beta Phi Mu is by invitation of the faculty from an American Library Association accredited professional degree program.

'''Birch bark manuscripts''' are documents written on pieces of the inner layer of [[birch bark]], which was commonly used for writing before the advent of mass production of [[paper]]. Evidence of birch bark for writing goes back many centuries and in various cultures.

The oldest dated birch bark manuscripts are numerous [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]] from approximately the 1st century CE, believed to have originated in Afghanistan, likely by the [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect. Translations of the texts, mostly in [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]], have produced the earliest known versions of significant Buddhist scriptures, including a ''[[Dhammapada]]'', discourses of Buddha that include the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra]]'',  [[Avadana]]s and [[Abhidharma]] texts. Sanskrit birch bark manuscripts written with [[Brahmi script]] have been dated to the first few centuries CE. Several early Sanskrit writers, such as [[Kālidāsa]] (c. 4th century CE), [[Sushruta]] (c. 3rd century CE), and [[Varāhamihira]] (6th century CE) mention the use of birch bark for manuscripts. The bark of ''[[Betula utilis]]'' (Himalayan Birch) is still used today in India and [[Nepal]] for writing sacred mantras.

Russian texts discovered in [[Veliky Novgorod]] have been dated to approximately the 9th to 15th century CE. Most of those documents are letters written by various people in the [[Old Novgorod dialect]].

The Irish language's native writing system [[Ogham]], sometimes called the "tree alphabet", was legendarily invented by [[Ogma]] who wrote a proscription on birch to Lugh, warning him; the text of this proscription can be found in the [[Book of Ballymote]]. The first letter of Ogham is ''beith''; ''beithe'' means "birch".

[[File:Fragmentary_Buddhist_text_-_Gandhara_birchbark_scrolls_(1st_C),_part_31_-_BL_Or._14915.jpg|left|thumb|Gandhara birchbark scroll fragments (c. 1st century)]]
Buddhist manuscripts written in the [[Gāndhārī language]] are likely the oldest extant Indic texts, dating to approximately the 1st century CE. The birch bark texts were stored in clay jars and acquired by the [[British Library]] in 1994. They were written in Kharoṣṭhī and believed to be originally from [[Afghanistan]] due to similar birch bark manuscripts that were discovered in eastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="AOS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=April 1, 1997|title=A preliminary survey of some early Buddhist manuscripts recently acquired by the British Library|journal=[[The Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|publisher=American Oriental Society|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19728985.html#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, a similar collection of Gāndhārī texts from the same era, called the Senior collection, has also surfaced.&lt;ref name="SalomonGlass2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Salomon|author2=Andrew Glass|title=A Gāndhārī Version of the Rhinoceros Sūtra: British Library Kharoṣṭhī Fragment 5B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTmN8Xs9xBkC&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=15 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98035-5|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Library birch bark manuscripts were in the form of scrolls, which were very fragile and already damaged. They were five to nine inches wide, and consisted of twelve to eighteen inch long overlapping rolls that had been glued together to form longer scrolls. A thread sewn through the edges also helped hold them together. The script was written in black ink. The manuscripts were written on both sides of the scrolls, beginning at the top on one side, continuing with the scroll turned over and upside down, so that the text concluded at the top and back of the scroll. The longest intact scroll from the British Library collection is eighty-four inches long.&lt;ref name="AOS" /&gt;

The texts were likely compiled by the Dharmaguptaka sect and probably "represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in Nagarāhāra", according to leading scholar Richard Salomon.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Salomon. ''Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhāra: The British Library Kharosthī Fragments'', with contributions by Raymond Allchin and Mark Barnard. Seattle: University of Washington Press; London: The British Library, 1999. pg 181&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes a variety of known commentaries and sutras, including a ''Dhammapada'', discourses of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] that include the ''Rhinoceros Sutra'', [[avadāna]]s, and abhidharma texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=Richard|title=Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhāra|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|year=1999|isbn=0-295-97769-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition of the scrolls indicates that they were already in poor condition and fragments by the time they were stored in the clay jars. Scholars concluded that the fragmented scrolls were given a ritual interment, much like Jewish texts stored in a [[genizah]].&lt;ref name="AOS" /&gt;

The bark of ''[[Betula utilis]]'' (Himalayan Birch) has been used for centuries in India for writing scriptures and texts in various scripts. Its use was especially prevalent in historical [[Kashmir]]. Use of bark as paper has been mentioned by early Sanskrit writers such as [[Kalidasa]] (c. 4th century CE), [[Sushruta]] (c. 3rd century CE), and [[Varahamihira]] (6th century CE). In Kashmir, early scholars recounted that all of their books were written on Himalayan birch bark until the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book |author=Müller, Friedrich Max |title=Selected essays on language, mythology and religion, Volume 2 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |location= |year=1881 |pages=335–336fn  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment of a birch bark scroll in Sanskrit, in the [[Brāhmī script]], was part of the British Library Gandhara scroll collection. It is presumed to be from North India, dating to sometime during the first few centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Olivelle2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Between the Empires: Society in India 300 Bce to 400 Ce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530532-6|pages=356–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birch bark manuscripts in Brāhmī script were discovered in an ancient Buddhist monastery in [[Jaulian]], near [[Taxila]] in the Punjab in Pakistan, and dated to the 5th century CE.&lt;ref name="Behrendt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt A.

The [[Bakhshali manuscript]] consists of seventy birch bark fragments written in Sanskrit and Prakrit, in the [[Śāradā script]]. Based on the language and content, it is estimated to be from the 2nd to 3rd century CE. The text discusses various mathematical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Companion and Commentary |author1=John Newsome Crossley |author2=Anthony Wah-Cheung Lun |author3=Kangshen Shen |author4=Shen Kangsheng |year= 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiTJHRGTG6YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA29&amp;lpg=RA1-PA29&amp;dq=%22Bakhshali+Manuscript%22|isbn=0-19-853936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodleian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treasures.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/The-Bakhshali-Manuscript|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005013320/http://treasures.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/The-Bakhshali-Manuscript|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 October 2011|title=The Bakhshali Manuscript|work=Treasures of the Bodleian|publisher=University of Oxford Bodleian Library|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large collection of birch bark scrolls were discovered in Afghanistan during the civil war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, possibly in the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan Caves]]. The approximately 3,000 scroll fragments are in Sanskrit or Buddhist Sanskrit, in the Brāhmī script, and date to a period from the 2nd to 8th century CE.&lt;ref name="Olivelle2006" /&gt;

The [[Bower Manuscript]] is one of the oldest Sanskrit texts on birch bark in the Brāhmī script. It includes several texts covering subjects including a medical treatise and proverbs. It was discovered in [[Kucha]] (currently in [[Aksu Prefecture]] in [[Xinjiang]], China), an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the northern [[Silk Road]], and is estimated to be from around 450 CE.&lt;ref name="Diringer1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Diringer|title=The Book Before Printing: Ancient, Medieval, and Oriental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NVKLKY4jIcC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=16 July 2012|year=1953|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-24243-9|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gilgit#Gilgit manuscripts|Gilgit Manuscripts]] were Buddhist texts discovered in the Gilgit area of Pakistan in 1931 and include various sutras, including the [[Lotus Sutra]], along with folk tales, medicine, and philosophy. They are dated to approximately the 5th to 6th centuries AD, and were written in Buddhist Sanskrit in the [[Śāradā script]].&lt;ref name="Marwah"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gyan Marwah|work=The South Asian Magazine|title=Gilgit Manuscript&amp;nbsp;— Piecing Together Fragments of History|url=http://www.the-south-asian.com/Aug2004/Gilgit_manuscript.htm|location=Haryana, India|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|title=Gilgit Manuscript|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22448&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922013344/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22448&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-09-22|work=Memory of the World Register|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17935041|title=India: Rare Buddhist manuscript Lotus Sutra released|date=05-03-2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts containing the Devīkavaca text, a hymn praising the goddess [[Durga]], were thought to protect the person who carries them from evil influences like an amulet or charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Devīkavaca|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01578|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one of these texts in [[Devanagari]] script from [[Nepal]] is held at [[Cambridge University Library]] (MS Add. 1578).

==East Slavic texts==

On July 26, 1951, during excavations in [[Novgorod]], a Soviet expedition led by [[Artemiy Artsikhovsky]] found the first Russian birch bark writing in a layer dated to c. 1400. Since then, more than 1,000 similar documents were discovered in [[Staraya Russa]], [[Smolensk]], [[Torzhok]], [[Pskov]], [[Tver]], [[Moscow]], [[Ryazan]], and [[Vologda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vologdaregion.ru/news/2015/7/21/v-vologde-vpervye-v-istorii-goroda-naydena-berestyanaya-gramota|script-title=ru:В Вологде впервые в истории города найдена берестяная грамота|date=21 July 2015|publisher=Vologda-Region|language=Russian|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Novgorod remains by far the most prolific source of them. In Ukraine, birch bark documents were found in [[Zvenyhorod]], [[Volynia]]. In [[Belarus]], several documents were unearthed in [[Vitebsk]] and [[Mstislavl]].

[[Image:beresta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Birch-bark letter no.&amp;nbsp;497, c.&amp;nbsp;1340-90, [[Veliky Novgorod]]; photograph]]
The late discovery of birch documents, as well as their amazing state of preservation, is explained by a deep culture layer in Novgorod (up to eight meters, or 25 feet) and heavy waterlogged [[clay]] soil which prevents the access of [[oxygen]]. Serious excavations in Novgorod started only in 1932, although some attempts had been made in the 19th century.

Although their existence was mentioned in some old East Slavic [[manuscript]]s, the discovery of birch bark documents ({{lang-ru|берестяна́я гра́мота}}, ''berestyanáya grámota'', and also ''grámota'' in those documents) significantly changed the understanding of the cultural level and language spoken by the [[East Slavs]] between the 11th and 15th centuries. About a hundred [[stylus]]es have also been found, mostly made of [[iron]], some of [[bone]] or [[bronze]].

According to [[Valentin Yanin]] and [[Andrey Zaliznyak]], most documents are ordinary letters by various people written in what is considered to be [[Old Novgorod dialect|a vernacular dialect]]. The letters are of a personal or business character. A few documents include elaborate obscenities. Very few documents are written in [[Old Church Slavonic]] and only one in [[Old Norse]]. The school exercises and drawings by a young boy named [[Onfim]] have drawn much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erikkwakkel.tumblr.com/post/67681966023/medieval-kids-doodles-on-birch-bark-heres|title=Medieval kids’ doodles on birch bark|last=Kwakkel|first=Erik|date=November 2013|work=[[Tumblr]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Schaeken|first=Jos|title=Stemmen Op Berkenbast: Berichten Uit Middeleeuws Rusland: Dagelijks Leven en Communicatie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSjrvm_c57kC&amp;pg=RA1-PA103|year=2012|publisher=Amsterdam UP|pages=101–105|isbn=9789087281618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* [[Valentin Yanin|Yanin, Valentin L.]] (Feb 1990).

Covers, ''History, "Kremlin of Novgorod", "Novgorod Museum of History", preservation dynamics, and the production of 'Birch bark documents'.'' This article contains examples of birch bark documents, styluses, and photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;

The document numbered 292 from the Novgorod excavations (unearthed in 1957) is the oldest known document in any [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language. It is dated to the beginning of the 13th century. The language used in the document is thought to be an archaic form of the language spoken in [[Olonets Karelia]], a dialect of the [[Karelian language]]. For details and full text, see [[Birch bark letter no. 292]].

Translation (with explanations in square brackets):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here, Yakov has settled with Gyurgi and with [[Chariton (name)|Khareton]] by courtless deed Gyurgi has gotten [at court] concerning trampled [by horses] wheat and Khariton concerning his loss. Gyurgi got one [[ruble]], three [[grivna]]s, and a basket of wheat for all that, and Khariton got ten [[cubit]]s of cloth and one grivna. And Gyurgiy and Khariton have no more concern to Yakov, nor Yakov to Gyurgiy and Khariton. And arrangers and perceivers to that are Davyd, son of Luka, and Stepan Taishen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Soviet Union==
There are birch bark letters written in modern times, most notably by victims of the Soviet repressions. People in [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlements]] and [[GULAG]] camps in Siberia used strips of birch bark to write letters to their loved ones back home, due to  inaccessibility of paper. Examples of these letters from Latvian victims of the Soviet regime are currently being considered to be included in the UNESCO "Memory of the World" heritage list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmina.unesco.lv/page/78 In Siberia Written Letters on Birch Bark]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], propaganda newspapers and leaflets published by guerilla fighters were sometimes printed on birch bark due to shortage of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.milportal.ru/2014/04/partizanskaya-pechat-orlovskoj-oblasti-v-gody-vojny/ Guerilla press of the Oryol Region during the years of war]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rg.ru/2003/10/07/vystavka.html From a reporters exhibit to a museum of press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in [[Christendom]] and [[Western world|Western society]].

Many other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of [[Christmas carol]]s, the illumination and enjoyment of [[Christmas light]]s, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Christkind]], and [[Saint Nicholas]] are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe,&lt;ref&gt; Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–79.&lt;/ref&gt; such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of [[Saint Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' feast day]] (6 December).

== Religious traditions ==

=== Western churches ===

[[File:Midnight Mass 2010 - 66 (5292245955).jpg|thumb|left|[[Midnight Mass]] is held in many churches toward the end of Christmas Eve, often with dim lighting and traditional decorative accents such as greenery]]

[[Roman Catholic]]s and high church [[Anglican]]s traditionally celebrate [[Midnight Mass]], which begins either at or sometime before [[midnight]] on Christmas Eve.  This ceremony, which is held in churches throughout the world, celebrates the birth of Christ, which is believed to have occurred at night. Midnight Mass is popular in Poland ([[pasterka]]).

In recent years some churches have scheduled their "Midnight" Mass as early as 7&amp;nbsp;pm.  In Spanish-speaking areas, the Midnight Mass is sometimes referred to as ''[[Misa de Gallo]]'', or ''Missa do Galo'' in Portuguese ("Rooster's Mass"). In the [[Philippines]], the custom has expanded into the nine-day ''[[Simbang Gabi]]'', when Filipinos attend dawn Masses (traditionally beginning around 04:00 to 05:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]) from 16 December, continuing daily until Christmas Eve. In 2009 [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10&amp;nbsp;pm so that the 82-year-old [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would not have too late a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430118.stm |title=Woman knocks Pope down at Christmas Mass|date=25 December 2009|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst it does not include any kind of Mass, the [[Church of Scotland]] has a service beginning just before midnight, in which [[Christmas carol|carols]] are sung. The Church of Scotland no longer holds [[Hogmanay]] services on New Year's Eve, however. The Christmas Eve Services are still very popular.
On Christmas Eve, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s. In candlelight services, while singing ''[[Silent Night]]'', each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle.

[[Lutheran]]s traditionally practice Christmas Eve [[Eucharist]]ic traditions typical of Germany and Scandinavia. "Krippenspiele" ([[Nativity play]]s), special festive music for organ, vocal and brass [[choir]]s and candlelight services make Christmas Eve one of the highlights in the Lutheran Church calendar. A nativity scene may be erected indoors or outdoors, and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Vermes, Geza. ''The Nativity: History and Legend''. Penguin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other figures in the scene may include [[angel]]s, [[shepherd]]s, and various animals. The figures may be made of any material,&lt;ref name="Dues"&gt;Dues, Greg.''Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide'' Twenty-Third Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and arranged in a stable or grotto. The [[Magi]] may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem.  While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]].&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt;

Christmas [[Vespers]] are popular in the early evening, and midnight services are also widespread in regions which are predominantly Lutheran. The old Lutheran tradition of a Christmas Vigil in the early morning hours of [[Christmas Day]] (Christmette) can still be found in some regions. In eastern and [[middle Germany]], congregations still continue the tradition of "[[Quempas]] singing": separate groups dispersed in various parts of the church sing verses of the song "He whom shepherds once came Praising" (''Quem pastores laudavere'') responsively.
[[File:Krippe Gutenzell.jpg|thumb|left|A nativity scene]]
[[Methodism|Methodists]] celebrate the evening in different ways. Some, in the early evening, come to their church to celebrate [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] with their families. The mood is very solemn, and the only visible light is the [[Advent Wreath]], and the candles upon the [[Lord's Table]]. Others celebrate the evening with services of light, which include singing the song ''Silent Night'' as a variety of candles (including personal candles) are lit. Other churches have late evening services perhaps at 11&amp;nbsp;pm, so that the church can celebrate Christmas Day together with the ringing of bells at midnight. Others offer Christmas Day services as well.

The annual "[[Nine Lessons and Carols]]", broadcast from [[King's College, Cambridge]] on Christmas Eve, has established itself a Christmas custom in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;{{citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is broadcast outside the UK via the [[BBC World Service]], and is also bought by broadcasters around the world.&lt;ref name=nine/&gt;

{{unref|section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:2013-12-24--Artoklasia during Christmas Eve service.JPG|thumbnail|Annunciation of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]

In the [[Byzantine Rite]], Christmas Eve is referred to as '''Paramony''' ("preparation").  It is the concluding day of the [[Nativity Fast]] and is observed as a day of strict [[fasting]] by those devout Byzantine Christians who are physically capable of doing so. In some traditions, nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky, in commemoration of the [[Star of Bethlehem]]. The [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the [[Royal Hours]], followed by the [[Divine Liturgy]] combined with the celebration of [[Vespers]], during which a large number of passages from the [[Old Testament]] are chanted, recounting the history of salvation. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at the end of the service, a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit, and all gather round and sing the [[Troparion]] and [[Kontakion]] of the Feast.

In the evening, the [[All-Night Vigil]] for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of [[Great Compline]], [[Matins]] and the [[First Hour]]. The Byzantine services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of [[Good Friday]], illustrating the [[Orthodox theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. This is illustrated in Eastern [[icon]]s of the Nativity, on which the [[Christ Child]] is wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his [[burial shroud|burial wrappings]]. The child is also shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The [[Church of the Nativity|Cave of the Nativity]] is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.

The services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)#Eastern Christian Churches|Theophany]] (Epiphany), and the two [[Great Feasts]] are considered one celebration.

In some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] cultures, after the Vesperal Liturgy the family returns home to a festive meal, but one at which [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|Orthodox fasting rules]] are still observed: no meat or dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.) are consumed (see below for variations according to nationality). Then they return to the church for the All-Night Vigil.

The next morning, Christmas Day, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated again, but with special features that occur only on Great Feasts of the Lord. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of this Liturgy, the faithful customarily greet each other with the [[kiss of peace]] and the words: "Christ is Born!", to which the one being greeted responds: "Glorify Him!" (these are the opening words of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of the Nativity that was chanted the night before during the Vigil). This greeting, together with many of the [[hymn]]s of the feast, continue to be used until the [[leave-taking]] of the feast on 29 December.

The first three days of the feast are particularly solemn. The second day is known as the [[Synaxis]] of the [[Theotokos]], and commemorates the role of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Nativity of Jesus]]. The third day is referred to simply as "the Third Day of the Nativity". The Saturday and Sunday following 25 December have special [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings assigned to them. 29 December celebrates the [[Holy Innocents]].

Byzantine Christians observe a festal period of [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]], during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the rest of the year. During this time one feast leads into another: 25–31 December is the [[afterfeast]] of the Nativity; 2–5 January is the [[forefeast]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

=== Meals ===
{{Further information|List of Christmas dishes}}

==== Bulgaria ====

In Bulgaria, the meal consists of an [[odd number]] of lenten dishes in compliance with the rules of fasting. They are usually the traditional [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[bob chorba]] (bean soup), fortune [[korovai|kravai]] (pastry with a fortune in it; also called ''bogovitsa'', ''vechernik'', ''kolednik''), [[stuffed peppers]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], dried fruit, boiled wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover-bulgaria.com/Travel_Results.aspx?CategoryID=450 Bulgarian Main Courses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104151340/http://www.discover-bulgaria.com/Travel_Results.aspx?CategoryID=450 |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meal is often accompanied with wine or Bulgaria's traditional [[alcoholic beverage]] [[rakia]], in the past - ''olovina'' (a type of homemade rye beer). The meals used to be put on top of hay, directly on the floor, together with a [[ploughshare]] or a [[coulter (agriculture)|coulter]].&lt;ref&gt;Христо Вакарелски. Етнография на България. Наука и изкуство. София 1977. с. 500&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====

In French-speaking places, [[Réveillon]] is a long dinner eaten on Christmas Eve.

==== Italy ====

While other Christian families throughout the world celebrate the Christmas Eve meal with various meats, Italians (especially Sicilians) celebrate the traditional [[Catholic]] "[[Feast of the Seven Fishes]]" which was historically served after a 24-hour fasting period. Although Christmas fasting is no longer a popular custom, some [[Italian-Americans]] still enjoy a meatless Christmas Eve feast&lt;ref name="RachaelRay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rachaelray.com/2007/11/feast-of-seven-fishes-a-sicilian-christmas-eve-tradition |title=Feast of Seven Fishes – A Sicilian Christmas Eve Tradition |publisher=Rachael Ray Digital LLC |year=2014 |accessdate=14 November 2014|quote=Sicilians traditionally celebrate Christmas Eve with a "Feast of Seven Fishes" which was historically served after a 24-hour fasting period. Although pre-Christmas fasting is not a popular custom still practiced by Italian-Americans, many still enjoy a meatless Christmas Eve feast.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attend the Midnight Mass. In various cultures, a festive dinner is traditionally served for the family and close friends in attendance, when the first star (usually [[Sirius]]) arrives on the sky.

==== Poland ====

[[File:Wigilia potrawy 554.jpg|thumb|Traditional Polish ''[[Wigilia]]'' meal]]
A similar tradition (''[[Wigilia]]'', or 'Christmas Vigil') exists in Poland. The number of dishes used to be traditionally an odd number (usually 5, 7, 9, or 11.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kasprzyk|first1=Magdalena|title=The 12 Dishes of Polish Christmas|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/the-12-dishes-of-polish-christmas|website=Culture.pl|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Słownik etymologiczny języka polskiego]] (Etymological Dictionary of the Polish Language) by [[Aleksander Brückner]], the number of dishes was traditionally related to social class: the peasants' vigil consisted of 5 or 7 dishes, the gentry usually had 9, and the aristocracy, 11 dishes, but the even number 12 is also found today to remember the 12 disciples. It is obligatory to try a portion of all of them. Some traditions specify that the number of guests cannot be odd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/66/768/Artykul/283212,12-11-9-Ile-dan-na-Wigilie |title=12, 11, 9?

In Poland, gifts are unwrapped on the Christmas Eve, as opposed to the Christmas Day.

==== Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania ====

In Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania, a traditional meatless [[12-dishes Christmas Eve Supper]] is served on Christmas Eve before opening gifts. This is known as the "Holy Meal" ([[Kūčios]] in Lithuania). The table is spread with a white cloth symbolic of the [[swaddling clothes]] the [[Child Jesus]] was wrapped in, and a large white candle stands in the center of the table symbolizing [[Light of the World (Jesus)|Christ the Light of the World]]. Next to it is a round loaf of bread symbolizing Christ [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Bread of Life|Bread of Life]]. [[Hay]] is often displayed either on the table or as a decoration in the room, reminiscent of the [[manger]] in Bethlehem. The twelve dishes (which differ by nationality or region) symbolize the [[Twelve Apostles]].

The Holy Meal was a common Eastern Orthodox tradition in the [[Russian Empire]], but during the era of the Soviet Union it was greatly discouraged as a result of the official [[atheism]] of the former regime. It is coming back in Russia and continues to be popular in Ukraine.

The main attributes of Holy Meal in Ukraine are [[kutia]], a poppy seed, honey and wheat dish, and uzvar, a drink made from reconstituted dried fruits. Other typical dishes are [[borscht]], [[Varenyky]], and dishes made of [[fish]], [[phaseolus]] and [[cabbage]].

==== Serbia ====

[[File:Candle lighting a plate of oranges and smarties 1.JPG|thumb|Candles on Christmas Eve 2010]]
In accordance with the [[Serbian Christmas traditions|Christmas traditions of the Serbs]], their festive meal has a copious and diverse selection of foods, although it is prepared according to the rules of fasting.

As well as a round, [[Leavening agent|unleavened]] loaf of bread and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, [[sauerkraut]], noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine.

Families in some Slavic countries leave an empty place at the table for guests (alluding to Mary and Joseph looking for shelter in Bethlehem).

== Gift giving ==

[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas presents under the Christmas tree]]

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from 6 December to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the night when [[Santa Claus]] makes his rounds delivering gifts to good children. Many trace the custom of giving gifts to the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] who brought gifts for the [[Christ child]] in the [[manger]].

In the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Hungary, where [[Saint Nicholas]] (sv. Mikuláš/szent Mikulás) gives his sweet gifts on 6 December, the Christmas gift-giver is the [[Christkind|Child Jesus]] ([[Ježíšek]] in [[Czech language|Czech]], Jézuska in Hungarian, Ježiško in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and Isusek in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Christmas encyclopedia McFarland'' p.143. &amp; Co., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Switzerland, presents are traditionally exchanged on the evening of 24 December. Children are commonly told that presents were brought either by the [[Christkind]] (German for Christ child),&lt;ref&gt;''The Christmas Almanack'' p.56. Random House Reference, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or by the [[Weihnachtsmann]]. Both leave the gifts, but are in most families not seen doing so. In Germany, the gifts are also brought on 6 December by "the [[Saint Nicholas|Nikolaus]]" with his helper [[Knecht Ruprecht]].

[[File:Gezin bij de kerstboom c1860.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree with presents hanging on the tree]]

In other Latin American countries, people stay awake until [[midnight]], when they open the presents.

== Christmas Eve around the world ==

[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Christmas Eve Candlelight Services.jpg|thumb|right|A Christmas Eve candlelight [[service of worship|service]] in [[Baghdad]], Iraq]]
Christmas Eve is celebrated in different ways around the world, varying by country and region. Elements common to many areas of the world include the attendance of special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers, and the giving and receiving of presents. Along with Easter, Christmastime is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, St. Nicholas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's, and the Feast of the Epiphany.

=== Celebrations ===

Among Christians, as well as non-Christians who celebrate Christmas, the significant amount of vacation travel, and travel back to family homes, that takes place in the lead-up to Christmas means that Christmas Eve is also frequently a time of social events and parties, worldwide.&lt;ref name="Fodor"&gt;Eugene Fodor, ''Fodor's South 1980: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana'', 1979, at p. 87, available at [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=sL54AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;q=christmas-eve#search_anchor Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discourse"&gt;Gary Sigley, ''A Chinese Christmas Story'', in Shi-xu, ed., ''Discourse as Cultural Struggle'', 2007, at p. 99, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=PS57ocrF5dMC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas-eve%20nightclubs&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;Adebayo Oyebade, ''Culture and Customs of Angola'', 2007, at pp. 103, 140, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=DeVqVy21g9sC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas-eve&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonic"&gt;[http://www.clubzone.com/events/Vancouver/165256/Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas-at-Tonic See, e.g., GetQd ''Twas the Night Before Christmas @ Tonic @ Tonic Nightclub Vancouver BC'', 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106084454/http://www.clubzone.com/events/Vancouver/165256/Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas-at-Tonic |date=6 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;[http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4699254/OH/Akron/The-College-Night-Out/The-Interbelt See, e.g., Upcoming.org, ''The College Night Out'', 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318083547/http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4699254/OH/Akron/The-College-Night-Out/The-Interbelt |date=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of historical events have been influenced by the occurrence of Christmas Eve.

=== Christmas truce ===
{{Main article|Christmas truce}}

During [[World War I]] in 1914 and 1915 there was an unofficial [[Christmas truce]], particularly between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[German Empire|German]] troops. The truce began on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1914, when [[German Army (German Empire)|German troops]] began decorating the area around their [[trench warfare|trenches]] in the region of [[Ypres]], Belgium, for Christmas. They began by placing candles on trees, then continued the celebration by singing [[Christmas carol]]s, most notably ''[[Silent Night (song)|Stille Nacht]]'' ("Silent Night"). The [[British Army|British troops]] in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon there were calls for visits across the "[[No man's land]]" when small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing space during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man's Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from [[Psalm 23]]. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by [[Pope Benedict XV]] for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.

On 24 December 1968, in what was the most watched television broadcast to that date, the [[astronaut]]s [[William Anders|Bill Anders]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Frank Borman]] of [[Apollo 8]] surprised the world with a reading of the Creation from the [[Book of Genesis]] as they orbited the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html|title=The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast|publisher=NASA National Space Science Data Center|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=12 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419065805/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html| archivedate= 19 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], an [[atheist]] activist, filed a lawsuit under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name = "aldrin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|pages=204, 623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial court dismissed the lawsuit, which was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Hair v.

In 1969, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp ([[Scott number|Scott#]] 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the moon. The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph, ''[[Earthrise]]'', of the Earth "rising" over the moon (NASA image AS8-14-2383HR), taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, "In the beginning God..."

&lt;ref&gt;* Staff - ''Fall 2007 Trade Paperbacks: Performing Arts &amp; Film'' (Publisher's Weekly, August 8th, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Staff - ''Cinema of Obsession: Erotic Fixation and Love Gone Wrong in the Movies'' (Midwest Book Review, January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Mary Ann Gwinn -  ''Pick up a Good Book'' (Seattle Times Newspaper, Dec. 2nd, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;'''''Cinema of Obsession: Erotic Fixation and Love Gone Wrong in the Movies''''' by [[Dominique Mainon]] and [[James Ursini]] is a non-fiction book documenting the history of obsessive love, amour fou and erotic fixation in cinema.

It begins with an overview of "mad love" in literature and myth, then moves quickly into an in-depth overview of the theme in modern cinema. From its origins in the myths of [[Ovid]] such as Pygmalion-Galatea, Psyche and Cupid, and [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] to medieval tales of tragic love triangles like that of Arthur-Guenivere-Lancelot and Mark-Isolde-Tristan and on to the Romantic tales of the Brontes and twentieth-century works of writers of erotica like Lawrence and [[Anaïs Nin]], this theme has become emblematic in cinema today.

The book features seminal works in obsession themes like Buñuel's ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'', Dietrich's ''[[The Blue Angel]]'', ''[[Peter Ibbetson]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', Renoir's ''[[La Bête Humaine (film)|La Bête Humaine]]'', and ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'', which set the groundwork for films to follow. It also defines and examples of the explosive nature of [[obsessive love]] with adaptations of legendary films such as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[Bette Blue]]'', ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'', and the more recent films of Wong Kar Wai and Almodovar.

==Theme==
The book's theme encompasses issues of attempted male control over the object of his obsession, which is  highlighted in films like Franju's ''[[Eyes without a Face]]'', Hitchcock's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', Visconti's ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'', Fellini's ''[[The Temptation of Doctor Anthony]]''. Male masochism, a key element in many of the films, especially film noirs like ''[[Criss Cross (1949 film)|Criss Cross]], [[The Killers]], [[Gilda]], [[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and more modern explorations like ''[[Lolita]]'' and Cronenberg's ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', earns its own chapter.

The fugitive couple, love on the run, another noir theme, is also studied centering on films like ''[[Gun Crazy]]'', Truffaut's ''[[Mississippi Mermaid]]'' and its recent remake with Angelina Jolie ''[[Original Sin]], [[Moulin Rouge]]'', and Lynch's ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]''. The book shifts gears in its finale and concentrates on the female gaze, films of female obsession: e.g., ''[[Jane Eyre]], [[Lady Chatterley's Lover]], [[The Piano]], [[The Story of Adele H]]., [[The Lover (film)|The Lover]], [[Fatal Attraction]], [[Vanilla Sky]]'', to name but a few. 
From the same authors of ''[[The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen]]'', this book also contains a filmography of over one hundred films including hundreds of illustrations and a complete bibliography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12945">'''Cognitive style''' or "thinking style" is a concept used in [[cognitive psychology]] to describe the way individuals [[thought|think]], perceive and remember information. Cognitive style differs from cognitive ability (or level), the latter being measured by aptitude tests or so-called intelligence tests. There is controversy over the exact meaning of the term "cognitive style" and whether it is a single or multiple dimension of human [[personality]]. However it remains a key concept in the areas of [[education]] and [[management]]. If a pupil has a cognitive style that is similar to that of his/her teacher, the chances are improved that the pupil will have a more positive learning experience.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Likewise, team members with similar cognitive styles likely feel more positive about their participation with the team.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} While matching cognitive styles may make participants feel more comfortable when working with one another, this alone cannot guarantee the success of the outcome.

==Multi-dimensional models and measures==
A popular multi-dimensional instrument for the measure of cognitive style is the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].

Riding (1991) developed a two-dimensional cognitive style instrument, his [[Cognitive styles analysis|Cognitive Style Analysis]] (CSA), which is a compiled computer-presented test that measures individuals' position on two orthogonal dimensions – Wholist-Analytic (W-A) and Verbal-Imagery (V-I). The W-A dimension reflects how individuals organise and structure information. Individuals described as Analytics will deconstruct information into its component parts, whereas individuals described as Wholists will retain a global or overall view of information. The V-I dimension describes individuals' mode of information representation in memory during thinking – Verbalisers represent information in words or verbal associations, and Imagers represent information in mental pictures. The CSA test is broken down into three sub-tests, all of which are based on a comparison between response times to different types of stimulus items. Some scholars argue that this instrument, being at least in part reliant on the ability of the respondent to answer at speed, really measures a mix of cognitive style and cognitive ability (Kirton, 2003). This is said to contribute to the unreliability of this instrument.

==Bipolar, one-dimensional models and measures==
The [[field dependence]]-independence model, invented by [[Herman Witkin]], identifies an individual's perceptive behaviour while distinguishing object figures from the content field in which they are set. Two similar instruments to do this were produced, the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) and the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) (1971). In both cases, the content field is a distracting or confusing background. These instruments are designed to distinguish field-independent from field-dependent cognitive types; a rating which is claimed to be value-neutral. Field-independent people tend to be more autonomous when it comes to the development of restructuring skills; that is, those skills required during technical tasks with which the individual is not necessarily familiar. They are, however, less autonomous in the development of interpersonal skills. The EFT and GEFT continue to enjoy support and usage in research and practice. However, they, too, are criticised by scholars as containing an element of ability and so may not measure cognitive style alone.

[[Liam Hudson]] (Carey, 1991) identified two cognitive styles: [[convergent thinking|convergent thinkers]], good at accumulating material from a variety of sources relevant to a problem's solution, and [[Divergent thinking|divergent thinkers]] who proceed more creatively and subjectively in their approach to problem-solving. Hudson's Converger-diverger construct attempts to measure the processing rather than the acquisition of information by an individual. It aims to differentiate convergent from divergent thinkers; the former being persons who think rationally and logically while the latter tend to be more flexible and to base reasoning more on heuristic evidence.

In contrast, [[cognitive complexity]] theories as proposed by [[James Bieri]] (1961) attempt to identify individuals who are more complex in their approach to problem-solving against those who are simpler. The instruments used to measure this concept of "cognitive style" are either Driver's Decision Style Exercise (DDSE) (Carey, 1991) or the Complexity Self-Test Description Instrument, which are somewhat ad hoc and so are little used at present.

[[Gordon Pask]] (Carey, 1991) extended these notions in a discussion of strategies and styles of learning. In this, he classifies learning strategies as either holist or serialist. When confronted with an unfamiliar type of problem, holists gather information randomly within a framework, while serialists approach problem-solving step-wise, proceeding from the known to the unknown.

[[Robert E. Ornstein|Robert Ornstein]]'s Hemispherical lateralisation concept (Carey, 1991), commonly called left-brain/right-brain theory, posits that the left hemisphere of the brain controls logical and analytical operations while the right hemisphere controls holistic, intuitive and pictorial activities. Cognitive style is thus claimed to be a single dimension on a scale from extreme left-brain to extreme right-brain types, depending on which associated behaviour dominates in the individual, and by how much.

Taggart's (1988) "Whole-brain human information processing theory" classifies the brain as having six divisions, three per hemisphere, which in a sense is a refined model of the hemispherical lateralisation theory discussed above.

The Allinson-Hayes (1996) Cognitive Style Index (CSI) has features of Ornstein's left-brain/right-brain theory. Recent evidence suggests that it may be the most widely used measure of cognitive style in academic research in the fields of management and education (Cools, Armstrong and Verbrigghe, 2014; Evans, Cools and Charlesworth, 2010). The CSI contains 38 items, each rated using a 3-point scale (true; uncertain; false). Certain scholars have questioned its construct validity on the grounds of theoretical and methodological approaches associated with its development. Allinson and Hayes (2012), however, have refuted these claims on the basis of other independent studies of its psychometric properties. Research has indicated both gender and cultural differences in CSI scores. While this may complicate some management and educational applications, previous investigations have suggested it is entirely plausible that cognitive style is related to these social factors.

==Kirton's model of cognitive style==
Another popular model of cognitive style was devised by Michael Kirton (1976, 2003). His model, called Adaption-Innovation theory, claims that an individual's preferred approach to problem solving, can be placed on a continuum ranging from high adaptation to high innovation. He suggests that some human beings, called '''adaptors''' tend to prefer the adaptive approach to problem-solving, while others ('''innovators'''), of course, prefer the reverse. Adaptors use what is given to solve problems by time-honoured techniques. Alternatively, innovators look beyond what is given to solve problems with the aid of innovative technologies. Kirton suggests that while adaptors prefer to do well within a given paradigm, innovators would rather do differently, thereby striving to transcend existing paradigms.

Kirton also invented an instrument to measure cognitive style (at least in accordance with this model) known as the Kirton Adaption-innovation Inventory (KAI). This requires the respondent to rate themselves against thirty-two personality traits. A drawback of all the other efforts to measure cognitive style discussed above is their failure to separate out cognitive style and cognitive level. As the items on the KAI are expressed in clear and simple language, cognitive level plays no significant role. Scores on the A-I continuum are normally distributed between the extreme cognitive styles of high innovation and high adaptation.

Another important concept associated with A-I theory is that of bridging in teams. Kirton (2003) defines bridging as "reaching out to people in the team and helping them be part of it so that they may contribute even if their contribution is outside the mainstream". Bridging is thus a task and a role, which has to be learnt. It is not a cognitive style. Bridging is also not leading, although the skilled leader may make use of persons they recognise as good bridgers to maintain group cohesion. Group cohesion means, to keep the group aware of the importance of its members working well together. Kirton (2003) suggests that it is easier for a person to learn and assume a bridging role if their cognitive style is an intermediate one. If person B assumes a bridging role which assists persons A and C to work well together in a team, then B's KAI score is recommended to be between those of A and C. Of course, it is only recommended that B's score lies between the scores of A and C, not that B's score lies near the KAI mean. All of A, B and C could be high-scoring innovators or, for that matter, high-scoring adaptors.

'''Collage''' (from the {{lang-fr| coller}}, "to glue";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollagedenise.com%2Fpage2.html&amp;date=2012-04-12 |url=http://collagedenise.com/page2.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |title=Origin of the term "collage" |first=Denise |last=Enslen}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|kɔ.laʒ}}) is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the [[visual arts]], where the artwork is made from an [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] of different forms, thus creating a new whole.

A collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.

The term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early precedents===
Techniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview&lt;/ref&gt; Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].

===Collage and modernism===

Despite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.

For example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage "was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage "Introduction to collage"]. Tate Gallery website&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches "collided with the surface plane of the painting."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works "gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other," according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: "References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art." This juxtaposition of signifiers, "at once serious and tongue-in-cheek," was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: "Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

===Collage in painting===

Collage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):

"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

In 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte à la chaise cannée)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte à la chaise cannée] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Musée National Picasso Paris&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.

[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#Étrécissements|etrécissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mariën]] from a method first explored by Mariën. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.

The [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau Réalisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau Réalisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.
Wesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,&lt;ref&gt;(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.

Another technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.

===Collage with wood===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; part of a series of experimental collages.]] --&gt;
[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918–1986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.

In a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt; Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.

It was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, "As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting..."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://12.172.4.131/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A4278&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Louise Nevelson]'' - [[The Museum of Modern Art]], MoMA Highlights, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.

Much wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.

Frequently, what is called "wood collage art" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable "[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)

===Decoupage===
[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|découpée]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]
{{Main|Decoupage}}
Decoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.

In the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].

There are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].

The craft became known as découpage in [[France]] (from the verb ''découper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].

The most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].

===Photomontage===
{{Main|Photomontage}}
Collage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]

''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.&lt;ref name=tomorrow&gt;[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm "This is tomorrow"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to "image 027TT-1956.jpg"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm "Just what is it"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian "combination printing", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]’s (1912–1988) series of black and white "photomontage projections" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8½ × 11&amp;nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.

The 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create "paste-ups" digitally.

Creating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to "undo" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.

===Digital collage===
Digital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].

===Three-dimensional collage===
A 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.

===Mosaic===
It is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design.Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.

===eCollage===
The term "eCollage" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.

==In other contexts==

===In architecture===
Though [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects used techniques that are akin to collage, collage as a theoretical concept only became widely discussed after the publication of ''Collage City'' (1978) by [[Colin Rowe]] and Fred Koetter.

Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the pictorial sense, much less seeking the types of disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.

===In music===
[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955–1957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]
{{Main|Sound collage}}
The concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.

In the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that "[[sound collage|musical collages]]" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name="timemagazine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, "mash-up" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called "literature of sound." In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).&lt;ref name="soundonsound"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In illustration===
Collage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].

===In artist's books===

Collage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.&lt;ref&gt;https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.

The [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.

===In fashion design===
Collage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.

===In film===
{{main|Collage film}}
Collage film is traditionally defined as, “A film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.” Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director’s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.

====In post-production====
The use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Amélie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en scène]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel’s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.

==Legal issues==
When collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.

Due to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.

The copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the "first sale" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.&lt;ref&gt;''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir. Oct. 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from  [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of [[colonialism]]: cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houska|first1=Tara|title='I Didn't Know' Doesn't Cut It Anymore|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|website=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132337/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}

==Overview==

Cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, Arnd (2003) ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 On ‘appropriation’. A critical reappraisal of the concept and its application in global art practices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231455/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 |date=March 3, 2016 }}'', published in Social Anthropology (2003), 11:2:215–229 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=KJohnson/&gt; or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] conflict.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt; This is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour,&lt;ref name=Alcoff/&gt; notably when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an "even playing field", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Owns Culture?: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law (Rutgers Series: The Public Life of the Arts)|last=Scafidi|first=Susan|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It is most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view of cultural appropriation characterizes critics of the practice as "engaged in a deeply conservative project: one which first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture."&lt;ref name=Bogeyman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004|title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be?|last=Berg|first=Chris|work=The Drum|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of cultural appropriation view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy as among its benefits.&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;{{cite web|work=Noahpinion|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/cultural-appropriation-is-great.html?m=1|title=Cultural appropriation is great!|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=December 19, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' appropriated elements from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', which itself appropriated elements from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as [[American Chinese cuisine]], modern Japanese [[sushi]], and [[bánh mì]], each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.&lt;ref name=Bogeyman /&gt;

==Academic study==
Cultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study. 
The term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652789|title=Cultural appropriation - Oxford Reference|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in "Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=John |last2=Hiller |first2=Susan |date=1992 |title=The Myth of Primitivism|journal=Circa|issue=61|pages=49|doi=10.2307/25557703|issn=0263-9475|jstor=25557703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural and racial theorist [[George Lipsitz]] has used the term "strategic anti-essentialism" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technoliteracy, Discourse, and Social Practice: Frameworks and Applications in the Digital Age| editor=Darren Lee Pullen| publisher=IGI Global| date=2009| isbn=978-1605668437| pages=312| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqJ3mKb41UsC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=strategic+anti+essentialism+lipsitz#v=onepage&amp;q=strategic%20anti%20essentialism%20lipsitz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Art, literature, iconography, and adornment===
A common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the [[iconography]] of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's [[mores]]. Examples include sports teams using [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the [[war bonnet]],&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt; [[medicine wheel]], or cross without any belief in those religions; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] tribal tattoos, [[Chinese characters]], or [[Celtic art]] worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as [[kitsch]] risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh/&gt;&lt;ref name=MTV1&gt;Ehrlich, Brenna (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Wear A Native American Headdress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151650/http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ |date=November 17, 2016 }}" for [[MTV]] News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOnline1"&gt;Freda, Elizabeth (Jul. 28, 2014) "[http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses Music Festival Is Banning Cultural Appropriation, aka Hipsters Wearing Native American Headdresses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507210844/http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses |date=May 7, 2016 }}" for ''EOnline''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman, Amy (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html Pharrell, Harry Styles, and Native American Appropriation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409140437/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html |date=April 9, 2016 }}" for [[The Daily Beast]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe and North America a common example of cultural appropriation is the misrepresentation of East Indian symbols, mythology and religious ideas as typified in Rudyard Kipling's stories and Talbot Mundy's [[Jimgrim]] book series including the highly discussed [[Nine Unknown]] and [[King of the Khyber Rifles]]. Movements to undo the biases, misrepresentations, and cultural inaccuracies made popular by authors like Kipling and Mundy have gained significant momentum since Kipling's poem "[[If—]]" was scrubbed off Manchester University walls by student leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/07/18/rudyard-kiplings-poem-scrubbed-wall-students-claim-hewas-racist/|title=Rudyard Kipling's 'If' poem scrubbed off wall by students who claim he was a 'racist'|last=Turner|first=Camilla|date=2018-07-18|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAJA, a watchdog organization for fair and respectful cultural representation, works to point out and prevent these cultural inaccuracies in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aaja.org/about|title=About AAJA|work=Asian American Journalists Association|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[ancient Egypt]] argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Ousterhout, Robert.

===Religion and spirituality===
Among critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.&lt;ref name="Wernitznig2"&gt;Wernitznig, Dagmar, ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the [[Plastic Shaman]]'s [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones – while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot – who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.—The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]], to issue several declarations on the subject. The ''Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality'' includes the passage:
{{quote|We assert a posture of zero-tolerance for any "white man's shaman" who rises from within our own communities to "authorize" the expropriation of our ceremonial ways by non-Indians; all such "[[Plastic shaman|plastic medicine men]]" are enemies of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;|}}Article 31 1 of the United Nations ''[[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]'' states:{{quote|Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP"/&gt;|}}

Many Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their [[sweat lodge]] and [[vision quest]] ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They also contend that there are higher safety risks when the ceremonies are conducted by non-Natives, pointing to [[Sweat lodge#Risks|deaths or injuries]] in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16121078&amp;dopt=Abstract|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taliman2"&gt;{{citation | first = Valerie |last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob |last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url =http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hocker, Lindsay.

====17th century to Victorian era====
During the 17th century, the forerunner to the [[three piece suit]] was appropriated from the [[traditional dress]] of diverse Eastern European and Islamic countries. The [[Justacorps]] [[frock coat]] was copied from the long [[zupan (clothing)|zupan]]s worn in Poland and the Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world4.eu/french-fashion-reign-louis-xiv/|title=Reign Louis XIV.

During the [[Highland Clearances]], the British aristocracy appropriated traditional [[Scottish clothing]]. [[Tartan]] was given spurious association with specific [[Highland clan]]s after publications such as [[James Logan (writer)|James Logan]]'s romanticised work ''The Scottish Gael'' (1831) led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans &lt;ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--106-108"&gt;[[#B|Banks: de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; and tartan became a desirable material for dresses, waistcoats and cravats. In America, plaid flannel had become [[workwear]] by the time of [[Westward expansion]], and was widely worn by [[Old West]] [[American pioneer|pioneers]] and [[cowboy]]s who were not of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=plaid+shirts+old+west&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|first=Jeremy|last=Agnew|date=25 October 2012|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2000s in fashion|21st century]], tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/1907/highland-fling|title=Highland fling - New Humanist|website=newhumanist.org.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English [[Regency era]] [[dandies]] adapted the Indian [[churidar]]s into [[skinny jeans|slim fitting]] [[Trousers#Europe before the 1900s|pantaloons]], and frequently wore [[turban]]s within their own houses.

American [[Western wear]] was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican [[Vaquero]]s, especially the pointed [[cowboy boot]]s and the [[guayabera]] which was adapted into the embroidered [[Western shirt]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Cowboys," from Time Life The Old West series. (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China poblana]] dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the [[choli]] and [[lehenga]] worn by [[India]]n maidservants like [[Catarina de San Juan]] who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analesiie.unam.mx/pdf/71_37-73.pdf A Mughal princess in New Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 during the annual [[Victoria's Secret]] fashion show, model [[Karlie Kloss]] was scrutinized for wearing a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] headdress during her walk on the runway.

''[[USA Today]]'' ran a feature where they interviewed a woman of mixed heritage who said that the headdress is a symbol of leadership and honour, and also has a [[religious]] meaning behind it. This cultural meaning was not considered in Victoria’s Secret’s use of the headdress as an accessory.

===Hairstyles, makeup and body modifications===
*The leaders of [[ancient Israel]] strongly condemned the adoption of Egyptian and Canaanite practises, especially cutting the hair short or shaving the beard. At the same time, the Old Testament distinguishes the religious [[circumcision]] of the [[Hebrew]]s, from cultures such as the Egyptians where the practise had aesthetic or practical purposes.
*During the early 16th century, European men imitated the short [[regular haircut]]s and beards on rediscovered [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman statues. The curled hair favoured by the [[Regency era]] [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummel]] was also inspired by the classical era.
*During the 17th century, [[Louis XIV]] began wearing [[wig]]s to conceal his baldness.

[[File:FedExField - Redskins Jaguars pregame field.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Redskins]] logo in Maryland]]

While the history of colonization and [[marginalization]] is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at [[Portland State University]], cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Pewewardy.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0710-1481| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 176–189| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = From enemy to mascot: The deculturation of Indian mascots in sports culture| journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education| accessdate = 2014-11-22| date = 1999| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/230304174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0027-6014| volume = 40| issue = 3| pages = 1–12| last = Longwell-Grice| first = Robert|author2=Hope Longwell-Grice| title = Chiefs, Braves, and Tomahawks: The Use of American Indians as University Mascots| journal = NASPA Journal (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, Inc.)| accessdate = 2014-10-29| year = 2003 | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=32547562&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site| doi=10.2202/0027-6014.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities which have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion.&lt;ref name="usccr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aistm.org/fr.usccr.htm |title=Statement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on the Use of Native American Images and Nicknames as Sports Symbols |publisher=The United States Commission on Civil Rights |date=April 13, 2001 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] initiated [[NCAA Native American mascot decision|a policy]] against "hostile and abusive" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the leadership of nearly all Native American tribes object to their depictions as sports mascots&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncai.org/proudtobe&lt;/ref&gt;, only one tribe explicitly approves of such representations. The [[Florida State Seminoles]] use the iconography of the [[Seminole]] tribe. Their mascots are [[Osceola and Renegade]], depictions of the Seminole chief [[Osceola]] and his Appaloosa horse.&lt;ref name="NPR.Seminole"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/11/28/456786680/osceola-at-the-50-yard-line|title=Osceola At The 50-Yard Line|last=Lyden|first=Jacki|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=November 28, 2015|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/florida-states-unusual-bond-with-seminole-tribe-puts-mascot-debate-in-a-different-light/2014/12/29/5386841a-8eea-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html|title=Florida State's Unusual Bond with Seminole Tribe Puts Mascot Debate in a Different Light|last=Culpepper|first=Chuck|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=December 29, 2014|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the NCAA attempted to ban the use of Native American names and iconography in college sports in 2005, the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] passed a resolution offering explicit support for FSU's use of Seminole culture and Osceola as a mascot; the university was granted a waiver, citing the close relationship with and consultation between the team and the tribe.&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole" /&gt; In 2013, the tribe's chairman objected to outsiders meddling in tribal approval, stating that the FSU mascot and use of Seminole iconography "represents the courage of the people who were here and are still here, known as the Unconquered Seminoles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminoletribune.org/like-the-old-florida-flag-let-us-alone/|work=The Seminole Tribune|last=Billie|first=James E.|title=Like the old Florida flag: 'Let us alone!'|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in 2013, the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] expressed disapproval of "the use of all American Indian sports-team mascots in the public school system, by college and university level and by professional sports teams", and not all members of the tribe's Florida branch are supportive of its stance.&lt;ref name="NPR.Seminole" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo.Seminole" /&gt;

In other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnicity-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the [[Boston Celtics]], the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], and the [[History of the Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Vikings]].

The [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] to be held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot [https://shop.gc2018.com/collections/mascot-1 Borobi], the local [[Yugambeh people|Yugambeh]] word for "koala," and has sought to trademark the word through [https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1762487?q=borobi IP Australia]. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.

===African-American culture===
[[File:Paul Wall.jpg|thumb|Example of hip hop fashion]]
The term [[wigger]] (common spelling "wigga") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, [[African American Vernacular English|language]], and [[Hip hop fashion|fashions]] associated with [[African-American culture]], particularly [[hip hop]], and, in Britain, the [[Grime (music)|grime]] scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nell: ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'', 5th ed. 607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/wigger |title=Wigger &amp;#124; Define Wigger at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wigger |title=wigger - definition of wigger by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wigger is a [[portmanteau]] of ''white'' and ''[[nigger]]'' or ''[[nigga]],'' and the related term wangsta is a mashup of ''wannabe'' or ''white'', and ''[[gangsta rap|gangsta]]''. Among black hip-hop fans, the word "nigga" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by whites, it is usually viewed as offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.09.98/cover/nigger-9814.html|title=Metroactive News &amp; Issues - The Word 'Nigger'|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wigger" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, [[black British]], and white culture (when used as synonym of [[white trash]]). The term is sometimes used in a racist manner, by other white people to belittle the person perceived as "acting black", but it is also widely used by African Americans like [[50 Cent]] offended by the wigga or [[chav|wanksta]]'s demeaning of black people and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xmmNfoefAAC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=LvbpzvmxIs&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America|first=Bakari|last=Kitwana|date=30 May 2006|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since [[slavery]] was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in the [[Western world]]. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay "[[The White Negro]]". It was later seen in the [[zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s, the [[beatnik]] of the 1950s–1960s, the [[blue-eyed soul]] of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were "wannabe Blacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/wiggers-just-wannabe-black-white-middleclass-kids-are-adopting-black-street-style-and-chilling-out-to-rap-music-david-usborne-reports-from-washington-1462591.html|title=Wiggers just wannabe black: White middle-class kids are adopting black street style and chilling out to rap music.|date=1993-08-22|publisher=Independent.co.uk|author=|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005 saw the publication of ''Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America'' by Bakari Kitwana, "a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years"''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitwana |first=Bakari |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4773208 |title='Why White Kids Love Hip Hop' |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Clift's documentary ''Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity'' questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. Clift's documentary examines "racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of [[Stephen Foster]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Rolling Stones]] -- all the way up to [[Vanilla Ice]] (popular music's ur-wigger...) and [[Eminem]]."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;Hank Stuever, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150706043444/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/29/AR2010012904040.html "'Blacking Up' documentary questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as "white [[poseur]]s", and states that the term ''wigger'' "is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture".&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Language===
Use of [[minority languages]] is also cited as cultural appropriated, such as when non-speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] or [[Irish language|Irish]] get tattoos in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Emily|title=The Scottish Gaelic Tattoo Handbook|publisher=Bradan Press|isbn=9780995099807|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHb0jwEACAAJ&amp;dq=the%20scottish%20tattoo%20handbook|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} Likewise, the use of incorrect [[Scottish Gaelic]] in a tokenistic fashion aimed at non-Gaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Richard A.

Since the early 2000s, it has become increasingly popular for people not of Asian descent, to get [[tattoo]]s of Indian [[devanagari]], [[Hangeul|Korean letters]] or [[Han character]]s ([[Traditional Chinese|traditional]], [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] or [[Kanji|Japanese]]), often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.port.ac.uk/1135/|title=Cultural appropriation of Japanese tattoos, 2008|website=port.ac.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/04/13/lost-in-translation-tattoos-and-cultural-appropriation/|title=Lost in Translation: Tattoos and Cultural Appropriation - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|website=thesocietypages.org|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to last US Census (2010), Asian-Americans make up 4.8 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf|title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010|last=Humes|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Ramirez|first3=Roberto R.|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, only one out of 20 (which corresponds to 5 percent) speaking roles go to Asian-Americans, and they are given only one percent of lead roles in film.

In chapter four of his book ''[[Playing Indian]]'', Native American historian [[Philip J.

Some people in the transgender community have protested against the casting of straight, cis-gender actors in trans acting roles, such as when [[Eddie Redmayne]] played the role of artist Lili Elbe in the film ''[[The Danish Girl]]'' and when [[Jared Leto]] played the role of a trans woman named Rayon in ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.&lt;ref name="Caruso"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acculturated.com/hollywood-guilty-cultural-appropriation-casting/ |title=Is Hollywood Guilty of Cultural Appropriation in its Casting? |last=Caruso |first=Jay |date=24 May 2018 |website=acculturated.com |publisher=Acculturated |access-date=21 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice nicknamed "gay for pay"; this occurs in films such as ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' ([[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (starring [[Tom Hanks]]), ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (starring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (with [[Sean Penn]] playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist, [[Harvey Milk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.them.us/story/call-me-by-your-name-gay-for-pay-oscar-bait |title=Latest Gay-for-Pay Oscar Bait: Dear Hollywood, Let queer people tell our own damn stories. |last=Kirst |first=Seamus |date=6 December 2017 |website=www.them.us |publisher=Them|access-date= |quote=One need not look far to see that Hollywood often fails to provide both representation of, and employment to, members of marginalized communities.

In some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can be accused of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the [[nation-state]] system. For example, the government of [[Ghana]] has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean [[Emancipation Day]] and marketing it to African American tourists as an "African festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hasty| first=J | title=Rites of Passage, Routes of Redemption: Emancipation Tourism and the Wealth of Culture| journal=Africa Today| volume=49| issue=3, Fall 2002| pages=47–76| publisher=Indiana University Press| url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043196408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity controversies==
In 2003, [[Prince Harry]] of the [[British royal family]] used [[Indigenous Australian art]] motifs in a painting for a school project. One Aboriginal group labelled it "misappropriation of our culture", saying that to Aboriginal people, the motifs have symbolic meanings "indicative of our spiritualism", whereas when non-Aborigines use the motifs they are simply "painting a pretty picture".&lt;ref name=RoyalRipOff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |title=A right royal rip-off |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=2003-08-20 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818171622/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outfit met with backlash and criticism as an appropriation of Native American culture and tradition. Victoria's Secret pulled it from the broadcast and apologized for its use.

When [[Selena Gomez]] wore the [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]] during a performance, there was debate on her reasoning behind wearing the culture specific piece.

"Reclaim the [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]]" has become a [[hashtag]] used by some people of South Asian descent who wear traditional garb, and object to its use by people not of their culture.

==Criticism of the concept==

[[John McWhorter]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], has criticized the concept, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing, and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term "appropriation," which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource: unlike appropriating a physical object, others imitating an idea taken from one group's culture don't inherently deprive that originating group of its use.&lt;ref name=McWhorter&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[John McWhorter|McWhorter]]|first1=John|title=You Can't 'Steal' A Culture: In Defense of Cultural Appropriation|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/you-can-t-steal-a-culture-in-defense-of-cultural-appropriation.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us." She also asserted the right of authors from a cultural majority to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority, attacking the idea that this constitutes unethical "cultural appropriation". Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing [[sombrero]]s to a 'tequila party', she said "The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: ''you're not supposed to try on other people's hats''. Yet that's what we’re paid to do, isn't it? Step into other people's shoes, and try on their hats." Sudanese-Australian social activist [[Yassmin Abdel-Magied]] walked out on Shriver's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Convery |first1=Stephanie |title=We need to talk about cultural appropriation: why Lionel Shriver's speech touched a nerve |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |work=The Guardian |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123152039/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |archivedate=2016-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel-Magied later wrote a dissenting opinion piece, published in ''[[The Guardian]]''; which has run a series of articles covering the debate over ''cultural appropriation'' matters.  In it, she called the speech "a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension". She reiterated the basic premises and arguments which form the ideological basis of ''cultural appropriation'', as stated in the above sections, regarding majority/minority, group identity, oppression, colonialism, etc.; but did not address Shriver's arguments about the merits of imagination and intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abdel-Magied |first1=Yassmin |title=As Lionel Shriver made light of identity, I had no choice but to walk out on her|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her |work=The Guardian |date=2016-09-10|accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126050313/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural artifact''', or '''cultural artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is a term used in the [[social sciences]], particularly [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4SIXk2bp5u8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+pragmalinguistic+analysis+of+narrative+texts&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = The pragmalinguistic analysis of narrative texts | author = Richard J. Watts | isbn=978-3-87808-443-3 | year=1981 | publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=warrabarna+kaurna!&amp;btnG=Search+Books | title = Warrabarna Kaurna! | author = Rob Amery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} for anything created by [[human]]s which gives information about the [[culture]] of its creator and users. &lt;!-- the article should be expanded, and this sentence would be a good start, but it just is not clear enough without rewriting or explanation. The artifact may change over time in what it represents, how it appears and how and why it is used as the culture changes over time.--&gt; ''Artifact'' is the spelling in [[North American English]]; ''artefact'' is usually preferred elsewhere.

Cultural artifact is a more generic term and should be considered with two words of similar, but narrower, nuance: it can include objects recovered from [[archaeological site]]s, i.e. [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]], but can also include objects of modern or early-modern society, or '''social artifacts'''. For example, in an anthropological context: a 17th-century [[lathe]], a piece of [[faience]], or a [[television]] each provides a wealth of information about the time in which they were manufactured and used.

Cultural artifacts, whether ancient or current, have a significance because they offer an insight into: technological processes, economic development and social structure, among other attributes.

The philosopher [[Marx W. Wartofsky]] categorised artifacts as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wartofsky, Marx W. (1979). Models: Representation and scientific understanding. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* primary artifacts: used in production (such as a hammer, a fork, a lamp or a camera);
* secondary artifacts: relating to primary artifacts (such as a user-manual for a camera);
* tertiary artifacts: representations of secondary artifacts (such as a picture of a user-manual for a camera).

Social artifacts, unlike archaeological artifacts, do not need to have a physical form (for example [[virtual artifact]]), nor to be of historical value (items created seconds ago can be classified as social artifacts).

{{Culture of India}}
The '''culture of India''' refers collectively to the thousands of distinct and unique cultures of all religions and communities present in [[India]]. India's [[Languages of India|languages]], [[Religion in India|religions]], [[Dance in India|dance]], [[Music of India|music]], [[Architecture of India|architecture]], [[Indian cuisine|food]], and customs differ from place to place within the country.  Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several cultures, spans across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old.&lt;ref name="John Keay 2011"&gt;John Keay (2011), ''India: A History'', 2nd Ed – Revised and Updated, Grove Press / Harper Collins, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4558-1}}, see Introduction and Chapters 3 through 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohammada, Malika 2007"&gt;Mohammada, Malika (2007), ''The foundations of the composite culture in India'', Aakar Books, {{ISBN|81-89833-18-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of India's diverse cultures, such as [[Indian religions]], [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]], [[Indian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Languages of India|languages]], [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]], [[Dance in India|dance]], [[Music of India|music]] and [[Cinema of India|movies]] have a profound impact across the [[Indosphere]], [[Greater India]] and the world.

The Hindus had allowed their strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted religions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of their frontiers and their capitals."&lt;/ref&gt; consequently between the years 1000 AD and 1500 AD, the population of the Indian subcontinent decreased from 200 to 125 million.&lt;ref name="La1999"&gt;{{citation |last=Lal |first=Kishori Saran |authorlink=K.

[[India]] is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the life of many of its people. Although India is a secular [[Hinduism|Hindu-majority]] country, it has a [[Islam in India|large Muslim]] population. Except for [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Nagaland]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Lakshadweep]], Hindus form the predominant population in all [[States and union territories of India|29 states]] and [[States and union territories of India|7 union territories]]. Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Kerala]], [[Telangana]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]]; while only [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Lakshadweep]] have majority Muslim populations. [[Sikh]]s and [[Christian]]s are other significant minorities of India.

According to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the [[Demographics of India|population of India]] practice [[Hinduism]]. [[Islam]] (14.2%), [[Christianity]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism]] (1.7%), [[Buddhism]] (0.7%) and [[Jainism]] (0.4%) are the other major religions followed by the people of India.&lt;ref name=indiareligion2011&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/india-has-79-8-percent-hindus-14-2-percent-muslims-2011-census-data-on-religion-2407708.html| title= India has 79.8% Hindus, 14.2% Muslims, says 2011 census data on religion | publisher=First Post| date= August 26, 2015 | accessdate= 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Tribal religions of India|tribal religions]], such as [[Sarnaism]], are found in India, though these have been affected by major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.&lt;ref name=fcrel/&gt; Jainism, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are also influential but their numbers are smaller.&lt;ref name=fcrel/&gt; [[Atheism]] and [[agnostics]] also have visible influence in India, along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other faiths.&lt;ref name=fcrel&gt;{{cite book | last=Clothey | first=Fred | title=Religion in India : a historical introduction | publisher=Routledge | location=London New York | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-415-94024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Centre, India will have world's largest populations of Hindus and Muslims by 2050. India is expected to have about 311 million Muslims making up around 19–20% of the population and yet about 1.3 billion Hindus are projected to live in India comprising around 76% of the population.

Indian philosophy comprises the philosophical traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. There are six schools of orthodox [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]]—and four [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ājīvika]] and [[Cārvāka]] – last two are also schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: {{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyarania for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[medieval India]] (ca.1000–1500), schools of Indian philosophical thought have been classified by the Brahmanical tradition{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}&lt;ref name="Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5"&gt;Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; as either orthodox or non-orthodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on whether they regard the [[Vedas]] as an infallible source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="World Religions p. 259"/&gt;

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. According to philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the earliest of these, which date back to the composition of the [[Upanishads]] in the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)]], constitute "the earliest philosophical compositions of the world."&lt;ref&gt;p 22, ''The Principal Upanisads'', Harper Collins, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like Jainism, Buddhism, Śaiva and [[Advaita Vedanta]] survived, but others, like [[Samkhya]] and [[Ājīvika]], did not; they were either assimilated or became extinct. Subsequent centuries produced commentaries and reformulations continuing up to as late as the 20th century. Authors who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophies include [[Shrimad Rajchandra]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Ram Mohan Roy]], and [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]].{{Sfn|Clarke|2006|p=209}}

For generations, India has a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It is when extended members of a family – parents, children, the children's spouses and their offspring, etc. – live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head in the joint Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Families |url=http://www.factsaboutindia.org/indian-families.html |publisher=Facts About India |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730125635/http://www.factsaboutindia.org/indian-families.html |archivedate=30 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1966 study, Orenstein and Micklin analysed India's population data and family structure. Their studies suggest that Indian household sizes had remained similar over the 1911 to 1951 period. There after, with urbanisation and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more nuclear-like families.&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamics of Change in the Modern Hindu Family |year=1993 |publisher=South Asia Books |author=Raghuvir Sinha |isbn=978-81-7022-448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Hindu Joint Family: The Norms and the Numbers |author1=Henry Orenstein |author2=Michael Micklin |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=39 |issue=3/4 |quote=Autumn, 1966 |jstor=2754275 |pages=314–325 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sinha, in his book, after summarising the numerous sociological studies done on Indian family, notes that over the last 60 years, the cultural trend in most parts of India has been an accelerated change from joint family to nuclear families, much like population trends in other parts of the world. The traditionally large joint family in India, in the 1990s, accounted for a small percent of Indian households, and on average had lower per capita household income. He finds that joint family still persists in some areas and in certain conditions, in part due cultural traditions and in part due to practical factors.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;
Youth in lower socio-economic classes are more inclined to spend time with their families than their peers due to differing ideologies in rural and urban parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Verma |first1=Suman |last2=Saraswathi |first2=T.S. |title=Adolescence in India|year=2002|publisher=Rawat Publications|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of education and growth of economics, the traditional joint-family system is breaking down rapidly across India and attitudes towards working women have changed.

Arranged marriages have long been the norm in Indian society. Even today, the majority of Indians have their marriages planned by their parents and other respected family-members. In the past, the age of marriage was young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heitzman|first=James|title=India: A Country Study.|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of marriage for women in India has increased to 21 years, according to 2011 Census of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_new/upload/women_men_2012_31oct12.pdf Women and men in India 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012024158/http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_new/upload/women_men_2012_31oct12.pdf |date=12 October 2013 }} CSO/Census of India 2011, Government of India, pp xxi&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, about 7% of women got married before the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;K.

In most of the marriages the bride's family provide a dowry to the bridegroom. Traditionally, the dowry was considered a woman's share of the family wealth, since a daughter had no legal claim on her natal family's real estate. It also typically included portable valuables such as jewellery and household goods that a bride could control throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heitzman|first=James|title=India: A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, in most families the inheritance of family estates passed down the male line.

In India, the divorce rate is low — 1% compared with about 40% in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India moves to make it easier for couples to divorce|publisher=BBC News|date=10 June 2010|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10284416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/mar/default.htm Marriage and Divorce data by Country – United Nations database]&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics do not reflect a complete picture, though. There is a dearth of scientific surveys or studies on Indian marriages where the perspectives of both husbands and wives were solicited in-depth. Sample surveys suggest the issues with marriages in India are similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world. The divorce rates are rising in India. Urban divorce rates are much higher. Women initiate about 80 percent of divorces in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sangeeta Pisharoty|title=Marriages are in trouble|publisher=The Hindu newspaper|date=15 May 2010|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article429761.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages. [[Banerjee]] et al. surveyed 41,554 households across 33 [[States and territories of India|states and union territories in India]] in 2005.

===Wedding rituals===
[[File:Hindu marriage ceremony offering.jpg|thumb|A Hindu wedding ritual in progress. The bride and the groom are seated together, receiving instructions from the priest. The sacred square fire container (''[[yajna]] kund'') is behind the priest.]]
Weddings are festive occasions in India with extensive decorations, colors, music, dance, costumes and rituals that depend on the religion of the bride and the groom, as well as their preferences.&lt;ref name=ft2008&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7498e59c-2233-11dd-a50a-000077b07658.html#axzz2aqrbE3eF Sari nights and henna parties], Amy Yee, The Financial Times, May 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The nation celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376057/indias-love-affair-with-gold/ India's love affair with gold], CBS News, February 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; of which over 80% are [[Hindu wedding]]s.

While there are many festival-related rituals in Hinduism, ''vivaha'' (wedding) is the most extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life.&lt;ref name=rjb1969&gt;Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0396-1}}, pages&amp;nbsp;153–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jgl2001&gt;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, James G. Lochtefeld (2001), {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, Page 427&lt;/ref&gt; Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings. The rituals and process of a Hindu wedding vary depending on region of India, local adaptations, resources of the family and preferences of the bride and the groom. Nevertheless, there are a few [[Hindu wedding#Main rituals|key rituals]] common in [[Hindu wedding]]s – ''Kanyadaan'', ''Panigrahana'', and ''Saptapadi''; these are respectively, gifting away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify impending union, and taking seven steps before fire with each step including a set of mutual vows. After the seventh step and vows of ''[[Hindu wedding#Saptapadi - Short Form|Saptapadi]]'', the couple is legally husband and wife.&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Dharmasastra, Vaman Kane (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prabhu2011&gt;P.H.

The couple walk around the holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib four times.
Indian Muslims celebrate a traditional [[Islamic marital practices#India|Islamic wedding]] following customs similar to those practiced in the Middle East. The rituals include ''Nikah'', payment of financial dower called ''Mahr'' by the groom to the bride, signing of marriage contract, and a reception.&lt;ref name=Zawaj&gt;[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/three_days.html Three Days of a Traditional Indian Muslim Wedding], zawaj.com&lt;/ref&gt; Indian [[Wedding|Christian weddings]] follow customs similar to those practiced in the Christian countries in the West in states like Goa but have more Indian customs in other states.

Christianity is India's third largest religion. With over 23 million Christians, of which 17 million are Roman Catholics, India is home to many Christian festivals. The country celebrates [[Christmas]] and [[Good Friday]] as public holidays.&lt;ref name=ph10/&gt;

Regional and community fairs are also common festival in India. For example, Pushkar fair of Rajasthan is one of the world's largest markets of cattle and livestock.

==Greetings==
[[File:An Oberoi Hotel employee doing Namaste, New Delhi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pressing hands together with a smile to greet [[Namaste]] – a common cultural practice in [[India]].]]

Indian greetings are based on [[Añjali Mudrā]], including [[Pranāma]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]].

Greetings include ''Namaste (Hindi and Sanskrit)'', ''[[Namaskar]] (Hindi)'', Juhar/Namaskar in [[Odia language|Odia]], ''[[Namaskar]] ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]),'' ''Namaskara ''([[Kannada]]), ''Namaskaram'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]), ''Vanakkam'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]), ''Nomoshkaar'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''Nomoskar'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''Aadab'' ([[Urdu]]), and ''Sat Shri Akal'' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]). All these are common spoken greetings or salutations when people meet, and are forms of farewell when they depart. Namaskar is considered slightly more formal than Namaste but both express deep respect. Namaskar is commonly used in India and [[Nepal]] by [[Hindus]], Jains and Buddhists, and many continue to use this outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Indian and Nepali culture, the word is spoken at the beginning of written or verbal communication. However, the same hands folded gesture may be made wordlessly or said without the folded hand gesture. The word is derived from ''[[Sanskrit]]'' (namah): to [[bowing (social)|bow]], reverential [[salutation (greeting)|salutation]], and [[respect]], and (te): "to you". Taken literally, it means "I bow to you".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=namaste&amp;searchmode=none Namaste] Douglas Harper, Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism it means "I bow to the divine in you."&lt;ref&gt;Ying, Y. W., Coombs, M., &amp; Lee, P. A. (1999), Family intergenerational relationship of Asian American adolescents, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 5(4), pp 350–363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J. D. (2007), The Boundaries of Faith: A Journey in India, Homily Service, 41(2), pp 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; In most Indian families, younger men and women are taught to seek the blessing of their elders by reverentially bowing to their elders. This custom is known as [[Pranāma]].

Other greetings include ''Jai Jagannath'' (used in [[Odia language|Odia]]) ''Ami Aschi'' (used in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''Jai Shri Krishna'' (in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and the [[Braj Bhasha]] and [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani]] dialects of [[Hindi]]), ''Ram Ram/(Jai) Sita Ram ji'' ([[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] dialects of [[Hindi]] and other [[Bihari languages|Bihari dialects]]), and ''[[Sat Sri Akaal|Sat Sri Akal]]'' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; used by followers of [[Sikhism]]), ''[[As-salamu alaykum]]'' ([[Urdu]]; used by follower of [[Islam]]), ''[[Jai Jinendra]]'' (a common greeting used by followers of [[Jainism]]), ''[[Jai Bhim]]'' (used by followers of [[Ambedkarism]]), ''Namo Buddha'' (used by followers of [[Buddhism]]), ''Allah Abho'' (used by followers of [[Bahá'í]]), ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' (used by followers of [[Judaism]]), ''Hamazor Hama Ashobed'' (used by followers of [[Zoroastrianism]]), ''Sahebji'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]; used by the [[Parsi]] people), ''Dorood'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Gujarati language|Guarati]]; used by the [[Irani (India)|Irani]] people), ''[[Om Namah Shivaya]]/Jai Bholenath'' (used in [[Dogri language|Dogri]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], also used in the city of [[Varanasi]]), ''Jai Ambe Maa/Jai Mata di'' (used in [[Eastern India]]), ''Jai Ganapati Bapa'' (used in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani language|Konkani]]), and etc.

These traditional forms of greeting may be absent in the world of business and in India's urban environment, where a handshake is a common form of greeting.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Messner, W. (2013).

The varied and rich [[wildlife of India]] has had a profound impact on the region's popular culture. Common name for wilderness in India is [[Jungle]] which was adopted by the British [[colonialists]] to the English language. The word has been also made famous in ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. India's wildlife has been the subject of numerous other tales and fables such as the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and the ''[[Jataka tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrumcommodities.com/education/commodity/statistics/cattle.html Symbolism in Indian culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509171551/http://www.spectrumcommodities.com/education/commodity/statistics/cattle.html |date=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, the cow is regarded as a symbol of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), [[mother goddess]] and bringer of good fortune and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Asian folklore |author1=Peter J.

This is why beef remains a taboo food in mainstream Hindu and Jain society.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Marshall [https://books.google.com/books?id=p5SRPcoelt4C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=cow+symbolism+hindu+culture&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a Nature's web: rethinking our place on earth] M.E.

As of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. Gujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producer and consumer of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing "If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cow when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian food is as diverse as India. Indian cuisines use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques and culinary presentation. From salads to sauces, from vegetarian to meat, from spices to sensuous, from breads to desserts, Indian cuisine is invariably complex. Harold McGee, a favourite of many Michelin-starred chefs, writes "for sheer inventiveness with milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On food and cooking|author=Harold McGee |isbn= 978-0-684-80001-1 |year=2004 |publisher=Scribner |url=http://www.curiouscook.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sanjeev Kapoor]], a member of Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel, Indian food has long been an expression of world cuisine. Kapoor claims, "if you looked back in India's history and study the food that our ancestors ate, you will notice how much attention was paid to the planning and cooking of a meal. Great thought was given to the texture and taste of each dish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Spice|year=2009|publisher=Indian Cuisine|pages=59–62|url=http://www.orissany.com/priority-mag-spore-air.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such historical record is {{IAST|Mānasollāsa}}, ({{lang-sa|मानसोल्लास}}, The Delight of Mind), written in the 12th century.

India is known for its love of food and spices. Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories – [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the western state of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties. In certain parts of India, these are called ''mithai'' or sweets. Sugar and desserts have a long history in India: by about 500 BCE, people in India had developed the technology to produce sugar crystals. In the local language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (खण्ड), which is the source of the word ''candy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sugar: A Bitterweet History|publisher=Penguin|year=2010|author=Elizabeth Abbot|isbn=978-1-590-20297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge. Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the [[Central Asia]]ns, [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]], and [[Colonialism in India|European colonists]]. Sweets are also very popular among Indians, particularly in [[West Bengal|Bengal]] where both [[Bengali Hindus]] and [[Bengali Muslims]] distribute sweets to mark joyous occasions.

Indian cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19130531_ITM|title=Indian food now attracts wider market. | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire | date=16 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most Indian restaurants outside India, the menu does not do justice to the enormous variety of Indian cuisine available – the most common cuisine served on the menu would be [[Punjabi cuisine]] ([[chicken tikka masala]] is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom). There do exist some restaurants serving cuisines from other regions of India, although these are few and far between. Historically, Indian spices and herbs were one of the most sought after trade commodities. The [[spice trade]] between India and Europe led to the rise and dominance of Arab traders to such an extent that European explorers, such as [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Christopher Columbus]], set out to find new trade routes with India leading to the ''[[Age of Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Spice_Trade.html|title=The History of the Spice Trade in India|author=Louise Marie M.

==Clothing==
{{Main|Clothing in India}}
Traditional clothing in India greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by local culture, geography, climate and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as [[sari]] and ''mekhela sador'' for women and [[dhoti]] or [[lungi]] or panche (in Kannada) for men. Stitched clothes are also popular such as [[churidar]] or ''salwar-kameez'' for women, with ''dupatta'' (long scarf) thrown over shoulder completing the outfit. Salwar is often loose fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut.&lt;ref name=mc1/&gt; The [[dastar]], a headgear worn by [[Sikh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s is common in [[Punjab]].

Indian women perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi, mehendi, earrings, bangles and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various ornaments made with gold, silver or other regional stones and gems. [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]] is often an essential part of a Hindu woman's make up. Worn on their forehead, some consider the ''bindi'' as an auspicious mark. Traditionally, the red bindi was worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi was worn by single women, but now all colours and glitter has become a part of women's fashion. Some women wear [[sindoor]] – a traditional red or orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called ''mang''). Sindoor is the traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. Single Hindu women do not wear ''sindoor''; neither do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may be married.&lt;ref name=mc1&gt;{{cite book |last = Chary |first = Manish |title = India: Nation on the Move |publisher = iUniverse|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vjI6IZt8tuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn = 978-1-4401-1635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups, and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and Muslim preferring the Arabic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Tarlo |first = Emma|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8wyM5heEc9gC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title = Clothing matters: dress and identity in India |publisher = C.

The [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [[Sanskrit]] is one of the oldest attestations of any [[Indo-Aryan languages]], and one of the earliest attested members of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The discovery of Sanskrit by early European explorers of India led to the development of comparative Philology. The scholars of the 18th century were struck by the far reaching similarity of Sanskrit, both in grammar and vocabulary, to the classical languages of Europe. Intensive scientific studies that followed have established that Sanskrit and many Indian derivative languages belong to the family which includes English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Celtic, Greek, Baltic, Armenian, Persian, Tocharian and other Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name=burrow1&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Language|author=Thomas Burrow|year=2001|isbn=978-81-208-1767-8|publisher=Motilal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of language within India may be distinguished over three periods: old, middle and modern Indo-Aryan. The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was ''sanskrit'' meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to ''Prakrit'' – the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. ''Prakrita'' became middle Indo-Aryan leading to ''Pali'' (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200–300 BCE), ''Prakrit'' (the language of Jain philosophers) and ''Apabhramsa'' (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is ''Apabhramsa'', scholars claim,&lt;ref name=burrow1/&gt; that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and many other languages now in use in India's north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structure similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.&lt;ref name=burrow1/&gt;

Sanskrit has had a profound impact on the languages and literature of India. [[Hindi]], India's most spoken language, is a "Sanskritised register" of the [[Khariboli dialect]]. In addition, all modern Indo-Aryan languages, [[Munda languages]] and [[Dravidian languages]], have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (''[[tatsama]]'' words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (''[[tadbhava]]'' words).&lt;ref name = Staal&gt;{{Harvnb|Stall|1963|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated to constitute roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages,&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{Harvnb|Chatterji|1942}}, cited in {{Harvnb|Stall|1963|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the literary forms of (Dravidian) [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].

===Epics===
The [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] and the [[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]] are the oldest preserved and well-known epics of India. Versions have been adopted as the epics of Southeast Asian countries like Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (''{{IAST|kāṇḍas}}'') and 500 [[canto]]s (''{{IAST|sargas}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutt|2004}}, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; and tells the story of Rama (an incarnation or [[Avatar]] of the Hindu preserver-god [[Vishnu]]), whose wife [[Sita]] is abducted by the [[Rakshasa|demon]] king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. This epic played a pivotal role in establishing the role of [[dharma|dhárma]] as a principal ideal guiding force for Hindu way of life.&lt;ref name = Brockington&gt;{{Harvnb|Brockington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest parts of the Mahabharata text date to 400 BC&lt;ref name=Brockington_1&gt;Brockington (1998, p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; and is estimated to have reached its final form by the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] (c. 4th century AD).&lt;ref&gt;Van Buitenen; The Mahabharata – 1; The Book of the Beginning. Introduction (Authorship and Date)&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional variations of these, as well as unrelated epics include the Tamil [[Ramavataram]], Kannada ''Pampa Bharata'', Hindi ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', and Malayalam ''[[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan|Adhyathmaramayanam]]''. In addition to these two great Indian epics, there are [[The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature]] composed in classical [[Tamil language]] — ''[[Manimegalai]]'', ''[[Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi]]'', ''[[Silappadikaram]]'', ''[[Valayapathi]]'' and ''[[Kundalakesi]]''.

India has had a long romance with the art of dance. The Hindu Sanskrit texts ''Nātyaśāstra'' (Science of Dance) and ''Abhinaya Darpana'' (Mirror of Gesture) are estimated to be from 200 BCE to early centuries of the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name=mog17/&gt;{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxiv, 19–20}}

The Indian art of dance as taught in these ancient books, according to Ragini Devi, is the expression of inner beauty and the divine in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dance Dialects of India|author=Ragini Devi|year=2002|publisher=Motilal|isbn=978-81-208-0674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a deliberate art, nothing is left to chance, each gesture seeks to communicate the ideas, each facial expression the emotions.

[[Dance of India|Indian dance]] includes eight classical dance forms, many in narrative forms with [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] elements. The eight classical forms accorded [[Indian classical dance|classical dance status]] by India's ''[[Sangeet Natak Academi|National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama]]'' are: ''[[bharatanatyam]]'' of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], ''[[kathak]]'' of [[Uttar Pradesh]], ''[[kathakali]]'' and ''[[mohiniattam]]'' of [[Kerala]], ''[[kuchipudi]]'' of [[Andhra Pradesh]], ''[[yakshagana]]'' of [[Karnataka]], ''[[Manipuri dance|manipuri]]'' of [[Manipur]], ''[[odissi]] (orissi)'' of the state of [[Odisha]] and the ''[[Sattriya dance|sattriya]]'' of [[Assam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-65370 "South Asian arts: Techniques and Types of Classical Dance"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudra.tv/channel_detail.php?chid=2 "Indian Dance Videos: Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Bhangra, Garba, Bollywood and various folk dances"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820050237/http://mudra.tv/channel_detail.php?chid=2 |date=20 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the formal arts of dance, Indian regions have a strong free form, folksy dance tradition. Some of the [[Indian folk dance|folk dances]] include the ''[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]'' of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]; the ''[[bihu]]'' of [[Assam]]; the zeliang of [[Nagaland]]; the [[Jhumair]], [[Domkach]], [[Chhau dance|chhau]] of [[Jharkhand]]; the [[Ghumura Dance]], [[Gotipua]], [[Mahari dance]] and [[Dalkhai]] of [[Odisha]]; the qauwwalis, birhas and charkulas of [[Uttar Pradesh]]; the jat-jatin, nat-natin and saturi of [[Bihar]]; the ''[[ghoomar]]'' of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]]; the ''[[dandiya]]'' and ''[[garba (dance)|garba]]'' of [[Gujarat]]; the kolattam of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]; the ''[[yakshagana]]'' of [[Karnataka]]; ''[[lavani]]'' of [[Maharashtra]]; ''[[Dekhnni]]'' of [[Goa]]. Recent developments include adoption of international dance forms particularly in the urban centres of India, and the extension of Indian classical dance arts by the Kerala Christian community, to tell stories from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India – Kalai Kaviri and Christu Dance Centre |year=2010 |publisher=International Christian Dance Fellowship |url=http://www.icdf.com/redeeming-our-culture-pg3.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116063520/http://www.icdf.com/redeeming-our-culture-pg3.php |archivedate=16 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Indian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. [[Kālidāsa|Kalidasa]]'s plays like [[Shakuntala]] and [[Meghadoot]]a are some of the older dramas, following those of Bhasa. [[Kutiyattam]] of Kerala, is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the [[Common Era]], and is officially recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. It strictly follows the [[Natya Shastra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Music is an integral part of India's culture. [[Natya Shastra|Natyasastra]], a 2000-year-old Sanskrit text, describes five systems of taxonomy to classify musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classification of musical instruments (South Asia : The Indian Subcontinent – Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 5) |editor=Alison Arnold|year=1999|page=319|publisher=Routledge; Har/Com edition|isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1|author=Reis Flora |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=musical%20instrument%20discovered%20india&amp;pg=PA319#v=onepage&amp;q=musical%20instrument%20discovered%20india&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these ancient Indian systems classifies musical instruments into four groups according to four primary sources of vibration: strings, membranes, cymbals, and air. According to Reis Flora, this is similar to the Western theory of organology. Archeologists have also reported the discovery of a 3000-year-old, 20-key, carefully shaped polished basalt lithophone in the [[Sankarjang|highlands of Odisha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=P.

[[File:Jodhpur RIFF.jpg|left|thumb|Group of Dharohar [[Indian folk music|folk music]]ians performing in [[Mehrangarh Fort]], [[Jodhpur]], India.]]
The oldest preserved examples of Indian music are the melodies of the ''[[Samaveda]]'' (1000 BC) that are still sung in certain Vedic [[Shrauta|Śrauta]] sacrifices; this is the earliest account of Indian musical hymns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Emmie te Nijenhuis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NrgfAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Indian music, Part 2, Volume 6 | publisher=BRILL | isbn=978-90-04-03978-0 | year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a tonal structure consisting of seven notes, which were named, in descending order, as ''Krusht'', ''Pratham'', ''Dwitiya'', ''Tritiya'', ''Chaturth'', ''Mandra'' and ''Atiswār''. These refer to the notes of a flute, which was the only fixed frequency instrument. The Samaveda, and other [[Hindu]] texts, heavily influenced [[Indian classical music|India's classical music]] tradition, which is known today in two distinct styles: [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music]]. Both the Carnatic music and Hindustani music systems are based on the melodic base (known as [[raga|Rāga]]), sung to a rhythmic cycle (known as [[Tala (music)|Tāla]]); these principles were refined in the [[Natyashastra|nātyaśāstra]] (200 BC) and the [[dattilam]] (300 AD).&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Dattilam: A Treatise on the Sacred Music of Ancient India, 1978, p. 283, Mukunda Lāṭha, Dattila&lt;/ref&gt;

The current music of India includes multiple varieties of religious, classical, [[folk music|folk]], filmi, rock and pop music and dance. The appeal of traditional classical music and dance is on the rapid decline, especially among the younger generation.

Prominent contemporary Indian musical forms included [[filmi]] and [[Indipop]]. Filmi refers to the wide range of music written and performed for mainstream [[Indian cinema]], primarily [[Bollywood]], and accounts for more than 70 percent of all music sales in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8405891.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plans to start India music awards | date=10 December 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indipop is one of the most popular contemporary styles of Indian music which is either a fusion of [[Indian folk music|Indian folk]], classical or [[Sufi music]] with Western musical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cave paintings from [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and [[Sittanavasal]] and temple paintings testify to a love of naturalism. Most early and medieval art in India is Hindu, Buddhist or Jain. A freshly made coloured floor design ([[Rangoli]]) is still a common sight outside the doorstep of many (mostly South Indian) Indian homes. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] is one of the classical painters from medieval India.

[[Pattachitra]], [[Madhubani painting]], [[Mysore painting]], [[Rajput painting]], [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mughal painting]] are some notable Genres of Indian Art; while [[Nandalal Bose]], [[M. F. Husain]], [[S. H. Raza]], [[Geeta Vadhera]], [[Jamini Roy]] and B. Venkatappa&lt;ref name="venka"&gt;Kamath (2003), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; are some modern painters. Among the present day artists, Atul Dodiya, Bose Krishnamacnahri, [[Devajyoti Ray]] and Shibu Natesan represent a new era of Indian art where global art shows direct amalgamation with Indian classical styles. These recent artists have acquired international recognition. [[Jehangir Art Gallery]] in [[Mumbai]], [[Mysore Palace]] has on display a few good Indian paintings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first [[sculptures]] in India date back to the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], where stone and bronze figures have been discovered. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed further, India produced some extremely intricate [[bronze]]s as well as temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not constructed by using blocks but carved out of solid rock.

Sculptures produced in the northwest, in [[stucco]], [[schist]], or [[clay]], display a very strong blend of Indian and Classical [[Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]] influence. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] evolved almost simultaneously. During the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries) sculpture reached a very high standard in execution and delicacy in modeling. These styles and others elsewhere in India evolved leading to classical Indian art that contributed to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Southeast Central and East Asia.

Indian architecture encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, constantly absorbing new ideas. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of its earliest production are found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (2600–1900 BC) which is characterised by well-planned cities and houses. [[Religion]] and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning and layout of these towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5892/|title=Dholavira: A Harappan City - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires and their successors, several Buddhist architectural complexes, such as the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]] were built. Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]]. [[Rajput kingdoms]] oversaw the construction of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Temple Complex]], [[Chittor Fort]] and [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]], etc. during their reign. [[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.

The traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.

With the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.  [[Fatehpur Sikri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255|title=Fatehpur Sikri|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Taj Mahal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252|title=Taj Mahal|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gol Gumbaz]], [[Red Fort of Delhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/231|title=Red Fort Complex|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charminar]] are creations of this era, and are often used as the stereotypical symbols of India.

The colonial rule of the British Empire saw the development of [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, and mixing of several other styles, such as European Gothic. The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.

Indian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]]. The southern temple gate, or [[gopuram]] is noted for its intricacy and majesty.

Contemporary [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]] is more cosmopolitan. Cities are extremely compact and densely populated. Mumbai's [[Nariman Point]] is famous for its [[Art Deco]] buildings. Recent creations such as the [[Lotus Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5921/|title=Bahá'í House of Worship at New Delhi - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Golden Pagoda, Namsai|Golden Pagoda]] and [[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham]], and the various modern urban developments of India like [[Bhubaneswar]] and [[Chandigarh]], are notable.

One of the best known forms of ancient Indian martial arts is the ''[[Kalarippayattu]]'' from [[Kerala]].

Among eastern states, ''[[Paika akhada]]'' is a martial art found in [[Odisha]].

The ''Dhanur Veda'' was first described in the 5th-century BCE [[Vishnu Purana|Viṣṇu Purāṇa]]&lt;ref name="Zarilli1998"/&gt; and is also mentioned in both of the major ancient Indian epics, the ''Rāmāyaṇa'' and ''Mahābhārata''.

Indian martial arts techniques have had a profound impact on other martial arts styles across Asia. The 3rd-century BCE ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' taught how to meditate single-mindedly on points located inside one's body, which was later used in [[martial arts]], while various [[mudra]] finger movements were taught in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism. These elements of [[yoga]], as well as finger movements in the ''nata'' dances, were later incorporated into various martial arts.&lt;ref name=Svinth&gt;J. R. Svinth (2002).

At that time there was only one national channel [[Doordarshan]], which was government owned. 1982 saw revolution in TV programming in India, with the New Delhi Asian games, India saw the colour version of TV, that year. The [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharat]] were some among the popular television series produced. By the late 1980s more and more people started to own television sets. Though there was a single channel, television programming had reached saturation. Hence the government opened up another channel which had part national programming and part regional. This channel was known as DD 2 later DD Metro. Both channels were broadcast terrestrially.

In 1991, the government liberated its markets, opening them up to [[cable television]]. Since then, there has been a spurt in the number of channels available. Today, Indian small screen is a huge industry by itself, and has thousands of programmes in all the states of India. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps are extremely popular with housewives as well as working women. Some lesser known actors have found success in [[Bollywood]]. Indian TV now has many of the same channels as Western TV, including stations such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[HBO]], [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], and [[MTV India]].

''[[Bollywood]]'' is the informal name given to the popular [[Mumbai]]-based [[film|film industry]] in India. Bollywood and the other major cinematic hubs (in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali Cinema]], [[Oriya film industry]], Assamese, Kannada, [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]], Marathi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Punjabi and Telugu) constitute the broader [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]], whose output is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced and number of tickets sold.

India has produced many cinema-makers like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[J. C. Daniel]], [[Kasinathuni Viswanath]], [[Ram Gopal Varma]], [[Bapu (film director)|Bapu]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Guru Dutt]],[[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], [[Shaji N.

Balachander]] (see also: [[List of Indian film directors|Indian film directors]]). With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.

==Perceptions of Indian culture==
{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}
[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]
India's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of "Indian culture" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of "Indianness" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression "Indian" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)

According to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.&lt;ref name="makar"&gt;{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas &amp; sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.&lt;ref name="makar"/&gt;

Others have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad – who was born in India and grew up there – claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17–20|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture – both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference – real or imagined – between India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised description of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:
* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, "a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans."
* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.
* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be more free from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, have an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.

The curatorial approach, one inspired by systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.

[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. Bayly notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|author=Susan Bayly|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521264341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture, but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.&lt;ref name=rosser1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23–76 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India, versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:

{{quotation|The presentation of South Asians is a standard pedagogic approach which runs quickly from the "Cradle of Civilisation"—contrasting the Indus Valley with Egypt and Mesopotamia—on past the Aryans, who were somehow our ancestors— to the poverty stricken, superstitious, polytheistic, caste ridden Hindu way of life&amp;nbsp;... and then somehow magically culminates with a eulogy of Mahatma Gandhi. A typical textbook trope presents the standard Ancient India Meets the Age of Expansion Approach with a colour photo of the Taj Mahal. There may be a side bar on ahimsa or a chart of connecting circles graphically explaining samsara and reincarnation, or illustrations of the four stages of life or the Four Noble Truths. Amid the dearth of real information there may be found an entire page dedicated to a deity such as Indra or Varuna, who admittedly are rather obscure vis-à-vis the beliefs of most modern Hindus.|A South Asian in America&lt;ref name=rosser1/&gt;}}

{{Cyborg}}
A '''cyborg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|b|ɔːr|g}}) short for "[[cybernetics|'''cyb'''ernetic]] [[organism|'''org'''anism]]") is a being with both [[Organic matter|organic]] and [[biomechatronic]] body parts. The term was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf Cyborgs and Space], in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and American scientist and researcher Nathan S. Kline.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term cyborg is not the same thing as [[bionic]], [[biorobot]] or [[android (robot)|android]]; it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-62006-165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cyborgs are commonly thought of as [[mammal]]s, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of [[organism]].

D. S. Halacy's ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman'' in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' – a bridge...between mind and matter."&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Halacy, ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman'' (New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1965), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, some cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g., [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] from DC Comics, the [[Cybermen]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise or [[Borg (Star Trek)|The Borg]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' or [[Darth Vader]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'') or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g., the [[Cylon (re-imagining)|"Human" Cylons]] from the [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|re-imagining of ''Battlestar Galactica'']], etc.). Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten [[free will]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things), such as [[Robocop]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Overview ==
According to some definitions of the term, the physical attachments [[human race|humanity]] has with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html ''A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by [[Donna Haraway]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical example, a human with an [[artificial pacemaker|artificial cardiac pacemaker]] or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] would be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body, perform signal processing, and can deliver electrical stimuli, using this synthetic [[feedback]] mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, especially [[cochlear implant]]s, that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists{{who|date=October 2014}} cite such modifications as [[contact lens]]es, [[hearing aid]]s, or [[intraocular lens]]es as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities. As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 bio-techno-social definition of aging] has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wejbrandt | first1 = A | year = 2014 | title = Defining aging in cyborgs: A bio-techno-social definition of aging | url = | journal = Journal of Aging Studies | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 104–109 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to address human-[[technology]] mixtures in the abstract. This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones, computers, the Internet, etc. but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology; for example, pen and paper, and [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[language]]. When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places, a person becomes capable of much more than they were before. An example is a computer, which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers. Another example, which is becoming more and more relevant is a bot-assisted human or human-assisted-bot, used to target social media with likes and shares.&lt;ref name=cgwj&gt;Chu, Z., Gianvecchio, S., Wang, H., &amp; Jajodia, S. (2012). Detecting automation of twitter accounts: Are you a human, bot, or cyborg?. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 9(6), 811-824.&lt;/ref&gt; Cybernetic technologies include highways, pipes, electrical wiring, buildings, electrical plants, libraries, and other infrastructure that we hardly notice, but which are critical parts of the [[cybernetics]] that we work within.

[[Bruce Sterling]] in his universe of [[Shaper/Mechanist]] suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called Lobster, which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (e.g. a [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|Powered Exoskeleton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally (e.g. the [[Bishop (Alien)|Bishop]] type in the [[Alien (franchise)|Alien]] franchise), Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally (e.g. [[Elysium (film)|Elysium]], [[RoboCop]]). The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently featured cyborgs called Omar, where "Omar" is a Russian translation of the word "Lobster" (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).

== Origins ==
The concept of a man-machine mixture was widespread in [[science fiction]] before World War II. As early as 1843, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story "[[The Man That Was Used Up]]". In 1911, [[Jean de La Hire]] introduced the [[Nyctalope]], a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg, in ''Le Mystère des XV'' (later translated as ''The Nyctalope on Mars'').&lt;ref name=Zehr&gt;{{cite book |last= Zehr |first= E. Paul |year= 2011 |title= Inventing Iron Man: The Possibility of a Human Machine |url= |location= |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |page= 5|isbn=1421402262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vuillermet&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Vuillermet |first= Maryse |editor-last= Le Juez |editor-first= Brigitte |encyclopedia= Clergés et cultures populaires|title= Les Mystères de Lyon |trans-title= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HH9RJmZ4nwQC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Nyctalope+1911&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ8LD2p6DLAhXH9R4KHanxDHE4ChDoAQhNMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Nyctalope%201911&amp;f=false |access-date= March 1, 2016 |language= French |edition= |year= 2004 |publisher=  Université de Saint-Étienne |isbn= 286272324X  |pages= 109–118 |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESF&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Clute |first= Johne |author-link= John Clute |editors= John Clute, David Langford, Peter Nicholls, and Graham Sleight| encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |title= La Hire, Jean de |url= http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/la_hire_jean_de |access-date= March 1, 2016 |date= February 12, 2016 |publisher= Gollancz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmond Hamilton]] presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his novel ''The Comet Doom'' in 1928. He later featured the talking, living brain of an old scientist, Simon Wright, floating around in a transparent case, in all the adventures of his famous hero, [[Captain Future]]. He uses the term explicitly in the 1962 short story, "After a Judgment Day," to describe the "mechanical analogs" called "Charlies," explaining that "[c]yborgs, they had been called from the first one in the 1960s...cybernetic organisms." In the short story "No Woman Born" in 1944, [[C. L. Moore]] wrote of Deirdre, a dancer, whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body. 

The term was coined by [[Manfred Clynes|Manfred E. Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]] in 1960 to refer to their conception of an [[superhuman|enhanced human]] being who could survive in [[extrasolar planet|extraterrestrial]] environments:

{{Cquote|For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously, we propose the term 'Cyborg'. – Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline&lt;ref&gt;Manfred E. Clynes, and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) "Cyborgs and space," ''Astronautics'', September, pp. 26–27 and 74–75; reprinted in Gray, Mentor, and Figueroa-Sarriera, eds., ''The Cyborg Handbook'', New York: Routledge, 1995, pp. 29–34. (hardback: {{ISBN|0-415-90848-5}}; paperback: {{ISBN|0-415-90849-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of [[space exploration]] was beginning to open up. A designer of [[physiology|physiological]] instrumentation and electronic data-processing systems, Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York.

The term first appears in print five months earlier when ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper.

{{Cquote|A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824072139/http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|title=Entry from OED Online|archivedate=24 August 2010|work=oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A book titled ''Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the [[Wearable computing|Wearable Computer]]'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyborg:Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer|url=http://eyetap.org/cyborg.htm|publisher=By [[EyeTap (website)|EyeTap]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the 35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film [[Cyberman (movie)|''Cyberman'']].

== Cyborg tissues in engineering ==
Cyborg tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses.
The work was presented by Di Giacomo and Maresca at MRS 2013 Spring conference on Apr, 3rd, talk number SS4.04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrs.org/s13-program-ss/|title=Program: Symposium SS: Bioelectronics—Materials, Interfaces, and Applications|work=mrs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyborg obtained is inexpensive, light and has unique mechanical properties. It can also be shaped in desired forms. Cells combined with MWCNTs co-precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material. Likewise, dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the MWCNT network. When observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial "tissue" composed of highly packed cells. The effect of cell drying is manifested by their "ghost cell" appearance. A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall (the most outer part of fungal and plant cells) may play a major active role in establishing a CNTs network and its stabilization. This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing and has the potential to open important new avenues to be exploited in electromagnetic shielding for radio frequency electronics and aerospace technology. In particular using Candida albicans cells cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6409466|title=IEEE Xplore – Sign In|work=ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actual cyborgization attempts ==
[[File:Neil Harbisson cyborgist.jpg|thumb|Cyborg Neil Harbisson with his antenna implant|300x300px]]

In current [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] applications, the [[C-Leg]] system developed by [[Otto Bock HealthCare]] is used to replace a [[human leg]] that has been amputated because of injury or illness. The use of sensors in the artificial C-Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user's natural gait, as it would be prior to amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/cleg_technology.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330002400/http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/cleg_technology.asp|title=Otto Bock HealthCare : a global leader in healthcare products – Otto Bock|archivedate=30 March 2008|work=ottobockus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prostheses like the C-Leg and the more advanced [[iLimb]] are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real-world cyborg applications.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Additionally [[cochlear implants]] and [[magnetic implants]] which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[vision science]], direct [[brain implant]]s have been used to treat non-[[congenital]] (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher [[William H. Dobelle|William Dobelle]].
Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into "Jerry", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry's [[visual cortex]] and succeeded in producing [[phosphenes]], the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a two-ton mainframe, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html Vision quest], ''Wired Magazine'', September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Philip Kennedy, a scientist and physician, created the world's first human cyborg from  Johnny Ray, a Vietnam veteran who suffered a stroke. Ray's body, as doctors called it, was [[locked-in syndrome|"locked in"]]. Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy's experiment. Kennedy embedded an implant he designed (and named "neurotrophic electrode") near the part of Ray's brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body. The surgery went successfully, but in 2002, Johnny Ray died.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sherry. "Rise Of The Cyborgs." Discover 29.10 (2008): 50. Science Reference Center. Web. 4 Nov. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Canadian Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle's second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, James [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/bmi-the-research-that-holds-the-key-to-hope-for-millions-835850.html BMI: the research that holds the key to hope for millions], [[The Independent]] 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to replacement technologies, in 2002, under the heading Project Cyborg, a British scientist, [[Kevin Warwick]], had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities. With this in place Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand, also receiving feedback from the fingertips in order to control the hand's grip. This was a form of extended sensory input. Subsequently, he investigated ultrasonic input in order to remotely detect the distance to objects. Finally, with electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system, they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: "Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy", [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185–189, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369| pmid = 14568806| title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems| journal = Archives of Neurology| volume = 60| issue = 10| pages = 1369–73| year = 2003| last1 = Warwick | first1 = K. | last2 = Gasson | first2 = M. | last3 = Hutt | first3 = B. | last4 = Goodhew | first4 = I. | last5 = Kyberd | first5 = P. | last6 = Andrews | first6 = B. | last7 = Teddy | first7 = P. | last8 = Shad | first8 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, British artist [[Neil Harbisson]] has had a [[cyborg antenna]] implanted in his head that allows him to extend his perception of colors beyond the human visual spectrum through vibrations in his skull.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo M.

== Cyborg proliferation in society ==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2007}}

=== In medicine ===
In medicine, there are two important and different types of cyborgs: the restorative and the enhanced. Restorative technologies "restore lost function, organs, and limbs".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Chris Hables, ed. The Cyborg Handbook. New York: Routledge, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function. There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost.

On the contrary, the enhanced cyborg "follows a principle, and it is the principle of optimal performance: maximising output (the information or modifications obtained) and minimising input (the energy expended in the process)".&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean François: The postmodern condition: A report on knowledge. Minneapolis:  [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present.

Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice, bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely. [[Michael Chorost]] wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants, or bionic ear, titled "Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human."&lt;ref&gt;Chorost, Michael. "[http://www.technologyreview.com/review/409244/the-naked-ear/ The Naked Ear]". Technology Review 111.1 (2008): 72–74. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Sullivan]] became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve-muscle graft, enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Chuck. "Re-wiring the Body." Design News 60.15 (2005): 67–72. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, a fully functioning [[artificial heart]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Michel, et al. "Improved Early Survival with the Total Artificial Heart." Artificial Organs 28.2 (2004): 161–165. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The continued technological development of bionic and nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement, and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model. The ethics and desirability of "enhancement prosthetics" have been debated; their proponents include the [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement, with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present, normative limitations such as aging and disease, as well as other, more general incapacities, such as limitations on speed, strength, endurance, and intelligence. Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies; namely, a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de-emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood, in favor of definition in terms of upgrades, versions, and utility.&lt;ref&gt;Marsen, Sky.

Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 9 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[brain-computer interface]], or BCI, provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device, effectively creating a cyborg. Research of Invasive BCIs, which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain, has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people, most notably those with severe cases, such as [[Locked-In syndrome]]. This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aide them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices. It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sherry. "RISE OF THE CYBORGS." Discover 29.10 (2008): 50–57. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep brain stimulation]] is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes. This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Tourette syndrome]], epilepsy, chronic headaches, and mental disorders. After the patient is unconscious, through anesthesia, brain pacemakers or electrodes, are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present. The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures. Like all invasive procedures, deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk. However, there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Alzheimer's: Deep brain stimulation 'reverses' disease|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15890749|work=BBC News|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retinal implant]]s are another form of cyborgization in medicine. The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging (conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of ganglion cells) is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells (cells which connect the eye to the brain.)

While work to perfect this technology is still being done, there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light. A specialized camera is worn by the subject, such as on the frames of their glasses, which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation. A chip located in the user's eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user.  If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them.

A similar process has been created to aide people who have lost their vocal cords. This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators. The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck, where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals. The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator. That simulator would then vibrate producing a multitonal sound which could be shaped into words by the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Bonnie. "Was blind, but now I see." 11. Christian Century Foundation, 2007. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[Nature Materials]]'' in 2012 reported a research on  "cyborg tissues" (engineered human tissues with embedded three-dimensional mesh of nanoscale wires), with possible medical implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/merging-the-biological-electronic/|title=Merging the biological, electronic|work=Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, researchers from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly.  By using [[3D printing]] and computer modeling these scientist developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers. The device utilizes a "spider-web like network of sensors and electrodes" to monitor and maintain a normal heart-rate with electrical stimuli. Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient, the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high-resolution imaging technology. The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit's heart, operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient-rich solution. The stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor [[John A. Rogers]] in which the electrodes are arranged in a s-shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking. Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate, in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/3dprinted-electronic-glove-could-help-keep-your-heart-beating-for-ever-9166004.html|title=3D-printed 'electronic glove' could help keep your heart beating for ever|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|#Animal cyborgs|Supersoldier}}
Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. [[DARPA]] has announced its interest in developing "cyborg insects" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the [[pupa]]l stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060313-120147-9229r.htm Military seeks to develop 'insect cyborgs']. ''Washington Times'' (13 March 2006). Retrieved on 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, DARPA is developing a [[neural]] implant to remotely control the movement of [[sharks]].  The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060307_shark_implant.html Military Plans Cyborg Sharks].

The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. [[DARPA]] is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas&lt;ref name=Anthes&gt;{{cite news|last=Anthes|first=E.|title=The race to create 'insect cyborgs'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/17/race-to-create-insect-cyborgs|accessdate=23 February 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the first cyborg Olympics were celebrated in Zurich Switzerland. Cybathlon 2016 were the first Olympics for cyborgs and the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports. In this event, 16 teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes. There were six different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered prosthetic legs and arms, robotic exoskeletons, bikes and motorized wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cybathlon|url=http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If on one hand this was already a remarkable improvement, as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference, on the other hand it showed that there is still a long way to go. For instance, the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and sit down, navigate a slalom and other simple activities such as walk over stepping stones and climb up and down stairs. Despite the simplicity of these activities, 8 of the 16 teams that participated in the event drop of before the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strickland|first=Eliza|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/bionics/at-the-worlds-first-cyborg-olympics-manmachine-hybrids-raced-for-the-gold|title=At the World's First Cybathlon, Proud Cyborg Athletes Raced for the Gold|work=IEEE Spectrum|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetic can make  a difference in peoples' lives. The next Cybathlon is expected to occur in 2020

The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction. However, many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms; these can range from paintings to installations. Some artists who create such works are [[Neil Harbisson]], [[Moon Ribas]], [[Patricia Piccinini]], [[Steve Mann]], [[Orlan]], [[H. R. Giger]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Wafaa Bilal]], [[Tim Hawkinson]] and [[Stelarc]].

Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He uses medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, virtual reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm. Between 1976–1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. For 'Third Ear' he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled, making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/stelarc/a29-extended_body.html Extended-Body: Interview with Stelarc].

==== Artists as cyborgs ====
Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination. Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human-bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums, from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings.
Artists that seek to make cyborg-based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists, or may consider their artwork "cyborg". How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter's flexibility with the term.
Scholars that rely upon a strict, technical description of cyborg, often going by Norbert Wiener's cybernetic theory and Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline's first use of the term, would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs.&lt;ref name="Tenney"&gt;Tenney, Tom; "[http://inc.ongruo.us/2010/12/29/cybernetics-in-art-and-the-myth-of-the-cyborg-artist/ Cybernetics in Art and the Myth of the Cyborg Artist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720034620/http://inc.ongruo.us/2010/12/29/cybernetics-in-art-and-the-myth-of-the-cyborg-artist/ |date=20 July 2012 }}"; inc.ongruo.us; 29 December 2010; March 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Volkart, Yvonne; "[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/cyborg_bodies/editorial/1/ Cyborg Bodies. The End of the Progressive Body: Editorial]"; medienkunstnetz.de; March 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Others may speak of defining subcategories, or specialized cyborg types, that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual. This may range from technological instruments being external, temporary, and removable to being fully integrated and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Cyborg? "; CyborgAnthropology.com; 18 Mar. 2012. | http://cyborganthropology.com/What_is_a_Cyborg%3F&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, cyborg artists are artists. Being so, it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict, technical representation of the term,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Kate; "Cyborg The artist as cyborg"; theglobeandmail.com; 18 February 2011; Web; March 5, 2012. | https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-artist-as-cyborg/article1913032/&lt;/ref&gt; seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism.&lt;ref name="Tenney"/&gt;

=== In body modification ===
As medical technology becomes more advanced, some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community. While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics,&lt;ref name="TechReviewMod"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/23847/page1/ |title=Implantable Silicon-Silk Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt; augmented reality&lt;ref name="HeartChaos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartchaos.com/post/5134010603/nintendo-3ds-augmented-reality-tattoo-is-awesome-real|title=I Heart Chaos — Nintendo 3DS augmented reality tattoo is awesome,...|work=iheartchaos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and QR codes&lt;ref name="QRTatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forevergeek.com/2011/07/qr-code-tattoo/|title=QR Code Tattoo for the Geek|author=Noemi Tasarra-Twigg|work=ForeverGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body. Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces&lt;ref name="WiredTatt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/the-illustrated-man-how-led-tattoos-could-change-the-face-of-humanity/ | work=Wired | first=Charlie | last=Sorrel | title=The Illustrated Man: How LED Tattoos Could Make Your Skin a Screen | date=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Core77Gadgets"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301124121/http://www.core77.com/competitions/GreenerGadgets/projects/4673 Digital Tattoo Interface], Jim Mielke, United States&lt;/ref&gt; would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality, bringing a [[transhumanist]] way of life into present day reality.

In addition, it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest. Individuals may experience pre-implantation feelings of fear and nervousness. To this end, individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness, particularly in a socialized setting, due to their post-operative, technologically augmented bodies, and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion. Anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity.&lt;ref name="Springer-509728"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11097-008-9096-0 |title=Aging: I don’t want to be a cyborg! |date=September 1, 2008 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |issn=1568-7759 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |doi=10.1007/s11097-008-9096-0 |issue=3 |volume=7 |pages=397–404 |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |first=Don |last=Ihde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
{{See also|Cyberpunk|List of fictional cyborgs}}

Cyborgs have become a well-known part of science fiction literature and other media. Although many of these characters may be technically [[android (robot)|androids]], they are often referred to as cyborgs. Well-known examples from film and television include [[RoboCop]], [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]], [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]], [[United States Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Steve Austin (character)|Steve Austin]] in both ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' and, as acted out by [[Lee Majors]], ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]],'' [[Replicants]] from ''[[Blade Runner]]'', [[Daleks]] and [[Cybermen]] from ''[[Doctor Who]],'' the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] from ''[[Star Trek]],'' [[Darth Vader]] and [[General Grievous]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]], and [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] from the 2004 ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series. From [[American comic book|comics]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] are characters such as [[8 Man]] (the inspiration for ''RoboCop''), [[Kamen Rider]], ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'s'' [[Motoko Kusanagi]], as well as characters from western comic books like [[Tony Stark]] (after his Extremis and Bleeding Edge armor) and [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor "Cyborg" Stone]]. The ''[[Deus Ex (series)|Deus Ex]]'' videogame series deals extensively with the near-future rise of cyborgs and their corporate ownership, as does the ''[[Syndicate (series)|Syndicate]]'' series. William Gibson's [[Neuromancer]] features one of the first female cyborgs, a "Razorgirl" named [[Molly Millions]], who has extensive cybernetic modifications and is one of the most prolific [[cyberpunk]] characters in the science fiction canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromancer|last=William|first=Gibson|publisher=Penguin|year=2016|isbn=|location=S.I.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyborg was also a central part of singer [[Janelle Monáe]]'s 48-minute video corresponding with the release of her 2018 album "[[Dirty Computer]]." This ''emotion picture'' intertwined the relationship between human and technology, highlighting the power of the digital on a futuristic, dystopian society. Monáe has previously referred to herself as an android, depicting herself as a mechanical organism often conforming to idealistic standards, thus using the cyborg as a way to detach from these oppressive structures. 

=== In space ===
Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/9128-cyborg-astronauts-needed-colonize-space.html|title=Cyborg Astronauts Needed to Colonize Space|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist,  stated "Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war... I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space." The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi-planet species.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} There are many [[effect of spaceflight on the human body]]. One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen. If this necessity was taken out of the equation, space exploration would be revolutionized. A theory proposed by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline is aimed at tackling this problem. The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is "capable of reducing CO2 to its components with removal of the carbon and re-circulation of the oxygen..."&lt;ref name=cyborgspace&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/022697surf-cyborg.html Cyborgs and Space], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; could make breathing unnecessary. Another prominent issue is [[radiation]] exposure. Yearly, the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0.30 rem of radiation, while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarstorms.org/Sastronauts.html|title=Health|work=solarstorms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the issue, Clynes and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump "which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses." Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance.&lt;ref name=cyborgspace /&gt;

Although the effects of spaceflight on our body is an important issue, the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important. With our current technology, it would take us about 260 days to get to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/q2811.html|title=How long would a trip to Mars take?|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep, or [[torpor]]. With this technique, it would "reduce astronauts' metabolic functions with existing medical procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/nasa-eyes-crew-deep-sleep-option-for-mission-to-mars-141003.htm|title=NASA Eyes Crew Deep Sleep Option for Mars Mission|work=DNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week. Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption.

=== In cognitive science ===
Theorists such as Andy Clark suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system. In this model "cyborg" is defined as a part biological, part mechanical system which results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole. Clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition.  He suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system. Examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic, such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes, or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone. According to Clark, these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way which is analogous to the way that a technology which would fit the traditional concept a cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host. Because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes, Clark comes to the conclusion that we are "natural-born cyborgs".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andy. ''Natural-Born Cyborgs''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyborg Foundation ===
In 2010, the [[Cyborg Foundation]] became the world's first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;García, F.C. [http://www.lavanguardia.es/vida/20110301/54121537968/nace-una-fundacion-dedicada-a-convertir-humanos-en-ciborgs.html "Nace una fundación dedicada a convertir humanos en ciborgs"], ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was created by cyborg [[Neil Harbisson]] and [[Moon Ribas]] as a response to the growing number of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming a cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;Rottenschlage, Andreas [http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Article/Thesoundofthecyborg-021242963775427 "The Sound of the Cyborg"] ''[[The Red Bulletin]]'', 1 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body,&lt;ref&gt;Redacción [http://elcomercio.pe/tecnologia/721054/noticia-fundacion-se-dedica-convertir-humanos-ciborgs "Una fundación se dedica a convertir humanos en ciborgs"] ''[[El Comercio (Peru)]]'', 1 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights.&lt;ref&gt;Calls, Albert [http://www.tribunamaresme.com/noticies/noticia.php?id=6672 ""Les noves tecnologies seran part del nostre cos i extensió del cervell""]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''La Tribuna'', 3 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the foundation, based in [[Mataró]] (Barcelona), was the overall winner of the Cre@tic Awards, organized by Tecnocampus Mataró.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez, Ll.

In 2012, Spanish film director Rafel Duran Torrent, created a short film about the Cyborg Foundation. In 2013, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]'s Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded with $100,000 USD.&lt;ref&gt;Pond, Steve [https://http "Cyborg Foundation" wins $100K Focus Forward prize]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114075411/https://http/ |date=14 January 2016 }}, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 22 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Future Scope and Regulation of Implantable Technologies ==

Given the technical scope of current and future implantable sensory/telemetric devices, these devices will be greatly proliferated, and will have connections to commercial, medical, and governmental networks. For example, in the medical sector, patients will be able to login to their home computer, and thus visit virtual doctor’s offices, medical databases, and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted telemetric devices.&lt;ref name=Carvalko2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carvalko|first1=J.R.|title=Law and policy in an era of cyborg-assisted-life: The  implications of interfacing in-the-body technologies to the outer world|journal=IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)|date=September 30, 2013|page=206|doi=10.1109/ISTAS.2013.6613121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this online network presents huge security concerns because it has been proven by several U.S. universities that hackers could get onto these networks and shut down peoples’ electronic prosthetics.&lt;ref name=Carvalko2013 /&gt; These sorts of technologies are already present in the U.S. workforce as a firm in River Falls, Wisconsin called Three Square Market partnered with a Swedish firm called Biohacks Technology to implant RFID microchips in the hands of its employees (which are about the size of a grain of rice) that allow employees to access offices, computers, and even vending machines. More than 50 of the firms 85 employees were chipped. It was confirmed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of these implantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eastabrook|first1=Diane|title=US: Wisconsin company offers optional microchips for employees|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/news/2017/08/us-wisconsin-company-offers-optional-microchips-employees-170802074308766.html|accessdate=November 5, 2017|agency=Al-Jazeera|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these devices are to be proliferated within society, then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations, monitoring, and security of these devices? According to this case study of Three Square Market, it seems that the FDA is assuming the role in regulating and monitoring these devices.

'''Darwinian anthropology''' describes an approach to [[anthropology|anthropological]] analysis which employs various theories from [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[evolutionary biology]]. Whilst there are a number of areas of research that can come under this broad description (Marks, 2004)&lt;ref name="M2004" /&gt; some specific research projects have been closely associated with the label. A prominent example is the project that developed in the mid 1970s with the goal of applying [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] perspectives to explain patterns of human social relationships, particularly [[kinship]] patterns across human cultures.

This kinship-focused Darwinian anthropology was a significant intellectual forebear of [[evolutionary psychology]], and both draw on biological theories of the evolution of social behavior (in particular [[inclusive fitness]] theory) upon which the field of [[sociobiology]] was founded.

==Overview==

In 1974 the biologist [[Richard D. Alexander]] published an article ''The Evolution of Social Behavior'' which drew upon [[W.D.Hamilton]]'s work on [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] and noted that:

{{quote|Although ten years have passed since Hamilton's landmark papers, apparently only a single social scientist (Campbell, 31) has made a distinct effort to incorporate  kin  selection  into theories  of human  altruism... But so have the biologists,  for one reason or another,  failed to consider the enormous literature on  topics  like  kinship  systems  and reciprocity in human behavior. (Alexander 1974, 326)&lt;ref name="A1974" /&gt;}}

Amongst other suggestions, Alexander suggested that certain patterns of social cooperation documented by ethnographers, in particular the [[avunculate]] ('mother's brother') relationship, could be explained in reference to individuals pursuing a strategy of individual inclusive fitness maximization under conditions of low certainty-of-paternity. This hypothesis was subsequently taken up and elaborated in a series of studies by other Darwinian anthropologists:

{{quote|The hypothesis follows that matrilineal inheritance is a cultural trait that evolved in response to low probability of paternity. [...] The  paternity  hypothesis  was  rescued  and  made  explicit  in  the  context  of  modern evolutionary theory by Alexander in 1974. Over the next 10 years this provided the impetus  leading  to  numerous  theoretical  refinements  and  scholarly  and  empirical investigations  (Flinn  1981;  Gaulin  &amp;  Schlegel  1980;  Greene  1978;  Hartung  1981b; Kurland 1979).(Hartung 1985,661-663) &lt;ref name="H1985" /&gt;}}

Ultimately these analyses were considered unsuccessful, and were specifically criticized by other sociobiologists on a number of grounds. One problem was said to be that interpreting [[inclusive fitness]] theory to imply that individuals have evolved the characteristic of pursuing strategies to maximize their own 'inclusive fitness' is erroneous; the theory should instead be interpreted to describe selection pressures on genes:

{{quote|Alexander’s argument... erred through looking at things from the point of view of an ''individual''... I believe this kind of error is all too easy to make when we use the technical term ‘fitness’ [of individuals]. This is why I have avoided using the term in this book. There  is really only one entity  whose point of view  matters in evolution, and that entity is the selfish gene.(Dawkins 1989 (1976), 137 emphasis in original)  &lt;ref name="D1989" /&gt;}}

A related problem was that, in assuming that individuals simply operate as inclusive fitness maximizing agents, any investigation of the proximate psychological mechanisms that mediate social behaviors was ignored. Symons made this observation in his 1989 ''Critique of Darwinian Anthropology'':

{{quote|DA’s  central  hypothesis  is  that  “evolved  behavioral  tendencies”  cause  human “behavior  to  assume  the  form  that  maximizes  inclusive  fitness”(Irons  1979b,  33). Turke  and  Betzig  (1985)  state  this  hypothesis  as  a  formal  prediction:  “Modern Darwinian theory predicts that human behavior will be adaptive, that is, designed to promote  maximum  reproductive  success  through  available  descendant  and nondescendant relatives.”(p 79)… [T]he key terms in [this] quotation are used in DA to  bypass  the  question  of  phenotypic  design  in  characterizations  of  adaptation.(Symons 1989, 131-132) &lt;ref name="S1989" /&gt;}}

Symons, along with Tooby and Cosmides, were amongst the founders of the emerging school of [[evolutionary psychology]], whose aim has been to focus more on these hypothesized proximate psychological mechanisms.

==Theoretical background==

Darwinian anthropology was critiqued by Symonds for its agnosticism as to the psychological mechanisms governing how social behavior is actually expressed in the human species, and its reliance on interpreting [[inclusive fitness]] theory to simply imply that ''humans have evolved to be inclusive fitness maximizers''. This section will review some of the relevant background discussion in inclusive fitness theory to clarify why this position was considered untenable.

===Evolutionary  versus proximate explanations===
{{see also|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Inclusive Fitness theory has often been interpreted to mean that ''social behavior per se is a goal of evolution'', and also that  genes (or individual organisms) are selected to find ways of actively distinguishing the identity of close genetic relatives ‘in order to’ engage in social behaviors with them.

{{quote|[M]any misunderstandings persist.  In many cases, they result from conflating “coefficient of relatedness” and “proportion of  shared genes,” which is a short step from the intuitively appealing—but incorrect—interpretation that “animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes.” These misunderstandings don’t just crop up occasionally; they are repeated  in many writings, including undergraduate psychology textbooks—most of them in the field of social psychology, within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism. (Park 2007, p860)&lt;ref name="P2007"&gt;Park, J.H. (2007) ''Persistent Misunderstandings of Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection: Their Ubiquitous Appearance in Social Psychology Textbooks''. Evolutionary Psychology 5(4): 860-873.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The apparent rationale for this common mis-interpretation is that organisms  ''would'' thereby benefit  the  “Inclusive  Fitness  of  the  individuals  (and  genes) involved”.  This approach  overlooks the point that evolution is not a [[Teleology#Teleology_and_science|teleological]] process, but  a  passive, consequential  and  undirected biological process, where environmental variations and drift effects are present alongside random gene mutations and natural selection.

Inclusive fitness theory takes the form of an [[Proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate explanation]], specifically a criterion (br&gt;c), for the evolution of social behaviors, not a [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate mechanism]] governing the expression of social behaviors. What forms of social behavior might meet this criterion are cannot be ''a priori'' specified by the theory, nor can it shed light on whether the life history of a species provides opportunities for social interactions to occur. Thus, strictly speaking, the interpretation that organisms ‘have evolved to’ direct social behavior towards genetic relatives is not implied by the theory (see also [[inclusive fitness]]).

Investigating how inclusive fitness theory might apply to the potential emergence of social traits in any  given  species  must begin  with  an  analysis  of  the evolutionarily  typical [[ecological niche]], demographics, and patterns of interaction of that species. Where significant interaction between individuals is not present in the [[life history theory|life history]] of a species, the theory is necessarily null regarding social behaviors between individuals. As Silk (2001) put it;

{{quote|The role of kinship in the daily lives of animals depends on the demographic composition of the groups in which they live. Kin selection will  only  be  an  important  force  in  the  evolution  of  social  behavior  if animals  find  themselves  in  situations  where  they  have  an  opportunity  to  fulfill  the predictions of  Hamilton’s  rule.  At  a  minimum,  kin  must  be  available. The  number, availability,  and  degree  of  relatedness  among  kin  will  depend  on  how  groups  are constructed in nature.” (Silk 2001, 77)&lt;ref name="S2001" /&gt;}}

Consideration  must thus be given to whether the ecological niche leads to the clustering of individuals in groups or whether individuals are typically solitary. [[Socioecology]] research, for example, suggests that fundamental influences on demographic patterns are the distribution/fecundity of primary food sources as well as patterns of predation. When considering social behavior traits of a given species, consideration of these influences is in a sense, logically prior to analyses of inclusive fitness pressures on the species.

===Selection pressure on genes or strategy of individuals===

Darwinian anthropology, following R. D. Alexander, used the notion of the ''inclusive fitness of individuals'' rather than ''the inclusive fitness of genes''. Dawkins (above) pointed to this as an error. The source of the confusion can be traced to discussions in Hamilton's early papers on inclusive fitness. In his 1963 paper Hamilton refers, unambiguously, to selection pressures on genes;

{{quote|[T]he  ultimate  criterion  which  determines  whether  G  [a  gene]  will  spread  is  not whether the behaviour is to the benefit of the behaver but whether it is to the benefit of the gene G; and this will be the case if the average net result of the behaviour is to add  to  the  gene  pool  a  handful  of  genes  containing  G  in  higher  concentration  than does the gene pool itself.” (1996 [1963], 7)&lt;ref name="H1963" /&gt;}}

However, in his paper published in 1964, actually written before the 1963 paper (Hamilton 1996), Hamilton had included a subsidiary discussion on what the genetic theory might imply for how we look at the fitness of individuals:

{{quote|Actually,  in  the  preceding  mathematical  account  we  were  not  concerned  with  the inclusive fitness of individuals as described here but rather with certain averages of them which we call the inclusive fitness of types. But the idea of the inclusive fitness of an individual is nevertheless a useful one. Just as in the sense of classical selection we may consider whether a given character expressed in an individual is adaptive in the sense of being in the interest of his personal fitness or not, so in the present sense of selection we may consider whether the character or trait of behaviour is or is not adaptive in the sense if being in the interest of his inclusive fitness.” (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 38)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

It is clear here that the formal treatment is of the selection pressures on types (genes or traits), whilst the notion of individual inclusive fitness may serve as a guide to the adaptiveness of the trait; just as consideration of effects of a trait on an individual's fitness can be instructive when considering classical selection on traits. At the same time, it is understandable that Alexander took the inclusive fitness of individuals as a heuristic device.

===Context-based or discrimination-based expression mechanisms===

In his 1964 paper, Hamilton 'hazards' “the  following  unrigorous  statement  of  the  main  principle  that  has emerged from the model”;

{{quote|The  Social  behaviour  of  a  species  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  in  each  distinct behaviour-evoking situation the individual will seem to value his neighbours’ fitness against  his  own  according  to  the  coefficients  of  relationship  appropriate  to  that situation.”(1964 [1996], 49)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

He uses the terms 'hazards', 'unrigorous', and 'will seem' deliberately, since his formal analysis makes clear that the model specifies the evolutionary selection pressure, rather than specifying what mechanisms govern the proximate expression of social behaviors. He also clearly points to social behaviors being evoked in distinct situations, and that individuals may encounter potential social recipients of different degree of relationship in different situations. If one ignores the cautious qualifying words however, the passage might readily be interpreted to imply that individuals are indeed expected to make an active assessment of the degree of relatedness of others they interact with in different situations. Later in the paper, Hamilton again discusses the issue of whether the performance (or expression) of social behaviors might be conditional on; (a) discriminating factors which correlate with close relationship with the recipient, or (b) actually discriminating which individuals 'really are' in close relationship with the recipient:

{{quote|The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of  his  neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we  suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.” (1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;}}

For certain social behaviors, Hamilton suggests there may be selection pressure for more discerning discrimination of genetic relatedness, were the mutation to occur. But 'in fact' the same net result of accurately targeting social behaviors towards genetic relatives could be achieved via a simpler mechanism of being expressed in proximity to the actor's 'home'. Hamilton is thus agnostic as to whether evolved social behaviors might be expressed via straightforward proximate mechanisms such as location-based cues, or whether more specific discriminatory powers might govern their expression. He does suggest that the distinct social contexts within which various social behaviors are expressed are factors to consider. Other theorists have discussed these questions of whether proximity, context or more discriminatory expression may govern behaviors:

{{quote|Animals cannot, of course, be expected to know, in a cognitive sense, who their relatives are, and in practice the behaviour that is favoured by natural selection will be equivalent to a rough rule of thumb such as ‘share food with anything that moves in the nest in which you are sitting.’ If families happen to go around in groups, this fact provides a useful rule of thumb for kin selection: ‘care for any individual you often see’.” (Dawkins 1979, 187)&lt;ref name="D1979" /&gt;}}

{{quote|If, for example, animals behave with an equal degree of altruism to all their “neighbours”… and if ''on average'' animals are related to their neighbours, then I would regard this as an example of kin selection. It is not a necessary feature of kin selection that an animal should distinguish different degrees of relationship among its neighbours, and behave with greater  altruism to the more closely related…”(Maynard Smith 1976, 282 emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="MS1976" /&gt;}}

Dawkins believes social behaviors will in practice be governed by context-based expression. Maynard Smith is, like Hamilton, agnostic, but reiterates the point that context-based cues might well govern their expression and that actively distinguishing relatives is not necessarily expected for the expression of those social traits whose evolution is governed by inclusive fitness criteria. In sum, inclusive fitness theory does imply that; ''the evolutionary emergence'' of social behavior can occur where there is statistical association of genes between social actors and recipients; but that ''the expression'' of such evolved social behaviors is not necessarily governed by actual genetic relatedness between participants. The evolutionary criterion and the proximate mechanism must thus not be confused: the first does require genetic association (of the form br&gt;c), the second does not.

Darwinian anthropology's central premise that human behavior ''has evolved to maximize the inclusive fitness of individuals'' is thus not a logical derivative of the theory. Also, the notion that ''humans will discriminate social behaviors towards genetic relatives'' is again not entailed by the theory.

==Reception by anthropologists==

Before the questions raised within anthropology about the study of ‘kinship’ by Schneider &lt;ref name="S1984" /&gt; and others from the 1960s onwards, anthropology itself had paid very little attention to the  notion that social bonds were anything other than connected to consanguinal (or genetic) relatedness (or its local cultural conceptions).  The social bonding associated  with  provision  of and sharing of food was one important exception, particularly in the work of Richards,&lt;ref name="R1932" /&gt; but this was largely ignored by descriptions of ‘kinship’ till more recently.  Although questioning the means by which ‘kinship bonds’ form, few of these early accounts questioned the fundamental role of ‘procreative ties’ in social bonding (Schneider, 1984). From the 1950s onwards, reports on kinship patterns in the New Guinea Highlands added some momentum to what had until then been only occasional fleeting suggestions that living together (co-residence) might underlie social bonding, and eventually contributed to the general shift away from a genealogical approach. For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested:

{{quote|[C]learly, genealogical connexion of some sort is one criterion for membership of many social groups. But it may not be the only criterion; birth, or residence, or a parent’s former residence, or utilization of garden land, or participation in exchange and feasting activities or in house-building or raiding, may be other relevant criteria for group membership.”(Barnes 1962,6)&lt;ref name="B1962" /&gt;}}

Similarly, Langness' ethnography of the ''Bena Bena'' also emphasized a break with the genealogical perspective:

{{quote|''The sheer fact of residence in a Bena Bena group can and does determine kinship.''  People do not necessarily reside where they do because they are kinsmen: rather they become  kinsmen because they reside there.”  (Langness 1964, 172 emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="L1964" /&gt;}}

By 1972, Schneider&lt;ref name="S1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S1972" /&gt; had raised deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and 'kinship' was a natural category built upon genealogical ties (for more information, see [[kinship]]), and especially in the wake of his 1984 critique&lt;ref name="S1984" /&gt; this has become broadly accepted by most, if not all, anthropologists.&lt;ref name="C2000" /&gt;

The darwinian anthropology (and other sociobiological) perspectives, arising in the early 1970s, had not unreasonably assumed that the genealogical conceptions of human kinship, in place since Morgan's early work&lt;ref name="M1870" /&gt; in the 1870s, were still valid as a universal feature of humans. But they emerged at precisely the time that anthropology, being particularly sensitive about its own apparent 'ethnocentric' generalizations about kinship (from cultural particulars to human universals) was seeking to distance itself from these conceptions. The vehemence of Sahlins' rebuttal of sociobiology's genetic relatedness perspective in his 1976 ''The use and abuse of Biology'', which underlined the non-genealogical nature of human kinship, can be understood as part of this 'distancing' trend.

==Alternative approaches==

The lack of success of darwinian anthropology created space for alternative approaches to analyzing human social behaviors from a biological perspective. Alexander's initial point (above) that the inclusive fitness framework had been scarcely applied to human kinship and social patterns has remained largely valid. But the move away from genealogical kinship in anthropology has continued to be a major barrier to any potential resolution. This section reviews a range of approaches to synthesizing ideas from  evolutionary biology to observations and data about human social behaviour across contemporary human populations. Whilst some of these approaches include the inclusive fitness approach, others may seek to demonstrate fit to other theories from evolutionary biology, or to demonstrate that certain proximate mechanisms of social behaviour are both compatible with the inclusive fitness approach, and also with the broad variety of ethnographic data on human kinship patterns.

==Criticism==

Theories in evolutionary biology relevant to understanding social behavior may not be limited to frameworks such as inclusive fitness theory. The theory of [[reciprocal altruism]] may have equal or greater explanatory power for some forms of human social behavior, and perhaps kinship patterns. Other approaches may maintain that human behavior is less amenable to biological analysis due to the prominent influence of social learning and cultural transmission in the human species, and instead advance ideas based on the role of e.g. culture, historical contingencies or economic/environmental conditions. All or any of these may or may not contribute valuable insights to our understanding of social behavior and social patterns in humans.

The '''death wail''' is a [[keening]], [[mourning]] [[lament]], generally performed in [[ritual]] fashion soon after the death of a member of a family or [[tribe]]. Examples of death wails have been found in numerous societies, including among the [[Celts]] and various indigenous peoples of Asia and Africa, and they are associated with [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples. This article focuses on the death wail among Indigenous Australians.

==Early accounts==
Some of the earliest accounts of the death wail describe its employment in the aftermath of fighting and disputes. One such discussion can be found in the second volume of [[Edward Eyre]]'s ''Journal of Expeditions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia And Overland From Adelaide To King George's Sound in the Years 1840-1'', Edward Eyre&lt;/ref&gt; Eyre describes what appears to have been a parlay between the members of two rival tribes —

&lt;blockquote&gt;Notice having been given on the previous evening to the Moorunde natives of the approach of the Nar-wij-jerook tribe, they assembled at an early hour after sunrise, in as clear and open a place as they could find. Here they sat down in a long row to await the coming of their friends. The men were painted, and carried their weapons, as if for war. The women and children were in detached groups, a little behind them, or on one side, whilst the young men, on whom the ceremonies were to be performed, sat shivering with cold and apprehension in a row to the rear of the men, perfectly naked, smeared over from head to foot with grease and red-ochre, and without weapons. The Nar-wij-jerook tribe was now seen approaching. The men were in a body, armed and painted, and the women and children accompanying them a little on one side. They occasionally halted, and entered into consultation, and then, slackening their pace, gradually advanced until within a hundred yards of the Moorunde tribe. Here the men came to a full stop, whilst several of the women singled out from the rest, and marched into the space between the two parties, having their heads coated over with lime, and raising a loud and melancholy wail, until they came to a spot about equidistant from both, when they threw down their cloaks with violence, and the bags which they carried on their backs, and which contained all their worldly effects. The bags were then opened, and pieces of glass and shells taken out, with which they lacerated their thighs, backs, and breasts, in a most frightful manner, whilst the blood kept pouring out of the wounds in streams; and in this plight, continuing their wild and piercing lamentations, they moved up towards the Moorunde tribe, who sat silently and immovably in the place at first occupied. One of the women then went up to a strange native, who was on a visit to the Moorunde tribe and who stood neutral in the affair of the meeting, and by violent language and frantic gesticulations endeavoured to incite him to revenge the death of some relation or friend. But he could not be induced to lift his spear against the people amongst whom he was sojourning. After some time had been spent in mourning, the women took up their bundles again, and retiring, placed themselves in the rear of their own party. An elderly man then advanced, and after a short colloquy with the seated tribe, went back, and beckoned his own people to come forward, which they did slowly and in good order, exhibiting in front three uplifted spears, to which were attached the little nets left with them by the envoys of the opposite tribe, and which were the emblems of the duty they had come to perform, after the ordinary expiations had been accomplished.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In advancing, the Nar-wij-jerooks again commenced the death wail, and one of the men, who had probably sustained the greatest loss since the tribes had last met, occasionally in alternations of anger and sorrow addressed his own people. When near the Moorunde tribe a few words were addressed to them, and they at once rose simultaneously, with a suppressed shout. The opposite party then raised their spears, and closing upon the line of the other tribe, speared about fifteen or sixteen of them in the left arm, a little below the shoulder. This is the generally understood order of revenge; for the persons who were to receive the wounds, as soon as they saw the weapons of their assailants poised, at once put out the left foot, to steady themselves, and presented the left shoulder for the blow, frequently uttering the word "'Leipa" (spear), as the others appeared to hesitate.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst this was going on, the influential men of each tribe were violently talking to each other, and apparently accusing one another of being accessory to the death of some of their people. Disclaimers passed on each side, and the blame was imputed to other and more distant tribes. The manes of the dead having been appeased, the honour of each party was left unsullied, and the Nar-wij-jerooks retired about a hundred yards, and sat down, ready to enter upon the ceremonies of the day, which will be described in another place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ernest Giles]], who traversed Australia in the 1870s and 1880s, left an account of a skirmish that took place between his survey party and members of a local tribe in the [[Everard Ranges]] of mountains in 1882. "Our foes did not again appear," he recorded. "At the first dawn of light, over at some rocky hills south-westward, where, during the night, we saw their camp fires, a direful moaning chant arose. It was wafted on the hot morning air across the valley, echoed again by the rocks and hills above us, and was the most dreadful sound I think I ever heard; it was no doubt a death-wail. From their camp up in the rocks, the chanters descended to the lower ground, and seemed to be performing a funereal march all round the central mass, as the last tones we heard were from behind the hills, where it first arose."

A more modern account of the death wail has been given by Roy Barker, a descendant of the Murawari tribe, some fifty miles north of the present town of [[Brewarrina, New South Wales|Brewarrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Indigenous Australian group names#M|Morowari (Murawari) Riverina, New South Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt; Barker was born on the old Aboriginal mission in the late 1920s and left there in the early 1940s. 

"You hear the crying and the death wail at night," he recalled, "it's a real eerie, frightening sound to hear. Sad sound... to hear them all crying. And then after the funeral, everything would go back to normal. And they'd smoke the houses out, you know, the old Aboriginal way."

==Death wail in literature==
The death wail is mentioned in many literary works:

"She began the high, whining keen of the death wail... It rose to a high piercing whine and subsided into a moan.  Mama raised it three times and then she turned and went into the house..." 
John Steinbeck's short story "Flight", set in the Santa Lucia Mountains

Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''[[Nervous Conditions]]'', set in post-colonial Rhodesia (now [[Zimbabwe]]) gives an account of the death wail.

==Recording==
A wax cylinder recording of the death wail of a [[Torres Strait Islander]], made in 1898, exists in the Ethnographic Wax Cylinder collection maintained by the [[British Library]].

An overwhelming majority of fiction is set on or features the [[Earth]].  However, authors of [[speculative fiction]] novels and writers and directors of [[science fiction film]] deal with Earth quite differently from authors of conventional fiction.  Unbound from the same ties that bind authors of traditional fiction to the Earth, they can either completely ignore the Earth or use it as but one of many settings in a more complicated universe, exploring a number of common themes through examining outsiders' perceptions of and interactions with Earth.

==Common themes==
{{Prose|date=October 2009}}
*'''Center of the Universe, or the Seat of Power in an [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|Intergalactic]] community'''
**Earth is often depicted as a major power-broker in the community due to [[anthropocentrism]]. Perhaps the most notable example of this is ''[[Star Trek]]'' (where Earth is the capital of the [[United Federation of Planets]]).
**Earth can also be depicted as the head of an empire as in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Dominic Flandry]]'' series where "The barbarians in the long ships waited at the edge of the Galaxy for the ancient [[Terran Empire]] to fall … The brilliant Starship Commander Flandry fought to save the empire even as he scorned it" (from the preface to ''The Rebel Worlds'').
**[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Darkover]]'' series, too, has a brooding Terran Empire maintaining a colonial enclave on the planet Darkover where the plot takes place, and on countless others.
**''[[Haegemonia: Legions of Iron]]'' also features an empire controlled from Earth with other major planets, such as Eden IV.
**It is a common theme across British science fiction to have Earth near the core, or center of the fictional universe{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, common examples could be the works of [[Peter F. Hamilton]] where earth is the main terminus of the wormhole and the capital of the inner worlds (in later works he turns the idea that people seek an inner [[Human migration|migration]] (as opposed to an external expansion) to [[frontier]] type worlds).
**In the [[BBC]] science fiction show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', many episodes set in the future depict Earth as being the head of an empire that stretches across many galaxies.
** In the [[Warhammer 40,000]] franchise, Earth is referred to as "Holy Terra" and is the capital of the Imperium of Man
*'''Invasion by [[alien invasion|Aliens]].'''
{{See also|:Category:Alien invasions in fiction}}
:*While reasons vary, in most stories, it is because extraterrestrials are looking for a new world to colonize or otherwise dominate. The aliens are often used to portray nearly all-powerful beings, placing the strongest forces on Earth at the receiving end of attacks that they can barely understand. This theme is one of the earliest in science fiction, demonstrated by [[H. G. Wells]] in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and Doctor Who, where the invasions in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s are small scale, and the invasions from the 1990s and later are more-large scale, in works such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. In such scenarios, the author often uses [[deus ex machina]] to allow the invasion to be repulsed. In others, like ''[[Footfall]]'' and ''[[Worldwar]]'', the author depicts aliens only slightly more advanced than the inhabitants of Earth, and are fought to a stand-still or defeated in battle. The opposite has also been depicted, with Earth becoming a refuge to aliens as seen in the ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' series of movies, and ''[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|Alien Nation]]'' series.
*'''Forgotten or mythical'''
**The memory of Earth, and its location may be lost to the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]] or shrouded in myth as mankind abandons the Earth. [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' and ''[[Galactic Empire (series)|Empire]]'' series depict a common theme of a destroyed Earth. In other works, such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', it is largely forgotten except by the religious. In the numerous books of the [[Dumarest saga|''Dumarest'' saga]] by [[E.C. Tubb]], the adventurer protagonist was born on a "galactic backwater" Earth and at a young age had stowed away on a rare spaceship touching down on the planet; having seen more than enough of the galaxy he wants to go back, but no one else had ever heard of the planet. The first Terran inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector are Earth-born criminals in [[sleeper ship]]s in ''[[StarCraft]]''. The expansion also mentions about Earth: upon hearing of the United Earth Directorate's forces' arrival, Zeratul remarks "Raynor [a [[wikt:Terran#Adjective|Terran]] captain] spoke to me of the distant Terran homeworld of Earth." This implies that the Terrans still know about Earth but its location is lost (''StarCraft'' manual mentions that the sleeper ships have become lost in hyperspace when an error erased the intended destination's coordinates, as well as those of Earth's, resulting in the ships going at full speed for several decades until the engines broke down). Also, the Terran Confederacy uses the same flag as the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]]. Also, in the [http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html Zodiac] series by Romina Russell, it states that "history tells us the original human colonizers came from a distant and long-gone planet called Earth, and they traveled through a portal in Helios to get here—but the portal is just another myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html|title=Zodiac Beginnings|last=Russell|first=Romina|date=14 February 2017|website=Zodiac Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Destruction'''
{{See also|:Category:Apocalyptic fiction}}
:*Earth could have been completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, but its location (or at least its former location) is well known. This last scenario is also popular, and was featured in the movie ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', as well as in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. There is an example of a devastated uninhabitable Earth in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1973 novel ''[[To Die in Italbar]]''.
*'''Not mentioned'''
**Some works, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and many [[fantasy]] works, never mention the Earth at all (although a proposed novel, [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s ''[[Alien Exodus]]'', would have linked Earth to the ''Star Wars'' universe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwriter.com/alienout.htm George Lucas's ''Monsters and Aliens'', Volume 1: ''Alien Exodus'' — Outline by Robert J. Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In some ''Star Wars'' works, Earth (also known as Urthha) exist, such as the ''Star Wars''-''[[Indiana Jones]]'' non-canonical comic strip ''Into the Great Unknown'' (published in ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'' #19), in the also non-canonical Disney's ''[[Star Tours|Star Tours: The Adventure Continue]]'' ride, in other two non-canonical works, and in ''Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas''.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the author to operate in a realm unfamiliar and otherworldly to the reader or to explore contentious issues and historical themes in an otherwise entirely alien environment, giving the work a radically different perspective. In the ''[[Homeworld]]'' games for example, Earth's existence is unknown – and indeed entirely immaterial – as the games take place in a different galaxy altogether (specifically the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]]). However, judging by the appearance of members of the Kushan/Hiigaran people, most notably Karan S'jet, Hiigaran biology is at least outwardly similar, if not identical, to human biology.

==Earth as presented in various works==
* In the [[H. G. Wells]] story ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', perhaps the first depiction of an alien invasion in fiction, Earth is simply a neighboring planet of the inhabitants of Mars. With their world coming into its end, they target the younger and richer Earth for migration. This plot is repeated with varying degrees of differences in many of its adaptations, but Earth's place largely remains the same. The notable exception is in the television series ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'', where the aliens look to Earth for more specific reasons, as it features many of their old world's characteristics (such as both being the third planet in their respective systems, the number 3 playing a large role in their beliefs).
* ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]'' - ''[[Earth]]'' is the home to the UNSA (United Nations Space Alliance) and Earth is attacked by the Settlement Defense Front, resulting in Earth's defenses compromised.
* In the [[anime]] series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', Earth has become a backwater wasteland after a horrific accident caused one of the jumpgates that humans used to travel the Solar System to explode, destroying part of the Moon and causing the destroyed bits to rain down on the Earth.
* The ''[[Gundam]]'' anime often depicts a war between Earth against the [[space colonization|space colonies]] established by humans in [[outer space]].
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'', Earth (known as [[Thulcandra]]) is part of the [[Field of Arbol]]: and is the subject of an interplanetary [[blockade]] — hence its name, the Silent Planet.
* In ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', [[Tuxedo Mask]] protects Earth and holds the Golden Crystal.
* In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', Earth has been united into a single geopolitical entity, [[The World State]].
* In [[David Weber]]'s ''[[Honorverse]]'', Earth is the capital planet of the [[Solarian League]], the largest and wealthiest political institution ever created by man. Prior to the League's creation, a large portion of humanity departed for other planets and solar systems in what came to be known as the [[Diaspora]], leaving those who remained to rebuild from the effects of pollution, resource exhaustion, and the cataclysmic Final War. They did so, and Earth once again became the political, economic, and cultural center of humanity.
* The Earth also plays a major part in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' universe. It is where humans come from and expand out of to create numerous Empires, being invaded by many different aliens through all of its history. Having a weather control station on the moon by 2070, by the year 200,000, the Earth is in the middle of the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. By the year 5,000,000,000, humanity is spread all across the stars and has fully integrated themselves with the rest of the universe. Shortly after the destruction of Earth, Humanity regroups and colonized a new planet, naming it New Earth. Humans go to live on to the end of the Universe.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' Earth, known as Terra ([[Latin]] for Earth), is the home world of Humanity and the capital of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium of Man]]. By the 41st Millennium, it has become an [[ecumenopolis]]. It is the site of the Golden Throne, where the God-Emperor resides. Its soil is utterly barren and its atmosphere is a fog of pollution. Massive, labyrinthine edifices sprawl across the vast majority of the surface. Its oceans have long ago boiled away. Many mountain ranges have been leveled, perhaps all but the Himalayas, due to the laboratories said to be underneath and the Astronomican that lays within them. Beneath hundreds of layers of urban accretion, catacombs hold older cultures, completely different from the surface ones. A poor civilization lives and dies, without ever seeing the surface. A square meter of land on Terra costs more than a palace on any Hive World; only the most wealthy can even afford to own a small section of land.
* In the [[Noon Universe]], [[Earth (Noon Universe)|Earth]] is a Utopian world of immense power and the initial home planet of all [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]] scattered over the Universe.
* In the alternate future universe of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', Earth has been divided into two twin worlds — technology-driven [[Stark (The Longest Journey)|Stark]], the world as we know it, and the magic world of [[Arcadia (The Longest Journey)|Arcadia]] for over 13 millennia.
* In [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'', [[The Stainless Steel Rat]] travels to Earth, 1975, and then to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] France, to stop a madman known as He from destroying the timeline.  The Rat and his contemporaries in the series show confusion over the name of the world, hedging by calling it either "Earth" or "Dirt".
* In the animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Earth is the center of the Homeworlds, the core of both Human and Neosapien Empires (at different times).
* In the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' film series, Earth is still the main home of humanity even though humans have begun to colonise other worlds. It is also the HQ of the ruthless [[megacorp]]oration "[[Weyland-Yutani]]". Nothing is seen of the planet itself in the primary four ''Alien'' films, with the exception of shots of the planet from orbit, and some shots of Paris in the special edition of ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' which depicts the city as a ruined, possibly post-holocaust landscape. By the time of ''Resurrection'', which is set in the 24th century, Earth as a whole is considered to be an unpleasant, polluted planet that even hardened mercenaries prefer to avoid. Upon learning of their impending arrival there, Johner (one of the film's character portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]]) remarks "Earth, man...what a shithole."
* The television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' differs from the usual portrayal of Earth as a dominant power in galactic civilization. The series' [[Systems Commonwealth]] was founded thousands of years in the past by the [[Vedran]] species in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], with Earth joining in the 22nd century. Humans go on to become a major player in the Commonwealth, but Earth itself has no special importance (although the final two episodes of the series [[retcon]] this). Following the fall of the Commonwealth, Earth becomes one of many [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]] slave worlds. Earth was eventually liberated, but the [[Spirit of the Abyss]] destroyed the planet.
* In the video game universe of ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', Earth is the center of all human government, military and technology. Earth and its colonies are governed by the UNSC, or the [[United Nations Space Command]]. During the Human–Covenant War, the Cole Protocol was implemented, stating that ships must self-destruct rather than let the Covenant find the location of Earth. Furthermore, any ship heading to Earth must take several random slipspace jumps rather than head straight for it. On October 20, 2552, Earth was attacked by the Covenant and successfully defended by the UNSC Military after a month-long battle.
* In the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, Earth is ruled by a [[fascism|fascistic]] government called the [[United Earth Directorate]]. When the UED becomes aware of the presence of aliens hostile to humanity in the far away Koprulu Sector, it sends a large [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] to defeat the aliens, conquer the sector, and reintegrate the banished [[Terran (StarCraft)|human colonists]] who reside there into its political fold. The Directorate's initial progress in the sector was promising, as it managed to invade and conquer the main planets of both the [[Terran Dominion]] and the bizarre alien [[Zerg]], in the process kidnapping the [[Zerg Overmind]] and using it to control most of the Zerg swarms. The rogue Zerg leader [[Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] waged a clever and highly successful war to rid the sector of the Earth's control, aided in part by temporary Terran and Protoss allies. The end result for Earth's forces was a crushing defeat which amounted to the loss of all ships in the Koprulu Sector. As of the events of ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'', there remain a few isolated pockets of UED fleet survivors scattered throughout the Koprulu sector. It is unclear if the UED is planning to return to the war-torn area.
* In author [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'', Earth is the heart of an economical empire, its biosphere wrecked by global warming to such an extent that any unfortified structure would be torn apart in a matter of days by colossal, super-sized versions of modern tropical hurricanes. The entire sprawling human population is forced to live in arcologies protected against the so-called "Armada Storms". Whilst Earth represents a significant political and industrial power base, it is nonetheless an independent state and not the head of the series' [[Confederation]]. Physically, Earth is dominated by massive Arcologies that cover most of the major urban centers of our time, including London, New York and [[Johannesburg]]. There are also several equatorial [[space elevator]]s that allow for transit into orbit, where the planet is surrounded by an ''[[Gerard K. O'Neill|O'Neill]] Halo'', a collection of captured asteroids providing habitation and raw materials as well as docking and strategic defense units. Earth is sometimes referred to as "The fortress world" due to the enormous fleet of space warship's surrounding it in order to protect the vital industrial facilities of the ''O'Neill Halo''.
* In the [[Metroid (series)|''Metroid'' series]], Samus's birthplace K-2L was a colony of Earth.  However at the formation of the Galactic Federation, in the year 2000 C.C. (Cosmic Calendar), it can be assumed that Earth's resources were absorbed into the federation.
* In the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' universe, Earth is the capital of the [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]], which spends much of the time period covered in the published media (from the middle to the end of the 27th century) locked in an interstellar war with the [[Kilrathi Empire]]. The Confederation was founded in the aftermath of the collapse of the World Economic Consortium.
* In the ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' series, Earth is much as in the real world until Rhodan, that Earth's first man on the moon, discovers a wrecked starship from the ancient Arkonide Empire. Using the technology and the help of the surviving Arkonides, Rhodan forces the Earth to unite under his leadership, and begins to explore the galaxy while carefully concealing the location of Earth from enemies such as the Arkonide Empire. Later in the series, Earth under the now-immortal Rhodan becomes a major player in the universe, establishing a benevolent empire. During an invasion of the Milkyway by the ''Laren'', Earth and the Moon with its 20 billion inhabitants are supposed to be teleported to a different system, but accidentally end up in the bridge between two collided galaxies (called ''Maelstrom of Stars'') and moved into orbit about a star. 120 years later the system falls into a giant energy vortex and is again transported to another galaxy, and most of the humans in it become part of the ''superintelligence IT''. Another five years later, IT transports Earth and Moon back into the Solar System, and they are repopulated.
* In the anime and manga series ''[[Trigun]]'' it is revealed that through constant pollution and humanity living beyond its means that the Earth had to be evacuated after becoming uninhabitable. The humans fled in cryogenic suspension with only a small skeleton crew operating their fleet called Project Seeds to search for a new homeworld. Upon crashing on the planet Gunsmoke, any advanced technology from the days of Earth is referred to as lost technology.
* In Phillip Reeves's ''[[Mortal Engines Quartet]]'' (known as the ''Hungry City Chronicles'' in the US), Earth has been ravaged by a conflict known as the Sixty Minute War, which was soon followed by earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a brief ice age, leaving Earth forever changed. Europe is known as the "Great Hunting Ground" as where most [[Traction Cities]] are found, North America is known as the "Dead Continent" and South America's [[isthmus]] has been cut off due to 'Slow Bombs'.
* In Dan Simmons's ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' series, Old Earth is believed to have been destroyed by ''The Big Mistake of '08'' (in which a miniature black hole was dropped into it), but later shown to have been spirited away by 'other' beings of godlike abilities and consciousness.
* In the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' film, astronauts attempt to leave the [[Solar System]] for the first time, aiming for [[Alpha Centauri]]. However, unexplained phenomena cause their small vessel to change course while the crew is in [[cryopreservation|cryostasis]]. They wake upon landing on an inhabitable but harsh planet that they later learn is a future Earth, dominated by sapient [[ape]]s. However, in the original [[Pierre Boulle]] novel and the [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|2001 film]], both of the same name, the astronauts find civilizations of apes on another planet, but suffer a rude shock upon returning to Earth, finding it besieged by apes.
* In the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' series of [[first-person shooter]]s, a modern-day research facility opens a portal storm between Earth and the border world Xen. The portal storm floods the planet with aliens from that world, and is kept open by a creature named [[Nihilanth]]. A scientist named [[Gordon Freeman]] manages to reach the creature and take it down, unknowingly freeing one of the races that traveled to Earth by the portal storms. The portal storm awakes the Combine Empire, which then manages to conquer Earth in just seven hours, after its military had been crippled by beings from Xen. Two decades after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon Freeman succeeds in cutting Earth off of the Combine Empire and a device that suppressed human reproduction, leading to a renewed fight between the native population and the trapped Combine forces.
* In the [[massively multiplayer online game]] ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'', Earth is shown in the near future as having been attacked by a force known as the Bane. Hopelessly outmatched, it is revealed that Earth's various governments haven't been caught completely off guard and rather than mount a suicidal defense, have chosen to abandon the planet using wormhole portals built using alien technology to evacuate as many people as they could to other planets so the human race can regroup and launch a counterattack at the Bane. The ultimate fate of Earth, and those that were left behind, was unknown, with many thinking it was lost forever. It was later discovered Earth had been conquered and converted into a large staging area for the Bane which left the planet in bad shape.
* In the video game ''[[Xenosaga]]'', the Earth has been abandoned by humanity for at least 4,000 years, because the Earth has disappeared altogether from physical space. Humans refer to the planet as "Lost Jerusalem".
* In the video game ''[[FreeSpace]]'' Earth serves as the capital of the Galactic Terran Alliance. During the war against the Shivans, a last-ditch attack in subspace saves the planet from destruction, but at the cost of collapsing the [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] node that allows access to the system. By the end of ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'', Earth is still sealed off and has had no contact with the outside systems for 32 years, but the Alliance is hopeful they have found a way to restore travel to the Sol system.
* In the ''[[AT-43]]'' universe, Earth, known as "Sol III" was the home planet of the humans who became the Therian faction. In this future, Earth was destroyed (after the Therians recklessly used up its resources) and the debris was used to form a [[Dyson sphere]] around the [[Sun]].
* In ''[[Little Fuzzy]]'', Earth is referred to as Terra, and is the center of a multi-planetary system, spanning many galaxies most likely.
* In the ''[[Funky Koval]]'' comic series, most events take place on 2080s Earth which is very similar to our own. However it is rather ruled by global corporations (Stellar Fox Syndicate is notable example) than political bodies like UN. Earth is also on the verge of wide galactic explorations with possess ion of subspace flight technology and maintain contact with at least two alien species: The Droll and Ancusans.
* In the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' manga, Mamoru Chiba is the representative of Earth taking the place of a Sailor Soldier and becoming Tuxedo Kamen. (Tuxedo Mask)
* In the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series of video games, Earth is the industrial, economic and cultural capital of the human Systems Alliance; however, the military and political capital is at [[Arcturus]], 36 light years from Earth. As of 2183, when the game is set, Earth is looked upon as a near Utopian world, for it has been mentioned that Earth has reached a "New Golden Age". However, there is still violent weather due to environmental damages of the 21st century. But since developing faster-than-light travel among other advanced technologies, there have been  significant improvements to the state of the planet. The Systems Alliance itself is regarded as a sleeping giant, and humanity has quickly established itself as one of the most important and powerful races in the galaxy. Earth, like a number of other planets in the Mass Effect series, is attacked at the onset of the Reaper War and suffers catastrophic damage due to it being the focal point of the war, resulting in huge losses of life and many cities left in ruins, though it is implied that Earth is subsequently repaired in time.
* In his work ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', French author [[Jules Verne]] presented the concept of a hollow center of the planet inhabited by prehistoric beings. The secrets of this region were explored by a group of travelers from the surface.
* In the science fiction novel ''The Last Train out of Existence'' by Volarion Wendsar, Earth is described as having reached a period of societal stagnation thanks to the development of 'holographic cellular phones'. The Earth continues to remain in this indefinite state of stagnation until a fleet commandeered by an admiral known as Kress Milligan commits a nuclear genocide against the humans of Earth, most of whom are obliterated. The government of the galaxy, the Galactic Ascendancy, forbids any travel to and from the Earth and its star system, and quells any attempts at violating this, including destroy the ship of archaeologist Arord Trialens before he can reach the surface to conduct an expedition.

===''Battlestar Galactica''===
The overarching plot in both the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]] and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' is the quest to find Earth, which is thought to be the location of the lost thirteenth colony of [[Kobol]]. Colonial history dictates that [[Kobol]] is the homeworld of all humanity, and that the Thirteen Tribes of Kobol fled that world thousands of years earlier, with twelve tribes founding the Twelve Colonies and the thirteenth heading to Earth. Both shows are similar in that the location of Earth is initially unknown, but clues to its location are gradually discovered by the refugee fleet from the [[Twelve Colonies]]. In both series, the exodus of the Thirteen Tribes took place so far in the past that most modern Colonials have come to assume that the stories of Earth are simply religious myths.

====Original series====
In the original series, several clues indicate that the existence of Earth is real. On the prison planet of Proteus, [[Lieutenant Starbuck|Starbuck]] encounters drawings of star systems on the wall of a cell once occupied by a mysterious prisoner. The star charts turn out to be that of the [[Solar System]]. Additionally, when the ''Galactica'' later reaches a planet called Terra, it is inhabited by humans who use Earth units of measurement (hours, minutes, etc.) rather than Colonial units of measurement, suggesting that it was settled by members of the lost Thirteenth Tribe thousands of years earlier on their way to Earth.

In ''[[Galactica 1980]]'', a continuation of the original series, the fleet did eventually discover Earth as it was in 1980.

====Re-imagined series====
In the Season Three finale of the re-imagined series, [[Kara Thrace]] returns to ''Galactica'' after her apparent death, claiming to have been to Earth and intending to lead the fleet there. The camera then pans out from the fleet to view the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and then zooms back in to show Earth, confirming the existence of the planet. In the Season Four mid-season finale episode "Revelations", the fleet finally reaches Earth, only to discover that it is a lifeless, radioactive wasteland.

In "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", it is revealed that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of humanoid and mechanical Cylons of a type previously unknown. It is also revealed that the final five Cylons had previously lived on Earth 2000 years in the past, when a [[nuclear war]] devastated the planet.

In the final episode, a [[twist ending]] shows ''Galactica'' reaching our Earth, 150,000 years ago. The Colonials and the Cylons they've made peace with decide to call their new world "Earth" due to the hope associated with the name of the now devastated planet the Thirteenth Tribe once inhabited. They then abandon their technology and live among the new Earth's native [[Hominini]]. 150,000 years later, in the present day, the remains of [[Mitochondrial Eve]] – a Colonial human/Cylon hybrid (named [[Hera Agathon]]) whose birth and destiny had been a major plot element of the series – are discovered.

===''Buck Rogers''===
In most variations on the ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' mythos (comic strip, TV series, feature film), Earth of the 25th century (where the action takes place) is recovering from various atomic wars, usually variations on [[World War III]]. In the original comic, [[Mongols]] have taken over the Earth; in the [[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|TV series]], the Draconian Empire fills this role (although the Draconians are obviously based on Mongols). Most of Earth's cities lie in ruins, although rebuilding is in progress (Earth's capital is New Chicago; other cities include New Paris, New London etc.). The second season of the TV series revealed that much of Earth's population fled the planet in the wake of the atomic war and founded colonies in deep space; the Earth ship ''Searcher'' is dispatched to investigate.

===''Buffyverse''===
In [[Joss Whedon]]'s [[Buffyverse]], established by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', Earth is one of several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]; the term "Earth" is used both to refer to the specific planet and to the dimension the planet exists in as a whole. Born from the Seed of Wonder, the source of all [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], Earth originated as a world of [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Demons]], and was ruled over by the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]] during a time known as the Primordium Age. Eventually, however, the human race rose up and fought back against the Old Ones, banishing them to other dimensions.

===''CoDominium''===
In [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s ''[[CoDominium]]'' series (now largely [[alternate history]]) the Earth comes under the control of the CoDominium, an alliance between the United States and [[Soviet Union]], in the year 1990. The CoDominium imposes its control over all other nations of the Earth, halting scientific development and warfare. The CoDominium is ruled by a Grand Senate located on the Moon, and eventually constructs interstellar colonies for the joint goal of economic gain and a means of exiling troublesome elements of society. Eventually in 2103, the CoDominium dissolves, with the US and USSR engaging in the nuclear "Great Patriotic Wars" which destroy almost all of Earth (it is mentioned that [[Jamaica]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean Alps]] are untouched).

The CD Space Navy escapes to the planet Sparta, which eventually becomes the nucleus of the "Empire of Man". During the Empire's Formation Wars the Earth is once more hit hard, but is eventually incorporated into the Imperium as the "honorary capital." When the Empire dissolves in the Secession Wars in the 27th century, Earth is once more subjected to nuclear attacks, but by the early 31st century has been reclaimed by the Second Empire. By that time, the Earth city of "New Annapolis" is a training center for the Imperial Space Navy. To inhabitants of planets newly contacted, such as [[CoDominium#Planets of the CoDominium and the Empire of Man|Prince Samual's World]] in "[[King David's Spaceship]]", the condition of the still largely desolate Earth is presented as an object lesson for the prohibitive price of war and a justification for Empire's claim to universal rule.

===''Dragon Ball''===
In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series, Earth is the primary setting and one of many planets in the North Galaxy. The planet is inhabited by humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, and demons, among others. ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s Earth features heavy [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]], such as [[humanoid robot]]s and flying cars, as well as heavy magical influence.

===''Dune''===
In [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series of novels, [[Earth]] is referred to as ''Old Earth / Old Terra'' by the time of the original novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (at least 21,500 years in the future). The [[Sun]] is called Al-Lat, and humanity had populated many planets (among them [[Caladan]], [[Giedi Prime]] and [[Salusa Secundus]]). In the time of [[Paul Atreides]], the Earth is an uninhabited and largely forgotten land, shrouded in legend. In ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', Paul refers to [[Hitler]] and [[Genghis Khan]], in comparing the destructiveness of his [[Jihad]] to their wars. It is a wilderness and recovering an ecosystem of its own as humans have abandoned it. The artifacts of ''Homo sapiens'' have for the most part crumbled back into the planet, though a more than casual observer can find many traces of the old civilizations.

Paul's son, the God Emperor [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]], refers to the Earth many times in his journals. The God Emperor seemed particularly fond of the ancestors he had from the Western sections of [[Eurasia]]. He makes references to [[Israel]], [[Urartu]], (also called [[Armenia]]), [[Edom]], [[Damascus]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Babylon]], [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]], [[Umlias]], the plains of Central Asia, and the [[Greeks]]; the [[House Atreides#Relationship to Greek mythology|family name]] refers to their descent from [[Atreus]]. He seems to have had ancestors among the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] or the [[Mongols]] as he says that one of his memories involves a horse plain with felt [[yurt]]s. Leto also has the memories of a famous politician from the United States whose name was [[Jacob Broom]]. In the book Children of Dune, Leto II mentions an ancestor named [[Agamemnon]], and makes reference to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.

In ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', it is noted that the [[Bene Gesserit]] Mother Superior [[List of Dune Bene Gesserit#Taraza|Taraza]] has the preserved [[Vincent van Gogh]] painting ''[[Thatched Cottages at Cordeville|Cottages at Cordeville]]'' hanging in her room.

In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], set in the Dune universe, it is revealed that at the beginning of mankind's war with the Machines, called the [[Butlerian Jihad]], Earth had been devastated by humans themselves using [[atomics (Dune)|atomics]] in an attack on the Machines. In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] series, also by Herbert and Anderson, it is mentioned that certain [[Claude Monet|Monet]] and [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] paintings are owned by [[House Vernius]], and hang in the Grand Palais at [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]].

===''Firefly''===
In the [[Joss Whedon]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', Earth is long since abandoned. It is referred to with awe as "Earth-that-Was", having been abandoned centuries ago due to overpopulation and depletion of the planet's natural resources. After fleeing the planet, the remnants of humanity traveled in [[generation ship]]s for decades (many humans lived their entire lives within a spaceship's walls) until finding a new star system. Collection of Earth-that-Was artifacts is a hobby for the rich, and ancient Earth artifacts are known to be very valuable.

It is unknown whether Earth has actually been destroyed, or if the planet still physically exists; in the feature film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', ancient starships are shown leaving a sickly brown Earth with gray oceans, but the fate of the planet is never fully revealed. A puppet show in the episode "[[Heart of Gold (Firefly)|Heart of Gold]]" implies that Earth has in fact been obliterated, but this was never actually confirmed on screen.

===''Asimov's future histories''===
In much of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fiction, the [[Earth (Foundation universe)|future Earth]] is an underprivileged planet — impoverished, overcrowded and disease-ridden — which is regarded with disdain by the arrogant [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacers]] of the "Outer Planets" (at this stage, there are about fifty of them).

In the [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the inhabitants of these planets are still aware that their ancestors came from Earth, but this does not make them fond of the place. Rather, they develop a racist theory by which "the best strains" had left Earth to colonize the other planets and left "the inferior strains" behind. However, they have no choice but to ask the help of the protagonist, a detective from the despised Earth, to solve murder mysteries which baffle their own police. Afterwards, Earth embarks on a major new campaign of space colonization, with the hope that the new colonists will prove more faithful to the Mother Planet than the earlier ones. However, in the end of the series, the Earth is doomed to a slow radioactive process that will leave the planet uninhabitable, causing a more rapid expansion of colonization from Earth.

In the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Galactic Empire'' series]], taking place thousands of years later (originally conceived as completely separate but made by Asimov in his later career into the direct sequel of the Robot Period), Earth and settlements from it are still clearly remembered in ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]]''. By the time of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'', Earth is ruled by Trantor, not yet a Galactic Empire. Its status as the original homeworld of humanity is now disputed.

In ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', we see Earth in the early days of the Empire of [[Trantor]]. Earth has a largely radioactive crust with only patches of habitable land in between, and its people have to undergo compulsory [[euthanasia]] at the age of 60. It is a backwater province, and among inhabitants of other planets there is a prevalent prejudice known as "Anti-Terrestrialism", (obviously modeled on [[antisemitism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}), with the main negative stereotype having to do with the radiation-induced diseases prevalent on Earth.

By this time, Earth people still believe themselves to be the original home of Humanity, but hardly anyone else shares this belief. Fanatical priests, based in a mysterious Temple erected on the ruins of Washington, D.C., cultivate the mystique of Earth's ancient glories and conceive a plot to spread a Terrestrial disease throughout the Galaxy and in this way take over the Empire (and incidentally, act out the stereotype). The plot is foiled by a middle-aged tailor from the Twentieth Century, who possess powerful psychic abilities as a result of experiments performed upon him when he arrived in the future.  Schwartz, the tailor, is often described as being Jewish, though this is never stated within the novel.

By the time of the Galactic Empire's decline, [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] is vaguely remembered as 'Sol' in ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', and only one candidate for being the Original World.  In ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', records of Earth are missing, so two citizens of the mature Foundation go looking for it, and eventually find that it is desolated by nuclear radiation.  The only sentient being remaining in the Solar system is robot Daneel Olivaw, who resides in a small station on the moon, overseeing the progress of a humanity now spread throughout the galaxy.

===''Hainish Cycle''===
In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Hainish Cycle]] our Earth is referred to as Terra. Like all [[Planets of the Hainish Cycle|human worlds of the Hainish Cycle]], Terra was populated by the humans of Hain in Earth's prehistory, but forgot our common ancestry after millennia of no contact from extraterrestrial humans after the collapse of the first Hainish interplanetary civilization.

The second period of contact with the interstellar Hainish community, now organized as "The League Of All Worlds" is described in ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', and ''[[Rocannon's World]]''. In ''The Dispossessed'', Terra's population is said to have fallen from 9 billion to only half a billion people due to a collapse of the Terran ecology, and that life has only survived there because of strict rationing of resources and help from the Hainish. In ''The Word for World Is Forest'', the people from Terra appear as reckless exploiters of other planets. Some time later, ''[[City of Illusions]]'' provides a detailed description of Terra in the depths of a second era of isolation, called "The Age Of The Enemy".

The post-apocalyptic Earth seen in ''City of Illusions'' shows signs of an advanced, abandoned civilization under a rewilded landscape. A small number of humans live in tiny, isolated settlements where they retain some technologies from the past but are completely cut off from any communication with neighboring regions or with other worlds. There is only one city with high technology and energy-intensive construction, and it is controlled by the alien conquerors of the League. The events of ''City of Illusions'' lead to the third period of Terran contact with other worlds, this time as the Ekumen, during which ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' takes place.

In the short story "Dancing To Ganam," which takes place in the far future of the Hainish universe, it is said that an extreme religious movement called the Unists developed on Terra and engaged in mass slaughter of non-believers and then of rival Unists sects. It is described as "the worst resurgence of theocratic violence since the Time of Pollution". It unclear if this time of pollution refers to the [[ecological collapse]] described in ''The Dispossesed,'' the collapse seen in ''City Of Illusions'', or is another unexplored dark period on Terra. In any case, the inclusion of this story is meant to show that even after so many millennia in the League and the Ekumen, Terra is still in many ways culturally primitive and prone to violent self-destruction.

Various individuals from Terra play a part in other stories. In ''[[The Telling]]'', Terra's incorporation into the Ekumen is briefly explained. Also, the main character in ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' is from Terra.

===''Hitchhiker's Guide''===
In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]], the [[Earth (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Earth]] is destroyed by a Vogon Constructor Fleet to make room for a hyperspace bypass.  One of two surviving Earthmen, [[Arthur Dent]], is affronted and dismayed to find that his planet's entry in the Guide consists of one word: "Harmless".  [[Ford Prefect]], a researcher for the Guide attempts (and fails) to placate him by informing him that he has written a more extensive article for the next edition, although the result of merciless editing of his original draft has reduced his version considerably, now reading "Mostly harmless".  Dent also learns that the Earth was originally constructed by the inhabitants of the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], as a giant supercomputer built to find the Question to [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|the Ultimate Answer of Life, The Universe and Everything]].  The computer was so large that it was often mistaken for a planet, and that it was destroyed five minutes before the program was due to complete (after ten million years of running).  It also mentions that humans are descended from the passengers of an ark full of unwanted middlemen (hairdressers, telephone sanitizers, advertising executives and the like), tricked into leaving their own planet behind by spurious tales of impending destruction invented by the rest of the planet's civilization (it is mentioned that the population was then wiped out by a disease contracted from a dirty telephone).  The Earth was located in Galactic sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.  An alternate version of Earth is the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#NowWhat|NowWhat]], which occupies the same space as Earth, but not the same probability. In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|2005 film adaptation]], a new Earth replaces the old one, and everything is restored to the moments leading up to its destruction, except for one thing: Arthur Dent is not part of the planet anymore, at his own request.

===''Red Dwarf''===
In the series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', Earth is seen mainly as the goal of the crew's trip; [[Dave Lister]] is personally obsessed with revisiting it as his home world, especially since he is the only character to be from there as [[Arnold Rimmer]] was born on [[Io (moon)|Io]]. The novel ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' mentions the Earth, despite Lister's regard for it, as suffering from massive littering and environmental damage; with a giant [[toupee]] being installed to in order to cover up [[ozone depletion]]. The novel ''[[Better Than Life]]'', however, mentions Earth being voted out of inhabitability to be the solar system's chosen planet of refuse known as Garbage World. A [[methane]] build up "farts" the planet out of the system and sends it out into deep space where it becomes an ice planet; later moved and thawed by the actions of the crew of ''Red Dwarf''. The Earth is inhabited by giant [[cockroach]]es and the descendants of [[GELF]]s sent there as punishment for their rebellion and bred into the [[GELF#The Polymorph|polymorph]]. Lister spends half a lifetime trapped there attempting to correct his species past actions before ''Red Dwarf'' can rescue him due to [[black hole]] [[time dilation]]. In ''[[Last Human]]'' a parallel Earth is doomed by the initiatives of Earth President John Milhous [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and humanity breeds GELFs and [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|simulants]] to terraform a new home across the multi-[[dimension]]al omni-zone.

===''Stargate''===
In the ''[[Stargate]]'' television series, Earth (designation: ''P2X-3YZ'') is described as one of countless inhabited worlds, and is revealed to be the original home world of humans all over the galaxy. In ancient history many groups of humans were kidnapped and enslaved by powerful alien races, primarily the [[Goa'uld]]. Others remained to form present day Earth societies, which interact covertly with other extraterrestrial races and civilizations, many of them human. Earth first became important in the scene after the [[Alterans]] occupied it as their new capital (its name was Terra at that point). When they were forced to relocate to Lantea in the Pegasus galaxy (several million years ago), they "seeded" the planet with a less advanced form of themselves. Eventually, the Goa'uld found the planet and determined that the human body is the ultimate host body for their parasitic race. Many humans were kidnapped through the Stargate the Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] brought to Earth (Earth already had its own Stargate in Antarctica but it was inoperable) but the leftover population wasn't touched; they eventually rebelled and drove the Goa'uld off the planet in 3000 BC. About 8000 BC, the Lantean remnants returned to the planet but the primitive civilization extinguished their last hope of rebuilding their once great civilization due to the presence of the Goa'uld; as such, the Ancients slowly died out or [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascended]] since their numbers were too small to survive, even by crossbreeding with regular humans.

With Earth largely left alone for millennia, its human population continued to advance until the rediscovery of the Stargate in 1928 and its subsequent reactivation in 1994 (since its DHD activation device was missing, they had been unable to determine its purpose until they were able to create a computer interface). Unlike an enormous majority of planets, the Stargate on Earth was kept secret from the general populace to prevent widespread panic because "we are not alone".

Humans who are from Earth are referred to as the [[Tau'ri]] by most other life forms in the galaxy, including the [[Goa'uld]]. Earth is a relatively important player on account of the radical change it unwittingly brought about when troops under the command of Colonel [[Jack O'Neill]] killed Goa'uld Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and started a guerrilla war against the Goa'uld. However, its importance pales in comparison to the power of the [[System Lords]] or the [[Free Jaffa Nation]], even though after the extinction of the Asgard and the defeat of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], the Tau'ri became the dominant race of known space — although they were initially at a huge technological disadvantage, they later managed to reverse-engineer Goa'uld technology to the point where they started building their own ships, though much of it was rendered obsolete when the Asgard granted a significant amount of non-weapon technology. The Tau'ri also created remarkable technological feats, such as fighters equipped with hyperdrives powered by an unstable isotope. Their power increased further when they discovered that, due to crossbreeding with Ancients before their extinction, some Earth-born humans actually possessed a unique gene required to operate some of the more advanced Ancient technology. The peak of their power occurred when the Asgard donated their entire technological knowledge to Earth prior to their extinction. With this and some Ancient technology, the Tau'ri actually surpassed their precursors and defeated the Ori.

The main interaction between Earth and the rest of the universe is via three organizations:

*  The '''[[International Oversight Advisory]]''' (IOA) coordinates funds and control between the nations of the Earth [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]; the [[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis Expedition]] was sent to the Pegasus Galaxy under its authority. The key players are the Big Five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the People's Republic of China, and the [[Russia]]n Federation; also important are [[Canada]], on account of its [[Canada – United States relations|special relationship with the United States]] and the services of Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], and other nations, such as Japan, Australia, and Germany, which have also been involved; Germany in particular has sent security personnel to [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]].
* '''[[Stargate Command]]''', under the control of the IOA and operated by the [[United States Air Force]], conducts off-world missions of diplomacy, tactical strikes, research and exploration. Control of the Stargate is a constant bone of contention with the Chinese, who take every opportunity to express their displeasure at the situation at IOA meetings where the future of Stargate Command is an issue (even though their off-world allies are satisfied with the current situation). Nevertheless, the SGC remains the primary interface between the humans of Earth and the outside world, including the galactic human diaspora.
* '''The Atlantis Expedition''' is based in the still sea- and space-worthy [[Atlantis (Stargate)|city-ship]] of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]].  An international team, with [[Tau'ri characters in Stargate Atlantis|personnel from at least 23 countries]], interacts with the other humans of the Pegasus Galaxy (seeded by the Ancients, not taken by the [[Goa'uld]]) and the dangerous [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]].  They rely on a mixture of Ancient and Earth technology and were originally based on Lantea until they were forced to relocate to M35-117. The expedition is currently suspended as Atlantis remains on Earth until repairs are completed after its most recent clash with the Wraith.

===''Star Trek''===
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the unified human state based on Earth, was one of the founding members of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Several major [[federation|federal]] organizations are headquartered on Earth, such as the Federation Council which meets in Paris. The Federation President also keeps offices in Paris, and [[Starfleet]] Headquarters is located in San Francisco. Major events on Earth included first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] (''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''), barely averted attacks by the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] (in "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" and ''Star Trek: First Contact''), Founder infiltration ("[[Homefront (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Homefront]]"), and [[List of fictional revolutions and coups#Star Trek|numerous attempted coups]]. Like most other major Federation worlds, Earth is a near-utopia where poverty and war have been eradicated and environmental damage has been reversed. Earth was also the planet of origin for at least one other sentient species, the Voth, according to the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Distant Origin]]". Descendants of the [[hadrosaurid]]æ, they are theorized to have fled Earth for the [[Delta Quadrant]] after an [[extinction event]].

In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]", we learn that the name of the planet's actual government is named United Earth. Much of its early history is unknown, although recent Trek novels have revealed that Earth's governments founded United Earth by signing the historic ''Traite d'Unification'' in 2123.  The episodes "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]" imply that United Earth is a [[parliamentary system]] of government: we meet various government officials who are referred to as Ministers (such as Minister Nathan Samuels, played by [[Harry Groener]]). United Earth's leader is most likely a Prime Minister – possibly, but not necessarily, Samuels himself. In the novels, Earth's governmental structure is further developed. Earth is a [[parliamentary republic]], with a separate [[head of state]] (the President) and [[head of government]] (the Prime Minister).

In the [[Mirror Universe]], Earth is the capital of the despotic Terran Empire which rules over large portions of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants and is generally seen as the most powerful interstellar empire. ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' revealed that the Empire had collapsed and fallen to a [[Klingon]]–[[Cardassian]] Alliance. ''Star Trek'' novels reveal that Earth was later liberated thanks to the efforts of anti-Alliance rebels and Memory Omega.

===''Starcraft''===
Earth is the "lost" homeland of the terrans of the Koprulu Sector, often referred to as "Old Earth". Earth history is well known to us until the 21st century.
However, by the time the 23rd century was reached, genetic engineering and cybernetics were in common use, and Earth's population had reached 23 billion. Consequently, a resource and overpopulation crisis was developing.

Earth's corporate factions who supported the capitalization of genetic engineering and cybernetics were opposed by those who saw this as a degeneration of the human race. These groups included humanist factions as well as religious conservatives who resorted to terrorism in these turbulent times. The conflict was resolved by the creation of the United Powers League, which generally supported the humanist philosophy and controlled all nations except for a few volatile Latin American states. The UPL banned many religions and made English the worldwide language.

The UPL proceeded to arrest and kill many people who opposed its "divinity of mankind" philosophy (which included "purity" from cybernetics, mutations, and so forth). It was during this time that Doran Routhe set up the colonization of the Koprulu Sector. Contact between the colonists and Earth was seemingly lost, and the Koprulu Sector terrans could not have found their way back to Earth.

With the discovery of the protoss and zerg, the United Powers League reformed to become the United Earth Directorate and launched an invasion of the Koprulu Sector, ostensibly in an effort to protect itself from the distant aliens. The invasion was repelled by a tenuous alliance of the Sector's powers.

===''Babylon 5''===
{{Main article|Earth (Babylon 5)|l1=Earth (''Babylon 5'')}}
In the universe of the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television series, Earth was located in a relatively uncontested and non-valuable portion of the Galaxy. As a result, the people of Earth were allowed to develop with relatively little outside interference or threat of invasion from alien races. Unified under the worldwide government of the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], first contact with the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] was made in the mid-22nd century, which led to trade with a number of different species.

Earth remained a relatively minor power until the 2230s, when it intervened on behalf of a number of other races (which later became the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]]) during the Dilgar invasion. Following the [[Dilgar War]], Earth began to expand its influence and was seen as a rising power in the galaxy. A disastrous [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with the [[Minbari]] in the 2240s precipitated the [[Earth–Minbari War]], in which Earth was nearly conquered: the military ([[EarthForce]]) was devastated and the planet's population was nearly annihilated. However, the Minbari mysteriously surrendered just prior to the final invasion of Earth.

Following the war, Earth's major contribution on the galactic stage was the creation of the Babylon Stations, that are neutral trading posts and diplomatic havens. Earth turned inward and suffered from xenophobic tendencies in the late 2250s, early 2260s under the despotic regime of President [[Morgan Clark]], until a military and civilian [[civil war]], started by General William Hague and later concluded by Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]], overthrew the Clark regime and helped establish Earth as one of the major players in the [[Interstellar Alliance]].

===''Robotech / Macross''===
In the ''[[Robotech]]'' canon, based on ''[[Macross]]'', Earth is the homeworld of humanity and notable as one of the few places that "The flower of life" (the source of the powerful energy source Protoculture) can grow. In 1999 during a global war the (future) SDF-1 an alien warship crashed to Earth on Macross island. Discovering they were not alone in the universe (and in secret the fact that the SDF-1 was a warship for a giant sized alien race) the human race united and rebuilt the ship as well as using the technology to advance their own and to create a small defence fleet for earth.

Ten years later the ship was ready but as preparation for launch on a mission of exploration continued Zentradi warships arrived in orbit to search for the ship. Though humanity tried peaceful contact a booby trap in the SDF-1 fired the huge main gun at the Zentradi committing Earth to a devastating interstellar war. To lure the Zentradi away from Earth the SDF-1 attempted a space fold [[Faster-than-light|FTL jump]]. This went wrong transporting not only the SDF-1 but part of Macross Island, 70,000 civilians and two navy warships to an area near Pluto. Pressure held in sub-surface shelters long enough to evacuate the civilians while the ships were grafted on to the SDF-1 as flight decks. However the jump also caused the FTL drive to vanish (for unknown reasons) as such the SDF-1 had to return home under normal thrust fighting Zentradi all the way and unable to talk to earth due to jamming.

During the conflict many Zentradi became fascinated by Earth culture and over a million ships eventually defected. The ship finally returned to Earth but was driven back into space to draw off the Zentradi again. However the Zentradi bought over four million ships to Earth and bombarded the planet. The SDF-1 took out most ships with an overload of its shield system but in the process the ship was left incapable of flight and most of the Earth's population was killed. Over the next two years the survivors tried to rebuild and at last the Earth began to green again.

Twenty years later the Earth had recovered during the war with the Robotech masters, but even after Earth's victory the planet was then attacked and occupied by another set of aliens The Invid in 2031. The Invid collected what they could of the Protoculture on Earth but seem to have left the population (now millions once more) largely alone.

In 2042 the Robotech Mars expedition returned from deep space but was wiped out by the Invid during the battle to liberate the planet. The survivors were forced down to Earth where they hooked up with the local resistance groups.

Two years later a massive fleet arrived with more advanced technology given to them by the alien Hydenites. The Invid quickly left Earth rather than risk Earth's destruction by deadly weapons the Neutron_S missiles which were far more dangerous than man believed. As Humanity celebrated however the Hydenites were revealed as the Children of Shadow who had destroyed the Invid homeworld eons before. They launched a sneak attack on the human space station liberty. Another war then began.

===''Sonic the Hedgehog''===
In the various continuities of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise, Earth is mentioned in one way or another:

*The video game series has [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] living on Earth, specifically a United States-like [[fictional country]] known as the United Federation. It is stated in ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'' that the planet has been in an endless cycle of destruction and resurrection since time immemorial: a monster known as Dark Gaia hibernates within the Earth's core, absorbing power from the negative energies and emotions of humanity, and destroys the planet when it emerges, and its counterpart, Light Gaia (a.k.a. "Chip"), defeats it and restores the Earth. In the game's plot, [[Doctor Eggman]], hoping to use Dark Gaia's power to build his empire, breaks the planet open himself and awakens both Light and Dark Gaia ahead of schedule; as a result, Dark Gaia's body splits apart, and Light Gaia develops severe [[amnesia]].
*The [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic book]] by [[Archie Comics]] reveals that the planet of [[Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Mobius]] is actually the Earth of a distant future; an alien race known as the Xorda launched several bombs meant to exterminate humanity, but instead ended up mutating the various wildlife, giving them [[humanoid]] forms, human [[cognition]], and (in many cases) [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]].
*[[Fleetway]]'s ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'' shows Earth existing as a separate planet from Mobius; the two planets are effectively "[[Double planet|twins]]", both having near-identical [[ecosystem]]s.
*In the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], the planet Freedom (specifically the Land of Darkness) is heavily implied to be a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth. Early on in the film, Sonic and [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] are seen traveling through what appears to be the ruins of New York City.
*In the [[anime]] series ''[[Sonic X]]'', Sonic, his friends, and Eggman hail from an alternate version of Earth; Mobius and Earth were once one planet, but a cataclysmic event split the planet into two and sent what would become Mobius into another dimension. The flow of time is different on both planets; one month in Mobuis equals an entire year on Earth.

===''Super Mario''===
* According to various sources, including ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', the Mushroom Kingdom and its surrounding areas and locations are part of the "Mushroom World," a parallel version of the Earth, or "Real World." One can travel back and forth between the two dimensions through warp pipes.
* In the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|1993 live-action film]], it is stated that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] actually split Earth into two and sent them into different dimensions. The surviving [[dinosaur]]s were sent to the alternate dimension, and that world's version of the [[human]] race eventually evolved from those dinosaurs rather than [[mammal]]s. Aside from Dinohattan, a run-down parallel version of [[New York City]], the entirety of the alternate Earth is a desert wasteland.

===''Uplift''===
At least a billion years ago in the [[Uplift Universe]] by [[David Brin]], there was a semi-mythical species known as the Progenitors that started the Uplift cycle—adopting a pre-sentient race and over a period of a hundred thousand years of selective breeding and genetic engineering, raising them to full sentience.  As a result, most sentient species in the universe are members of various clans and factions, often quite powerful, with varying beliefs.

Earth was overlooked and humans evolved, evidently without a patron race.  However, by the time of first contact with galactic civilization, humans had themselves raised chimpanzees and dolphins to sentience, giving the human race a claim to patron status.  This claim is provisionally accepted by the major institutions of galactic civilization even as it is hotly contested by a number of senior patron races.

Galactic civilization holds humanity's claim of having evolved to sentience independently to be highly controversial at best, and an offensive heresy at worst. Some clans holding the latter view have actively conspired to have humanity's patron status officially vacated and to adopt the "wolfling" race themselves, thus gaining three sentient races and control of "fallow" genetic material: Earth's wealth of species with uplift potential.  Only the conservative and ponderous nature of galactic institutions and the rivalry of other clans reluctant to see the Earth's races claimed by another have prevented this.

===''Worldwar''===
In the [[Worldwar]] novels by [[Harry Turtledove]], Earth is the human homeworld and is attacked by the aliens known as The Race in 1942. All sides in the Second World War are forced to unify to fight this threat, and despite superior technology the Lizards (a human racial epithet for the aliens) are fought to a draw by 1944.

In 1962 another Race fleet arrives carrying a civilian colony force of nearly 100 million, in 1965 the Race and the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] fight a major war which Germany loses.

In 1994 humanity has caught up to the Race enough to send a slower-than-light starship to the Race's home world, where it arrives in 2031. Soon after another ship arrives, an [[Faster-than-light|FTL-capable]] ship, indicating that humanity has now surpassed the Race in technology.

===''MOTHER / EarthBound''===
* In the ''[[EarthBound|MOTHER / EarthBound]]'' video game series, Earth has different continent names and different cities but is still the same. Between 2000 and 2010, an alien known as Giygas took over the planet and destroyed most of the population. But, with the warning from a small alien from the future, a young hero named [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]] saved the world from Giygas before he could attack.
* Many thousands of years later, all the population of Earth was killed – presumably because the planet was flooded – but some people went on the [[Mother 3|Nowhere Island]] before everything was destroyed. The island was protected because it contained a great power that was sealed long ago. The survivors hid their memories in an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and created new ones, better ones so that they could have a normal life without remembering the world of before. Later in the game, Earth was again destroyed but then recreated as it was before. It is unknown if it means before the planet was flooded or before the game's tragic events.

===''Shannara''===
In the [[Shannara]] series of books by [[Terry Brooks]], the setting is a post-apocalyptic earth that was destroyed after a nuclear holocaust wiped out most of humanity and mutated the survivors into Men, Gnomes, Dwarves, and Trolls. Elves are also there, but according to Allanon's recounting of history, the Elves always existed in our current world. Before the Great Wars, as the nuclear holocaust is referred to, humans had advanced to a utopian society.

===''The Death Gate Cycle''===
In the [[Death gate cycle]] series of books by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]], a nuclear holocaust led to the creation of a two mutant strains of humans who developed fantastic magical powers. Other races, such as Dwarves and Elves were also present, even in pre-holocaust Earth, but were hidden from humanity.  In this universe, the Earth was destroyed by the Sartan, one of the magical races that evolved from humans.

A '''folk hero''' or '''national hero''' is a type of [[hero]] – real, fictional or [[mythology|mythological]] – with the sole salient characteristic being the imprinting of his or her name, personality and deeds in the popular consciousness of a [[people]]. This presence in the popular consciousness is evidenced by its historical frequency in [[Folk music|folk songs]], folk tales and other [[folklore]]; and its modern [[trope (literature)|trope]] status in literature, art and films.

[[File:Joan of Arc on horseback.png|thumb|[[Joan of Arc]] depicted on horseback in an illustration from a 1505 manuscript. The martyr and saint Joan of Arc is a national hero in France]]
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], one of [[Italy]]'s "fathers of the fatherland"]]
[[File:Portrait of Davy Crockett.jpg|thumb|[[Davy Crockett]], hero of the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]]]]
[[File:Grotepier TN.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]], a Frisian folk hero]]

Although some folk heroes are historical public figures, many are not. The lives of folk heroes are generally fictional, their characteristics and deeds often exaggerated to mythic proportions.

The folk hero often begins life as a normal person, but is transformed into someone extraordinary by significant life events, often in response to social injustice, and sometimes in response to natural disasters.

One major category of folk hero is the defender of the common people against the oppression or corruption of the established power structure.  Members of this category of folk hero often, but not necessarily, live [[outlaw|outside the law]] in some way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5336">[[Image:Gubal01-220.png|thumb|Gubal]]The '''Gubal''' is a [[musical instrument]] developed by the Swiss company ''PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.''. It is a vessel made of PANArt's patented ''Pang'', a [[Deep drawing|deep drawn]] sheet steel permeated by iron nitride needles.&lt;ref&gt;USPTO patent database: [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8,552,279.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,552,279&amp;RS=PN/8,552,279 Method for production of a metallic-sounding musical instrument]&lt;/ref&gt; Pang was developed by PANArt for [[steelpan]] construction in the middle of the 1990s. Examining the characteristics of their new material the PANArt tuners Sabina Schärer and Felix Rohner created a number of different ''Pang instruments''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paschko: [http://www.lex.hangblog.org/de/pang-instrumente.htm Pang-Instrumente]. In: Das Hanglexikon. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2001 they introduced the ''[[Hang (instrument)|Hang]]''. The Gubal was the first Pang instrument that was developed after the Hang.&lt;ref&gt;Ane Hebeisen: [https://www.derbund.ch/kultur/pop-und-jazz/die-heiler-vom-schattenhang/story/20732136 Die Heiler vom Schattenhang]. In: Der Bund, 20 April 2017. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in Summer 2013 on occasion of the 20th anniversary of PANArt. The name Gubal is registered as trademark for musical instruments by PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO ROMARIN database: [http://www.wipo.int/romarin/mark-detail.xhtml;jsessionid=23C128BB724575B5872DBD04449C2C84 International Registration Number 1176482]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gubal has some similarities to the Hang but also some important differences&lt;ref&gt;Matt Venuti: [http://www.mattvenuti.com/hang-gubal/ The Hang and the Gubal].&lt;/ref&gt; that caused its developers to give the instrument a new name.

== Description ==

Like the Hang the Gubal is played with the hands and combines the sounds of a ring of seven tone fields on the upper side of the instrument with the sound of the air in the vessel, the [[Helmholtz resonance]].&lt;ref name=from-the-hang-to-the-gubal&gt;PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.: [http://panart.ch/en/articles/from-the-hang-to-the-gubal From the Hang to the Gubal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different from the Hang the ''Gu'', a round resonance opening with an inward looking neck, is placed in the center of the upper side of the instrument. It is surrounded by an elastic area, the ''Ringding''. Here the player can stimulate the Helmholtz resonance more strongly than with the Hang generating a strong bass sound. Due to a hemispherical extension on the bottom side of the instrument, called the ''Gugel'', the pitch of the resonance is 78 [[hertz]] (E{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). By inserting a hand into the opening the player can lower this pitch and is able to play different bass tones.&lt;ref name=from-the-hang-to-the-gubal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paschko: [http://www.lex.hangblog.org/de/fotos-des-gubals.htm Fotos des Gubals]. In: Das Hanglexikon. (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ringding is tuned to four partial tones: E{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, E{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. This way it serves a double function: It is a sound source itself as well as the place to excite the bass sound of the Helmholtz resonance.&lt;ref name=from-the-hang-to-the-gubal/&gt;

The Ringding is surrounded by the ring of seven seven tone fields created with the hammer and tuned to the notes B{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, D{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and B{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=from-the-hang-to-the-gubal/&gt;

== The Gubal as part of the Pang ensemble ==

While Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer understood the Hang as an instrument for the personal use by a single player, they emphasized the potential of the Gubal to be joined by other instruments. However, as most instruments are potentially much louder than the Gubal they faced the problem that instrumental partners drown out the Gubal. Therefore, they began to develop additional Pang instruments optimized as partners for the Gubal. In autumn 2015 the ''Hang Gudu''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2c-QHIek6E Hang® Gudu presentation (English)]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced and in 2016 three Pang string instruments and the ''Hang Urgu''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-opdzKZSo8 Hang® Urgu presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; This way the ''Pang ensemble''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHqYQ6uZqrwrUDjGHJEoyjBSBImUpMFji PANArt Pangensemble]&lt;/ref&gt; was established. On its website PANArt describes the focus of its current work as follows:

{{quote|"The call of iron has led PANArt to collective play, out of the relaxing spherical cocoon of the Hang's individual character, and into the excitement of the pulsating music of the ensemble. Together with the string instruments, a new field of musical communication has opened."&lt;ref&gt;PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.: [http://panart.ch/en/articles/pang-music-the-new-art-form-from-panart Pang music – the new art form from PANArt]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The "Harold Shea" Stories''' is a name given to a series of five [[science fantasy]] stories by the collaborative team of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]] and to its later continuation by de Camp alone, [[Christopher Stasheff]], [[Holly Lisle]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[Frieda A. Murray]], [[Tom Wham]], and [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]. De Camp and Stasheff collectively oversaw the continuations. The series is also known as the "'''Enchanter'''" series, the "'''Incomplete Enchanter'''" series (after the first collection of stories) or the "'''Compleat Enchanter'''" series.

In the original stories, psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard, and Vaclav Polacek (Votsy) travel to various [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel worlds]] where ancient myths or old literature are reality. In the course of their travels, other characters are added to the main cast, notably Belphebe and Florimel, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, respectively, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into  the chaos. In the later continuations, the most notable additions to the cast are the recurring villain, Malambroso, and Voglinda, the young daughter of Shea and Belphebe.

==Original series==
The protagonists utilize a system of [[symbolic logic]] to project themselves into the worlds they visit, but it is an inexact science, and they miss their target realities as often as they hit them. For example, in the first story, "[[The Roaring Trumpet]]", Shea intends to visit the world of [[Irish mythology]], and instead ends up in [[Norse mythology]]. Most of the worlds visited have systems of physics different from ours, usually magical, which the heroes devote a considerable amount of effort to learning and applying. Much humor is drawn both from the culture shock of their encounters and from the reality that they usually do not understand the local systems well enough to be able to predict the actual effects of the spells they attempt.

Much of the series' attraction stems from the interaction of the psychologists' logical, rationalistic viewpoints with the wildly counterintuitive physics of the worlds they visit. Their attitudes provide something of a deconstructionist look at the basic rationales of these worlds, hitherto unexamined either by their inhabitants or even their original creators. Essentially, they allow the reader to view these worlds from a fresh viewpoint. The "worlds" so examined include not only the Norse world of "The Roaring Trumpet", but also the worlds of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in "The Mathematics of Magic", [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (with a brief stop in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s Xanadu from "[[Kubla Khan]]") in "The Castle of Iron", the ''[[Kalevala]]'' in "The Wall of Serpents", and, at last, Irish mythology in "The Green Magician".

With "The Green Magician" the original collaboration ended, Pratt's early death precluding any additional entries. A final planned story set in the world of [[Persian mythology]] was never written, nor was a projected response to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s misuse of their hero in his novella ''The Case of the Friendly Corpse'' (1941). (De Camp would finally address the latter issue in "[[Sir Harold and the Gnome King]]".)

Reviewing the 1950 edition of ''The Castle of Iron'', [[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] described the series as "a high point in the application of sternest intellectual logic to screwball fantasy.".&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', December 1950, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damon Knight]] characterized the series as "relaced, ribald adventure ... priceless," saying that "no fantasy reader should be without them."&lt;ref&gt;"The Dissecting Table", ''[[Worlds Beyond (magazine)|Worlds Beyond]]'', December 1950, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[Richard A. Lupoff]] described the series as "whole planes above the hackneyed gut-spillers and skull-smashers that pass for [[heroic fantasy]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Lupoff's Book Week", ''Algol'' 28, 1977, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second series==
De Camp was reluctant to continue the series on his own, feeling that the collaboration with Pratt had a flavor impossible for either of them to duplicate alone. When he finally did revive the series in company with younger authors nearly forty years later, this impression was seemingly borne out; while not without interest, his own solo contributions to the second series exhibit a wryer, more cynical view of the worlds toured, and the protagonists' problematic use of magic is abandoned. His interest appears to have shifted to debunking the less credible aspects of the universes visited, rather than taking these as a given and extrapolating the fantasy worlds' physical or magical laws from them, as in the previous sequence. On the other hand, some of the new authors made efforts to duplicate de Camp and Pratt's original achievement, exploring fresh venues where their heroes once again have to learn the world's fundamental magical rules from the ground up. Holly Lisle ("Knight and the Enemy"), John Maddox Roberts ("Arms and the Enchanter") and Tom Wham ("Harold Shakespeare") were among the authors who recreated the original formula.

The initial impulse for the continuation may have been the successful adaptation of the characters into Tom Wham's authorized [[gamebook]] adventure ''[[Prospero's Isle]]'', published by [[Tor Books]] in October 1987 (the basis of "Harold Shakespeare"), to which de Camp had contributed an admiring introduction. This may have encouraged him to wrap up long-unresolved loose ends from the original series, such as the stranding of Walter Bayard in the world of [[Irish mythology]], and to resolve the unaddressed complication introduced by [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s "borrowing" of Harold Shea for use in his novel ''The Case of the Friendly Corpse''. Both of these goals he accomplished in ''[[Sir Harold and the Gnome King]]'' (1990 chapbook). When the decision was made to continue the series further, this story was revised slightly to reconcile it with the other new stories, though the fit is somewhat awkward.

Once the loose ends are resolved, most of the action in the second sequence involves Shea and Chalmers' quest across several universes to rescue Florimel, who has been kidnapped by the malevolent enchanter Malambroso. After Florimel is finally recovered, a similar effort must be made to recover Shea and Belphebe's daughter Voglinda, likewise seized by the unrepentant Malambroso. A final tale sends Shea and Belephebe on an unrelated adventure precipitated by the foolishness of Shea's colleague Polacek.

Milieus encountered in the second series include the worlds of Irish myth and the ''Orlando Furioso'' (again) in "Professor Harold and the Trustees", L. Ron Hubbard's setting from ''The Case of the Friendly Corpse'' and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[land of Oz]] in "Sir Harold and the Gnome King", the classical [[China|Chinese]] epic novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'' in "Sir Harold and the Monkey King,"  the romantic fantasies of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (with the unique twist of its being ''Quixote's'' version of reality rather than Cervantes') in "Knight and the Enemy", [[Virgil]]'s Graeco-Roman epic the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in "Arms and the Enchanter", the old [[Russia]]n ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'' in "Enchanter Kiev," [[Bhavabhuti]]'s ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' (or "Vikram and the Vampire"), a proto-''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' collection of [[India]]n tales, in "Sir Harold and the Hindu King", [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' ''[[Barsoom]]'' in "Sir Harold of Zodanga", and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' in "Harold Shakespeare".

There exists one additional contribution to the series; "Return to Xanadu" by [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]], which revisits the world of ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' and transfers a minor character appearing therein to that of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights]]'' by the agency of an unnamed magician who appears to be intended to represent [[L. Sprague de Camp]] himself. "Return to Xanadu" was first published in ''[[The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp]]'' edited by [[Harry Turtledove]] and published by [[Baen Books]] in 2005.

==Publication==
The original publication of the first three Pratt and De Camp collaborations ("Roaring Trumpet",  "Mathematics of Magic", and ''The Castle of Iron'') was in ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Magazine]]'' during its brief run.  The remaining two appeared in ''Beyond Fantasy Magazine'' and ''Fantasy Magazine'' a few years later.  ''Sir Harold and the Gnome King'' first appeared in the [[World Fantasy Convention]] program book in 1990 and as a chapbook the following year. It was later revised and appeared with the remainder of the later continuations in regular trade books.

==Yngvi==
In the original story a character in a jail comes to the bars every hour on the hour to announce that "[[Yngvi]] is a louse!".  This phrase has moved into the lexicon and has taken on a life of its own in certain SF-related circles.  Who, or what, Yngvi may be is not mentioned in the book, though in [[Old Norse]], Yngvi is another name for the god [[Freyr]].

'''ISO 639-2:1998''', ''Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 2: Alpha-3 code'', is the second part of the [[ISO 639]] [[International standard|standard]], which lists [[Language code|code]]s for the representation of the names of [[languages]]. The three-letter codes given for each language in this part of the standard are referred to as "Alpha-3" codes. There are 464 entries in the [[list of ISO 639-2 codes]].

The [[United States|US]] [[Library of Congress]] is the registration authority for ISO 639-2 (referred to as ISO 639-2/RA). As registration authority, the LOC receives and reviews proposed changes; they also have representation on the ISO 639-RA Joint Advisory Committee responsible for maintaining the ISO 639 code tables.

==History and relationship to other ISO 639 standards==

Work was begun on the ISO 639-2 standard in 1989, because the [[ISO 639-1]] standard, which uses only two-letter codes for languages, is not able to accommodate a sufficient number of languages. The ISO 639-2 standard was first released in 1998. 

In practice, ISO 639-2 has largely been superseded by [[ISO 639-3]] (2007), which includes codes for all the individual languages in ISO 639-2 plus many more. It also includes the special and reserved codes, and is designed not to conflict with ISO 639-2. ISO 639-3, however, does not include any of the collective languages in ISO 639-2; most of these are included in [[ISO 639-5]].

==B and T codes==
While most languages are given one code by the standard, twenty of the languages described have two three-letter codes, a "bibliographic" code (ISO 639-2/B), which is derived from the English name for the language and was a necessary [[legacy systems|legacy]] feature, and a "terminological" code (ISO 639-2/T), which is derived from the native name for the language and resembles the language's two-letter code in ISO 639-1. There were originally 22 B codes; '''scc''' and '''scr''' are now deprecated.

In general the T codes are favored; [[ISO 639-3]] uses ISO 639-2/T. However, [[ISO 15924]] derives its codes from ISO 639-2/B when possible.

==Scopes and types==
The codes in ISO 639-2 have a variety of "scopes of denotation", or types of meaning and use, some of which are described in more detail below. 
* Individual languages
* Macrolanguages (see [[ISO 639 macrolanguage]])
* [[#Collections of languages|Collections of languages]]
* Dialects
* [[#Reserved for local use|Reserved for local use]]
* [[#Special situations|Special situations]]

Individual languages are further classified as to type:
* Living languages
* Extinct languages
* Ancient languages
* Historic languages
* Constructed languages

{{anchor|Collective language codes}}
===Collections of languages===
Some ISO 639-2 codes that are commonly used for languages do not precisely represent a particular language or some related languages (as the above macrolanguages). They are regarded as collective language codes and are excluded from [[ISO 639-3]]. For a definition of macrolanguages and collective languages see [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp].

The collective language codes in ISO 639-2 are listed below.

The following two codes are identified as collective codes in ISO 639-2 but are (at present) missing from ISO 639-5:
*&lt;tt&gt;bih&lt;/tt&gt; [[Bihari languages|Bihari]] (has the ISO 639-1 code &lt;tt&gt;bh&lt;/tt&gt;)
*&lt;tt&gt;him&lt;/tt&gt; [[Himachali languages|Himachali]]

Codes registered for 639-2 that are listed as collective codes in ISO 639-5 (and collective codes by name in ISO 639-2):

===Reserved for local use===
The interval from '''qaa''' to '''qtz''' is 'reserved for local use' and is not used in ISO 639-2 nor in [[ISO_639-3#Special_codes|ISO 639-3]]. These codes are typically used privately for languages not (yet) in either standard.

===Special situations===
There are four generic codes for special situations:
*'''mis''' is listed as "uncoded languages" (originally an abbreviation for "miscellaneous")
*'''mul''' (for multiple languages) is applied when several languages are used and it is not practical to specify all the appropriate language codes
*'''und''' (for undetermined) is used in situations in which a language or languages must be indicated but the language cannot be identified.
*'''zxx''' is listed in the code list as "no linguistic content", e.g. animal sounds (added 2006-01-11)
These four codes are also used in [[ISO_639-3#Special_codes|ISO 639-3]].

'''Imhotep''' is the titular [[antagonist]] in the 1932 film ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'', and later featured in its [[The Mummy (1999 film)|1999 remake]] and its sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' again as one of the main [[antagonist]]s. [[Sofia Boutella]] plays a female version of this character named [[Ahmanet]] in the [[The Mummy (2017 film)|2017 remake]]. Imhotep is loosely inspired by the historical figure [[Imhotep]], a noted [[polymath]] and counselor to the Pharaoh [[Djoser]] in the [[27th century BC]].

==''The Mummy'' (1932)==
In his original appearance, Imhotep was portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] as a high priest of [[Ancient Egypt]], who steals the Scroll of Thoth in attempt to resurrect his lover Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. For Imhotep's sacrilege, the princess's father [[Pharaoh]] Amenophis the Magnificent orders Imhotep to be tortured, [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried alive. The scroll is buried with him, so that no one would ever again have the chance to use it again like he did.

Imhotep is accidentally revived as a [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]] when an archaeological expedition discovers his mummy and one of the archaeologists unknowingly reads the scroll's ancient life-giving spell. While reviewing his mummy, the archaeologists that discovered Imhotep note not only was he buried alive as indicated by his struggle, but that sacred spells meant to protect his soul on its journey to the Underworld were chipped off his coffin, so his soul would be condemned in the afterlife.

Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists and assumes the identity of Ardath Bey, a modern Egyptian. In this form he helps the archaeologists find the tomb of Ankh-es-en-amon. When Bey meets a woman, Helen Grosvenor, who bears a striking resemblance to Ankh-es-en-amon, he realizes that she is a [[reincarnation]] of the princess, and attempts to mummify her and make her his bride.

Imhotep is able to use years of power and strength to control others in person and through a looking pool from afar, causing both attraction to him, and death to those he wishes it upon. His powers allow him to control others to take his orders, which gives him control and the ability to draw Helen Grosvenor to him, where she can never remember what she did, or why she was with him. In the end, Grosvenor, recalling her past life, appeals to the goddess [[Isis]] who causes Imhotep to dissolve.

The ancient Egyptian priest from the film is named after a famous Egyptian architect named Imhotep who was responsible for designing the step pyramid at Sakkara. He is also well known for becoming his own priest, and excelling in medicine where he was considered a healer, using plants to treat common diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/imhotep.shtml|title=BBC - History - Imhotep|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the mummy of Imhotep has never been found, an empty sarcophagus was found in a tomb that is thought to have been his. People are in a disagreement on if the tomb discovered actually does belong to Imhotep, however, because there is evidence that whoever was laid to rest in that tomb did not worship [[Ra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://josephandisraelinegypt.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/the-tomb-of-imhotep-found-the-coffin-was-empty-and-orientated-to-the-north/|title=The tomb of Imhotep adjoining the Ibis Galleries in Saqqara. The coffin was empty and orientated to the north. The tomb dated to the 3rd dynasty.

==''The Mummy'' (1999)==
In the 1999 remake, Imhotep is portrayed by [[Arnold Vosloo]] and is the main [[antagonist]] of the film. In 1290 B.C., Imhotep was high priest under the rule of Pharaoh [[Seti I]]. He began an affair with Seti's mistress Anck-su-namun and they murder the Pharaoh when he discovers it. They are discovered and Anck-su-namun commits suicide, intending that Imhotep resurrect her. He and his priests later steal her corpse from her burial place. Imhotep attempts to resurrect Anck-su-namun, but is captured at [[Hamunaptra]] (the City of the Dead) by the [[Medjay]] (the Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards). His priests are mummified and buried alive. Imhotep, meanwhile, is condemned to endure the Curse of the Hom Dai: the ritual involves cutting out his tongue, mummifying him alive, and sealing him in a sarcophagus filled with carnivorous [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]]. The curse transforms Imhotep into an undead fiend kept in a state of living death. If revived, he would gain control over sand and other elements.

During an archaeological dig 3,000 years later, Imhotep is accidentally revived when Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan ([[Rachel Weisz]]) reads the ''Book of the Dead'' at Hamunaptra, where his sarcophagus was. Imhotep regenerates himself using the flesh of four thieves who breached his burial chamber and opened a cursed chest. He attempts to resurrect Anck-su-namun again, using Evelyn as a sacrifice. Ultimately, Imhotep is defeated when he is stripped of immortality by the Book of Amun-Ra, and he is stabbed with a sword by the film's [[protagonist]] [[Rick O'Connell]] ([[Brendan Fraser]]). As he degenerates into a skeletal form and falls into the pool from which he summoned Anck-su-namun's [[Egyptian soul|Ba]], Imhotep vows he will return to have his revenge.

Once revived, Imhotep gained several powers, including regeneration, invulnerability, and the ability to turn himself into sand and control the desert sands. He could also wield the [[Ten Plagues of Egypt]] to an unspecified degree; he could turn water to blood, unleash swarms of [[locust]]s, and control the people of the city by inflicting them with boils and sores. Early in the film, Imhotep expresses an intense [[Ailurophobia|fear of cats]], screaming in fear when a white one appears in Evelyn's room. Ardeth Bay (the leader of an ancient [[secret society]] devoted to guarding Imhotep's tomb, rather than an alias of Imhotep) and Evelyn's employer explain that Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, cats being associated with the Guardians of the Underworld in Egyptian mythology. Rick uses this fear against Imhotep later in the film.

==''The Mummy Returns'' (2001)==
In the 2001 sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', Imhotep, having been resurrected and freed from the resin he had been trapped in at the end of the first movie by a group of cultists and Anck-su-namun's reincarnation, proceeds to seek out the Bracelet of Anubis which was the key to finding the lair of the Scorpion King, an ancient warrior whose defeat will grant Imhotep control over the Scorpion King's near-indestructible Army of [[Anubis]]. After finding the bracelet on the arm of Alex O'Connell, the son of Rick and Evy, Imhotep captures the boy and uses him to find the lair of the Scorpion King, rejuvenating his body using the flesh of mercenaries Anck-su-namun tricks into opening the cursed chest. Once Imhotep reaches the lair, he walks over a magic seal on the floor which causes him to be robbed of his telekinesis, immortality, and other powers granted by the Curse of Hom Dai by Anubis, who seemingly wishes him to face the Scorpion King as a normal mortal. When the Scorpion King responds to Imhotep's summons, Imhotep tricks him into attacking Rick O'Connell. When Rick kills the Scorpion King and sends him and his army to the Underworld, the palace begins to collapse. Rick and Imhotep both nearly fall into a chasm, that apparently leads to the Underworld, and grab onto the ledge. While Rick is rescued by Evelyn, Imhotep begs Anck-su-namun for assistance to save him, but she selfishly refuses and leaves him to die. After this betrayal, Imhotep loses all will to live, since his only reason for returning from the grave was to be reunited with his lover, who apparently did not fully reciprocate his affection. He gives Rick and Evelyn a sad smile, understanding their love is genuine, and willingly casts himself into the pit, thus ending his reign of terror once and for all.

==''The Mummy'' (2001–2003)==
In the animated television series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'', based on the 1999 and 2001 films, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] and is again the main antagonist. Unlike the movies, he is able to speak contemporary English in this series. Many years ago, Imhotep was a priest who wanted to rule the world. He was already the keeper of the Scrolls of Thebes. When he was about to steal the Manacle of Osiris, the Pharaoh sent his royal guards to intercept him and sentence him to be mummified alive. Years later, Imhotep was resurrected by Colin Weasler, despite his co-worker Evy's attempt to destroy him. He plots to seek the Scrolls of Thebes in order to remove the Manacle of Osiris from Alex. When it comes to the fight in the Paris Catacombs where the Scrolls of Thebes are, he does regain them before they end up destroyed by Alex using the Manacle's power to bring a torch underneath the Scrolls of Thebes. Though he was thought dead when fighting the [[Minotaur]] within the flooding catacombs, Imhotep managed to survive and strives to find other ways to conquer the world.

'''Jewish assimilation''' ({{lang-he-n|התבוללות}}, ''Hitbolelut'') refers to the gradual [[cultural assimilation]] and [[social integration]] of [[Jews]] in their surrounding culture as well as the ideological program promoting conformity as a potential solution to historic Jewish marginalization in the age of emancipation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/assimilation|title=YIVO {{!}} Assimilation|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Jewish holiday]] [[Hanukkah]] stems from the [[Maccabees]]' revolt against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Many Jews of the era had adopted the Hellenistic language and culture, which the Maccabee group considered an abomination. Use of the [[vernacular]] is an example of acculturation, one of the key characteristics of Jewish assimilation in the modern era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jewish assimilation began anew among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] on an extensive scale towards the end of the 18th century in Western Europe, especially Germany, as the [[Haskalah]] emerged as a culture. Reasons cited for its initial success included hope for better opportunities accompanying assimilation into the non-Jewish European communities, especially among the [[upper class]]es. "The concentration of the Jewish population in large cities had a strong impact on their lifestyle and made them more visible in the economy and in the culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013061311/http://www.un.org/en/holocaustremembrance/The_History_of_the_Jews_in_Europe.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As legal emancipation remained incomplete in Germany, many upper-middle class urban Jews propagated [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals, which they believed would allow them to improve their social standing. "The ideologues consequently envisioned a regeneration of German Jewry that would gain it equal rights but would also lead to the formation of a new kind of Jew based on its ideal of man."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformation of German Jewry 1780-1840|last=Sorkin|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5|quote="The ideologues consequently envisioned a regeneration of German Jewry that would gain it equal rights but would also lead to the formation of a new kind of Jew based on its ideal of man."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
Both the Christian and Jewish communities were divided concerning answers to what was known as the [[Jewish question]]. The question, coming during the rise of [[nationalism]] in Europe, included the extent to which each nation could integrate its Jewish citizens, and if not integrated, how should they be treated and the question solved. The breakdown of the traditional Jewish communal structure, the [[Kehilla (modern)|Kehilla]], marked the declining perception of a distinct Jewish nationality among those Jews that promoted emancipation. However, attempts to reduce Judaism to a confession did not necessarily induce an increase in tolerance of the Jews on the part of the majority society.

As an alternative to a more liberal practice of [[Judaism]], assimilation also took the form of conversion to [[Christianity]]. None of the descendants of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] retained the Jewish religion. Assimilationists saw Jewish cultural distinctiveness and tribalism as the root of antisemitic hostility and thus felt that Jewish social bonds needed to be weakened.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This led some Jews to philosophical questions of [[Jewish identity]] and [[Who is a Jew?]]. The propriety of assimilation, and various paths toward it were among the earliest internal debates of the emancipation era, including whether and to what extent Jews should relinquish their right to uniqueness in return for [[Social equality|civic equality]]. These debates initially took place within the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]], a population with a revered historical [[Eretz Israel|Biblical homeland]], but without a state of their own for nearly 2,000 years.

Jewish academics in the nineteenth century partook in social scientific studies concerning anti-Semitic notions of Jewish degeneration. Their active role in this intellectual discussion served as both a calculated response to anti-Semitic allegations and a way to explore common social bonds uniting Jews as the autonomous community had been in full decline. Many Jewish social scientists did not entirely disagree with the ideas of distinct Jewish traits conceived by anti-Semites. This lent itself well to the contentious debate over assimilatory practices. "The political and social message of this immutable Jewish nature was clear: the 'Jewish body' was racially different and pathological, and opponents of emancipation and integration were correct in insisting that Jews were unfit to be part of a healthy modern nation-state."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=237051|title=Racial Science, Social Science, and the Politics of Jewish Assimilation on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the exploration of Jewish lineage can also be seen as a form of appeasement as "It allowed Jewish social scientists to fill the roles of apologist and reformer, to defend their own people based on the knowledge and insights of science."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, conditions in Eastern Europe convinced many Jews to emigrate to the United States.  In Germany, Jewish integration into the Army and other occupations was successful. In the United States traditional [[disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] were generally absent but they faced many different challenges of acculturation. In the early 20th century, there was social discrimination against Jews in certain quarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/jewishexp.htm|title=The American Jewish Experience in the Twentieth Century:  Antisemitism and Assimilation, The Twentieth Century, Divining America: Religion in American History, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many universities and professions barred to them or with a quota limit.

In the modern 21st century, although the view on Jews has considerably improved, in the US specifically, the nation is guided as a Christian nation, with a common example being all of the Christmas songs and ads being played during the holiday season with parents needing to say "''we'' do not celebrate Christmas." ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigthink.com/stay-attuned/what-jesus-means-to-a-21st-century-jew|title=What Jesus Means to a 21st Century Jew|last=Israel|first=Jeffrey|work=Big Think|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of such advertisement for any Jewish holiday during the year. Jewish assimilation is common more in the modern day since the pressures of society to be like everyone else are high. The new Reform Judaism Movement also adds to this, since it is a branch of Judaism that has become more moderate on following the laws of the torah, leading Jews to be more relaxed instead of strict on their religion.

== Contemporary debate ==
The issue of Jewish assimilation has agitated Jewish [[polemicists]] and intrigued Jewish historians for a considerable time.  Since some Jews supposedly abandoned traditional [[Jewish customs]] to embrace [[modern era|modern]] [[secular]] [[Western culture]], more [[conservative Jews]] have chastised them for deserting the Jewish people. "Religious Jews regarded those who assimilated with horror, and Zionists campaigned against assimilation as an act of treason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bela|last= Vago| authorlink = Bela Vago|title=Review of Jewish Assimilation in Modern Times|editor= Marsha L. Rozenblit|journal=[[Jewish Social Studies]]|volume= 44|issue= 3-4|date= 1982|ref=pp.334-335|jstor= 4467195}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term assimilation, once used proudly by those who sought integration into European society, became seen as a term of contempt for a symbol of subservience to [[gentile]] culture, a sign of rejection of all links to the common history and destiny of the [[Jewish people]], and a betrayal of their ancestors who suffered [[pogroms]] to keep Judaism alive. Such Jews consider assimilation a loss of [[Jewish identity]] of an individual either by marriage to a spouse who is not Jewish or by [[apostasy|abandonment]] of Judaism to adopt another religion.

In ''Assimilation in American Life'', [[Milton Gordon (sociologist)|Milton Gordon]] defined assimilation as a continuum, with the first stage [[acculturation]], that is, the adoption of such outward cultural forms of the larger society as language, dress, recreational tastes, and political views. Total assimilation is possible only if the host society is receptive and extensive [[interfaith marriage]] takes place (at its most in former European colonies with a divisive black-white line, which allowed Jews to be seen as part of the desirable white element and where [[miscegenation]] was hardly a taboo).  Most European and [[American Jews]] acculturated, but they rarely lost their sense of Jewish identity. They most frequently abstained from what Gordon called "structural assimilation," the creation of friendships and other contacts primarily with members of the host society.

In ''Assimilation and Community: The Jews in nineteenth-century Europe'', Marion Kaplan describes how the Jewish identity was maintained and how the German-Jewish identity was formed, specifically through Jewish women and their actions within their families and their communities. Jewish women placed a lot of importance on their culture and religion by reinforcing their traditions. They accomplished this by continually observing Jewish traditions and rituals, such as family dinners on Friday evenings, and holidays from the Jewish calendar. Strict adherence to Judaism was essential in maintaining their Jewish identity within their household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion A.|title=Assimilation and community: The Jews in nineteenth-century Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan also stresses the importance of family and community; close knit families had strong ties with one another. This strong sense of community helped them in protecting and maintaining their culture. However, ways in which Jews adapted to the culture can be seen in the way Jewish women raised their children in Germany. They encouraged them to take part in sports, learn musical instruments, and read German fairy tales to them. Jewish women also subscribed to German periodicals, following its fashion styles and news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion A.|title=Assimilation and community: The Jews in nineteenth-century Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Paula Hyman]]'s book ''The Jews of Modern France'' demonstrates that Jewish assimilation into [[French people|French society]] allowed them to integrate in the community. The term assimilation is based on the modern term. Assimilation is presumed to "reflection the substitution of a French identity for a Jewish one."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hyman|first1=Paula|title=The Jews of Modern France|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this simplistic view does not give an all encompassing view on the intricate relations between [[History of the Jews in France|Jews]] and the French. The Jews had to constantly defend their legitimacy as a minority group in France. While most people associate assimilation as a negative term, "they were not simply passive absorbers of bourgeois French culture; they also participated in its shaping."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Jews contributed to French society, through participating in all aspects of society like government and universities. In her book Hyman helps illustrate instances that show integration in French society.  Beginning with the cooperation of the French state, Jews were able to maintain networks of communal institutions in the system of [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] that both promoted acculturation and reinforced Jewish feelings of solidarity.  These consistories also helped support the existence of specific Jewish institutions. These institutions provided charitable assistance to Jews through a variety of philanthropic societies.  Examples of these would be a network of modern Jewish primary schools as well as extended supplemental Jewish education to Jewish children who began attending public schools.  Despite mass participation by Jews in all levels of French society – government, universities, and professional careers – the vast majority of Jews in 19th century France chose to be married and buried as Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This clarifies that Jews were not fully assimilated into French society nor sought the disappearance of their institutions and/or biological merger with the French society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[David Sorkin]]'s ''The Transformation of German Jewry 1780-1840'' assesses what should have been an immensely successful integration process given the Jewish population's great societal contributions as they adopted German secular culture and the [[bourgeois]] ideal of individualism known as [[Bildung]]. Instead, a separate [[German-Jewish]] subculture developed while emancipation lagged. Sorkin depicts the fruitless attempts of the Jews to be tolerated as no level of self-denial would ultimately prove acceptable to their counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From an international conference on Jewish assimilation held at [[Haifa University]] in May 1976, [[Bela Vago]] edited a collection of papers entitled ''Jewish Assimilation in Modern Times''.  Most of these papers accept the [[Zionist]] equation of assimilation with Jewish group disappearance.

==Christian–Jewish relations==
{{see also|Conversion of the Jews|Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews}}
The question of Jewish assimilation is a topic of concern for both Jewish and Christian religious leaders. A number of [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christian]] denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer [[Proselytism|proselytize]] Jews.  They have made use of [[dual-covenant theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=1499 Ecumenical Considerations on Jewish-Christian Dialogue] (World Council of Churches)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrock.com/Attempt.html#valid|title=Should Christians Attempt to Evangelize Jews?|first=Allan R.|last=Brockway|website=www.abrock.com|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcon3.htm Policies of mainline and liberal Christians towards proselytizing Jews] (religioustolerance.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christian Europe proved a time and place where Jews and Christians could come together while coexisting socially and creatively amidst the persecution.  They were living so closely together in some areas that leaders from both would be worried about the influence one religion had on the other.  A Christian Monarch in charge of a growing town would invite Jewish merchants to help revitalize the economy.  There was a pattern of expulsion and re-invitation that allowed for the two to live intimately together in smaller towns throughout Europe.  Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne in the Holy Roman Empire,  was the first to leave detailed descriptions of the rights of Jewish Merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Ivan|title=A Jewish-Christian Symbiosis|date=2002|publisher=Schocken|isbn=0805212019|pages=453; 449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain and Portugal, after the 15th century, there was controversy over the sincerity of Iberian [[Converso|Judeo-Catholics who converted]] under pain of being expelled from the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_jewish_catholics.html|title=Famous Jewish Catholics|website=www.adherents.com|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain and Portugal, descendants of [[Arabs]], [[Moors]], and Jews (''[[morisco]]s'' and ''[[marrano]]s''), were, for a period of time banned from certain guilds, positions in the clergy and particularly from emigrating to Latin America (''[[limpieza de sangre]]''). This early discrimination system was weaker in [[Latin America]] due to the social status that Sub-Saharan African slaves had, much below that of [[New Christian]]s from the [[Old World]], a contributing factor to the absorption of these elements in the developing [[Cultural pluralism|culturally pluralistic]] societies of the [[New World]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has attracted some Jews, such as [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Israel Zolli]], [[Erich von Stroheim]], and [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]].

{{Judaism}}
'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966). "[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1966_3_SpecialArticles.pdf Jewish Studies in American Liberal-Arts Colleges and Universities]," ''American Jewish Year Book'' 67 (1966), 1–30; here: p. 3. Retrieved 2016-07-01 from the website of the American Jewish Committee Archives. Also reprinted, with a postscript by Band, in: Band, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature''. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2003. p. 390–408. {{ISBN|9780827609723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loveland"&gt;Loveland, Kristen (2008). "The Association for Jewish Studies: A Brief History". Association for Jewish Studies 40th Annual Conference, December 21–23, 2008. 16&amp;nbsp;p.; here: p.&amp;nbsp;1. "The first to address the postwar rise of Jewish studies, Band's article quickly set off a reaction amongst the new generation of Jewish studies professors." Available as a [http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf PDF file] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726190104/http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf |date=2016-07-26 }} on the website of the Association for Jewish Studies, "[http://www.ajsnet.org/mission.htm About Us]" page. Retrieved 2016-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as "the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries".&lt;ref&gt;Band (1966), p. 5. In the 2002 reprint, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985). ''World Register of University Studies in Jewish Civilization: Inventory of Holdings'' (Vol. 1). Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

===Europe===

====University College London====
[[University College London]] (UCL) houses the largest department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies in Europe. The department is the only one in the UK to offer a full degree course and research supervision in Jewish Studies at the BA Honours, MA, MPhil and PhD levels in every subject of Hebrew and Jewish Studies—philology, history, and literature—covering virtually the entire chronological and geographical span of the Hebrew and Jewish civilisation from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the modern period. As the first university in England to open its doors to Women, Roman Catholics and Dissenters, UCL was also the first to admit Jewish students. This traditional link of the College with the Anglo-Jewish community is very much alive today. Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (1778–1859), one of the leading figures in the struggle for Jewish emancipation in England, was among the principal founders of University College and the chief promotor of its Hebrew department. At his instigation, [[Hyman Hurwitz]] was appointed as the first Professor of Hebrew in 1828. In 1967 the department was renamed the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies and extended to include, in addition to the established courses in Hebrew language and literature, a much wider range of courses with an emphasis on Jewish history. The department acts as host to both the Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhse.org/ |title=jhse.org |publisher=jhse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Jewish Studies (IJS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416002941/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which organises annual public lecture series and international conferences on all aspects of Jewish civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503054431/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motek Cultural Initiative''' was established in 2011 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada in order to showcase Israeli music. Its programs include annual galas, concerts, music festivals, workshops, lectures, advocacy events, and Q&amp;A sessions.Motek is Hebrew slang for "Sweetheart", "Mon Cheri", "Habibi" is a gender-neutral term of endearment.

==History==
Upon moving to Canada from Israel, it became evident to Motek's founder, Ravid Dahan, that few organizations in North America were celebrating Israeli musical artists in their programming, even though there was a growing demand for it in [[Jewish music|Jewish]] and [[world music]] communities. Having worked with the most prominent talents, including Israel’s top-ten musical artists, Ravid created Motek to promote Israeli music while bridging the gap between local Jewish and Israeli communities. The charity hosts an annual gala in Toronto venues.

{{one source|date=May 2010}}
The '''orgasmatron''' is a fictional electromechanical device that appears in the [[1973 in film|1973 movie]] ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', which also shows the effects of a related device, an '''orgasmic orb'''. Similar devices have appeared in other fictional works. The term has also been applied to a non-fictional device capable of triggering an orgasm-like sensation using [[electrode]]s implanted at the lower spine.

Author [[Christopher Turner]] has suggested that the orgasmatron was a parody of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s [[orgone]] accumulator.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter D. |last=Kramer |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2297527/ |title=The Great Proselytizer of Orgasm |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Orgasmatron is Woody Allen's name, in Sleeper, for a parody of Reich's orgone accumulator, a telephone booth-sized plywood and metal box said to store a healing and enlivening force. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron |title=Wilhelm Reich: the man who invented free love |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |quote=Woody Allen parodied it in Sleeper (1973), giving it the immortal nickname the "Orgasmatron". }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Sleeper'' (1973)==
The orgasmatron is a fictional device in the fictional future society of 2173 in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''. It is a large cylinder big enough to contain one or two people. The orgasmatron was made by decorating an [[elevator]] in the home where the movie was filmed. Once entered, it contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology that rapidly induces [[orgasm]]s. This is required, as almost all people in the ''Sleeper'' universe are [[impotent]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigid]], although males of Italian descent are considered the least impotent of all groups.

The main character Miles Monroe, played by Allen, is being hunted by the police as being [[subversive]] to security of the state, and attempts to hide in it, thinking it is a closet. He is discovered there, and easily captured in a daze, with a sheepish smile on his face.

Another related device, an orb, also appears in this movie. It is a silver-colored sphere about the size of a [[grapefruit]] that contains some (otherwise undescribed) future technology. When the orb is touched by a human, it induces pleasurable sensations. In a scene where Miles impersonates a [[robot]]ic servant, he is ordered by the hostess to pass the orb among the guests. Unlike the robot he is imitating, he is not immune to the effects of the orb. Much physical humor results from his reaction to firmly holding this device, which party participants only lightly caress.

Later on, they encounter a [[gay]] male couple, one of whom offers Miles a "hit off the orb". Miles reports that he's "cool" and does not need to indulge. It appears the effect of the orb is more like social [[alcoholic beverage|drinking]] or [[drug|drug use]], pleasurable rather than orgasmic.

==Similar concepts==
Similar devices are:

===In ''Barbarella'' (1964)===
(Referred to in both the [[Barbarella (comics)|comic]] and 1968 [[Barbarella (film)|film]]—the description below refers to the film.)

The device has been invented by Dr. Durand-Durand, the evil antagonist in ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. Instead of being called an Orgasmatron, Durand-Durand refers to it as the Excessive Machine. It resembles a clamshell that once grasping the passenger's entire body below the neck, gently (at first) and pleasurably massages the passenger by flexing its upper half with a wave-like motion from right to left. The lid is made of long, rigid rod-like paddles that lie in a row, side by side. The paddles themselves each have one end at the bottom of the lid, near the joint of the Excessive Machine's "clamshell", and the other end moves freely. Because the paddles are not glued or welded together but instead move together, and because the paddles pivot around the "clamshell" joint and move parallel to the [[sagittal plane]], they can have this wave-like motion. It is operated from a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] resembling that used to control a large [[organ (music)|organ]]. By properly manipulating the keys the operator may induce great sexual pleasure in the victim, sufficient to cause death by [[orgasm]]. In one of the final scenes of the movie the evil opponent is torturing Barbarella with the pleasures of this machine, during which she vocalises extensively ("oh", "ooh", "ahh", etc.). But in the end the machine overloads and is destroyed, while she survives, and feels rather well.

See [[Magic Mountain (1973)]] by Jadorowski for another orgasmatron.

===In ''Flesh Gordon'' (1974)===
In the 1974 film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'', a [[ribaldry|ribald]] parody of the science fiction adventures of [[Flash Gordon]], the villain "Emperor Wang" directs a "sex ray" at Earth which causes the planet's inhabitants to become uncontrollably sexually aroused.

===In ''Orgasmatron'' (1986)===
''[[Orgasmatron (album)|Orgasmatron]]'' is the seventh album by the British band [[Motörhead]], released in 1986. It is the only full Motörhead album to feature [[Pete Gill]] on the [[Drum kit|drums]], although he also played on the four new tracks recorded for the 1984 ''[[No Remorse (Motörhead album)|No Remorse]]'' [[compilation album]].

=== In ''Coneheads'' (1993) ===
"Senso-rings" were used in the movie ''[[Coneheads]]'' to provide pleasure to the other partner.

=== In ''Demolition Man'' (1993) ===
John Spartan (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) is introduced to an orgasmatron-like device by [[Lenina Huxley|Lt. Lenina Huxley]] ([[Sandra Bullock]]) in the 1993 movie ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''. The device is in widespread use in the film's future world, since actual sex ("fluid exchange") has been deemed unsafe and become both illegal and socially taboo.

===In ''Orgazmo'' (1997)===
In ''[[Orgazmo]]'', the "Orgazmorator" was built in the form of an oversized water gun. It was operated by pointing it at a subject and firing. Apparently, it could even generate multiple successive orgasms in a man.

==Non-fictional orgasmatron==

===Surgically implanted devices===
{{see also|Wirehead (science fiction)}}

Discovered serendipitously as a potential side effect of a [[spinal cord stimulator]] used in pain relief, the medical "orgasmatron" device has been judged effective by some recipients, but costs $3,000 and requires surgical insertion of electrodes near the [[spinal cord]]. Invented by Dr. Stuart Meloy in [[Winston-Salem]], the device employs a [[function generator]] manufactured by Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME Corp.). It has been described as being of great potential in treating sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/story?id=235788&amp;|title=Doctor Discovers the 'Orgasmatron'|date=2004-11-09|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Call him doctor 'Orgasmatron' |first1=Regina |last1=Nuzzo |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-he-orside11feb11,1,5212599.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |oclc=71790328 |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |quote=Dr. Stuart Meloy stumbled upon an alternative -- and pleasurable -- use for an electrode stimulation device that treats pain. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device and its inventor were featured in the first episode of the seventh season of the Showtime show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''

== Apparel patterns capturing the input of a designer ==


Apparel patternmakers draft patterns based on a designer's sketch of a style. The designer gives the sketch to the '''patternmaker''', who can ask questions to determine details the designer is looking for.

Patterns may be drafted on paper or in a computer program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker pulls an existing pattern (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If it's a completely new style, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, but this method has fallen out of use, as it's less accurate and takes longer than the other methods. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms.

Patternmakers have a combination of engineering and design skill. They need to be able to understand what the designer wants, and translate that into the lines of a pattern that will cause the garment to fit correctly. Ideally the pattern captures not only the fit, but also the flair intended by the designer.

Patternmaking is taught in conjunction with fashion design education, as it is vital for designers to understand the apparel development process. It is also taught as a major at certain trade schools. There are many books on the subject, but it is rare for a patternmaker to become a professional through teaching oneself. Apprenticeships are almost unheard of in modern America, but would serve well to improve the transition from student to professional status. Because this occupation is relatively unknown outside of the apparel industry, there is a serious lack of patternmakers who can accurately interpret designs in Los Angeles, and possibly other fashion capitals.

== Metal casting patterns used in foundries ==

[[File:Patternmakers (7598841038).jpg|thumb|The patternmakers' workshop at the [[Thomas-Morse Aircraft Corporation]], 1922]]
 
Foundry patternmakers have historically been woodworkers with skills of a woodcarver, [[woodturner]], and cabinet maker. When an object is made from cast iron, cast aluminum or any liquified metal  the patternmaker is employed to make a wood model of the object. The original pattern has to be made slightly larger as metal shrinks when it cools and often the pattern made in puzzle like parts as the sand mold must be "rammed up" in a certain manner and the parts of the pattern must be removed from the sand mold without altering the negative space which is left behind in the sand. Pattern makers also have evolved into cutting negative spaces into blocks of steel where sheet metal will be pressed between two matching shapes. A dinner fork is a good example. 
A block of steel is made to mirror the back of the fork and a block of steel is made to mirror the top of the fork.

The '''Paua House''' was a tourist attraction in the southern [[New Zealand]] town of [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]], but now on display at the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] in [[Christchurch]]. 

The Paua House was originally just a standard New Zealand [[bungalow]] located at 258 Marine Parade, Bluff.&lt;ref name="Newshub"&gt;"[http://www.newshub.co.nz/entertainment/paua-shell-house-on-exhibition-in-new-canterbury-home-2008070321#axzz4HC2WYqmG Paua shell house on exhibition in new Canterbury home], ''Newshub'', 3 July 2008. Retrieved 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The house was owned by elderly couple Fred and Myrtle Flutey, who built up a massive collection of ornaments and trinkets made from the iridescent shells of the [[paua]], a New Zealand species of [[abalone]] often used for souvenirs and items of [[kitsch]]. Over the course of some 40 years, the couple adorned the house with these ornaments, and also with the cleaned shells of paua found by the Fluteys on the local beach. By the time of the couple's deaths (Myrtle in 2000, Fred on New Year's Eve 2001)&lt;ref name="Stuff"&gt;"[http://www.stuff.co.nz/517724/Iconic-paua-house-recreated-in-all-its-glory Iconic paua house recreated in all its glory]", ''stuff.co.nz'', 4 July 2008.

Retrieved 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fluteys were playing host to thousands of visitors per year, with some reports suggesting one million people visited the house during the 37 years that the collection was built up.&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt;

When the Fluteys died, the house was purchased by their grandson, Ross Bowen. Despite protests from locals who wished the house to stay in its shelled condition, Bowen loaned the Fluteys' collection to [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] in [[Christchurch]] on a ten-year loan. Parts of the house were recreated by the museum and opened to the public in 2008.&lt;ref name="Obscura"&gt;"[http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fred-and-myrtles-paua-shell-house Fred and Myrtle's Paua Shell House]", ''Atlas Obscura''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">A '''philosophical language''' is any [[constructed language]] that is constructed from [[first principles]], like a [[Engineered language|logical language]], but may entail a strong claim of absolute perfection or transcendent or even mystical truth rather than satisfaction of pragmatic goals. Philosophical languages were popular in [[Early Modern]] times, partly motivated by the goal of recovering the lost [[Adamic language|Adamic]] or [[Divine language]].  The term '''ideal language''' is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as [[Toki Pona]] are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. It may be known as a language of pure ideology. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages today. 

In most older philosophical languages, and some newer ones, words are constructed from a limited set of [[morphemes]] that are treated as "elemental" or fundamental. "Philosophical language" is sometimes used synonymously with "taxonomic language", though more recently there have been several [[conlang]]s constructed on philosophical principles which are not taxonomic.  Vocabularies of [[oligosynthetic language]]s are made of [[compound word]]s, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of [[morpheme]]s; oligoisolating languages, such as Toki Pona, similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words. 

[[Toki Pona]] is based on [[minimalism|minimalistic]] [[voluntary simplicity|simplicity]], incorporating elements of [[Taoism]]. [[Láadan]] is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on [[muted group theory]].  

A priori languages are constructed languages where the vocabulary is invented directly, rather than being derived from other existing languages (as with [[Esperanto]] or [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).  Philosophical languages are almost all [[a priori (languages)|a priori languages]], but most ''a priori'' languages are not philosophical languages.  For example, [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] are all ''a priori'' but not philosophical languages: they are meant to seem like natural languages, even though they have no genetic relation to any natural languages.

==History==
Work on philosophical languages was pioneered by [[Francis Lodwick]] (''A Common Writing'', 1647; ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'', 1652), Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] (''[[Logopandecteision]]'', 1652), [[George Dalgarno]] (''Ars signorum'', 1661), and [[John Wilkins]] (''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'', 1668).  Those were systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. In 1855, English writer [[George Edmonds (lawyer)|George Edmonds]] modified Wilkins' system, leaving its taxonomy intact, but changing the grammar, orthography and pronunciation of the language in an effort to make it easier to speak and to read.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, George. ''A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language''.  [[Richard Griffin and Company]], London and Glasgow, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] created ''[[lingua generalis]]'' (or ''lingua universalis'') in 1678, aiming to create a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically; as a side effect he developed [[binary calculus]].&lt;ref name="lingua"&gt;[http://history-computer.com/Dreamers/Leibniz.html history-computer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

These projects aimed not only to reduce or model grammar, but also to arrange all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies.  This idea ultimately led to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally as a tree, and so impossible to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts.  Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century.  

After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the fringe.  Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (for example, [[Ro (language)|Ro]]).  More recent philosophical languages have usually moved away from taxonomic schemata, such as 21st century [[Ithkuil]] by [[John Quijada]].

'''Sexual tension''' is a social phenomenon that occurs when two individuals interact and one or both feel [[sexual desire]], but the [[consummation]] is postponed or never happens. A common scenario is where the two individuals function in close proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension doesn't have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship.

Sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expertdaconquista.com/aprenda-criar-tensao-sexual/|title=Aprenda A Criar Tensão Sexual - Expert da Conquista|date=2016-03-18|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.

== In fiction ==
Sexual tension is a common feature in works of [[fiction]]. This longing is often suggested by incidents of [[intimacy]]; for example, when two characters are alone and in close proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction.

Sexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Card|2010|pp=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Signifyin'''' (sometimes written "'''signifyin(g)'''") (vernacular), is a wordplay. It is a practice in [[African-American culture]] involving a verbal strategy of indirection that exploits the gap between the [[denotative]] and [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] meanings of words. A simple example would be insulting someone to show affection.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams, [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/498/to-african-americans-what-does-signifying-mean "To African-Americans, what does "signifying" mean?"], ''The Straight Dope'', September 28, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other names for signifyin' include:  "Dropping lugs, joaning, sounding, capping, snapping, dissing, busting, bagging, janking, ranking, toasting, woofing, putting on, or cracking." &lt;ref&gt;"Signifying, Concept of." ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Signifyin' directs attention to the [[Connotation|connotative]], context-bound significance of words, which is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. The expression comes from stories about the [[Signifying Monkey]], a trickster figure said to have originated during [[slavery in the United States]].

The American literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] wrote in ''[[The Signifying Monkey]]'' (1988) that signifyin' is "a [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]], in which are subsumed several other rhetorical tropes, including [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]], and [[irony]] (the master tropes), and also [[hyperbole]], [[litotes]], and [[metalepsis]]. To this list we could easily add [[aporia]], [[chiasmus]], and [[catachresis]], all of which are used in the ritual of Signifyin(g)."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''The Signifying Monkey: a Theory of African-American Literary Criticism'', Oxford University Press, 1988, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BRXXrVQEjHcC&amp;pg=PA52 p. 52].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and features==
[[Rudy Ray Moore]], known as " Dolemite", is well known for having used the term in his comedic performances. While Signifyin(g) is the term coined by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. to represent a black vernacular, the idea stems from the thoughts of [[Ferdinand De Saussure]] and the process of signifying--"the association between words and the ideas they indicate."&lt;ref name=MatuzFalk&gt;Roger Matuz and Cathy Falk, "Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Current Debate in African-American Literary Criticism, An Introduction to."&lt;/ref&gt; Gates states, "’Signification,’ in Standard English, denotes the meaning that a term conveys, or is intended to convey." Gates takes this idea of signifying and "doubles" it in order to explain signifyin(g). He states of Black Vernacular, "their complex act of language Signifies upon both formal language use and its conventions, conventions established, at least officially, by middle-class white people."&lt;ref name=TSM /&gt;

[[File:Henry Louis Gates Jr.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] writes that thinking about signifyin' is like "stumbling unaware into a hall of mirrors," hence the action of doubling.&lt;ref&gt;Gates 1988, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;]]Gates examines the ways in which signifyin(g) differs from signifying.

According to Gates, the practice derived from the Trickster archetype found in much [[African mythology]], folklore, and religion: a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who plays tricks or otherwise disobeys normal rules and societal norms. In practice, signifyin' often takes the form of quoting from subcultural vernacular, while extending the meaning at the same time through a rhetorical figure.

The expression itself derives from the numerous tales about the [[Signifying Monkey]], a folk trickster figure said to have originated during slavery in the United States. In most of these narratives, the Monkey manages to dupe the powerful Lion by signifying.

The term ''signifyin''' itself currently carries a range of metaphorical and theoretical meanings in black cultural studies that stretch far beyond its literal scope of reference. In ''The Signifying Monkey'', Gates expands the term to refer not merely to a specific vernacular strategy but also to a trope of double-voiced repetition and reversal that exemplifies the distinguishing property of Black discourse. However, this subtle [[African-American]] device, if linguistically analyzed, becomes notoriously difficult to pin down, as Gates writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thinking about the black concept of Signifiyin(g) is a bit like stumbling unaware into a hall of mirrors: the sign itself appears to be doubled, at the very least, and (re)doubled upon ever closer examination. It is not the sign itself, however, which has multiplied. If orientation prevails over madness, we soon realize that only the signifier has been doubled and (re)doubled, a signifier in this instance that is silent, a "sound-image" as [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] defines the signifier, but a "sound-image" ''sans'' the sound. The difficulty that we experience when thinking about the nature of the visual (re)doubling at work in a hall of mirrors is analogous to the difficulty we shall encounter in relating the black linguistic sign, "Signification," to the standard English sign, "signification." This level of conceptual difficulty stems from – indeed, seems, to have been intentionally inscribed within – the selection of the signifier, "signification." For the standard English word is a homonym of the Afro-American vernacular word. And, to compound the dizziness and giddiness that we must experience in the vertiginous movement between these two "identical" signifiers, these two homonyms have everything to do with each other and, then again, absolutely nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Gates 1988, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gates, in "The Signifying Monkey and the Language of Signifyin(g)" clarifies the confusing nature of the subject matter by representing the two terms on a graph made up of intercepting x-axis and a y-axis.  The x-axis is represented by the Standard English we recognize and use within most professional and educational settings.  Simply put, the x-axis is the literal definition of a word as represented by the masses and the term coined by Saussure.  The y-axis, however, is represented by the term Signifyin(g) and is labelled as Black Vernacular.  As Gates represents, "the relation of signification itself has been critiqued by a black act of (re)doubling" in which the point of intersection permits new understandings of a term to take place.&lt;ref name=TSM&gt;Gates, ''The Signifying Monkey''.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the x-axis and y-axis intersect, the two meanings of the word collide to form a new meaning, so often represented by puns and tropes.

By viewing Signifyin(g) as a graph, such as Gates represents, the doubling nature of black vernacular becomes apparent.  As Gates exhibits, "the English-language use of signification refers to the chain of signifiers that configures horizontally," or all accepted definitions of a term as represented by Standard English.  The y-axis of black vernacular, however, "concerns itself with that which is suspended, vertically…the playful puns on a word that occupy the paradigmatic axis of language and which a speaker draws on for figurative substitution."&lt;ref name=TSM /&gt; A term may share a name but the definitions may be completely different.

==Examples==

===The Dozens===
{{further|The Dozens|Call and response}}
An example of signifyin' is "doing the Dozens." The Dozens is a game in which participants seek to outdo each other by throwing insults back and forth. Tom Kochman offered as an example in ''Rappin' and Stylin' Out: Communication in Urban Black America'' (1972): "Yo momma sent her picture to the lonely hearts club, but they sent it back and said, 'We ain't that lonely!'"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kochman, ''Rappin' and Stylin' Out: Communication in Urban Black America'', University of Illinois Press, 1972, p. 261, cited in [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/498/to-african-americans-what-does-signifying-mean Adams 1984].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Caponi describes "calls, cries, hollers, riffs, licks, overlapping [[antiphony]]" as examples of signifying in [[hip hop music]] and other [[African-American music]]. She explains that signifyin' differs from simple repetition and from simple variation in that it uses material:

&lt;blockquote&gt;rhetorically or figuratively — through troping, in other words — by trifling with, teasing, or censuring it in some way. Signifyin(g) is also a way of demonstrating respect for, goading, or poking fun at a musical style, process, or practice through parody, pastische, implication, indirection, humor, tone- or word-play, the illusions of speech, or narration, and other troping mechanisms… Signifyin(g) shows, among other things, either reverence or irreverence toward previously stated musical statements and values."&lt;ref&gt;Gena Dagel Caponi, ''Signifyin(G), Sanctifyin', &amp; Slam Dunking: A Reader in African American Expressive Culture''. University of Massachusetts Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn6y4iHj6_MC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schloss relates this to the ambiguity common to African musics, including looping (as of a [[Sampling (music)|sample]]), for "it allows individuals to demonstrate intellectual power while simultaneously obscuring the nature and extent of their agency ... It allows producers to use other people's music to convey their own compositional ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Schloss, ''Making Beats: The Art of Sample-Based Hip-Hop''. Wesleyan University Press, 2004, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Twitter===
{{further|Black Twitter}}
Several academics have argued that Black Twitter has become a form of signifyin'. Sarah Florini of the University of Wisconsin-Madison writes that race is normally tied to "corporeal signifiers." Online, in the absence of the body, black users perform their racial identify using wordplay that only those with knowledge of black culture can fully recognize.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Florini, [http://tvn.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/07/1527476413480247.abstract "Tweets, Tweeps, and Signifyin’: Communication and Cultural Performance on 'Black Twitter'"], ''Television &amp; New Media'', March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversational signifyin(g)===
Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, recognized as the first scholar to interject African American women's signifyin' practices into broader linguistic discourses, recorded the following example.  Grace is pregnant and beginning to show, but has not informed her sister yet.  Her sister, seemingly unaware of the situation, comments on her weight gain:
"Grace (noncommittally): Yes, I guess I am putting on a little weight. Rochelle: Now look here, girl, we both standing here soaking wet and you still trying to tell me it ain’t raining? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell-Kernan|first1=Claudia|title=Language behavior in a black urban community|date=1971|publisher=Language-Behavior Research Laboratory|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Roger Matuz and Cathy Falk in their article "Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Current Debate in African-American Literary Criticism, An Introduction," explore the criticism that the term Signifyin(g) has faced since its introduction in Gates text, "The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism."  The main criticism that Gates faces is a confusion surrounding the ideas of a black literary theory informed by Western thought—the same thought that created a purpose for the term Signifyin(g).  Gates responds to these critiques by arguing for "text specific readings of black literature that explore works in relation to themselves and each other rather than viewing them as literal reflections of historical or social aspects of African American society."&lt;ref name=MatuzFalk /&gt; This conversation between texts is the redoubling that comprises Signifyin(g).

Joyce A. Joyce states that Gates is too far removed from the Black experience: "Black creative art is an act of love which attempts to destroy estrangement and elitism by demonstrating a strong fondness or enthusiasm for freedom and an affectionate concern for the life of people, especially black people…it should be the job of the Black literary critic to force ideas to the surface, to give them force in order to affect, to guide, to animate and to arouse the minds and emotions of black people."&lt;ref name=MatuzFalk /&gt;

Other critics, however, support Gates and the term Signifyin(g), noting its "subversive" nature and ability to bring about change to a system.

'''''Smallville''''' is&lt;!--See [[WP:TVLEAD]], all shows listed in present tense even after cancellation since cancellation does not destroy existing episodes--&gt; an American television series developed by writer-producers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]] created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]. The series, initially broadcast by [[The WB]], premiered on October 16, 2001. After ''Smallville''{{'}}s [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]], The WB and [[UPN]] merged to form [[The CW]], the series' later United States broadcaster. ''Smallville'', which ended its [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth and final season]] on May 13, 2011, follows [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) in the fictional town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]], before he becomes known as Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five ''Smallville'' ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and introducing other DC comic-book [[superhero]]es and [[Supervillain|villains]].

Before the series' production, [[Bruce Wayne (TV series)|''Bruce Wayne'']], chronicling the young protagonist's journey toward [[Batman]], was proposed first. Although that series failed to generate interest, it inspired ''Smallville''. Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their "no tights, no flights" rule to the president of [[Warner Bros. Television]], reducing Superman to the bare essentials and examining what led Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel. After seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar departed with little explanation. ''Smallville'' was primarily filmed in and around [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations. Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by [[Mark Snow]], who incorporated elements of [[John Williams]]' musical score from the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]]. In [[Smallville (season 7)|season seven]], Louis Febre (who worked with Snow from the beginning) became the series' primary composer.

''Smallville'' was generally positively received when it began. Former ''Superman'' star [[Christopher Reeve]] expressed approval for the series, making two guest appearances before his death. The [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot episode]] set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4&amp;nbsp;million viewers. Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34&amp;nbsp;million viewers per episode, with [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] the highest-rated at 6.3&amp;nbsp;million. By the end of its run, ''Smallville'' passed ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' as the longest-running North American science-fiction series by episode count.&lt;ref name="gwrecord"&gt;{{cite news|author=Darren Sumner|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/05/smallville-bows-this-week-with-stargates-world-record/ |title=''Smallville'' bows this week&amp;nbsp;— with ''Stargate''{{'}}s world record |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]], the series received accolades ranging from [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] to [[Teen Choice Awards]]. ''Smallville'' spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly comic book, soundtrack recordings and series-related merchandise. All ten seasons are available on DVD in [[DVD region code|regions 1, 2 and 4]]. In April 2012, it continued in comic-book form with a storyline resuming shortly after the [[Finale (Smallville)|series finale]], which ended in 2015.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Tollin/Robbins Productions]] originally wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne, but the feature-film division of Warner Bros. decided to develop an [[Batman Begins|origin movie]] for [[Batman]] and did not want to compete with a television series.&lt;ref name="genesis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8–17|isbn=978-1-84023-795-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Tollin/Robbins approached Peter Roth, president of [[Warner Bros. Television]], about developing a series on a young Superman. That year, [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] developed a pilot based on the film ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]''. After watching the pilot, Roth approached Gough and Millar about developing a pilot about a young Superman;&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; the two made a "no tights, no flights" rule that Clark would not fly or wear the Superman suit during the series.&lt;ref name="No Flights No Tights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelrosenbaum.com/small.html|title=Smallville|author=Barry Garron|date=October 15, 2001|publisher=MichaelRosenbaum.com|accessdate=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allison Mack at ComicCon 2009 NN.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Young, blonde woman with arms folded at a table|Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) was created for the series.]]

Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman to his "bare essence", exploring why Clark Kent became the Man of Steel.&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; They felt that because they were not comic-book fans or familiar with the universe, they would have an unbiased approach to the series. Gough and Millar learned about the characters, researching the comics and choosing what they liked.&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; They pitched their idea to The WB and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on the same day.&lt;ref name="metcom"&gt;{{cite video|title="Metamorphosis" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bidding war between the networks followed, with The WB committing to thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="metcom"/&gt;

Although Roth, Gough and Millar knew the show would be action-oriented, they wanted to reach ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''{{'}}s "middle America iconography". To create atmosphere, the team decided the [[meteor shower]] bringing Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show. The primary source of his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight, it would take away the parents of the girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path. Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain.&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt;

The creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people. They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive him to reach out to the teenagers,&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana.&lt;ref name="pilcom"&gt;{{cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor, Lex's father, whom they saw as conducting an "experiment in extreme parenting."&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; They wanted a younger Kent couple, to be involved in Clark's life and help him on his journey.&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt; [[Chloe Sullivan]] (another character created for the series) was considered the "outsider" the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; rather than a "precursor to [[Lois Lane]]".&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt;

''Smallville'' has been described by Warner Bros. as a from-the-roots reinterpretation of Superman mythology. Since the November 2004 reacquisition of [[Superboy]] by [[Jerry Siegel|the Siegel family]], a [[copyright infringement]] dispute has arisen over [[Superman#Copyright battles|ownership of the fictional town of Smallville]] and a claimed similarity between Superboy and ''Smallville''{{'}}s Clark Kent. According to the Siegel heirs, "''Smallville'' is part of the Superboy copyright" (which they hold).&lt;ref name="Superboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/02/superboy-copyright-faq/|title=Superboy Copyright FAQ|author=Brian Cronin|date=August 2, 2006|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew changes===
On April 3, 2008, after seven seasons with the series, Gough and Millar announced that they were leaving ''Smallville''. The developers thanked the cast and crew for their work, acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as "their vision" of the show. A reason for their departure was not provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=7018|title=Alfred Gough and Miles Millar Exit ''Smallville''|publisher=SuperHeroHype.com|date=April 3, 2008|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gough and Millar were replaced as [[showrunner]]s by [[Todd Slavkin]], [[Darren Swimmer]], Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson. All began writing for the series at the start of the second season, and were executive producers by the seventh season. On February 6, 2009, after one season, the ''L.A.

===Filming===
The series was produced at BB Studios in [[Burnaby]], British Columbia. Although production was initially planned for Australia, [[Vancouver]] had more of a "Middle America landscape". The city provided a site for the Kent farm, doubled for Metropolis, provided a cheaper shooting location and was in the Los Angeles time zone.&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; Smallville's Main Street is a combination of two locations in the town of [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]] and [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]].&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt;
[[File:Smallville-sign1.jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=A white billboard with a blue ribbon around the edges. On the ribbon, "Cloverdale Town Centre" appear in yellow surrounding two banners. The top banner reads, "Destination Cloverdale" and the bottom reads, "Home of Smallville".|Cloverdale welcome sign]]
[[Vancouver Technical Secondary School|Vancouver Technical School]] doubled as the exterior for Smallville High, since the school had the "mid-American largess" wanted by the filmmakers&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt; and was in keeping with Millar's idea that Smallville should be the epitome of "Smalltown, USA".&lt;ref name="Pilot ep"&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.20–23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Templeton Secondary School]] was used for Smallville High's interior.&lt;ref name="locations school/"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/schools/Secondaryschools/03939010/Profile/Schoolhighlights.htm|title=School Highlights ;— School Profile|publisher=vsb.bc.ca|accessdate=October 19, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070526081909/http://www.vsb.bc.ca/schools/Secondaryschools/03939010/Profile/Schoolhighlights.htm |archivedate = May 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During season one, the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville High's red and yellow and distributed large Smallville High Crows logos; so much of the school was painted that it adopted red and yellow as its school colors. The students became accustomed to the film crew (which had to shoot when school was in session), and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the students could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next class.&lt;ref name="Obsession"&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion), pg.69&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kent farm is a working farm in [[Aldergrove, British Columbia|Aldergrove]]. Owned by the Anderlinis, the crew painted their home yellow for the show.&lt;ref name="metcom"/&gt; Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at [[Hatley Castle]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt; The interiors were filmed at Shannon Mews in Vancouver, also the set for the ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' pilot and the film ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]''.&lt;ref name="pilcom"/&gt; Clova Cinema, in Cloverdale was used for exteriors of the Talon, ''Smallville''{{'}}s coffeehouse.&lt;ref name="locations talon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloverdalebia.com/cgi-bin/itsmy/go.exe?page=20&amp;domain=1&amp;webdir=cloverdale|title=Cloverdale Filming Including Smallville|publisher=Cloverdale Business Improvement Association|accessdate=January 14, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214151358/http://www.cloverdalebia.com/cgi-bin/itsmy/go.exe?page=20&amp;domain=1&amp;webdir=cloverdale|archivedate=February 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series made extensive use of [[Steadicam]] and crane shots.  Some episodes also featured camera shots from helicopters.

The story is told from Clark's point of view, so color schemes and camera selection illustrate how he interprets his environment. When he is safe at home, the colors are "warm and gentle" earth tones and the camera movement is "very gentle". When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger, the lighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile. When danger is present, the lighting becomes colder and the camera is [[Hand-held camera|handheld]] to allow for more "extreme angles". In Metropolis "clean, hard-lined architecture" predominates, with blues, purples and reflective metals the dominant scheme. The same concept is used for the characters; Lex usually has a "glass, steel background", and Lionel has a white or "clinical blue" background. Lex typically wears black, grey and "cool tones" (purples and blues). Clark is represented by red, yellow and blue, similar to the traditional Superman costume, and "All-American" red, white and blue.&lt;ref name="memoria com"&gt;{{cite video|people=Al Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Kent Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title="Memoria" commentary|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

===Music===
Composer [[Mark Snow]] worked with producer Ken Horton to create ''Smallville''{{'}}s score. Snow composed music as he watched the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a "typical action-adventure" television show, "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".&lt;ref name="Snow1"&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.154–155&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#BCD4E6|align=right|quote=I get a locked picture on a videotape which syncs up with all my gear in the studio. I write the music, finish it up, mix it up, send it through the airwaves on the internet, and the music editor puts it in. They call up usually and say, 'Thank you, well done.' Sometimes they call and say, "Thank you, not so well done—can you change this or that?" I say "Sure," make the changes and send it back.&lt;ref name="Snow1"/&gt;|source=—Mark Snow, on composing music for each episode}}
The main ''Smallville'' theme was not composed by Snow, although he composed opening themes for other shows (including ''[[The X-Files]]''). The series' opening music is "[[Save Me (Remy Zero song)|Save Me]]" by [[Remy Zero]]. Snow composed the closing-credits music, which was intended as ''Smallville''{{'}}s theme. During the first two seasons, the closing-credits music was a potential theme for the series (before "Save Me" was selected); it was more "heroic" and "in-your-face". Snow was told during season two that the closing credits needed new music, since the show had evolved and the existing music was no longer suitable, and he created a new, toned-down score with a more "melodic" sound.&lt;ref name="Obsession"/&gt; Snow has also reworked music from the previous [[Superman in film|''Superman'' films]]. [[John Williams]]' musical score for the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' was used in season two's "Rosetta" (which featured a guest appearance by [[Christopher Reeve]]) and several times in the season-two finale. To save money Snow recorded his version of Williams' score, since using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams' orchestra.&lt;ref name="Exodus"&gt;Simpson, Paul, pp.102–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Randall Larson on May 23, 2008 Snow said that he would not be returning to ''Smallville'', citing the joint workload of ''Smallville'' and ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', but would return for ''Ghost Whisperer''. Reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was "more [about] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randall Larson|url=http://www.buysoundtrax.com/larsons_soundtrax_5_23_08.html|title=Interview: Mark Snow on X-Files: I Want To Believe|publisher=BuySoundTrax.com|date=May 23, 2008|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for ''Smallville'' in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for ''Smallville'' there was a shift to "thematic development" in the score, paralleling the characters' growth: "As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his growth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a 'Superman' theme would be required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Pulliam|url=http://www.smallvilleph.com/2009/09/louis-febre-exclusive-interview/|title=Louis Febre Exclusive Interview|publisher=Smallville PH|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode's storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre's scores were not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 2|date=March 2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=62–65|isbn=1-84023-947-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In season three's "Slumber", producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. [[R.E.M.]] was suggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode's featured band with its story (which revolved around [[Rapid eye movement (sleep)|REM sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Simpson|title=Smallville Season 3 Companion|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|date=September 2005|pages=26–29|isbn=978-1-84023-952-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season, Al Gough wanted to use [[Johnny Cash]]'s cover of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]" for the final scene of "Shattered" (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one-way mirror at [[Belle Reve]] sanitarium) as soon as he read the episode's script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song's use in the episode would honor his memory, gave ''Smallville'' the rights.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

For season three's "Resurrection" and "Memoria", songs were chosen as symbolism for the characters. In "Resurrection", [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]]'s "[[Echoes (The Rapture album)|Infatuation]]" was used during a scene with Lex and Lana to symbolize the question, "Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other?"&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion), pp.70–73&lt;/ref&gt; For "Memoria" Gough wanted to use [[Evanescence]]'s "[[My Immortal]]" for the episode's final scene, telling Wade-Reed that he saw the song as being about mothers. In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother, [[Lara (comics)|Lara]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion), pp.100–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Season three's "Velocity" provided the music editors with the opportunity to use [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], rarely used in the series. The episode, similar to ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', focused on Pete. Wade-Reed heard of British hip-hop artist [[Dizzee Rascal]], and was the first person in the United States to secure the rights to Rascal's album.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.62–65&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Beeman directs episodes, and sometimes scenes, with particular songs in mind. For "Vortex" in season two, he used [[Coldplay]]'s "[[In My Place]]" for the final scene.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 2 Companion), pg.16&lt;/ref&gt; In the season-two finale "Exodus", Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up at the Kent barn before Lex's wedding to [[Matthew Good]]'s "Weapon". The lyrics speak of an angel and devil "by my side", and Beeman timed specific shots to the song's lyrics.&lt;ref name="Exodus"/&gt;

===Reception===
''Smallville'' set a WB record as its highest-rated series debut, with 8.4&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned in for the pilot.&lt;ref name="Pilot rate"&gt;{{cite news|author=Seth Gunderson |url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=908 |title=Smallville, Kansas.

''Smallville'' appeared on the cover of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as one of five new shows to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rob Allstetter|title=Mass o' Media: ''Smallville'' gets a full season|journal=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|issue=1466|date=December 21, 2001|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its first season, the series was sixth on the [[Parents Television Council]]'s 10-best list of broadcast programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=14098|title=Broadcast TV may test limits on sex, language|publisher=Baptist Press|date=August 26, 2002|accessdate=June 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033517/http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=14098|archivedate=September 28, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levin, acknowledging early concerns that ''Smallville'' had become a [[villain of the week]] series, said that season two would introduce "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes" and become less of a "serialized show".&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20020116owen0116p3.asp|title=Tuned In: UPN got 'Buffy,' but WB gets ratings|publisher=Post-Gazette|date=January 16, 2002|accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gough, although each succeeding season relied more on season-long story arcs, an occasional villain-of-the-week story was necessary. The villain-of-the-week stories were more harshly criticized by fans of the Superman mythology, but Gough wanted to please them and The WB's general audience (teenagers who preferred villain-of-the-week stories over episodes focusing on the Superman mythology).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.38–41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Reeve]], star of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' films]], expressed his approval of the show:&lt;blockquote&gt;I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [''Smallville''] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom is doing a good job following the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul, pp.78–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, ''Smallville's'' Clark Kent was a better representation of the original material and remained "true to the heart of the story" by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Karl Heimueller|title=The 'Superman' Fanboy Dilemma, Part 5: What If 'Returns' Is (Gasp) Kraptonite?|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1535143/06262006/story.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=June 27, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Michael. "TV's New Heroes", ''[[TV Guide]]'', July 11, 2011, pages 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; but Christopher Hooton of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' wrote that ''Smallville'' was a story which did not need to be told: "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/865637-smallville-limps-toward-the-finish-line|title=Smallville limps toward the finish line|accessdate=June 8, 2011|date=June 7, 2011|author=Christopher Hooton|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
''Smallville'' has generated other media and spinoffs, from young-adult novels and comic books to Internet-based mini-episodes with characters from the series. It influenced the British TV series, ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/29/bbc.television|title=Merlin: BBC cues up TV and cinema ads|author=Mark Sweney|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=August 29, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Two series of novels have been published since ''Smallville''{{'}}s second season. A series of eight young-adult novels was published by [[Hachette Book Group#Inactive imprints|Aspect Publishing]] from October 2002 to March 2004, and a second series of ten young-adult novels was published by [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown Young Readers]] from October 2002 to April 2004. A bimonthly comic-book series, which often tied into the series, was also published.

====Young adult novels====
Three novels were published on October 1, 2002: one by Aspect and two by Little, Brown Young Readers. The Aspect novel (''Smallville: Strange Visitors'') was written by [[Roger Stern]], with Clark and his friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who set up shop in Smallville and use kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Strange Visitors|author=[[Roger Stern]]|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=[[Warner Aspect|Aspect]]|isbn=0-446-61213-8|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little, Brown Young Readers first published ''Arrival'' by Michael Teitelbaum, chronicling the [[Pilot (Smallville)|series' pilot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Arrival|author=Michael Teitelbaum|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=Little, Brown Young Readers|isbn=0-316-17359-2|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second novel (''See No Evil'', by series writers [[Cherie Bennett]] and [[Jeff Gottesfeld]]) follows Dawn Mills, a young actress who wants to attend [[Juilliard]]. Dawn, who can become invisible, wants to get revenge on the people who have been talking behind her back but is stopped by Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: See No Evil|author=[[Cherie Bennett]] &amp; [[Jeff Gottesfeld]]|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=Little, Brown Young Readers|isbn=0-316-17301-0|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See No Evil'' was one of the original storylines for season one's "Shimmer".&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville'' No. 10, pg. 37, [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN B001DF5N62]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2002 Aspect published [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant's]] ''Smallville: Dragon'', about an ex-convict who assumes the abilities and appearance of a dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives him to try to kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Dragon|author=Alan Grand|date=November 1, 2002|publisher=[[Warner Aspect|Aspect]]|isbn=0-446-61214-6|page=256|authorlink=Alan Grant (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' ''Flight'', about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Flight|author=[[Cherie Bennett]] &amp; [[Jeff Gottesfeld]]|date=December 1, 2002|publisher=Little, Brown Young Readers|isbn=0-316-17468-8|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flight'' (like ''See No Evil'') was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville'' No. 10, pg. 38, [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN B001DF5N62]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, ''Hauntings'' follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Hauntings|author=[[Nancy Holder]]|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=[[Warner Aspect|Aspect]]|isbn=0-446-61215-4|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little, Brown Young Readers then published ''Animal Rage'' by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches).

Little, Brown Young Readers published the next two books in April and June 2003. The first, ''Speed'', was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld. The second, ''Buried Secrets'', was written by Suzan Colon. In ''Speed'', a boy uses an hourglass his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit [[hate crime]]s without being caught. Clark stops him before he disrupts a local multicultural festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Speed|author=[[Cherie Bennett]] &amp; [[Jeff Gottesfeld]]|date=April 16, 2003|publisher=Little, Brown Young Readers|isbn=0-316-16816-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Buried Secrets'' Clark and Lex fall in love with a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher, jeopardizing their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Buried Secrets|author=Suzan Colon|date=June 1, 2003|publisher=Little, Brown Young Readers|isbn=0-316-16848-3|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2004 Aspect published [[Diana G. Gallagher]]'s ''Shadows'', about a girl and her father who move to Smallville; the father creates murderous monsters. Jonathan Kent assumes that the deaths are related to LuthorCorp, creating tension with his son. Clark discovers the truth to prove Lex's innocence, stopping the creatures before they can kill again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smallville: Shadows|author=[[Diana G.

====Comic books====
''Smallville''{{'}}s first venture into comics was "Elemental", a one-off story by Gough and Millar which appeared in ''[[TV Guide]]'' during the series' first season and set in that period.&lt;ref name="Elemental"&gt;{{Comic strip reference | Cowriters = [[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] and [[Martin Pasko]] | Coartists = [[Terry Dodson]], [[Rachel Dodson]], [[Alex Sinclair]] and Tom B.

Entitled ''Smallville: The Comic'', it has two stories. The first, "Raptor" by [[Mark Verheiden]] and Roy Martinez, is about an abused boy who mutates into a [[Velociraptor|raptor]] (thanks to kryptonite) and tries to get revenge on the Luthor family. [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]] and [[John Paul Leon]] wrote "Exile and The Kingdom", with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father offers him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one.&lt;ref name="Comic review"&gt;{{cite news|author=R.J. Carter|title=Comic Book Review: Smallville: The Comic|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=1457|publisher=The Trades|date=October 28, 2002|accessdate=August 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522225217/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=1457|archivedate=May 22, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics then began publishing a bimonthly comic with stories about ''Smallville'' characters. Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic a companion to the series rather than a non-canonical version. According to Carpenter, the series expands on events in the series (such as season-ending cliffhangers) and gives "additional depth" to characters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed additional explanation.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;{{cite news|author=Arune Singh|title=Somebody Save Me: Clint Carpenter talks 'Smallville,' the TV show and the comic|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2895|publisher=Comic Book Reviews|date=December 1, 2003|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was originally intended to be in charge of the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic book was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; The series tied into the TV series, the ''Chloe Chronicles'' webisodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America Online Offers Exclusive Access To Series Of New Online Adventures Tied To The WB's Hit Series 'Smallville'|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,670347,00.html|publisher=Time Warner|date=April 14, 2004|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Smallville''-related webpages,&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production.&lt;ref name="Comic review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R.J.

====''Smallville Season Eleven''====
The first digital issue of a ''Smallville Season Eleven'' comic book was released on April 13, 2012; the first print issue was published on May 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/02/09/announcing-smallville-season-11/|title=Announcing Smallville Season 11|author=Brandy Phillips|publisher=DCcomics.com|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the comic book (written by ''Smallville'' executive story editor [[Bryan Q. Miller]]), set six months after Darkseid's attack, Clark no longer fights crime as "The Blur" but as "Superman". Although Clark is generally accepted by the public, some distrust him (including Lex Luthor, despite his memory loss after his encounter with Tess Mercer).&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #1 (April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; ''TV Guide'' reported that "Detective", a new series of adventures paralleling the TV series and the comic series' second arc, would be published digitally on the title's off-week beginning January 4, 2013. A new arc, "Effigy", would feature a team-up of recurring character [[Martian Manhunter|John Jones]] and [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Smallville-Season-11-Comic-Book-1057735.aspx|title=Smallville Season 11 Comic Book Features Impulse and Expands its Universe|author=Rich Sands|date=December 13, 2012|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics cancelled the series after nineteen issues at the end of the "Olympus" story arc, with the rest of the season-eleven story continuing as miniseries under the ''Season Eleven'' banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Smallville-Comic-Book-1069971.aspx|title=Exclusive: Smallville Comic Book Changes Format, Heads for a Crisis|author=Rich Sands|date=September 6, 2013|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2015, DC Comics ended the ''Smallville Season Eleven'' with story arc "Continuity", which serves as the finale of the television franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryan Q.

===''Chloe Chronicles''===
Allison Mack's character, Chloe Sullivan, has starred in two promotional tie-in series: ''Smallville: Chloe Chronicles'', and ''Vengeance Chronicles''. Two volumes of ''Chloe Chronicles'' totaled eleven mini-episodes. In the first volume Chloe investigated events leading to the death of Earl Jenkins, who held Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first-season episode "[[Smallville (season 1)#ep8|Jitters]]". It aired from April 29 to May 20, 2003 to AOL subscribers.&lt;ref name="Gregorian"/&gt; After the first volume received positive responses from viewers, the second volume was created as a continuation with Sam Jones III as Pete Ross. This volume used the ''Smallville'' comic books as a secondary tie-in to the series. Viewers could watch ''Smallville'', ''Chloe's Chronicles'' and finish with the ''Smallville'' comic book, which would provide an "enhanced backstory to the online segments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Jonah Weiland|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3392|title=AOL New online adventures tied to "Smallville" hit AOL|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=April 14, 2004|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later series, ''Vengeance Chronicles'', is a spinoff of the fifth-season episode "[[Smallville (season 5)#ep101|Vengeance]]". In this series Chloe joins a costumed vigilante, whom she calls the "[[Acrata#In other media|Angel of Vengeance]]", to expose Lex Luthor's Level 33.1 experiments on meteor-infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Smallville: Vengeance Chronicles Promo Webisodes|people=Alfred Gough &amp; Miles Millar|year=2006|publisher=Warner Bros. Video, Inc.|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for an online show about Chloe originated with Mark Warshaw, who ran the show's website and was in charge of the DVDs. The series intended to wrap up "unfinished business" from the television show.&lt;ref name="Chronicles"/&gt; Although ''Smallville: Chloe Chronicles'' began on AOL, it made its way to the United Kingdom's Channel 4 website.&lt;ref name="Chronicles"/&gt; According to Lisa Gregorian, senior vice president for television of Warner Bros. Marketing Services, "Our goal is to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience, just as music videos did for record promotion."&lt;ref name="Gregorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2003/04/29/4108.shtml|title=America Online has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and The WB Television Network to produce new mini-dramas to publicise Smallville.|publisher=BBC |date=April 29, 2003|accessdate=March 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allison Mack described the show as "very [[Nancy Drew]] and mysterious": "I think it's a bit more like ''[[The X-Files]]'' or ''[[NYPD Blue]]''. The Chronicles are like a detective story, with Chloe following clues and interviewing people, going from spot to spot, figuring things out."&lt;ref name="Chronicles"&gt;Simpson, Paul, (Season 2 Companion) pp.154—155&lt;/ref&gt; The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell; Mack was given script approval for the series, allowing her to review and make changes to the script. Warshaw communicated with Gough and Millar to expand ''Smallville'' stories in ''Chloe's Chronicles''.&lt;ref name="Chronicles"/&gt;

===Promotional tie-ins===

The online series allowed viewers to investigate with the fictional team to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, working with a team of artists on the illustrations. Nilson received the plot for each comic episode as ''Smallville''{{'}}s production crew was filming its current television episode.

During the sixth season there was talk of spinning off the [[Green Arrow]] into his own series, but Hartley refused to talk about the possibility of a spin-off because of his role on ''Smallville''. The actor felt it his duty to respect what the show had accomplished in five seasons, and not "steal the spotlight" because there was "talk" of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, "talking" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=136–138|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
It's [[Prom]] time at [[Beverly Hills]] High! Ben Birnbaum is back from [[Princeton University]] for the summer but also visiting is a friend of his family's. Maddy, a junior at the rival Pacific Palisades high school who has just had [[Gastric bypass surgery]] is staying with the Birnbaums, and to Anna Percy's disdain, has quite the newly curvy figure and seems to be flirty with Ben. Ben assures Anna that he thinks of Maddy as a little sister but Anna isn't sure and acts rather coldly to the girl throughout the novel. Anna feels ashamed for actually getting jealous so she asks Sam and the rest of the A-list crew to give her a makeover. In the end, it is revealed that Maddy has a crush on one of her teachers.

Meanwhile, the Beverly Hills High School Prom is being thrown by two A-list wannabes, Jazz and Fee (short for Jasmine and Ophelia, respectively). No one is excited because it means the prom will be just as lame as them but Sam gets the idea to shoot a short documentary about the drama of organizing a high school prom to enter anonymously in a film contest, to prove once and for all that she can stand outside of her father's shadow. To her surprise, Sam begins to feel a sense of kinsmen ship to the two girls and when the prom location is lost, she generously secures the colosseum set being used for her father's remake of [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ#Film.2C radio and television|Ben Hur]]. Sam invites Eduardo to be her date but he is unavailable due to his commitments at the Peruvian consulate so Sam invites Parker, as friends.

Prom is amazing, especially since Dee is released from Ojai, the rehab center/mental hospital she was committed to in [[Back in Black]]. However, she is dateless so Cammie sets her up on a blind date with Jack Walker, a friend from Princeton who is in L.A. and is hoping to break into reality television. The two hit it off at prom and to thank Sam for helping organize an awesome prom, the entire student body elects Sam prom queen but she is slightly dismayed as she can't enter her film anonymously anymore.

At the post-prom party, Sam and Parker share a kiss before getting caught by Eduardo, who left his parents' anniversary party to surprise Sam. He is hurt and breaks it off, despite Sam's pleading.

Also throughout the novel, Cammie begins investigating the circumstances of her mother's death with the help of Adam, who grows increasingly worried for her. The two discover the police report from the night her mother accidentally drowned and discover new information that they previously did not know: Dina and Jackson Sharpe were also on the boat. It was said in the report that Dina was having an affair with her father, Clarke. Cammie suspects that the two conspired to get rid of her mother. She tells Sam this new information and Sam insists on helping out as well.

'''Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park''' is a [[Florida State Parks|Florida State Park]] located in [[White Springs, Florida|White Springs]] off [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|U.S. 41]], along the [[Suwannee River]] in north Florida.

[[Stephen Foster]] is famous for having written the song "[[Old Folks At Home]]," also known as "Way Down Upon the Suwannee River." The song, referring  nostalgically to "home far, far away," is Florida's [[state song]].&lt;ref name=southernhistoryfoster&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center - White Springs, Florida|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/stephenfoster.html|publisher=Explore Southern History|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Among the wildlife of the park are [[gopher tortoise]]s, [[box turtle]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[wood duck]]s, and a variety of birds.

==Recreational activities==
Activities include [[picnic]]king, [[hiking]] and [[bicycling]], as well as horseback riding, [[canoe]]ing, and [[wildlife]] viewing.

Amenities include picnic tables, wooded trails, boat access to the Suwannee River, and riverside [[Cottage#North America|rental cabin]]s.

There is a craft shop which sells Floridian and [[Southeastern U.S.|Southeastern]] folk art and crafts.

==Stephen Foster Museum==
The Stephen Foster Museum honors the accomplishments of American composer [[Stephen Foster]] and features [[dioramas]] and exhibits about his famous songs, including ''[[Old Folks at Home]]'', more commonly known by the words of its first line as "(Way Down Upon the) Swanee River."  

Honoring Foster, who never visited Florida, was the idea of [[Josiah K. Lilly, Sr.]], the son of [[Eli Lilly]]. He proposed the memorial in 1931.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridastateparks.org/history/parkhistory.cfm?parkid=86|title=Florida State Parks 75th Anniversary 1935 - 2010: Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park (History)|publisher=[[Florida State Parks]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Stephen Foster Memorial Carillon}}

==Carillon==
The ''Stephen Foster Memorial Carillon'', the park's 97-[[tubular bell]] [[carillon]] tower, was built in 1957 by the [[J.C. Deagan Company]]. Over four decades, the company built and installed in excess of 500 carillons worldwide based, on their own 1916 design. The setup at White Springs was their largest and last carillon. It is noted as the "world's largest tubular bell instrument"&lt;ref name=YAHOO&gt;[http://travel.yahoo.com/p-parks-216921-stephen_foster_state_folk_culture_center-i "Stephen Foster State Folk Culture Center"] Yahoo Travel&lt;/ref&gt; from the company.  

The carillon plays Foster's songs throughout the day.  A second museum area inside the tower also features exhibits about Stephen Foster and the carillon.&lt;ref name=YAHOO /&gt;
The carillon was not working and a restoration fund is raising money to restore and preserve.

==Special events==
Every year, the park hosts the [http://www.floridastateparks.org/folkfest/default.htm Florida Folk Festival] on [[Memorial Day]] weekend.

==Hours==
Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

==Plot==
[[Holden Caulfield]], a teenager, is living in an unspecified institution in [[Southern California]] near [[Hollywood]] in 1951. Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B, an author and [[World War II]] veteran whom Holden is angered at for becoming a [[screenwriter]], one month after his discharge.  As he waits, Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas.

Holden begins his story at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an exclusive [[boarding school]] in Agerstown, [[Pennsylvania]], on the Saturday afternoon of the traditional [[American football|football]] game with a rival school.  Holden has been expelled from Pencey due to poor work and is not to return after Christmas break, which begins the following Wednesday.  He plans to return home on that day so that he will not be present when his parents receive notice of his expulsion.  After forfeiting a [[fencing]] match in New York by forgetting the equipment in the subway, he is invited to the home of his history teacher, Mr. Spencer.  Spencer is a well-meaning but long-winded old man.  Spencer greets him and offers him advice, but embarrasses Holden by further criticizing Holden's work in his subject in a rude manner.

Holden returns to his dorm wearing the new red hunting cap he bought in New York. His dorm neighbor Robert Ackley is one of the few students also missing the game.  Ackley, unpopular among his peers, disturbs Holden with his impolite questioning and mannerisms. Holden, who feels sorry for Ackley, tolerates his presence. Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date.  However, Holden is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is an old friend, Jane Gallagher, whom Holden had romantic feelings for and feels protective of. That night, Holden decides to go to a [[Cary Grant]] comedy with his best friend Mal Brossard and Ackley. Since Ackley and Mal had already seen the film, they end up just playing pinball and returning to Pencey. When Stradlater returns hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden wrote for him about the baseball glove of Holden's late brother Allie, and refuses to reveal whether he slept with Jane.  Enraged, Holden punches him, and Stradlater easily wins the ensuing fight. When Holden continues insulting him after the fight, Stradlater knocks him unconscious and leaves him with a bloody nose. After leaving for Ackley's room, Holden is disappointed when he treats him rudely. Fed up with the so-called "phonies" at Pencey Prep, Holden impulsively decides to leave Pencey early, sells his [[typewriter]] to earn money, and catches a train to [[Pennsylvania Station (1910-1963)|Penn Station]] in New York. Holden intends to stay away from his home in a hotel until Wednesday, when his parents would have received news of his expulsion. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey student named Ernest Morrow, and lies to her about himself and her son.

In a [[taxicab]], Holden inquires with the driver about whether the ducks in the [[Central Park]] lagoon migrate during winter, a subject he brings up often, but the man barely responds.  Holden checks into the dilapidated Edmont Hotel.  He spends an evening dancing with three tourist women from [[Seattle]] in the hotel lounge and enjoys dancing with one, though is disappointed that he is unable to hold a conversation with them. Following an unpromising visit to Ernie's Nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], Holden becomes preoccupied with his internal angst and agrees to have a [[prostitute]] named Sunny visit his room. His attitude toward the girl changes the minute she enters the room; she seems about the same age as him. Holden becomes uncomfortable with the situation, and when he tells her all he wants to do is talk, she becomes annoyed and leaves. Even though he still paid her the right amount for her time, she returns with her [[pimp]] Maurice and demands more money.  Holden insults Maurice, and after Sunny takes the money from Holden's wallet, Maurice punches him in the stomach and leaves with Sunny. Afterwards, Holden imagines that he has been shot by Maurice, and pictures murdering him with an [[automatic firearm|automatic]] pistol.

The next morning, Holden, becoming increasingly depressed and in need of personal connection, calls Sally Hayes, a familiar date. Although Holden claims that she is "the queen of all phonies", they agree to meet that afternoon to attend a play at the [[Biltmore Theater]].  Holden shops for a special [[vinyl record|record]], "Little Shirley Beans", for his 10-year-old sister Phoebe. He spots a small boy singing "[[Comin' Thro' the Rye|If a body catch a body coming through the rye]]", which lifts his mood. Although Holden's date initially goes well, it soon sours after Sally introduces her friend George. After the play, Holden and Sally go ice skating at [[Rockefeller Center]], where Holden suddenly begins ranting against society and frightens Sally. He impulsively invites Sally to run away with him that night to live in the wilderness of [[New England]], but she is uninterested in his hastily conceived plan and declines. The conversation turns sour, and the two angrily part ways.

Holden decides to meet his old classmate, a [[Columbia University|Columbia]] student named Carl Luce, for drinks at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. During the meeting, Holden annoys Carl with his fixation on sex. After Luce leaves, Holden gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, and calls an icy Sally. Exhausted and out of money, Holden wanders over to Central Park to investigate the ducks, breaking Phoebe's record on the way.  Nostalgically recalling his experience in [[elementary school]] and the unchanging dioramas in the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] that he enjoyed visiting as a child, Holden heads home to see Phoebe.  He sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out, and wakes up Phoebe – the only person with whom he seems to be able to communicate his true feelings. Although Phoebe is happy to see Holden, she quickly deduces that he has been expelled, and chastises him for his aimlessness and his apparent dislikes towards everything. When asked if he cares about anything, Holden shares a selfless fantasy he has been thinking about (based on a [[Mondegreen|mishearing]] of [[Robert Burns]]'s ''[[Comin' Through the Rye]]''): he pictures himself as the sole guardian of thousands of children playing in a huge [[rye]] field on the edge of a cliff. His job is to catch the children if, in their abandon, they come close to falling off the brink; to be, in effect, the "catcher in the rye". Because of this misinterpretation, Holden believes that to be the "catcher in the rye" means to save children from losing their innocence.

When his mother returns home, Holden slips out and visits his former and much-admired English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who is now a [[New York University]] professor. Mr. Antolini expresses concern that Holden is headed for "a terrible fall" and advises him to begin applying himself. Although Holden is exhausted, he is courteous and considers his advice. Mr. Antolini also provides Holden with a place to sleep. Holden is upset when he wakes up in the night to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a [[homosexual]] advance. Confused and uncertain, he leaves and spends the rest of the night in a waiting room at [[Grand Central Station]], where he sinks further into despair and expresses regret over leaving Mr. Antolini. He spends most of Monday morning wandering [[Fifth Avenue]].

Losing hope of finding belonging or companionship in the city, Holden impulsively decides that he will head out [[Western United States|west]] and live a reclusive lifestyle as a gas station attendant. He decides to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say farewell.  While visiting Phoebe's school to give a forged excuse note, Holden becomes quite annoyed by graffiti containing the word "[[fuck]]", and becomes distressed by the thought of children learning the word's meaning.  When he meets Phoebe at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him, even though she was looking forward to acting as [[Benedict Arnold]] in a play that Friday. Holden refuses to let her come with him, which upsets Phoebe, so Holden decides not to leave after all. He tries to cheer her up by allowing her to skip school and taking her to the [[Central Park Zoo]], but she remains angry with him. They eventually reach the zoo's [[carousel]], where Phoebe reconciles with Holden after he buys her a ticket. Holden is finally filled with happiness and joy at the sight of Phoebe riding in the rain.

In a short epilogue, Holden briefly alludes to encountering his parents that night and "getting sick" (implying a [[tuberculosis diagnosis]]), mentioning that he will be attending another school in September.  Holden says that he doesn't want to tell anything more because, surprisingly, he has found himself missing his former classmates.  He warns the reader that telling others about their own experiences will lead them to miss the people who shared them.

==History==
Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in ''The Catcher in the Rye''. While at [[Columbia University]], Salinger wrote a short story called "[[The Young Folks]]" in [[Whit Burnett]]'s class; one character from this story has been described as a "thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes". In November 1941 he sold the story "[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]", which featured Holden Caulfield, to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but it wasn't published until December 21, 1946, due to World War II. The story "[[I'm Crazy]]", which was published in the December 22, 1945, issue of ''[[Collier's]]'', contained material that was later used in ''The Catcher in the Rye''. In 1946, ''The New Yorker'' accepted a 90-page manuscript about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Jack |year=1991 |title=New essays on the Catcher in the Rye |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521377980 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ic6NhqIcWhQC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style==
''The Catcher in the Rye'' is narrated in a [[First-person narrative|subjective]] style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.

Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage [[colloquialism|colloquial]] speech of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costello |first=Donald P. |date=October 1959 |title=The Language of 'The Catcher in the Rye' |journal=American Speech |doi=10.2307/454038 |jstor=454038 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=172–182 |quote=Most critics who glared at ''The Catcher in the Rye'' at the time of its publication thought that its language was a true and authentic rendering of teenage colloquial speech.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words and phrases that appear frequently include:
* "Old" – term of familiarity or endearment.
* "Phony" – superficially acting a certain way only to change others’ perceptions
* "That killed me" – one found that hilarious or astonishing
* "Flit" – homosexual
* "Crumbum" or "crumby" – inadequate, insufficient, disappointing
* "Snowing" – sweet-talking
* "I got a bang out of that" – one found it hilarious or exciting
* "Shoot the bull" – have a conversation containing false elements
* "Give her the time" – sexual intercourse
* "Necking" – kissing
* "Chew the fat" or "chew the rag" – small-talk
* "Rubbering" or "rubbernecks" – idle onlooking/onlookers
* "The Can" – the bathroom

==Interpretations==
[[Bruce Brooks]] held that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from [[young adult fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Brooks |date=May 1, 2004 |title=Holden at sixteen |work=[[Horn Book Magazine]] |url=http://archive.hbook.com/magazine/articles/2004/may04_brooks.asp |accessdate=December 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071221100107/http://archive.hbook.com/magazine/articles/2004/may04_brooks.asp |archivedate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, [[Louis Menand]] thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that "alienation is just a phase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Menand |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Menand |date=September 27, 2001 |title=Holden at fifty |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/10/01/011001fa_FACT3?currentPage=all |accessdate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name="Onstad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Holden is quick to become emotional. "I felt sorry as hell for..." is a phrase he often uses.

Peter Beidler, in his ''A Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye"'', identifies the movie that the prostitute "Sunny" refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy falls off a boat. The movie is ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937), starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. Sunny says that Holden looks like the boy who fell off the boat. Beidler shows (page 28) a still of the boy, played by child-actor [[Freddie Bartholomew]].

Each Caulfield child has literary talent. D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood; Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill (Holden's own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in "phony" as the writer has no space for his own imagination, and describes D.B.'s move to Hollywood to write for films as "prostituting himself"; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove; and Phoebe is a diarist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Svogun |first=Margaret Dumais |date=Winter 2003 |title=J.D.

This "catcher in the rye" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the "catcher" and the "fallen"; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yasuhiro Takeuchi |date=Fall 2002 |title=The Burning Carousel and the Carnivalesque: Subversion and Transcendence at the Close of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=320–337 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=7592838&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[Salinger (book)|biography of Salinger]], [[David Shields]] and [[Shane Salerno]] argue that: "''The Catcher in the Rye'' can best be understood as a disguised [[war novel]]." Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, "took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shields |first1=David |last2=Salerno |first2=Shane |date=2013 |title=Salinger |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=xvi |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Salinger-David-Shields/dp/1476744831 |accessdate=August 23, 2015 |quote=The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel. Salinger emerged from the war incapable of believing in the heroic, noble ideals we like to think our cultural institutions uphold.

==Reception==
''The Catcher in the Rye'' has been listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nash K. Burger called it "an unusually brilliant novel,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burger |first=Nash K. |date=July 16, 1951 |title=Books of The Times |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-rye02.html |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stern |first=James |date=July 15, 1951 |title=Aw, the World's a Crumby Place |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-rye01.html |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George H. W. Bush]] called it a "marvelous book," listing it among the books that have inspired him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academy of Achievement – George H. W. Bush |work=The American Academy of Achievement |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/bus0int-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970213181840/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/bus0int-1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 13, 1997 |accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the [[BBC]]'s Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded "as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager. Holden is at various times disaffected, disgruntled, alienated, isolated, directionless, and sarcastic."&lt;ref name="finlo rohrer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohrer |first=Finlo |date=June 5, 2009 |title=The why of the Rye |work=BBC News Magazine |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8084931.stm |accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Gopnik]] considers it one of the "three perfect books" in American literature, along with ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' and ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', and believes that "no book has ever captured a city better than ''Catcher in the Rye'' captured New York in the fifties."&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam. ''The New Yorker'', February 8, 2010, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Pruchnic wrote an appraisal of The Catcher in the Rye after the death of J.D. Salinger. In this article, Pruchnic focuses on how the novel continues to be received incredibly well, even after it has aged many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a “teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come”.&lt;ref&gt;Pruchnic, Jeff. "Holden at Sixty: Reading Catcher After the Age of Irony." Critical Insights: ------------The Catcher in The Rye (2011): 49–63. Literary Reference Center. Web. February 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Gates]] said that ''The Catcher in the Rye'' is one of his favorite books ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2013 |title=The Best Books I Read in 2013 |last=Gates |first=Bill |work=gatesnotes.com|access-date=August 7, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all reception has been positive; the book has had its share of critics. Rohrer writes, "Many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in.  J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique.  That is to say, he has done nothing."&lt;ref name="finlo rohrer" /&gt;  Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it "captures existential teenage angst" and has a "complex central character" and "accessible conversational style"; while at the same time some readers may dislike the "use of 1940s New York vernacular" and other things.

==Censorship and use in schools==
In 1960, a teacher in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] was fired for assigning the novel in class; however, she was later reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dutra |first=Fernando |date=September 25, 2006 |title=U.

==Attempted adaptations==

===In film===
Early in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Hamilton (critic) |title=In Search of J. D. Salinger |year=1988 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-394-53468-9}} p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story "[[Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut]]" was released; renamed ''[[My Foolish Heart (film)|My Foolish Heart]]'', the film took great liberties with Salinger's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work.&lt;ref name="Onstad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;Berg, A. Scott. ''Goldwyn: A Biography''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989. {{ISBN|1-57322-723-4}}. p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The enduring popularity of ''The Catcher in the Rye'', however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel's screen rights.&lt;ref&gt;See Dr. Peter Beidler's A'' Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's the Catcher in the Rye'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''The Catcher in the Rye'' was first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], producer of ''My Foolish Heart''.&lt;ref name="berg" /&gt; In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite [[Margaret O'Brien]], and, if he couldn't play the part himself, to "forget about it." Almost 50 years later, the writer [[Joyce Maynard]] definitively concluded, "The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger."&lt;ref name="mayn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maynard |first=Joyce |authorlink=Joyce Maynard |title=At Home in the World |year=1998 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-19556-7 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s that [[Jerry Lewis]] "tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,"&lt;ref name="mayn" /&gt; despite Lewis not having read the novel until he was in his thirties.&lt;ref name="Whitfield" /&gt; Celebrities ranging from [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] to [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] have since tried to make a film adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2004 |title=News &amp; Features |work=IFILM: The Internet Movie Guide |url=http://vgn.ifilm.com/db/static_text/0,1699,5784,00.html |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906121952/http://vgn.ifilm.com/db/static_text/0,1699,5784,00.html |archivedate=September 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', [[John Cusack]] commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-director [[Billy Wilder]] recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel's rights:

{{cquote|Of course I read ''The Catcher in the Rye''... Wonderful book. I loved it. I pursued it. I wanted to make a picture out of it. And then one day a young man came to the office of [[Leland Hayward]], my agent, in New York, and said, 'Please tell Mr. Leland Hayward to lay off. He's very, very insensitive.' And he walked out. That was the entire speech. I never saw him. That was J. D. Salinger and that was ''Catcher in the Rye''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Cameron, ed. ''Conversations with Wilder''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999. {{ISBN|0-375-40660-3}}. p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1961, Salinger denied [[Elia Kazan]] permission to direct a stage adaptation of ''Catcher'' for [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news |last=McAllister |first=David |date=November 11, 2003 |title=Will J.

In 2003, the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Big Read|The Big Read]]'' featured ''The Catcher in the Rye'', interspersing discussions of the novel with "a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger's adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield."&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt; The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a "literary review", and no major charges were filed.

After Salinger's death in 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at [[Harold Ober]] Associates, stated that nothing has changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slim chance of Catcher in the Rye movie – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=ABCnet.au |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/29/2805400.htm?section=justin |accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' released after his death. He wrote: "Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy.

Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's [[first-person narrative]] into [[voice-over]] and dialogue would be contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |date=January 29, 2010 |title=Could 'Catcher in the Rye' finally make it to the big screen?

===Banned fan fiction===
In 2009, a year before his death, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man.&lt;ref name="finlo rohrer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gross |first=Doug |date=June 3, 2009 |title=Lawsuit targets 'rip-off' of 'Catcher in the Rye' |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/06/03/salinger.catcher.lawsuit/index.html |accessdate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's author, [[John David California|Fredrik Colting]], commented: "call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books".&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, Karl.

{{main|The Catcher in the Rye in popular culture}}

''The Catcher in the Rye'' has had significant cultural influence, and works inspired by the novel have been said to form their own genre. Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by ''The Catcher in the Rye'' to include the novels ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'' by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'' by [[Stephen Chbosky]], ''[[A Complicated Kindness]]'' by [[Miriam Toews]], ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' by [[Sylvia Plath]], ''[[Ordinary People (novel)|Ordinary People]]'' by [[Judith Guest]], and the film ''[[Igby Goes Down]]'' by [[Burr Steers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohrer |first=Finlo |date=June 5, 2009 |title=Why does Salinger's Catcher in the Rye still resonate? |work=BBC News Magazine |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8084931.stm |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy writer [[Harry Turtledove]] has written a pastiche-parody "Catcher in the Rhine", based on his daughter's mishearing of Salinger's title. In this short story, an unnamed narrator, who is clearly meant to be Holden Caulfield but is unnamed to avoid copyright problems, goes on vacation to Germany and meets characters from the ''[[Niebelunglied]]''. This was first published in ''[[The Chick is in the Mail]]'', edited by [[Esther Friesner]], [[Baen]] 2000 and reprinted in the omnibus ''Chicks Ahoy!'' (2010). It was reprinted in ''Atlantis and Other Places'' also in 2010.

In "Catcher In The Wry" former major league baseball player, [[Bob Uecker]], recounts anecdotes of his years behind the plate and on the road, recalling the antics of his famous teammates, including Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Richie Allen, and Warren Spahn.

The July 1985 issue of [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] included a parody of the novel, ostensibly written by Holden Caulfield's son, entitled 'The Son of the Catcher, who Lives in Rye'.

In [[Postal 2]] a book by the name of "Catch her in the Rye" is present.

In December 1991, punk rock band [[Green Day]] released their second studio album ([[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]), containing the song ''Who Wrote Holden Caulfield''. The song describes said character as crazy, frustrated, and lacking motivation.

"The Catcher in the Rye" deeply influenced the 2017 biographical drama film, ''"[[Rebel in the Rye]]"'', which is about J.D. Salinger. It is a visual about his life, before and after World War II, and gives more about the author's life than the readers of "The Catcher in the Rye" learned from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/rebel-in-the-rye-review/538908/ |title='Rebel in the Rye' Is Phony Through and Through |last=Sims |first=David |work=The Atlantic|access-date=May 22, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Symbolist Movement in Literature''''', first published in 1899, and with additional material in 1919, is a work by [[Arthur Symons]] largely credited with bringing French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] to the attention of Anglo-American literary circles. Its first two editions were vital influences on [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]]—a note that, for nothing else, would assure its historical place with the most important early Modernist criticism. [[Richard Ellmann]] has contributed an Introduction to most modern editions.

== Textual history ==

While ''The Symbolist Movement in Literature'' was first published in monograph book form in 1899, its origins can be traced back to previous essays and articles published by Symons. In 1893, Symons' article ''The Decadent Movement in Literature'' appeared in the November volume of ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine''. This ten page article touched on many of the authors subsequently discussed in "The Symbolist Movement in Literature", such as Huysmans, Maeterlinck, Verlaine and Villers de L'Isle-Adam. The 1893 essay also mentioned the English writers Pater and Henley.

A few years later adverts were placed for ''The Decadent Movement in Literature'' to be published imminently as a book in its own right. In 1896, an advert appeared in [[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]], which Symons served as literary editor for and Leonard Smithers published. The advert, placed by Smithers himself (for he was hoping to publish it), stated the book to be 'in preparation'. In 1897, Smithers placed an identical advert in his bijou edition of Pope's ''Rape of the Lock''. One assumes that Symons was working on an expanded version of his 1893 article, to be published in a single volume under the same name. How and when Symons decided to change the title word of 'Decadent' to 'Symbolist' is unclear. What is clear, however, is that between 1893 and 1899, Symons' own perception of and sensibility towards literary Decadence changed.

Many of the essays in the 1899 edition of ''The Symbolist Movement in Literature'' were initially published as individual articles between 1897 and 1899 in periodicals such as ''The Star'' or ''The Athenaeum'', before being revised and collated for the final monograph.

== Contents ==

Symons's book is a collection of short essays on various authors. A list of contents is useful, among other reasons, for determining the time and trace of its influence. Eliot, for instance, would not have read about [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] in his 1908 edition. Essays on English authors were added for Symons's 1924 ''Collected Works''.

=== 1899 and 1908 ===

#[[Gérard de Nerval]]
#[[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]]
#[[Arthur Rimbaud]]
#[[Paul Verlaine]]
#[[Jules Laforgue]]
#[[Stéphane Mallarmé]]
#The Later [[Joris-Karl Huysmans|Huysmans]]
#[[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]] as a Mystic

=== Additions in 1919 ===

#[[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]
#[[Prosper Mérimée]]
#[[Théophile Gautier]]
#[[Gustave Flaubert]]
#[[Charles Baudelaire]]
#[[Goncourt brothers|Edmond and Jules de Goncourt]]
#[[Léon Cladel]]
#A Note on [[Émile Zola|Zola]]'s Method

== Influence ==

[[Arthur Symons]] was a close friend of Yeats, and the mutual influence was probably just as much one of conversation as of letters. Its dedicatory note (to Yeats) opens:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
May I dedicate to you this book on the Symbolist movement in literature, both as an expression of a deep personal friendship and because you, more than any one else, will sympathise with what I say in it, being yourself the chief representative of that movement in our country? France is the country of movements, and it is naturally in France that I have studied the development of a principle which is spreading throughout other countries, perhaps not less effectually, if with less definite outlines....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

T. S. Eliot, whose relationship with the book was significantly less dialectical—he discovered its second edition in bookshop while at Harvard, though he did eventually write to Symons—was perhaps even more influenced by it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I owe Mr. Symons a great debt: but for having read his book I should not, in the year 1908, have heard of [[Jules Laforgue|Laforgue]] or [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]]; I should probably not have begun to read [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]; but for reading Verlaine, I should not have heard of [[Tristan Corbière|Corbière]]. So the Symons book is one of those which have affected the course of my life.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Herbert.  ''Notes on some Figures Behind T.S. Eliot'', Houghton Mifflin,  Boston, 1964 pp. 103-4, citing Eliot's review of Peter Quennell's ''Baudelaire and the Symbolists'' in the January 1930 issue of ''Criterion'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its importance for other contemporary writers was also, of course, profound. Richard Ellmann, [[James Joyce]]'s most preeminent biographer, argues that Symons was a major influence for Joyce's decision to emigrate to Paris (though Joyce's attitude toward Rimbaud, as evinced by the former's letters, was generally negative). In a later generation Symons' book was responsible, for example, for alerting the young British poet [[David Gascoyne]] to the appeal of French poets such as Rimbaud and Baudelaire, some of whom he was to memorably translate.

The '''Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program''' ('''TTCSP''') is a non-profit program at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia, PA]]. TTCSP was established at the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy Research Institute, "Think Tanks and Foreign Policy Program", 2001-2010, "[http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/objectives.html Source 1]", 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The director is [[James McGann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James G.

==Program history==
The TTCSP was established at the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] in 1989. It began with its focus on [[think tanks]] in the US. In the 1990s the Program became increasingly global as a result of the political and economic transformation that took place in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy Research Institute, "Selected List of Publications", 2001-2010, "[http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/publications.html Source 5]", 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.

==Global Go To Think Tank Index==
McGann and the Program publish the annual ''Global Go To Think Tank Index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A&amp;M think tank aims to solve state issues|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/education/campus-chronicles/article/A-M-think-tank-aims-to-solve-state-s-problems-5761811.php|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the Index is based on a three-phase survey whose participants include politicians, scientists, think tank donors, and think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Christian, and Klaus Wohlrabe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26491">'''Value-added modeling''' (also known as '''value-added measurement''', '''value-added analysis''' and '''value-added assessment''') is a method of teacher evaluation that measures the teacher's contribution in a given year by comparing the current test scores of their students to the scores of those same students in previous school years, as well as to the scores of other students in the same grade. In this manner, value-added modeling seeks to isolate the contribution, or [[value added]], that each teacher provides in a given year, which can be compared to the performance measures of other teachers. VAMs are considered to be fairer than simply comparing student achievement scores or gain scores without considering potentially confounding context variables like past performance or income.  It is also possible to use this approach to estimate the value added by the school principal or the school as a whole.

Critics say that the use of tests to evaluate individual teachers has not been scientifically validated, and much of the results are due to chance or conditions beyond the teacher's control, such as outside tutoring.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;Dillon, Sam. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/education/01teacher.html "Method to Grade Teachers Provokes Battles"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 31, 2010. Accessed September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows, however, that differences in teacher effectiveness as measured by value-added of teachers are associated with small economic effects on students.&lt;ref&gt;It is also complicated to calculate an accurate estimate if the students have many teachers in the course of a year.

Researchers use statistical processes on a student's past test scores to predict the student's future test scores, on the assumption that students usually score approximately as well each year as they have in past years.  The student's actual score is then compared to the predicted score.  The difference between the predicted and actual scores, if any, is assumed to be due to the teacher and the school, rather than to the student's natural ability or socioeconomic circumstances.

In this way, value-added modeling attempts to isolate the teacher's contributions from factors outside the teacher's control that are known to strongly affect student test performance, including the student's general [[intelligence]], [[poverty]], and parental involvement.

By aggregating all of these individual results, statisticians can determine how much a particular teacher improves student achievement, compared to how much the typical teacher would have improved student achievement.

Statisticians use [[hierarchical linear modeling]] to predict the score for a given student in a given classroom in a given school. This prediction is based on aggregated results of all students. Each student's predicted score may take into account student level (e.g., past performance, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity), teacher level (e.g., certification, years of experience, highest degree earned, teaching practices, instructional materials, curriculum) and school level (e.g., size, type, setting) variables into consideration. Which variables are included depends on the model.

==Uses==
{{asof|2010}}, a few school districts across the United States had adopted the system, including the [[Chicago Public Schools]], [[New York City Department of Education]] and [[District of Columbia Public Schools]]. The rankings have been used to decide on issues of teacher retention and the awarding of bonuses, as well as a tool for identifying those teachers who would benefit most from teacher training.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt; Under [[Race to the Top]] and other programs advocating for better methods of evaluating teacher performance, districts have looked to value-added modeling as a supplement to observing teachers in classrooms.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

[[Louisiana]] legislator [[Frank A. Hoffmann]] introduced a bill to authorize the use of value-added modeling techniques in the state's public schools as a means to reward strong teachers and to identify successful pedagogical methods, as well as providing a means to provide additional professional development for those teachers identified as weaker than others. Despite opposition from the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, the bill passed the [[Louisiana State Senate]] on May 26, 2010, and was immediately signed into law by [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://la.aft.org/?action=article&amp;articleid=b9c38aaa-8a79-42c4-97d5-0c8b4853a44b "Value-added evaluation bill is now law"], "Louisiana Federation of Teachers Weekly Legislative Digest'', May 28, 2010. Accessed September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts do not recommend using value-added modeling as the sole determinant of any decision.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt;  Instead, they recommend using it as a significant factor in a multifaceted evaluation program.&lt;ref name="Measuring Teaching Using Value-Added Modeling"&gt;{{cite paper

==Limitations==
As a [[norm-referenced]] evaluation system, the teacher's performance is compared to the results seen in other teachers in the chosen comparison group.  It is therefore possible to use this model to infer that a teacher is better, worse, or the same as the typical teacher, but it is not possible to use this model to determine whether a given level of performance is desirable.

Because each student's expected score is largely derived from the student's actual scores in previous years, it difficult to use this model to evaluate teachers of kindergarten and first grade.  Some research limits the model to teachers of third grade and above.

Schools may not be able to obtain new students' prior scores from the students' former schools, or the scores may not be useful because of the non-comparability of some tests.  A school with high levels of student turnover may have difficulty in collecting sufficient data to apply this model.  When students change schools in the middle of the year, their progress during the year is not solely attributable to their final teachers.

Value-added scores are more sensitive to teacher effects for mathematics than for language.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt;  This may be due to widespread use of poorly constructed tests for reading and language skills, or it may be because teachers ultimately have less influence over language development.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt;  Students learn language skills from many sources, especially their families, while they learn math skills primarily in school.

There is some variation in scores from year to year and from class to class.  This variation is similar to performance measures in other fields, such as [[Major League Baseball]] and thus may reflect real, natural variations in the teacher's performance.&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite paper

 | laysource = ''The Los Angeles Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this variation, scores are most accurate if they are derived from a large number of students (typically 50 or more).  As a result, it is difficult to use this model to evaluate first-year teachers, especially in elementary school, as they may have only taught 20 students.  A ranking based on a single classroom is likely to classify the teacher correctly about 65% of the time.  This number rises to 88% if ten years' data are available.&lt;ref name=Otterman&gt;{{cite news

| newspaper = ''The New York Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, because the [[confidence interval]] is wide, the method is most reliable when identifying teachers who are consistently in the top or bottom 10%, rather than trying to draw fine distinctions between teachers that produce more or less typical achievements, such as attempting to determine whether a teacher should be rated as being slightly above or slightly below the median.&lt;ref name=Otterman /&gt;

Value added scores assume that students are randomly assigned to teachers. In reality students are rarely randomly assigned to teachers or to schools. According to economist and professor, Dr. [[Jesse M. Rothstein]] of [[University of California, Berkeley]], "Non-random assignment of students to teachers can bias value added estimates of teachers’ causal effects."&lt;ref name="Teacher quality in educational production: Tracking, decay, and student achievement"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue of possible bias with the use of value added measures has been the subject of considerable recent study, and other researchers reach the conclusion that value added measures do provide good estimates of teacher effectiveness.  See, for example, the recent work of the Measures of Effective Teaching project&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Thomas J.Kane, Daniel F. McCaffrey, Trey Miller, and Douglas O. Staiger, Have We Identified Effective Teachers? Validating Measures of Effective Teaching Using Random Assignment.

Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin, [http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/generalizations-about-using-value-added-measures-teacher-quality "Generalizations about the Use of Value-Added Measures of Teacher Quality"], ''American Economic Review'', 100(2), May 2010, pp. 267-271. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistician [[William Sanders (statistician)|William Sanders]], a senior research manager at [[SAS Institute Inc.|SAS]] introduced the concept to school operations when he developed value-added models for school districts in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. First created as a teacher evaluation tool for school programs in Tennessee in the 1990s, the use of the technique expanded with the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation in 2002. Based on his experience and research, Sanders argued that "if you use rigorous, robust methods and surround them with safeguards, you can reliably distinguish highly effective teachers from average teachers and from ineffective teachers."&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

A 2003 study by the [[RAND Corporation]] prepared for the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], said that value-added modeling "holds out the promise of separating the effects of teachers and schools from the powerful effects of such noneducational factors as family background" and that studies had shown that there was a wide variance in teacher scores when using such models, which could make value-added modeling an effective tool for evaluating and rewarding teacher performance if the variability could be substantiated as linked to the performance of individual teachers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Daniel F.; Lockwood, J. R.; Koretz, Daniel M.; and Hamilton, Laura S.  [http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf "Evaluating Value-Added Models for Teacher Accountability"], [[RAND Corporation]], 2003. Accessed September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on the use of the program in that city's schools, creating a searchable web site that provided the score calculated by the value-added modeling system for 6,000 elementary school teachers in the district. [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] praised the newspaper's reporting on the teacher scores citing it as a model of increased transparency, though he noted that greater openness must be balanced against concerns regarding "privacy, fairness and respect for teachers".&lt;ref name=NYT2010 /&gt; In February, 2011, Derek Briggs and Ben Domingue of the [[National Education Policy Center]] (NEPC) released a report reanalyzing the same dataset from the L.A. Unified School District, attempting to replicate the results published in the ''Times'', and they found serious limitations of the previous research, concluding that the "research on which the Los Angeles Times relied for its August 2010 teacher effectiveness reporting was demonstrably inadequate to support the published rankings."&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, D. and Domingue, B.  [http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/due-diligence "Due Diligence and the Evaluation of Teachers"], [[National Education Policy Center]], 2011. Accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] is sponsoring a multi-year study of value-added modeling with their Measures of Effective Teaching program.  Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as control of the classroom and challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify effective teachers.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt;  The study about student evaluations was done by [[Ronald Ferguson (economist)|Ronald Ferguson]].  The study also discovered that teachers who [[teaching to the test|teach to the test]] are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt; Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]], dispute some of these interpretations, however.&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, R.  [http://nepc.colorado.edu/thinktank/review-learning-about-teaching "Review of Learning About Teaching"], [[National Education Policy Center]], December, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report do not support the conclusions, and that "interpreted correctly... [they] undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/newsletter/2011/01/study-released-last-month-gates-foundation-has-been-touted-%E2%80%9Csome-strongest-eviden |title=Gates Report Touting ‘Value-Added’ Reached Wrong Conclusion &amp;#124; National Education Policy Center |publisher=Nepc.colorado.edu |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Principals and leaders==
The general idea of value added modeling has also been extended to consider principals and school leaders.  While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion about the importance of school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into the impact of them on student outcomes.  Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes.  This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers.  The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact on student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Branch, [[Eric Hanushek]], and Steven G. Rivkin, [http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/ "School Leaders Matter: Measuring the impact of effective principals"], ''Education Next'' 13(1), Winter 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative estimates indicate that an effective school leader improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year.  These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining good teachers.  Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.

==Criticism and concerns==
A report issued by the [[Economic Policy Institute]] in August 2010 recognized that "American public schools generally do a poor job of systematically developing and evaluating teachers" but expressed concern that using performance on [[standardized test]]s as a measuring tool will not lead to better performance. The EPI report recommends that measures of performance based on standardized test scores be one factor among many that should be considered to "provide a more accurate view of what teachers in fact do in the classroom and how that contributes to student learning." The study called value-added modeling a fairer means of comparing teachers that allows for better measures of educational methodologies and overall school performance, but argued that student test scores were not sufficiently reliable as a means of making "high-stakes personnel decisions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva L. Baker|Baker, Eva L.]]; Barton, Paul E.; [[Linda Darling-Hammond|Darling-Hammond, Linda]]; Haertel, Edward; Ladd, Hellen F.; [[Robert L. Linn|Linn, Robert L.]]; [[Diane Ravitch|Ravitch, Diane]]; Rothstein, Richard; Shavelson, Richard J.; and Shepard, Lorrie A.  [http://epi.3cdn.net/b9667271ee6c154195_t9m6iij8k.pdf "Problems with the Use of Student Test Scores to Evaluate Teachers"], [[Economic Policy Institute]], August 29, 2010. Accessed September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Haertel, who led the Economic Policy Institute research team, wrote that the methodologies being pushed as part of the [[Race to the Top]] program placed "too much emphasis on measures of growth in student achievement that have not yet been adequately studied for the purposes of evaluating teachers and principals" and that the techniques of valued-added modeling need to be more thoroughly evaluated and should only be used "in closely studied pilot projects".&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

Education policy researcher [[Gerald Bracey]] further argued it is possible that a correlation between teachers and short-term changes in test scores may be irrelevant to the actual quality of teaching. Therefore, "it cannot permit causal inferences about individual teachers. At best, it is a beginning step to identify teachers who might need additional professional development."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bracey, Gerald]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gerald-bracey/value-subtracted-a-debate_b_47404.html "Value Subtracted: A "Debate" with William Sanders"], [[Huffpost]], May 1, 2007. Accessed September 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Statistical Association]] issued an April 8, 2014 statement criticizing the use of value-added models in educational assessment, without ruling out the usefulness of such models.  The ASA cited limitations of input data, the influence of factors not included in the models, and large standard errors resulting in unstable year-to-year rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Statistical Association]], [http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-ASAVAM-Statement.pdf "ASA Statement on
Using Value-Added Models for Educational Assessment"], April 8, 2014. Accessed August 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ewing, writing in the [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] criticized the use of value-added models in educational assessment as a form of "mathematical intimidation" and a "rhetorical weapon." Ewing cited problems with input data and the influence of factors not included in the model.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, John, [http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201105/rtx110500667p.pdf "Mathematical Intimidation:
Driven by the Data"], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], 58:5, May 2011. Accessed August 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Several alternatives for teacher evaluation have been implemented:

* '''Evaluation by students''':  If asked validated questions, students as young as fourth graders can accurately identify effective teachers.&lt;ref name=MET /&gt;  [[Course evaluation]]s are common in universities, but rarely count for more than a trivial fraction in a decision to retain or fire a teacher.{{citation needed|reason=unsubstantiated claims|date=March 2016}}
* '''Activities outside the classroom''':  Part of a teacher's evaluation typically includes participation in staff training events.  For example, a teacher who completes a master's degree is almost always paid more, even though holding a master's degree has no effect on student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Douglas N.|last2=Sass|first2=Tim R.|title=Teacher training, teacher quality and student achievement|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047272710001696|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=95|issue=7-8|pages=798–812|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=previous ref was an op ed|date=March 2016}}

==Building==
The Verdaguer House Museum is located in a 17th-century house occupied by Josep Verdaguer and his wife, Josepa Santaló, (parents of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]) between 1841 and 1847, when the poet was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrets.cat/indret/127/casa-museu-verdaguer.html |publisher=endrets.cat |title=Museum page at endrets.cat|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The exhibition area is structured on three floors: on the first floor is the permanent exhibition, which takes visitors through the stages of the poet’s life; the second floor shows what a typical kitchen and bedroom were decorated like in the 19th century, time in which young Jacint lived; on the third floor there is a space dedicated to temporary exhibitions and another to the artist [[Perejaume]], as well as an audiovisual presentation on the life and work of [[Jacint Verdaguer]].
