The '''1995–96 [[British Collegiate American Football League]] season''' was the 11th full season of the BCAFL, organised by the British Students American Football Association (BSAFA, now the [[British American Football Association|BAFA]]). &lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Bcafl.png|right|BCAFL Logo]] --&gt;

No new teams were added in the 1995–96 season. The [[University of Stirling|Stirling]] Clansmen withdrew after nine seasons, while the Aberdeen Steamrollers withdrew after one season (without actually playing a match), reducing the BCAFL to 27 teams.

The '''40th [[Chess Olympiad]]''', organised by the [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs]] and comprising an open&lt;ref&gt;Although commonly referred to as the ''men's division'', this section is open to all male and female players.&lt;/ref&gt; and women's tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of [[chess]], took place in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]],&lt;ref name="chessdom"&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/news/chess-olympiad-istanbul-2012 Chess Olympiad 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey], Chessdom.com.&lt;/ref&gt; from 27 August to 10 September 2012. The city also hosted the [[34th Chess Olympiad|event in 2000]].

More than 1,700 players and team captains participated, including 157 teams in the open and 127 teams in the women's section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/team-starting-rank-for-the-40th-world-chess-olympiad/ Team starting rank for the 40th World Chess Olympiad], Chessdom.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The main competitive events were held at the [[Istanbul Expo Center]]. The Chief Arbiter of the event was [[Greece]]'s [[International Arbiter]] Panagiotis Nikolopoulos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratings.fide.com/tournament_details.phtml?event=69392 40th World Chess Olympiad-Open] FIDE Tournament Details&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratings.fide.com/tournament_details.phtml?event=69393 40th World Chess Olympiad-Women] FIDE Tournament Details&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Istanbul's hosting the [[34th Chess Olympiad]] in 2000 sparked a "Chess boom" in the country. Turkey has since hosted more than 100 international chess tournaments, including European Championships, World Youth Championships, and Youth Chess Olympiads. Membership in the Turkish Chess Federation has risen from 3,000 to about 250,000 in only eight years. [[Ali Nihat Yazıcı]], President of the [[Turkish Chess Federation]], is credited with triggering most of the activities towards this intensive chess development in the country.&lt;ref name="chessvibes-protest"&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/formal-protest-issued-against-turkish-chess-federation Formal protest issued against Turkish Chess Federation], Chessvibes.com, 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later elected a Vice-President of FIDE.

Istanbul won the right to host the 40th Chess Olympiad in November 2008, during the 78th Congress of [[FIDE]] at the [[38th Chess Olympiad]] in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="chessdom"/&gt; Istanbul's bid was approved by a vote of 95–40 over [[Budva]].

== The event ==
[[File:Olympiad2012Entrance1.jpg|thumb|The [[Istanbul Expo Center]], the location of the tournament]]
=== Competition format ===
The tournament was played in a [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system format]]. The [[time control]] for every single game was 90 minutes per 40 moves, with addition of 30 seconds per move, and 30 minutes after the 40th move. It was allowed once again for a player to offer a [[Draw by agreement|draw]] at any time during the game. A total of 11 rounds were played, in which every team played with four of their players against another team. Every team was allowed to nominate one reserve player.&lt;ref name="FIDE-rules"&gt;[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=95&amp;view=article FIDE Handbook: Olympiad Pairing Rules], [[FIDE]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams were ranked according to the match points won in every round. In case of same number of match points by one or more teams, the tie-breaker is decided by applying: 1. The [[Sonneborn-Berger]] system; 2. Total game points scored; 3. Sum of the match points of the opponents, excluding the lowest one.&lt;ref name="FIDE-rules"/&gt;

=== Open event ===
[[File:KramnikGrischukOlympiad2012.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Vladimir Kramnik]] and [[Alexander Grischuk]] playing for Russia]]
The open section of the tournament was contested by 157 teams representing 152 nations. Turkey, as host nation, had three teams, whilst the [[International Braille Chess Association]] (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Committee of Silent Chess (ICSC) each provided one team.&lt;ref name="chessvibes"&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/istanbul-olympiad-preview-who-will-play-and-who-wont Olympiad preview], Chessvibes.com, 22 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chessbase"&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=8422 2012 Istanbul Chess Olympiad preview], [[ChessBase]], 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Armeniachessolympiad.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Team [[Armenia]] being awarded the first place trophy]] --&gt;[[Armenia]], led by world number 2 [[Levon Aronian]], won their third title after previously winning the event in [[37th Chess Olympiad|2006]] and [[38th Chess Olympiad|2008]]. The [[Russia]]n team were once again the clear favourites before the Olympiad but failed to win the gold for the fifth consecutive time and occupied the second place, while the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team as a titleholder finished in the third place. Three teams, China, Armenia and Russia, were tied on the top of the standings before the last round of the event with China winning the tie-breaker. But in that final round the Chinese players had to play against the Ukraine, led by [[Vassily Ivanchuk]], while Armenians played against [[Hungary]] and Russia played against [[Germany]]. The Armenians and Russians won their final matches but Ukraine edged the leading [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] team 3–1 preventing them from winning a medal. The Armenian and Russian teams had the same match points in the final standings but the Armenians won the tie-breaker taking their third title. Ukraine, thanks to the win in the final round against China, took the bronze medal.

The [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] Trophy is awarded to the nation that has the highest total number of match points in the open and women's divisions combined. Where two or more teams are tied, they are ordered by the same tie breakers as in the two separate events.

== Controversies ==
On 24 November 2010, ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article concerning the possibilities that the [[Turkish Chess Federation]] has paid the voters amount of $120,000 in order to win the bids to organize the Olympiad. In the financial report published on the official website of the Turkish Chess Federation there was a footnote, which translated into English points on the allocation of these costs for stand, souvenirs, lobbying activities, as well as accommodation, transportation and food for some of the FIDE delegates to vote for the city.&lt;ref name="chesdom-NYT"&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/news-2010/chess-olympiad-2012-scandal Chess Olympiad 2012 sparkles discussion – NY Times article], Chessdom.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The official answer of the Turkish Chess Federation denied the claim and mentioned that the sum spent is not very big when bidding to host an Olympiad. It was also clarified in the response that the costs were allocated to pay for the Turkish delegates at the FIDE Congress in [[Dresden]], and the expenses documented by invoices testify that no money was given to any of the FIDE delegates and none of the expenses were reimbursed.&lt;ref name="chesdom-NYT"/&gt;

In June 2012, [[Ali Nihat Yazıcı]], President of the Turkish Chess Federation, announced that no arbiters from [[Germany]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[United States]] would be accepted for the event because of the involvement of those countries in launching or supporting court cases against FIDE, causing financial problems and a loss of distributable income for worldwide chess development. A few days later, the [[English Chess Federation]] sent a protest letter to FIDE, which was later co-signed by the other federations who announced their support.&lt;ref name="chessvibes-protest"/&gt;

Russian journalist Evgeny Surov was denied accreditation and was not even allowed to enter the venue as a spectator. This led to protests by the Russian Chess Federation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/russian-chess-federation-supports-surov-with-open-letter Russian Chess Federation supports Surov with open letter], Chessvibes.com, 30. August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 40 top players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/top-players-sign-open-letter-supporting-russian-journalist Top players sign open letter supporting Russian journalist], Chessvibes.com, 5.

'''Columbia Park''' or '''Columbia Avenue Grounds''' was a [[baseball park]] in [[Philadelphia]]. It was built in 1901 as the first home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], who played there for eight seasons, including two games of the [[1905 World Series]].

Columbia Park fell into disuse after the Athletics' move in 1909 to the larger [[Shibe Park]], and was demolished in the 1910s.

==Home of the Philadelphia Athletics==

Columbia Park was built in 1901 by the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] when the team was established, in the creation of the [[American League]].  The site was a vacant lot on which manager and part-owner [[Connie Mack]] obtained a ten-year lease.&lt;ref name=selter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selter|first1=Ronald M.|title=Ballparks of the Deadball Era: A Comprehensive Study of their Dimensions, Configurations, and Effects on Batting, 1901 – 1919|date=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina and London|isbn=978-0-7864-3561-6|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occupied the block bordered by 29th Street, Oxford Street, 30th Street, and Columbia Avenue (since renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue, in honor of the [[Cecil B. Moore|civil rights leader]]). The park was built by contractor James B. Foster {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, at a cost of $35,000.

[[File:OpeningDayColumbia Park.png|thumb|left|A photograph of Columbia Park on opening day, 26 April 1901, which was printed in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' the following day]]

The stadium was very small, and originally had a [[seating capacity]] of only 9,500.  This was eventually increased to 13,600 by the addition of bleacher seating in the outfield.  During some sold out games, unofficial additional seating could be found on top of the adjoining homes.  There was only one dressing room, for the home team; visiting teams had to change at their hotels. Although the ballpark was in Philadelphia's [[Brewerytown, Philadelphia|Brewerytown]] section, beer sales were prohibited.

The opening game in Columbia Park was held on April 26, [[1901 Philadelphia Athletics season|1901]], after the first two games were rained out.  The Athletics played the [[history of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] in front of an overflow crowd of 10,524, with some fans standing on the outfield walls and the roofs of nearby houses.  The Athletics lost 5-1, despite three hits by [[second baseman]] [[Nap Lajoie]].&lt;ref name=Inquirer&gt;{{cite news|title=Carrick, All to the Good, Fools The Athletic Hitters|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=27 April 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conference on the field at the Columbia Avenue Grounds, 1905 World Series.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Conference on the field during a [[1905 World Series]] game at Columbia Park.]]

===World Series===
During their tenure at Columbia Park, the Athletics won the [[list of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]] twice. The first time was in 1902, before the institution of the modern [[World Series]]. Three years later the Athletics won again and faced the [[New York Giants (baseball team)|New York Giants]] in the [[1905 World Series]].

The Giants won the series 4 games to 1. Games 1 and 3 were held at Columbia Park. Both were shutout victories for Giants future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|hall of famer]] [[Christy Mathewson]].&lt;ref name=Ritter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritter|first1=Lawrence|title=Lost Ballparks: A Celebration of Baseball's Legendary Fields|date=1992|publisher=Viking Studio Books|location=New York|isbn=0140234225|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other teams==
The Athletics leased the ballpark to the independent [[Negro Leagues|Negro League]] club the [[Philadelphia Giants]]. The Giants played at the ballpark while the Athletics were on the road. The Giants were the first club to play night baseball in Philadelphia when they played under portable lights on June 4, 1902.

The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] temporarily called Columbia Park home in [[1903 Philadelphia Phillies season|1903]] while [[Baker Bowl]] was repaired after a balcony collapse on August 8, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Connie Mack and the Early Years of Baseball |last=Macht |first=Norman L. |authorlink= |author2=Connie Mack, III |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location= |isbn=0-8032-3263-2 |page=316 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZvAWd-Aq5UMC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=Phillies+Athletics+city+series#PPA316,M1 |accessdate=2009-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies played sixteen games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alternate Site Games Since 1901 | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/neutral.htm | work= | publisher=[[Retrosheet]]| accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also briefly served as the home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics (NFL)|Philadelphia Athletics football club]], before the team folded in 1902.

==Disuse and demolition==
The final game played at the park took place on October 3, [[1908 Philadelphia Athletics season|1908]]; the visiting [[Boston Americans]] defeated the Athletics 5-0 in the second game of a doubleheader.  The lack of seating at Columbia Park was the main reason the Athletics left for Shibe Park.  The sod from Columbia Park was transplanted to [[Shibe Park]] after the 1908 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shoeless Joe and Ragtime Baseball|last=Frommer |first=Harvey |authorlink= |year=2008|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location= |isbn=0-8032-1862-1 |page=23 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B_FXGNCmieAC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Columbia+Park%22+Athletics|accessdate=2009-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Athletics left, the park was almost entirely abandoned.  Columbia Park was eventually demolished in the 1910s to make way for new homes.

A '''creance''' is a long light cord used to tether a flying [[hawk]] or [[falcon]] during training in [[falconry]]. They are used both when the bird is young, and when the bird has been taken out of the aviary for a moult or other reasons.

The creance itself is thin, designed to be of as little inconvenience to the bird as possible. It's threaded through the [[swivel]] and tied with a [[falconer's knot]]. The creance typically extends to around 25 metres (82&amp;nbsp;feet), at which point the bird should be ready to fly free (without the use of the creance).

'''Duendes Rugby Club''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[rugby union]] and [[field hockey]] club sited in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]]. The rugby team currently plays at [[Torneo del Litoral]], the first division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Rosario]] (URR) league system.

==History==
Duendes Rugby Club was founded in 1957 and registered with the Rosario Union that same year. After just one season the club won the promotion to the top division of the URR league system and won its first title in 1960.

Along with [[Club Atlético del Rosario|Atlético del Rosario]] and [[Jockey Club de Rosario|Jockey Club]], Duendes is one of the most successful clubs in its city of origin, having won the [[Unión de Rugby de Rosario]] championship 15 times. The club also won the [[Torneo del Litoral]] tournament 12 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://urr.org.ar/duendes-campeon-del-litoral/ Duendes, campeón del Litoral], URR, 14 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

At national level, Duendes is also the most winning team from Rosario, having won the [[Nacional de Clubes]] title twice, in 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.duendes.com.ar/historia.php |title=Duendes History |language=Spanish |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312095152/http://www.duendes.com.ar/historia.php |archivedate=12 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On four occasions (1968, 1969, 1972 and 1993) the team remained unbeaten all season.

In 2009 Duendes won the inaugural [[Torneo del Interior]], the national competition for clubs not from Buenos Aires. As winners of this tournament, the team qualified directly to the semi-finals of the overhauled Nacional de Clubes.

In November, 2011, Duendes won its first [[Nacional de Clubes]] championship, defeating [[Club La Tablada|La Tablada]] 26-23 in the final match. The MVP was the [[fly-half]] Mateo Escalante, the game's top scorer with 16 points converted with a 100% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyfun.com.ar/nota.asp?not_codigo=75113 "La revancha de Duendes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520111032/http://www.rugbyfun.com.ar/nota.asp?not_codigo=75113 |date=May 20, 2012 }}, Rugbyfun website, 2011-11-26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgerton Park Arena''' was an indoor [[arena]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. The building was originally constructed in 1892 as the drill hall for a training school for delinquent boys. When the school moved early in the 20th century, the building was turned into an indoor sports arena and exhibition hall. An artificial ice-making system was installed in 1935.

The first professional team to use the building was the [[Rochester Cardinals]] hockey team in 1935-36. The Cardinals played in the International Hockey League and were a farm team of the [[New York Americans]] of the National Hockey League. Rochester could have been a charter member of the International-American Hockey League which formed in the summer of 1936 upon the merger of the IHL and the Canadian-American Hockey Leagues. However, the Cardinals went into receivership before the end of the 1935–36 season and no suitable owner could be found to operate the team. Also, the arena sat only 3,500 for hockey and officials of the new league wanted a minimum capacity of 5,000. The City of Rochester, the arena's owners, refused to expand the building. This refusal to expand the building meant Rochester had to wait until the Community War Memorial Arena (now [[Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial]]) opened in 1955 to join the American Hockey League. Rochester was awarded a new franchise in the American Hockey League in 1956 after Pittsburgh withdrew. The [[Rochester Americans]] began play in the 1956-57 season.

In 1940 the International-American Hockey League changed its name to the American Hockey League. The AHL is now the premier minor league in professional hockey.

Edgerton Park Arena was the primary home of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Rochester Royals]] from 1945 to 1955.  The Royals moved into the new Rochester Community War Memorial for the 1955–56 NBA season. But because of periodic scheduling conflicts and the two-month-long 1956 American Bowling Congress Finals scheduled for the War Memorial, the Royals returned to the Arena to play several games during the 1955–56 season. It also hosted performances by the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] and cowboy star [[Gene Autry]] in the 1940s. The arena held 4,200 people for basketball. The building was demolished in the late 1950s.

'''Grêmio Desportivo Amarante''' or '''Amarantes''' ([[Capeverdean Crioulo]], [[ALUPEC]] or [[ALUPEK]]: ''GD Amarantis'', [[São Vicente Crioulo|São Vicente]]: ''GD Amarantes'') is a [[Association football|football]] club that had played in the Premier division and plays in the [[São Vicente Island League]] in [[Cape Verde]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becv.org/vitrina-associados/gremio-desportivo-amarante Gremio Desportivo Amarante - Commercial Chamber of Northern Cape Verde] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based in the city of [[Mindelo]] in the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]] .

Its logo has a navy blue colored shield with the short name GDA from left to right and bottom and a brown eagle carrying a brown football reading "always ahead" (Portuguese: sempre a frente).  As there is a club named [[Amarante F.C.|Amarante]] in Portugal based in Amarante, the club has no affiliation with that club as its logo is different.

==History==
The club was founded in 1936 and is the island's fourth oldest club in São Vicente.

Amarante has four regional titles won.  It was the second club to win a title in the regionals.  Académica was even in the number of titles from 1953 to 1964, with the exception from 1961 to 1962 where the club had the most number of titles.  It had the third most in the region until 1985 when [[FC Derby]] took the position and became fourth in most number of regional titles, their fourth and recent was won in 1999.  Since 2012, the title totals are shared with [[Batuque FC|Batuque]].

Amarante celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1986.

It is one of a couple of teams that only won one title since independence and was in 1999.  The club won five insular titles and once took part in the colonial in 1961 where they lost to [[Sporting Clube da Praia]] and the national in [[1999 Cape Verdean Football Championships|1999]] where they won the only national title. Also at the 1999 national championships, they finished with 13 points, a record stood for two seasons until Fogo's [[Botafogo FC (Cape Verde)|Botafogo]] took it in 2001, they also had 4 wins and 8 goals scored, half were scored in a match against [[Juventude do Sal]] where they won 4-0, one of three matches that was the highest at the national championships that season. At the finals, they faced Fogo's [[Vulcânicos FC|Vulcânicos]] and defeated it 2-0 in the first leg, the second leg was a goal draw.

In 2011, the club celebrated its 75th anniversary of its foundation.

In the 2015-16 season, Amarante as second placed club in the cup competition lost to Mindelense in the 2015 regional super cup.  Amarante won their only regional [[São Vicente Opening Tournament|Association Cup]] title.  Amarante finished last place behind Farense and appeared in the regional second division for the first time in January 2017 and became the fourth club after [[Académica do Mindelo]], it started with the Second Division's Association Cup, until then, Amarante was one of five unrelegated clubs in the region. Amarante's final result was 3rd, the level where they will participate again in the Second Division, their second one next season as they were shy of being in the 50/50 zone of ever returning to the Premier Division.  In the cup competition, the club reached up to the Semifinals and lost a match and was kicked out from further competition.

'''Hit wicket''' is a method of [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]] in the sport of [[cricket]]. This method of dismissal is governed by Law 35 of the [[Laws of Cricket]]. The striker is out "hit wicket" if, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his wicket is [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|put down]] by his bat or his person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-35-hit-wicket/|title=Law 35 - Hit wicket|website=www.lords.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The striker may do this whilst preparing to receive or receiving a delivery or in setting off for his first run after playing the delivery. In simple language, if the striking batsman knocks the bails off the stumps or uproots the stumps, while attempting to hit the ball or take off for a run, he is out hit wicket.

This method is the sixth most common method of dismissal after [[Caught (cricket)|caught]], [[bowled]], [[leg before wicket]], [[run out]] and [[stumped]]. It is significantly rarer than any of these, which constitute the five conventional methods, but still much more common than the other four ([[timed out]], [[obstructing the field]], [[retired out]] and [[hit the ball twice]]), which are extremely rare.

Although a bowler is given credit for the wicket, it is not a method of dismissal that a bowler actively seeks. A batsman may not be given out "hit wicket" if the ball is not actually delivered by the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] or if the delivery is a [[no-ball]].

{{As of|2018|April|3}}, a total of 158 batsmen have been dismissed hit wicket in [[Test cricket]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batsmen dismissed by hit wicket in Test cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 66 batsmen in [[One Day International]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batsmen dismissed by hit wicket in One Day International cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10 in [[Twenty20 International]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batsmen dismissed by hit wicket in Twenty20 International cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the women's game,  12 players have been dismissed in [[women's Test cricket|Tests]] by hit wicket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players dismissed by hit wicket in women's Test cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=8;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; six players [[Women's One Day International cricket|women's ODIs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players dismissed by hit wicket in women's One Day International cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=9;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only one player, [[Marizanne Kapp]] of [[South Africa women's national cricket team|South Africa]], has been dismissed by this method in a [[women's Twenty20 International]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players dismissed by hit wicket in women's Twenty20 International cricket|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=10;dismissal=6;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable dismissals==
Due to the rarity of this method of dismissal, many occurrences in international cricket are notable.

===Commentary gaffe===
On 9 August 1991, during a match between [[English cricket team|England]] and the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] at [[the Oval]], [[Ian Botham]] fell over his stumps whilst attempting to hook [[Curtly Ambrose]] and so was dismissed "hit wicket". Later in the day, [[Brian Johnston]] of BBC Radio's ''[[Test Match Special]]'' read out the details of the scorecard as normal. When he came to Botham's dismissal, his fellow presenter [[Jonathan Agnew]] commented that Botham 'just didn't quite get his leg over'. This was a [[double entendre]] meaning that he was not able to avoid hitting his stumps by getting his leg higher than the stumps, and also a reference to sex. Johnston slowly started laughing until he could commentate no more, leaving about a minute of broadcasting being just him in a fit of giggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/test_match_special/presenter_profiles/2976173.stm BBC Sport] Brian Johnston and Jonathan Agnew of BBC radio's ''Test Match Special'' discussing Ian Botham's dismissal 'Hit wicket'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disintegrating bat===
In the first innings of the 3rd Test in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|1921 Ashes series]], at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], [[Andy Ducat]], playing in his only Test for England, fended at a fast ball bowled by [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s [[Ted McDonald]].  Ducat's bat broke, and a splinter flew back and dislodged a bail, the ball being caught behind by a slip fielder. Ducat was given out "caught", although it seems likely that he could also have been given out "hit wicket".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1920S/1920-21/ENG_IN_AUS/ENG_AUS_T3_14-20JAN1921.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1921, in the 2nd Test between Australia and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Old Wanderers]] in [[Johannesburg]], McDonald dismissed [[Billy Zulch]] in a similar fashion, breaking the batsman's bat so that fragments flew back to dislodge a bail, and Zulch was given out "hit wicket".&lt;ref name=StrangeDismissals/&gt;

After these incidents, the MCC clarified that whole bat must break the wicket for the batsman to be given out "hit wicket".  However, effective 1 October 2010, this law has been changed to allow a batsman to be dismissed "hit wicket" if a splinter, or part of his bat, breaks the wicket.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlesexchampionship.com/MCC%20Law%20Changes%202011%97Summary%20of%20Changes%20for%20players.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying gloves===
Playing for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] at [[the Oval]] in 1953, [[Alan Revill]]'s hand was hit by a lifting delivery from [[Alec Bedser]].  Revill shook his hand in pain, and his glove flew off, hit the stumps, and dislodged a bail.  The umpire considered that Revill was still "playing at the ball", and he was dismissed "hit wicket".&lt;ref name=StrangeDismissals/&gt;

===Falling headgear===
In Test cricket, a number of batsmen have been out "hit wicket" as a result of headgear falling onto the stumps.

In the 2nd Test between Australia and the West Indies at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in 1960–61 (the Test immediately after the famous [[Tied Test]] at [[Brisbane]]), [[Joe Solomon]] was first out in the second innings, following on.  Playing back to a [[topspinner]] bowled by [[Richie Benaud]], his cap fell off and dislodged a bail, so he was out "hit wicket".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1960-61/WI_IN_AUS/WI_AUS_T2_30DEC1960-03JAN1961.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/calypso/synopsis2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian crowd thought the dismissal was unsporting, and booed their own side.

In Warwickshire's County Championship match against Hampshire at Edgbaston in 1962, [[M. J. K. Smith]] was dismissed when a gust of wind blew his cap on to his wicket.&lt;ref name=StrangeDismissals&gt;http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/231414.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.edgbaston.com/Scorecards/25/25383.html| title= Warwickshire v Hampshire in 1962|publisher=Warwickshire County Cricket Club| access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Indian cricket team|Indian]] cricketers have been dismissed in a similar fashion – [[Ashok Mankad]] by England's [[Chris Old]] during the 3rd Test at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in July 1974,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1974/IND_IN_ENG/IND_ENG_T3_04-08JUL1974.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] by Australia's [[Jeff Thomson]] during the 1st Test at Brisbane in December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1977-78/IND_IN_AUS/IND_AUS_T1_02-06DEC1977.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd [[One Day International]] between [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and Australia in [[Dunedin]] in February 2000, New Zealand's [[Adam Parore]] had his helmet knocked off by a short-pitched delivery from [[Brett Lee]].  The helmet fell into the stumps, and Parore was also out "hit wicket", causing some disturbance in the crowd.&lt;ref name=StrangeDismissals/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1999-2000/AUS_IN_NZ/SCORECARDS/AUS_NZ_ODI3_23FEB2000.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd Test between England and West Indies at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] on 9 June 2007, [[Kevin Pietersen]] was out "hit wicket" when his helmet fell onto the stumps. The bowler was [[Dwayne Bravo]], who bowled a good bouncer that dislodged the helmet. Replays suggested that the force of the ball broke the chinstrap, freeing the lid to strike the stumps.

===Other strange hit wicket dismissals===
[[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]'s [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] was also out "hit wicket" in the 3rd Test against England at Headingley on 6 August 2006, as he attempted to sweep England spinner [[Monty Panesar]] and in doing so lost his balance before falling backwards onto his stumps. He attempted to jump over the stumps, but completely fell on top of them.

One of the more bizarre hit wicket dismissals was of [[Sri Lanka national cricket team]] former captain [[Kumar Sangakkara]] in the finals of the triangular ODI Compaq Cup against India at Colombo on 14 September 2009, as he attempted a shot and in the follow through his bat slipped out of his hands, flew backwards in the air and landed on the stumps.

On 1 December 2017, West Indian player [[Sunil Ambris]] became the first player to be dismissed hit wicket on debut, also getting out for a [[Duck (cricket)|golden duck]].  He proceeded to get out the same way in the very next game, becoming the only player to be out this way twice in consecutive games.

The '''Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum''' is an automotive museum on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in [[Speedway, Indiana]], [[United States]], which houses the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="IIBWGD"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/37769728/ims-hall-of-fame-to-add-gordon-stewart|title=IMS Hall of Fame to Add Gordon, Stewart|publisher=Inside Indiana Business|first=Alex|last=Brown|date=March 20, 2018|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 article"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kelly |first=Paul |title=Davidson, Travers, Coon Comprise 2010 Class For Auto Racing Hall |publisher=[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|IMS LLC]] |date = 2010-04-28 |url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/news/15926/Davidson__Travers__Coon_Comprise_2010_Class_For_Auto_Racing_Hall | accessdate =2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intrinsically linked to the [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Brickyard 400]], but it also includes exhibits reflecting other forms of [[motorsports]], [[car|passenger cars]], and general automotive history. In 2006, it celebrated its 50th anniversary. The museum foundation possesses several former Indianapolis 500-winning cars, and they are regularly rotated onto the display floor exhibits.

The museum is independently owned and operated by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Foundation, Inc., a registered [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ims.com/index.php/ask-donald-davidson-my-dad-was-a-riding-mechanic/#.VFD4SMn5cZJ Indianapolis Motor Speedway – Official Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum dates back to 1956, and moved to the current building in 1976. It is located in the infield of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway race course, and is open year-round, except Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

==History==
[[File:OriginalIMSMuseum.JPG|thumb|Image of the original Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum building]]
[[File:Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum - 2015 - Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Entrance of the museum, 2015]]
The first museum at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] was completed April 7, 1956&lt;ref name="1996 Program"&gt;.{{cite news|title =1996 Indianapolis 500 Official Program | publisher =Indianapolis Motor Speedway | date = 1996-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMS.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/museum/ |title=Hall of Fame Museum |publisher=IndianapolisMotorSpeedway.com |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328133310/http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/museum/ |archivedate=2008-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum displays"&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2007-05-02-3092398979_x.htm | title =Museum displays auto racing history | publisher =USAToday.com | date = 2007-05-07 | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the southwest corner of the property, outside turn one of the famous oval, at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road. Its exhibits included [[Ray Harroun]]'s [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911 Indy 500]] winning car, and a handful of other vehicles. Karl Kizer became the first curator.&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; When it opened, it only had six cars.&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; Within a number of years, dozens of collector cars were being donated and acquired. It did not take long for management to realize that the building was of insufficient size.&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum displays"/&gt; According to Speedway publicist Al Bloemker, by 1961, the museum was seeing an average of 5,000 visitors per week (not including month of May crowds).&lt;ref&gt;Fred Agabashian 1961 Interviews&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway broke ground on a new {{convert|96000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} museum and administration building, located in the infield of the track.&lt;ref name="IMS.com"/&gt; The two-story white building was made of Wyoming quartz, and along with the museum, housed office space, the ticket office, a gift shop, and photography department. It officially opened to the public on April 5, 1976,&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; coinciding with the year-long [[United States Bicentennial]] celebration.&lt;ref name="IMS.com"/&gt; It officially operated under the name '''Hall of Fame Museum''', but was known colloquially as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. The original museum building outside turn one was kept intact, and converted into additional office space.

The museum, representing the entire facility, was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Museum displays"/&gt;

In the summer of 1993, the original museum building outside of turn one was demolished. In its place a multimillion-dollar administration building was erected.&lt;ref name="Star06-29-1993a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway is adding new office building (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7003881//|first=Howard M.|last=Smulevitz|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=27|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 29, 1993|accessdate=2018-02-15}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star06-29-1993b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway is adding new office building (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7003896//|first=Howard M.|last=Smulevitz|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=29|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 29, 1993|accessdate=2018-02-15}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative and ticket offices were moved out of the infield museum building, and relocated to the new admin office. This freed up floor space in the museum for an expanded gift shop and other exhibits.

In 1993, the museum parking lot hosted the first "Indy 500 Expo" during race festivities, an outdoor interactive spectator exhibit. In 1995, it was expanded and renamed "Indy 500 FanFest". It was discontinued after 1997, but in recent years, smaller displays sponsored by [[Chevrolet]] have featured former pace cars and other exhibits.

In 2016, a revitalization and modernization project began, to expand the museum floor and add interactive displays. In addition, in April 2016, the facility was officially renamed the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum.

==Exhibits==
The museum rotates a display of over 75 cars at any given time.&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; Due to considerable space restraints, only a small portion of the total collection can be displayed.&lt;ref name="Museum displays"/&gt; Many cars are stored in the invitation-only basement, or at separate off-site facilities. Some of the cars in storage, however, are not restored to display condition. Frequently, cars are sent on loan for display at other museums, historical car shows, parades, and other activities.

The collection includes&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMS.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum displays"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Centennial Pamphlet"&gt;{{Citation|author1=Davidson, Donald |author2=Loscar, Mary Ellen |author3=Bireley, Ellen |author4=Shunck, Steve |title=The Ultimate Indianapolis 500 Winning Car Collection|place=Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum|publisher=Weibel Design Inc. &amp; Brad Hoffner Designs Inc.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; over thirty [[Indianapolis 500]] winning cars, various other [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy cars]], and several racing cars from other disciplines. Other items on display include trophies, plaques, racing paraphernalia such as helmets, gloves, and driver's suits. A collection of models, photographs, toys, and paintings are also for view. One display exhibits a timeline of scoring devices.

===Special exhibits===
In some years, a special exhibit takes over much or all of the museum floor, commemorating a special event or milestone. Such exhibits are typically on display for an extended period, encompassing the entire month of May, and sometimes throughout the summer.

===Basement===
Due to the size of the collection, and space constraints on the display floor, a large portion of the collection is stored in the basement. Some cars are rotated into display, while others remain downstairs permanently, out of view from the public. The basement at the museum is strictly off-limits to the public, and admittance is by invitation only. The contents of the basement collection has become a source of [[folklore]] and mystique, as some extremely rare vehicles are stored there, few visitors are allowed to enter, and photography is strictly forbidden. 

===North Wing===
In 2016, the museum display floor was expanded by 6,000 square feet after office space was relocated to another building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/story/life/2016/05/02/speedway-museum-wants-double-size/83798518/ Speedway museum wants to double in size]&lt;/ref&gt; The new North Wing is used to display additional cars, and offers a view of a portion of the IMS road course.

==Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame==
[[File:IMSHallofFame.JPG|thumb|The Auto Racing Hall of Fame]]
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame,&lt;ref name="IIBWGD"/&gt; formerly known as the '''Auto Racing Hall of Fame''',&lt;ref name="2010 article"/&gt; dates back to 1952. It was established and supported by the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] and [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; It was originally the brainchild of [[Tony Hulman]]&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; who had expressed interest in starting a racing [[hall of fame]] shortly after he purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1946.&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; As of 2017, there have been 153 inductees enshrined into the hall.

The [[AAA Contest Board|AAA]] dropped out of racing entirely in 1955. After being established for only three years, and after only a handful of historical, "veterans committee" inductees, the hall of fame went dormant. A year later, the first Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum opened its doors. In 1961, Hulman acquired and revived the hall of fame,&lt;ref name="1996 Program"/&gt; and incorporated it into the Speedway's museum organization.

Candidates can be nominated after at least twenty years from the first date of active participation in professional-level auto racing. A short list of nominees from before 1970, and nominees after 1970 are placed on the ballot. Inductees must receive 75 percent of the votes of a roughly 150-member&lt;ref name="2010 article"/&gt; panel of racing officials, living hall of fame members, and selected media representatives. Participation and accomplishments in the [[Indianapolis 500]] are heavily weighed, but are not the lone factors in consideration. Since 2018, the scope has been expanded to include participants of other events at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway: the [[Brickyard 400]] NASCAR race, which has taken place at IMS from 1994-present, and [[United States Grand Prix#Indianapolis Grand Prix|U.S. Grand Prix]] when [[Formula One]] competed at IMS from 2000-2007. Voting is held annually in the early spring. Beginning in 2017, the announcement of the inductees is made on Founders Day (March 20), the date in which the track was incorporated in 1909. The new members are formally inducted about a week before the race during a special ceremony. There is no set number of inductees for each year, and the number varies annually.

Inductees that are deceased are sometimes assigned Speedway historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]] to accept the award in their memory. In 2004, former car owner [[Roger Penske]] accepted the award on behalf of [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who could not make the trip from [[Brazil]].

'''Lambeau Field''' is an outdoor athletic stadium in the [[East North Central States|north central]] [[United States]], located in  [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. The home field of the [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), it opened in [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957]] as '''City Stadium''', replacing the original [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]] at [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]] as the Packers' home field.

(While [[Soldier Field]] in [[Chicago]] is older, it was not the home of the Bears until [[1971 Chicago Bears season|1971]].) Only the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[Fenway Park]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at Wrigley have longer active home-field tenures in American professional sports.

==History==
===Packers seek a modern facility===
Since 1925, the Packers had played at 25,000-seat [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], located behind [[Green Bay East High School]]. However, by the 1950s, it was considered inadequate for the times. It was built almost entirely of wood, and East High's locker room facilities were considered inadequate even in the 1920s; visiting teams often dressed at their hotel. Besides the school's location which limited any expansion of the seating southward, its placement along the [[East River (Wisconsin)|East River]] meant seating expansion on the north and east sides of the stadium was also impossible. Officials in [[Milwaukee]], {{convert|120|mi}} to the south, where the Packers had played part of their schedule since 1933, knew that City Stadium was less than ideal as an NFL venue. They built [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1953 in hopes of luring the Packers there full-time. As originally built, County Stadium was double the size of City Stadium.

Soon after County Stadium opened, the other NFL owners threatened to force the Packers to move to Milwaukee unless they built a new stadium. In August 1955, the Packers announced plans for a new stadium in Green Bay, with a seating capacity of 32,000.&lt;ref name=ngspbpk&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAkkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qCUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7079%2C4861047 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=New grid stadium planned by Packers |date=August 25, 1955 |page=18-part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1956, Green Bay voters responded by approving (70.3%) a bond issue to finance the new stadium.&lt;ref name=bvabyos&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nAQqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rSYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5155%2C2261763 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=Bay votes a big 'yes' on stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=17-part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gbdytns&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1956/04/04/page/53/article/green-bay-says-yes-to-new-stadium |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Green Bay says yes to new stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=3, part 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cost in 1957 was $960,000 (paid off in 1978) and its [[seating capacity]] was 32,500.

The new stadium was the first modern stadium built specifically for an NFL franchise. At the time, the eleven other NFL teams were playing either in facilities shared with [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[baseball]] teams, or in other pre-existing shared facilities.

The site, now bordered on three sides by the village of [[Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin|Ashwaubenon]], was selected because it had a natural slope, ideal for creating the bowl shape, along with expansive parking. The nearby outdoor practice fields ([[Clarke Hinkle Field]] and [[Ray Nitschke Field]]) and [[Don Hutson Center]] are in Ashwaubenon, as was the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame|Packers Hall of Fame]] until 2003.

The new City Stadium was officially opened in week one of the [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957 season]] on September 29,&lt;ref name=cstpostad&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/09/29/page/43/article/packers-open-stadium-pro-race-against-bears-today |work=Chicago Sunday Tribune |last=Hollow |first=Cooper |title=Packers open stadium, pro race against Bears today |date=September 29, 1957 |page=3, sec. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Packers upset the rival [[1957 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] 21–17 in front of a capacity crowd of 32,132.&lt;ref name=pubcwn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/09/30/page/65/article/packers-upset-bears-21-17-cards-win |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |last=Hollow |first=Cooper |title=Packers upset Bears, 21-17; Cards win |date=September 30, 1957 |page=1, sec. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ceremony at halftime, the stadium was dedicated by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. Also in attendance on the platform were reigning [[Miss America]] [[Marilyn Van Derbur]], NFL commissioner [[Bert Bell]], and Bears' owner [[George Halas]],&lt;ref name=cofgbcs/&gt; on a brief leave from coaching.

Although they now had a modern facility in Green Bay, the Packers continued to play two or three regular-season games in Milwaukee at County Stadium. Starting in [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], expansions to Lambeau Field (see below) made it financially realistic for the Packers to play their entire regular season in Green Bay for the first time in over 60 years. Former Milwaukee ticket holders receive tickets to a [[preseason]] game and games 2 and 5 of the regular season home schedule, in what is referred to as the "[[Gold (color)|Gold]] package". Green Bay season ticket holders receive tickets to the remaining home games as part of their "[[Green]] package".

===Expansion, 1961–95===
Demand for tickets at the new stadium easily outstripped supply, not coincidentally after the arrival of coach [[Vince Lombardi]] in [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|1959]]. In [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|1961]], four years after it opened, the stadium's capacity was increased to 38,669.&lt;ref name=ctbbagb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SQIqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hyYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3216%2C5191380 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Capacity to be boosted at Green Bay stadium |date=March 9, 1961|page=10-part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Packers have been regularly increasing the seating capacity. The bowl was increased to 42,327 in [[1963 Green Bay Packers season|1963]], to about 50,837 in [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|1965]] with the enclosure of the south end zone,&lt;ref name=sgagby&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AFYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7358%2C6135922|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Stadium grows at Green Bay |date=March 10, 1965 |page=18-part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pisfd&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PVYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ricEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2839,885296|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |last=Johnson |first=Chuck |title=Packers in shape for debut |date=August 12, 1965 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, 1987 pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, 1998 pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and to 56,263 in [[1970 Green Bay Packers season|1970]], when the north end zone was enclosed to form a continuous oval bowl.&lt;ref name=pssw70&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r34hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RIsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2931%2C1099940 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Packers start stadium work |date=January 23, 1970 |page=15-part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the team considered placing a dome on the stadium. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepostgame.com/throwback/201511/green-bay-packers-dome-lambeau-field-cold-snow-weather-home-field-advantage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of 72 [[luxury boxes|private boxes]] in [[1985 Green Bay Packers season|1985]] increased the seating capacity to 56,926, and a [[1990 Green Bay Packers season|1990]] addition of 36 additional boxes and 1,920 theatre-style club seats brought the number to 59,543. In [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], a $4.7 million project put 90 more private boxes in the previously open north end zone, again giving the stadium the feel of a complete bowl and increasing capacity to 60,890.

===2001–03 renovation===
[[Image:Lambeau-field.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The West side of Lambeau Field]]
By the end of 1999, the Packers believed that they needed to update the facility to remain financially competitive in the NFL. Rather than build a new stadium, Chairman/CEO [[Bob Harlan]] and President/COO John Jones unveiled a $295 million plan to renovate Lambeau Field in January 2000. It was to be paid for partly by the team via the 1997–98 stock sale, which netted more than $20 million. Most of the proceeds were to be paid through a 0.5% sales tax in [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] and [[personal seat license]] fees on [[season ticket]] holders. After their plan won approval by the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]], it was ratified by Brown County voters on September 12, 2000 by a 53%–47% margin. Construction began early in 2001. The sales tax expired on September 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/news/local/green-bay/lambeau-field-sales-tax-ends-today|title=After 15 years, Brown County Lambeau Field sales tax expires tonight|last=Miston|first=William|date=September 30, 2015|publisher=[[WLUK-TV]], Green Bay|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive redevelopment plan was designed to update the facilities, add more premium and suite seating, yet preserve the seating bowl, keeping the storied natural grass playing field of the "frozen tundra". The project was completed in time for the [[2003 Green Bay Packers season|2003 season]], bringing the capacity to 72,515.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambeaufield.com/stadium_info/history/lambeau_field_expansions/ Expansions] ''Lambeau Field''&lt;/ref&gt; Construction management was conducted by [[Turner Construction]] Sports, and proved to be of remarkably little disruption to the [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|2001]] and [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|2002 season]]s.

{{wide image|Lambeau Field panorama.jpg|750px|Lambeau Field on October 3, 2004}}

Although the capacity has more than doubled since Lambeau Field was opened, demand for tickets remains high. The Packers have sold out every game since [[1960 NFL season|1960]], and at least 115,000 names are on the waiting list (with a reported average wait time of 30 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/fan-zone/faq.html Packers.com Fan Zone FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The sell-out streak has had the effect (intended or not) of ensuring that all Packers home games are televised in Green Bay and Milwaukee, a streak that started in 1973 (prior to that time, local telecasts of home games were disallowed regardless of how many tickets were sold); the Packers are one of four NFL teams (the others being the [[Washington Redskins]], [[Denver Broncos]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]) that have not had a home game [[National Football League on television#Blackout policies|blacked out]] since the 1973 blackout rules were put into place, with the exception of a 1983 Wild Card Playoff game against the Cardinals in 1983.  &lt;ref&gt;https://fox6now.com/2014/01/02/1983-was-the-last-time-packers-fans-had-to-deal-with-a-blackout/ &lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], Lambeau Field was voted the number one NFL stadium in game-day atmosphere and fan experience by a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' online poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SI.com – NFL Fan Value Experience|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/11/01/fvi.intro/index.html?bcnn=yes|work=CNN|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, The Sports Turf Managers Association named Lambeau Field the 2009 Field of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2009/12/02/1/ Lambeau Named 2009 'Field Of The Year'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206105003/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2009/12/02/1 |date=December 6, 2009 }} Green Bay Packers&lt;/ref&gt;

===South end zone expansion, 2012–13===
[[File:Lambeau South End Zone Expansion.jpg|thumb|250px|A view of the 2013 Lambeau Field seating expansion in the south end zone and one of the new HD video boards]]In 2010, plans were announced by the Green Bay Packers to install new [[High-definition television|high definition]] scoreboards in place of their current scoreboards; plans for a new sound system were announced as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2010/12/07/packers-unveil-plans-for-new-scoreboards.html|title=Packers Unveil Plans for New Scoreboards|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Milwaukee Business Journal]]|date=December 7, 2010|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the plans were expanded to include adding as many as 7,500 seats both inside and outside as well as viewing platforms and lounge areas. On May 5, 2011, the Packers sent out an online survey to 30,000 season-ticket holders, club-seat holders and individuals on the season-ticket waiting list to get feedback from the fans on several concepts being considered for the south end-zone development. On August 25, 2011 plans were officially announced to add 7,500 new seats to the south end zone. The new seats are outdoors with the exception of one indoor row. The seats include heated areas that melt snow as it falls (a concept tested on a small scale during winter 2010), intending to solve the logistical problem of shoveling snow from an "upper deck" seating area. The snow that falls into the original bowl area is shoveled by compensated volunteers from the community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/12/22/fans-help-shovel-lambeau-field-before-packersvikings-game-saturday/|title=Fans help shovel Lambeau Field before Packers/Vikings game Saturday|date=February 22, 2016|website=FOX6Now.com|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a system of temporary chutes placed in the aisles and carts to remove the snow from the stadium.

[[Image:LambeaufieldGreenbay.jpg|thumb|r|upright=1.00|The renovated Lambeau Field on game day]]
The new sound system was completed in time for the 2011–2012 NFL season. On August 25, 2011 Packers president Mark Murphy announced that the expansion of Lambeau would not be paid by taxpayers but by the team itself. After construction was completed on the south end zone seating in the summer of 2013, Lambeau became the 3rd largest stadium in the NFL, with a capacity of 80,750. Additional construction included two new tower gates for the north and south end zone. Lambeau Field also installed [[Mitsubishi]] Diamond Vision Video Boards, as well as a rooftop viewing terrace in the north end zone for club seat holders during games. The rooftop viewing terrace and video boards were completed in time for the 2012 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article_spofford/article-1/Survey-seeks-input-on-south-end-zone/30e2147f-73c3-4904-a3ab-1e76c2cd8b1f Survey seeks input on south end zone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508054727/http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article_spofford/article-1/Survey-seeks-input-on-south-end-zone/30e2147f-73c3-4904-a3ab-1e76c2cd8b1f |date=2011-05-08 }} Green Bay Packers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81fb879e/article/packers-look-to-expand-lambeau-want-to-begin-work-in-2012?module=HP_headlines Packers look to expand Lambeau, want to begin work in 2012] National Football League&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2012, Lambeau Field was damaged by a minor fire when construction workers were cutting a metal beam near the fourth floor. The sparks from the cutting landed inside a wall and ignited the foam insulation. The area was temporarily evacuated and a minor back injury to one of the responding firefighters was reported. Green Bay Fire Lt. Nick Craig says the fire was small but in an unwieldy area. He says fire officials had to proceed slowly because they didn’t want to open the wall and allow the flames an oxygen supply until they had enough water on hand. The fire happened on Aaron Rodgers Day, a day the state proclaimed in honor of the Packers quarterback because Rodgers wears No. 12, and the date that Wednesday was 12-12-12. The fire damage cost $5,000 in repairs.

===Atrium renovation, 2013–15===
In 2013, the Packers announced a new $140.5 million renovation project for the Lambeau Atrium entrance, that will be entirely paid by the Packers without public funding. The project began in March 2013 and was completed in June 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/packers/packers-announce-140-million-atrium-renovation-plan-np8a6vu-186096071.html|title=Packers plan $140 million Lambeau atrium upgrade|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statues at Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|rt|upright=1.00|Statues of Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi at Lambeau Field]]
The Packers removed ground between Bob Harlan Plaza and Lombardi Avenue, which is now the basement of the atrium. The Pro Shop has been moved to the new ground level, and a set of escalators were installed on the western side, leading to the atrium and the entrance of the Miller Gate. The Packers Hall of Fame moved to the second floor of the atrium where Curly's Pub was originally located. Curly's moved to the main floor where the Pro Shop was previously held. This renovation project was referred to as "Phase II", with the first phase considered as the 7,500 seats that were installed previously. The new setup was made to be easier for fans to get to Curly's as it was difficult for fans in the past.

Phase II also included the following:

*The Oneida Nation gate was given an expanded plaza extending into the east parking lot. A tunnel under the plaza leads to a player parking area immediately east of the player facilities. Permanent rest rooms were installed under the plaza.
*A new entrance called the [[American Family Insurance]] gate was added at parking lot level on the east side, with an escalator providing access to the main floor of the atrium. The Pro Shop is also accessible here.
*Harlan Plaza in front of the Miller Gate facing Lombardi Avenue will remain, but its front now lines up with the North face of the atrium tower where the Pro Shop is situated. The Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi statues were repositioned and remain in the plaza.
*New player facilities in the lower level of the stadium, including strength and conditioning rooms and a 35-by-50-yard practice walk-through area.

The renovation project is expected to create approximately 1,500 jobs and pay more than $60 million in wages.{{update needed|date=January 2018}} Team president and CEO [[Mark Murphy (safety, born 1955)|Mark Murphy]] said 95% of spending on the project will be done in Wisconsin and 69% in northeastern Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2013/01/09/lambeau-field-renovation-underground/1819917/ Packers plan to renovate the Lambeau Atrium]".

{{Main|Titletown District}}
On August 20, 2015, the Green Bay Packers presented the master plan for the Titletown District, an area that will be constructed on approximately 34 acres of land just west of Lambeau Field. Titletown will consist of three tenants including [[Destination Kohler#Lodge Kohler|Lodge Kohler]], a hotel built and managed by the [[Kohler Company]]; a Bellin Health Sports Medicine Clinic; and Hinterland Restaurant and Brewery. Development on the remaining 16 acres calls for commercial, retail, and residential elements.

===Packers record at Lambeau===
[[File:View of Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|rt|upright=1.00|View of Lambeau Field from the South end zone]]
As of the end of the 2017 season, the Packers have compiled a 231–120–5 regular season mark at Lambeau Field. The Packers playoff record at home as of the 2017 season is 17-5.

The [[Denver Broncos]] (0-4) are the only NFL team that has never won a regular season game at Lambeau Field. No team has an undefeated record at Lambeau Field. The last remaining team with an undefeated record, the [[Houston Texans]], was beaten by the Packers in [[2016 Green Bay Packers season|Week 13]] of the [[2016 NFL season]].

==Name and nickname==
===New City Stadium===
{{Main|City Stadium (Green Bay)}}
The original name of Lambeau Field lasted through the [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|1964 season]]. Officially "City Stadium", the name "New City Stadium" was used informally to distinguish it from its predecessor at [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]].

===Lambeau Field===
[[File:2009-0620-WI010-GB-Lambeau.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Curly Lambeau stands near the main entrance]]

Two months after the death of Packers founder [[Curly Lambeau]], New City Stadium was renamed "Lambeau Field" by the Green Bay city council on August 3, [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|1965]].&lt;ref name=pbblfid/&gt;&lt;ref name=lfvbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maraniss, 1999 pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides founding the team in 1919, Lambeau played for the Packers in their early years and was the team's coach for 31 seasons through [[1949 Green Bay Packers season|1949]]. He shares the distinction with rival [[George Halas]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] of coaching his team to the most [[NFL championships]], with six. Lambeau was inducted as a charter member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in Canton, Ohio in 1963.

===Corporate naming rights===
On November 7, 2000, two months after Brown County voters approved a sales tax to fund Lambeau Field's renovation, a second referendum was presented to the same Brown County voters. This referendum asked whether naming rights to the renovated stadium should be sold in order to retire earlier the 0.5% sales tax created to cover construction costs. The referendum passed 53%-47%, the exact percentage by which voters approved the sales tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=149148 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: "Packers, Green Bay to discuss Lambeau naming rights" June 19, 2003.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="namingrightsvote"&gt;{{cite news|title=Packers to Start Shopping Lambeau Name Around|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/news/nov00/lambeau09110800.asp|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=November 8, 2000|accessdate=August 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227024751/http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/news/nov00/lambeau09110800.asp|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the vote passed, the Packers entered talks with the city of Green Bay, which owns the stadium, to further explore the options. The City and team agreed to sell the rights if a price of $100 million could be realized, although no buyer has been found.

The Packers, although agreeing to be bound by the will of the voters, have consistently stressed that they would prefer Lambeau Field keep its traditional name, honoring the club's founder.&lt;ref name="namingrightsvote"/&gt;

The Packers have sold naming rights to the eight entrance gates. From the north going clockwise, they are: [[Bellin Health]] (north gate), [[Miller Brewing]] (atrium gate), [[American Family Insurance]] (northeast gate at parking lot level), the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin|Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin]] (east gate on elevated plaza facing Oneida Street), [[Shopko]] (south gate), [[Mills Fleet Farm]] stores (southwest gate), [[Associated Bank]] (west gate and private box entrance), and [[Kwik Trip]] (northwest gate). [[Verizon Communications Inc.|Verizon]] was the previous sponsor of the northwest gate (2003-2017). Miller Brewing is also a sponsor of the atrium, and has a section in one end zone called the "Miller Lite End Zone", giving away tickets in that area with various beer promotions.

At the 2015 Packers shareholders meeting President Mark Murphy said "We will not sell the naming rights to the stadium. ... We will never do that. It will always be Lambeau Field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-07-29/packers-lambeau-field-naming-rights-mark-murphy-london "Packers will 'never' sell naming rights to Lambeau Field, CEO says"].

==="The Frozen Tundra"===
[[Image:Lambeau Field bowl.jpg|thumb|right|An empty Lambeau Field.]]
The stadium's [[nickname]] was spawned by the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] between the Packers and the [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], played on December 31, 1967. The game was played in temperatures of {{convert|-15|F}} with sharp winds. Journalist [[Tex Maule]] associated Lambeau Field with the term ''[[tundra]]'' in his article summarizing the game in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name="The Old Pro"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The old pro goes in for six|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1968/01/08/542925/the-old-pro-goes-in-for-six|magazine=Sports Illustrated|last=Maule |first=Tex |authorlink=Tex Maule |date=January 8, 1968|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambeau Field is alleged to have gotten its nickname, ''The Frozen Tundra'', from ''The Greatest Challenge'', the Packers' authorized version of the highlight film written by [[Steve Sabol]].&lt;ref name="Davis, 2008, p. 159."&gt;Davis, 2008, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cowboys' authorized version of the highlight film, ''A Chilling Championship'', also written by Sabol, [[Bill Woodson]] used the term the ''Frozen Tundra'' when narrating the film to describe Lambeau Field.&lt;ref name="Davis, 2008, p. 159." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodson Was First With 'Frozen Tundra'"&gt;{{cite web |title=Woodson Was First With 'Frozen Tundra'|url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=6428|work=Press Box Online|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|1967 season]], an [[under-soil heating|underground electric heating]] system had been installed but it was not able to counter the effects of the cold front that hit Green Bay at the onset of the ''Ice Bowl''.

The underground heating and drainage system was redone in [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997]], with a system of pipes filled with a solution including antifreeze replacing the electric coils. After the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006 season]], the surface, heating, and drainage system was replaced. A new grass surface was installed, using the [[Desso GrassMaster]] system, which has synthetic fibers woven into the traditional [[Kentucky bluegrass]] sod.&lt;ref name=thnwgisk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lambeau Field Updates Include a New Surface|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2690426|work=[[ESPN]]|date=December 7, 2006|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/29409724.html|title=Grass is greener: Lambeau surface bounces back|last=Nickel|first=Lori|date=June 2, 2008|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=October 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005003742/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/29409724.html|archivedate=October 5, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the new video boards, installed in [[2004 NFL season|2004]], have been influenced by the field's nickname, being called "Tundra Vision". These video displays measure more than {{convert|25|ft|m}} high by {{convert|46|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=displays&gt;{{cite web |title=Lambeau Field, Stadium Facts|url=http://www.lambeaufield.com/stadium_info/history/|publisher=Green Bay Packers|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An artificial lighting system, based on technology used in Dutch rose-growing greenhouses, was tested in [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]] and purchased for use in the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 season]]. It operates 24 hours a day from October to early December to extend the growing season for the field's grass. The system is also used in some soccer stadiums where shade from stands and partial roofs are a problem for the turf, not the cold and short growing season found in Green Bay.&lt;ref name="Branch, John"/&gt;

===Titletown, USA===
More famously a nickname for the city than its football field, "Titletown, USA" became popularized in 1961, even before [[Vince Lombardi]] won any of his championships. At the [[1961 NFL Championship Game]] against the [[New York Giants]], which the Packers won 37–0, fans hung up signs around the stadium that read ''Welcome to Titletown, USA''. Then-Giants quarterback [[Y. A. Tittle]] joked that the honor was for him, just that his name was misspelled. By the mid-60s, Titletown, USA was registered as a trademark of the Green Bay Packers, Inc. Lambeau Field has been home to seven NFL world championship seasons, five under Lombardi, one under [[Mike Holmgren]] and one under [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], surpassing the six world championship seasons witnessed by its predecessor, [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], under Curly Lambeau.

==Postseason==
[[Image:LambeauFieldAtriumInside.jpg|thumb|right|The Atrium inside Lambeau Field]]
Lambeau Field has frequently given a significant postseason [[home-field advantage]] for the Packers. Playoff games at Lambeau Field typically feature cold Wisconsin winters. The most famous example is the aforementioned [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]]. More recently, in the [[NFL playoffs, 1997|1997 NFL playoffs]] both the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the divisional playoffs and the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 1996-97#Conference championships|NFC Championship Game]] struggled to adapt to the muddy and the cold conditions respectively. The temperatures during the [[National Football League playoffs, 2007-08#NFC: New York Giants 23, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT)|2007]] [[NFC Championship Game]] (in which the Packers lost in OT, 23–20, to the [[New York Giants]]) reached as low as {{convert|-4|F}}, with a wind chill of {{convert|-24|F|}}. From its opening in [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957]] until January 2003, when they fell 27–7 to the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], the Packers had never lost a postseason game at Lambeau Field. However, the Packers hosted just one postseason game (in the ad-hoc round-of-16 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]) during a lean stretch of 27 years between the [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]] of [[1967 NFL season|1967]] and a wild-card game in December 1994. Although the Packers have won only five of their last ten playoff games at Lambeau Field, their overall home post-season record is a respectable 16–5. The stadium has hosted five championship contests: three NFL title games in [[NFL Championship Game, 1961|1961]], [[NFL Championship Game, 1965|1965]] and [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|1967]] (the "Ice Bowl"); two NFC championships after the 1996 and 2007 seasons.

==Traditions==
===The "Lambeau Leap"===
[[File:James Stark doing the Lambeau Leap (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[James Starks]] doing the "Lambeau Leap"]]
Many Packer players will jump into the end zone stands after scoring a touchdown, in a celebration affectionately known as the "Lambeau Leap". The Lambeau Leap was invented by safety [[LeRoy Butler]], who scored after a [[Reggie White]] fumble recovery and lateral against the [[Oakland Raiders|L.A. Raiders]] on December 26, [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]]. It was later popularized by wide receiver [[Robert Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traditions|url=http://uscsports.cstv.com/trads/scar-hof.html|publisher=University of South Carolina Athletics|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packersnews.com/print/print_11238108.shtml Lambeau Field Timeline] Green Bay Packers news&lt;/ref&gt;

It's not known precisely when the celebration was first coined the "Lambeau Leap", but one of the first possible mentions was by broadcaster [[Al Michaels]], who mentioned during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1996, "It's a new tradition in Green Bay, Robert Brooks ''leaping'' into the stands."

When the NFL banned [[Touchdown celebration|excessive celebrations]] in 2000, the Lambeau Leap was [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into the new rules, permitting it to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10671807/nfl-penalize-goal-post-dunk-next-season "Goalpost dunks will draw flags"]. ESPN. Retrieved January 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a visiting player will attempt a Lambeau Leap, only to be denied by Packers fans. This happened to then-[[Minnesota Vikings]] [[cornerback]] [[Fred Smoot]] when he intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37qkcicW8E YouTube – Fred Smoot's Lambeau Leap!!!]&lt;/ref&gt; Packers fans proceeded to throw their beverages on Smoot. During the [[2007–08 NFL playoffs#NFC: New York Giants 23, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT)|2007 NFC Championship game]], [[New York Giants]] [[running back]] [[Brandon Jacobs]] faked a Lambeau Leap after scoring a touchdown, angering many Green Bay faithful in the stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280120009 Manning, Giants head to Super Bowl for rematch with Pats]&lt;/ref&gt; Before a game against the Packers on September 20, 2009, [[Cincinnati Bengals]] wideout [[Chad Johnson (American football)|Chad Johnson]], then known as Chad Ochocinco, announced he would do a Lambeau Leap if he scored a touchdown, and then followed through by leaping into the arms of pre-arranged fans wearing Bengals jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4489691 ESPN – Ochocinco finds end zone in Green Bay] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4497498 Ochocinco had it planned out]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a statue was made outside of Lambeau Field commemorating the Leap. Featuring a shortened replica of the end zone wall and 4 random Packers fans, the statue allows visitors to pose for pictures doing their own Lambeau Leap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-press-release/article-1/Lambeau-Leap-Statue-unveiled/abd0acab-08d5-457f-a955-c10ac3e3da08 "Lambeau Leap Statue unveiled"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102083338/http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-press-release/article-1/Lambeau-Leap-Statue-unveiled/abd0acab-08d5-457f-a955-c10ac3e3da08 |date=2015-01-02 }}. Packers.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NFL Network]] countdown program, NFL Top 10, named the Lambeau Leap the 3rd greatest touchdown celebration of all time.

===Stadium music===
[[Image:LambeauFieldWelcome2007.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome sign]]
Originally, music at Lambeau Field was provided by the Packers' [[Lumberjack Band]]. The live band has been replaced by recorded music.

The Packers intro music for when they are introduced before each game is "[[Get Ready for This]]" by [[2 Unlimited]]. [[Public address|PA announcer]] Bill Jartz (also the main [[news anchor]] for [[WBAY-TV]] (Channel 2)), accompanies this by saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, here are your 13-time World Champion Green Bay Packers."

Whenever the Packers score a touchdown, the [[Todd Rundgren]] hit "[[Bang the Drum All Day]]" is played. This tradition began in 1985.

The "Go Pack Go" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is "Go Pack Go!" by The 6 Packers.

The [[House of Pain]] hit "[[Jump Around]]" is often played during one time-out at Lambeau, resulting in widespread jumping around by the crowd. This tradition began due to the popularity of the same song/[[Jump Around#University of Wisconsin-Madison|crowd-participation tradition]] at [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]] football games.

The [[polka]] standard "[[Beer Barrel Polka]]" (also known as "Roll Out The Barrel") is also played at Lambeau Field, usually in the fourth quarter of games. "[[I Gotta Feeling]]" by [[the Black Eyed Peas]] is played when the Packers win a game.

===Packers shareholders meeting===
With the 1997–98 sale of stock in the [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.|Packers corporation]], swelling the number of owners to over 112,000, a large venue was needed for the annual shareholders meeting. The event returned to Lambeau Field in 2006 after several thousand people were turned away from the 2005 meeting at the nearby [[Resch Center]].

===High school and college football===
When built, Lambeau Field was also slated to be used by Green Bay's public high schools, as old City Stadium had been. However, a key [[1962 NFL season|1962]] game between the [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] and [[1962 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, however both Southwest High and West High played there until a west side high school stadium was built in the late 1970s. In 1973, the WISAA Championship game was played there, the last at Lambeau, between Wisconsin Rapids Assumption and Marquette University High School. In 1982 and 1983, [[St. Norbert College]] hosted [[Fordham University]] (Lombardi's [[alma mater]]) in two [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] tilts, benefitting the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation.&lt;ref name="nytcarmexclassic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/lambeau-field-gives-college-football-a-try.html|title=Lambeau Field Gives Football the Old College Try|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=September 1, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the 2006 Wisconsin–Ohio State hockey game (see below), newspaper reports said the Wisconsin football team might be interested in moving a non-conference road game to Lambeau Field.

In 2016, Lambeau Field hosted the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin Badgers]] vs. [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] in the 2nd of a two-game series which started in 2014, where the game was in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] at [[NRG Stadium]].&lt;ref name="nytcarmexclassic" /&gt; The Badgers won in what was called a "Historic upset" by ESPN and Yahoo! Sports, as the unranked Badgers defeated the #5 ranked Tigers 16-14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/135993/wisconsin-secures-historic-upset-as-lsu-sputters-in-season-opener "Opening ouch: LSU sputters as Wisconsin lands historic upset"]. ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/video/wisconsin-shocks-lsu-historic-upset-034131978.html "Wisconsin shocks LSU in historic upset"]. Yahoo. Retrieved December 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
[[File:Lambeau Field (Wisconsin Badgers vs Ohio State Buckeyes, February 2006).jpg|thumb|right|Lambeau Field hosting its first hockey game.]]
Following the success of the "[[Cold War (ice hockey)|Cold War]]", collegiate ice hockey game held in 2001 at [[Michigan State University|Michigan State's]] [[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)|Spartan Stadium]], [[ice hockey|hockey]] teams from [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Ohio State]] met in the [[Frozen Tundra Hockey Classic]], an outdoor game played on a temporary rink inside the stadium on February 11, 2006. The Badgers defeated the Buckeyes 4–2 before a capacity crowd of 40,890. There were some problems as the ice began to crack during play, but overall it was a success, ending with the Badgers doing the Lambeau Leap following their victory.

===Snowmobile racing===
In 2004 a snowmobile racing event was held in the parking lot due to a lack of snow. In 2005 the snowmobile racing event took place over the turf, with the right amount of snow cover.

===Concerts===
Not many concerts are held at Lambeau Field because the primary use of the stadium is football. The Lambeau Field lease between the city of Green Bay and the Packers allows for one non-football event a month between February and June, with the Packers having veto power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/06/27/lambeau-field-host-concerts/29365127/|title=Lambeau Field should host more concerts|work=Press Gazette Media|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability plans==
The Green Bay Packers have made efforts to make Lambeau Field more environmentally sustainable. In fact, extra recycling bins will be placed around the field and biodegradable food-ware will be used at restaurants and other establishments within Lambeau Field. In addition, there are plans to power the field with wind energy and biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Bay Packers Launch Environmental Program|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2008/07/23/green-bay-packers-launch-environmental-program/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, more than 500 induction lighting fixtures have been installed within it, as well as 11 high-efficiency condensing boilers for space heating in the stadium, melting snow, and heating the field. Also, two high-efficiency electric chillers have been installed for the air-conditioned regions of Lambeau Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Bay Packers, WPS focus on energy|url=http://www.fierceenergy.com/story/green-bay-packers-wps-focus-energy/2014-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Major League: Back to the Minors''''' is a 1998 American [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film|comedy]] film written and directed by John Warren. It is the third film in the ''Major League'' series, following ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' (1989) and ''[[Major League II]]'' (1994).

== Plot ==
Roger Dorn is now the owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Aging minor league pitcher Gus Cantrell, who plays for the [[Fort Myers Miracle]], is planning to retire. Then, Roger recruits Gus to be the manager of the Buzz, the Twins' [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[minor league]] affiliate. Gus's mission is to make a real team out of a bunch of players who include ballet dancer turned ballplayer Lance "The Dance" Pere, minor league lifer Frank "Pops" Morgan, Rube Baker, Taka Tanaka, Pedro Cerrano, pitcher Hog Ellis, home run hitter Billy "Downtown" Anderson, and pitcher Carlton "Doc" Windgate, a medical school graduate who throws the slowest fastball in the minors.

However, Gus clashes with Leonard Huff, the snobby manager of the Twins. One night in Minnesota, Gus and his fiancee Maggie Reynolds are having dinner with Roger and Huff at an expensive-looking restaurant, where Huff challenges Gus to a game between the Buzz and the Twins and Gus accepts the challenge.

The game is scheduled to take place at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minnesota. The Twins take a 3-0 lead in the 6th inning, but Downtown hits a home run that ties the game at 3-3 in the 8th inning.  But in the bottom of the 9th inning, with two outs, while the Twins are up to bat, and Doc is one strike away from striking out home run hitter Carlos Liston, Huff has the stadium's lights turned off so the game can end with a tie rather than give the Buzz a chance to win in extra innings. However, the media says that the Twins were still outplayed by the Buzz.

Huff now wants to bring Downtown up to the Twins, even though Gus believes that he is not yet ready. However, Anderson jumps on the opportunity, turning his back on Gus. Without Downtown, the Buzz start losing again. With the Twins, Anderson starts hitting poorly, proving Huff wrong. Gus manages to get the Buzz back on track, and Downtown is sent back down to the Buzz, where Gus teaches him how to get more hits. Gus leads the Buzz to a division title in their league.

Gus issues a challenge for Huff to bring the Twins to Buzz Stadium for another game. If the Twins win, Gus will give his salary for the year to Huff. If Gus and the Buzz beat the Twins, Gus can take over as the manager of the Twins. Huff accepts the challenge and takes the Twins to play against the Buzz. This time, the Twins take a 4-0 lead in the 6th inning, but the Buzz still manage to come from behind with three runs, and then win the game, 5-4, thanks to a game-winning two-run home run by Downtown. Gus decides that he wants to stay with the Buzz so he can continue to work with minor league players on their skills and hopefully turn them into stars.

==Possible sequel==
[[David S. Ward]], the writer and producer of the original ''Major League'', announced in 2010 that he was working on a new film, which he calls ''Major League 3'', which instead as a proper sequel to the second film and hoped to cast the original stars [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Tom Berenger]].

'''Meiklejohn Stadium ''' is a ballpark in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It is on the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus and is the home field for the University of Pennsylvania Quakers varsity baseball team.

The field is about half a mile south-southeast of [[Franklin Field]], along the eastern edge of the university's campus, along the [[Schuylkill River]]. The ballpark is tucked away near the intersection of the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] and University Avenue. The [[CSX Transportation|CSX railroad tracks]] run behind home plate and are still in use. [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]] (the Schuylkill Expressway) runs parallel to the outfield wall with exit 41 visible from home plate. The right field foul line is kept tight by a large power plant that has two rising cooling tanks and a fence around its perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Murphy field keeps dream alive for Temple baseball| date=2000-04-20| publisher=| url=http://temple-news.com/2000/04/20/murphy-field-keeps-dream-alive-for-temple-baseball/| work=[[The Temple News]]| pages=| accessdate=2009-06-11| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710040814/http://temple-news.com/2000/04/20/murphy-field-keeps-dream-alive-for-temple-baseball/| archivedate=2011-07-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; River Field Drive, which fronts the railroad tracks to the nort, is so close that there are only a couple of rows of seats available on the third base side.

When it opened, the dimensions were reported to be 289 feet to the left field foul pole, 317 feet to the right field foul pole, and 385 feet to dead center field. The first game was played on March 23, 2000, against [[Saint Joseph's Hawks#Baseball|St. Joseph's University]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ryan| last=Kelly| coauthors= | title=Taking to the field: Baseball welcomes the opening of Penn's new stadium at Murphy Field| date=2000-03-09| publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]| url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2000/03/09/Resources/Taking.To.The.Field.Baseball.Welcomes.The.Opening.Of.Penns.New.Stadium.At.Murphy-2163051.shtml| work =[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-11| language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn beat St. Joe's 13-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jay| last=Nagle| coauthors= | title=Quakers break in new park| date=2000-03-24| newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer| url=| work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark does not have lights, so all games are played during the day.

The stadium opened in 2000 and was originally called Murphy Field after the athletic fields on which the ballpark was built.

Their contributions to the University included $10 million in 2005 to help renovate the baseball field including the addition of a new scoreboard. The field was officially renamed on April 1, 2006, prior to a double-header against [[Brown Bears|Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Bernstein| coauthors=| title=Field to be renamed at ceremony tomorrow| date=2006-03-31| publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]| url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/03/31/Sports/Field.To.Be.Renamed.At.Ceremony.Tomorrow-2144914.shtml| work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]| pages=| accessdate=2009-06-11| language=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predecessors ==

From at least 1875 through the first few games of 1895, the team staged its home games at Penn's multi-purpose athletic grounds, aka '''University Grounds'''.[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/baseball/1800s/1894.html][http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/baseball/1800s/1875.html] The field was on the block southeast of the 37th and Spruce intersection, a few blocks west of the eventual site of Franklin Field.[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/img/alum/blkly1894x600.jpg] That site is now occupied by dormitories and a quadrangle.

'''River Field''', another campus multi-sports facility, opened a baseball diamond in 1940, allowing the baseball team to vacate Franklin Field.[Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb 14, 1940]

'''Bower Field''', which opened in May 1979, was Penn baseball's home field immediately prior to Meiklejohn. It was known to be a pitchers' ballpark.

The '''War Memorial Arena''' (originally known as '''Onondaga County War Memorial''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is part of the [[Oncenter|Oncenter Complex]]. Designed by Edgarton and Edgarton and built from 1949 through 1951, the structure is significant as an example of a World War I, World War II and Aroostook War commemorative&lt;ref name="nrhptext"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Onondaga County War Memorial|first=Kathleen|last=LaFrank|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6369|publisher=State of New York|date=October 1988|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}and [http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6204 ''Accompanying 21 photos, exterior and interior, from construction through 1988']&lt;/ref&gt; and as "an early and sophisticated example of single-span thin-shell concrete roof construction." It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988. The War Memorial has been renovated in 1994 and 2018.

==Tenants==
The War Memorial Arena is home to the [[Syracuse Crunch]] [[ice hockey]] team and the [[Professional Arena Soccer League|Major Arena Soccer League]] team the [[Syracuse Silver Knights]].

Previous teams to call the War Memorial home included the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Syracuse Nationals]], the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]]'s  [[Syracuse Smash]] and several now-defunct [[American Hockey League]] teams. The Nationals defeated the [[Fort Wayne Pistons]] in a deciding seventh game at home to win the [[1954–55 NBA Championship]]. The War Memorial also hosted the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in 1961 and the NCAA [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|Frozen Four]] in 1967 and 1971.

The 1977 film [[Slap Shot]] included the War Memorial among the various arenas used as shooting locations for in-game action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering a Legend|url=http://www.syracuse.com/today/index.ssf/2008/09/remembering_a_legend.html|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=Syracuse|date=September 28, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:War Memorial at Oncenter.jpg|thumb|left|War Memorial at OnCenter (2006)]]

==Notable events==
The Onondaga County War Memorial was home to the annual [[New York State Public High School Athletic Association|NYSPHSAA]] wrestling tournament in 1968, from 1970 to 1972, and then for 29-straight years, 1974–2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysphsaawrestling.com/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109090933/http://nysphsaawrestling.com/history.html |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The championship event has since been hosted by various venues around the state.

Professional wrestling has also experienced its share of history at the War Memorial. Shortly after completion of filming of the [[World Championship Wrestling]]-produced film [[Ready to Rumble]], actor [[David Arquette]] won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship title on April 26, 2000 in a taping of the company's weekly [[Thunder]] broadcast, which is often cited as being the first legitimate sign of the demise of WCW. It also hosted the first WWF [[In Your House]] pay-per-view in 1995. In April 1998 the Oncenter hosted [[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]].  The Oncenter is occasionally host to [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] [[house show]]s.

The [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Syracuse Crunch]] have hosted the AHL All-Star Classic twice (1998, 2016) and reached the Calder Cup Finals in 2013 and 2017.

The arena hosted the opening ceremonies and several games of the [[2015 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] from September 18–26, 2015.

It is also a prominent concert venue in the region, which includes various [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Aerosmith]] shows among numerous others over the years. [[Elvis Presley]] also performed at the venue, July 25 and 26, 1976. An audience recording featuring both shows was released in 2015 under the title Onondaga Nights.

The Oncenter War Memorial Arena was the first professional hockey arena to install LED lighting in 2012, provided by Ephesus Lighting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.com/nhl/2015/07/01/NHL-AHL-hockey-arena-led-lighting-makes-ice-look-brighter&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the arena's stage are the words, "In memory of our service veterans."

'''Protective equipment in [[gridiron football]]''' ("football gear") consists of equipment worn by football players for the protection of the body during the course of a football game. Basic equipment worn by most football players include [[football helmet|helmet]], [[shoulder pads]], gloves, shoes, and thigh and knee pads,a mouthguard, and a [[jockstrap]] or [[compression shorts]] with or without a [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Neck rolls, elbow pads, hip pads, tailbone pads, rib pads, and other equipment may be worn in addition to the aforementioned basics. Football protective equipment is made of synthetic materials: [[foam rubber]]s, [[Elastomer|elastics]], and durable, shock-resistant, molded [[plastic]]. Football protective equipment has remained consistent in use for decades with some slight modifications made over the years in design and materials. The assignment and maintenance of football gear belongs to the team [[equipment manager]].

==Helmet==
{{Main|Football helmet}}
[[File:20090905 Kevin Grady.jpg|thumb|[[Kevin Grady]] wearing a [[winged football helmet]] with a clear [[visor]] and a mouthguard .]]
The professional football helmet consists of  several distinct parts: the shell, jaw pads and abdomen bladders, face mask, chin strap, and mouth guard. The shell is constructed of hard plastic with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football, except for non-tackle variations such as flag football. Although they are protective, players can and do still suffer head injuries such as concussion.
Football helmets are the logo of the team and the team colors.

There are several styles of face masks and chin straps available. The selection is left to the player, with quarterbacks generally selecting more open masks with maximum visibility.
Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility. There are at least 15 different facemask styles. New design for the helmet includes an integrated faceguard featuring shock absorbing "Energy Wedges" that reduce the force of impacts to the faceguard.

A recent addition to the football helmet is a visor or eye shield, traditionally used to protect players from eye injuries or glare. Former [[Chicago Bears]] quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] was the first to wear a visor/shield. The visors started out as clear or smoked, but now come in colors ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. The visor/shield is used at the player's discretion.

The helmet fitting process starts by measuring the player's head with [[calipers]]. Based on measurements taken, a helmet shell of the appropriate size and style is chosen. Then, padding is added to ensure that the helmet fits the player's head. Padding consists of both foam rubber pads and inflatable (air) pads. Both the top and side padding include inflatable bladders that customize the fit. Once the helmet is in place on the player's head, the inflater bulb is applied to two points on the outside of the helmet. The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player's face. The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light, and once the pads are in place, there is no movement or shifting on the player's head.

===Radio===
The NFL allowed dummy communication in regular-season games in 1994. Rather than coaches calling a time-out in order to give a play to a quarterback, many of today's teams are opting for radios inside their quarterback's helmet. The helmets are set up with a small speaker in each ear hole. Quarterback coaches or offensive coordinators on the sidelines talk to the quarterback with a radio, giving him specific plays and options. Players from the "old school" might argue that this creates an unfair advantage, but proponents say that the radio helmets make for clear coach-to-player communication, even in large, noisy games like the Super Bowl.

NFL rules state that all helmets with a headset in them must have a visible green dot on the back. Since only the quarterback can have a wired helmet, it stops other players using the quarterback's helmet. A few times in 2006 the holder on the field goal attempt was told to pull up and throw or run at the last second because of a change the coaches saw on the field. This gave teams an "unfair advantage" in the eyes of the NFL. The new rules let each team know who is wearing a headset and who is hearing the plays being called.

According to a press interview held with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the quality of the sound is good, but crowd noise factors in. “It’s about like what you’d hear over a loudspeaker,” said Bucs QB Shaun King. “It can be hard to hear when there’s a lot of noise on the outside, but it’s pretty cool."

===Off field===

==Shoulder pads==
{{Main|Shoulder pads}}
The shoulder pads consist of a hard plastic outer shell with shock-absorbing foam padding underneath. The pads fit over the shoulders and the chest and rib area, and are secured with various snaps and buckles. Shoulder pads give football players their typical "broad-shouldered" look, and are fitted to an adult player by measuring across the player's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade with a soft cloth measuring tape and then adding 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch. For comfort, shoulder pads are sometimes worn in conjunction with a shoulder pads cushion of foam rubber over a cotton half-tee.

Shoulder pads accomplish two things for a football player: (1) they absorb some of the shock of impact through deformation. The pads at the shoulders are strung on tight webbing and deform on impact, and (2) they distribute the shock through a larger pad that is designed to regulate players' body temperatures during games and practices and protects against injury.

==Jockstrap, or athletic supporter==

A typical [[jockstrap]] used in football is constructed of a wide elastic waistband with a support pouch of cotton/elastic to contain the genitals. Two wide elastic straps affixed to the base of the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip complete the jock. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|impact resistant cup]] (protective cup) to protect the testicles and penis from injury. Many youth football players, such as the [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] leagues, are often required to wear a protective cup.  However, they are now not worn as often at the high school, college, and peewee level, although still highly recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Fleming |first= David |date= November 10, 2005 |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=fleming/040922 |title= When Did Cups Become Uncool? |department= Flem File |work= Page 2 |publisher= [[ESPN]] |accessdate= April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The jockstrap is the one piece of equipment used in football that predates the sport itself. In 1874, Charles Bennett of the Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp &amp; Smith, created the "bicycle jockey strap" for bicycle riders (or, bicycle jockeys as they were then known). Other athletes adopted the jockey strap in their sports. A mass marketing in 1902 claimed the garment, now termed a "small comforter" was "medically installed" for all males that engaged in sports or harmful activity.

==Jerseys and pants==

The main purpose of these two garments is to identify the player by name and [[Number (sports)#American football|number]], and by his team [[Away colours|colors]].

'''Jerseys.''' The front and back of the [[jersey (sport)|jersey]] are usually nylon, with spandex side panels to keep it taut. The goal is to make it difficult for an opposing player to grab hold of the jersey and use it for leverage. To help this process: Jerseys have an extension at the bottom that wraps around from front to back to keep the jersey tucked in. Jerseys have a wide strip of Velcro at the rear that mates with Velcro inside the waistband of the pants. Many players apply two-sided carpet tape to their shoulder pads so that the jersey sticks to the pads. The players individually choose which of these features (if any) they will use. Each professional football player is usually equipped with a set of practice jerseys as well as four game jerseys. Players will change jerseys at half time if it is raining. Jerseys will usually have a variety of patches affixed to the shoulders or other parts of the garment. Patches may depict the American flag, the team [[logo#Sports|logo]], or other significant information.

'''Pants.''' Pants are manufactured in nylon and mesh (for hot weather practices), and nylon and spandex for a tight fit (with team colors) for games. Most pants are manufactured with the traditional lace-up fly as a zippered fly is impractical and subject to damage due to stress in the rough and tumble of the game. The interior sides of the pants legs contain four individual pockets to hold two thigh pads (one for each leg) and two knee pads. The pads are placed in the pockets before the pants are put on in the locker room. The pants are secured with a belt, sometimes with a traditional metal buckle or with several rings. Game-used jerseys and pants are sports collectibles, with those of celebrity athletes realizing high sums.

==Footwear==
{{main|Cleat (shoe)}}

Similar to [[football boots|soccer cleats]], gridiron football shoewear have soles that consist of spikes called "cleats" purposefully designed for games on grass. Some cleats have removable cleats that can be screwed into specific holes. Cleat sizes are changed, depending on the conditions of the field (longer cleats provide better traction on a wet field, shorter cleats provide greater speed on a dry field). Flat bottomed shoes, called "turf shoes," are worn on [[artificial turf]] (specifically [[AstroTurf]] due to the lack of soil that causes friction and grip in artificial fields.

==Other==

===Hip, tail, thigh, and knee pads===

Quilted hip pads date to the 1890s and are one of the earliest pieces of protective football gear known. Today, hip and tailbone pads are made of plastic and protect the hips, [[human pelvis|pelvis]], and [[coccyx]] or tailbone. The pads are inserted into the pockets of a girdle worn under the football pants. Thigh and knee pads are made of plastics and inserted into pockets constructed inside the football pants.

===Nose guard===
[[File:Nose_Armor.jpg|thumb|Nose armor.]]
In the days before helmets, players often wore nose guards or "nose masks" or "nose armor".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiquefootball.com/nosemask_history_4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Football was a brutal sport before the introduction of helmets and other protective gear. Serious injuries and even deaths were common occurrences in the game. Harvard's All-American center, [[John Cranston (American football)|John Cranston]], was the first player to wear equipment to protect his face during an [[American football]] game. In order to protect Cranston's "weak nose," Harvard captain and [[1889 College Football All-America Team|1889 All-American]] [[Arthur Cumnock]] invented a device that he called "nose armor."&lt;ref name=Armor&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Nose Armor|work=The Olean Democrat|date=1892-11-29}} ("It is said that Captain Cumnock, of Harvard, invented the nose armor so that Cranston, the great Harvard centre rush, who had a weak nose, could play with the crimson eleven.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Nose Armor|work=The Daily Review (Decatur, IL)|date=1892-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Nose Armor|work=The Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette|date=1892-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumnock's invention gained popularity, and in 1892, a newspaper article described the growing popularity of the device:&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the invention of nose armor football players who have been hitherto barred from the field because of broken or weak noses are now able to thrust an armor protected nose (even though it be broken) into the center of the roughest scrimmage without danger to the sensitive nasal organ. The armor is made of fine rubber and protects both the nose and teeth."&lt;ref name=Armor/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Percy Langdon Wendell]] later invented the most commonly used version of the nose mask.

===Gloves===

Many receivers wear gloves that have sticky rubber palms, called tact gloves. Spray on sticky substances (such as Stick 'em) have been illegal since the 1980s. Linemen also wear gloves, for using their hands to fight off opposing linemen. The gloves worn by linemen usually are lined with very thick padding to better protect fingers and hands, which sometimes are caught in an opponent's face mask or are stepped on. Players are not permitted to put gels or "stick 'ems" on their gloves.

==Equipment management==

The role of an equipment manager has become an important one for football teams. The equipment manager has two main areas of responsibility: first, fitting each player on the team with a customized array of equipment that will provide maximum protection against injury, and, secondly, being responsible for the logistics of handling many pieces of equipment on a daily basis—keeping it repaired and in stock, and moving the equipment for road games.

The '''Raymond Heard Stadium''' is a tennis stadium in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], [[Louisiana]]. It was constructed in 1976 and has been home to the ULM tennis team for over 30 years and opened its gates to a pair of fall tournaments in 2008 for the first time in over 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulmwarhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=19000&amp;ATCLID=205707806&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's courts have been home to nine women's conference championship teams and a pair of All-Americans.

In addition to serving as home for Warhawk champions, the stadium has hosted multiple conference championships. Beginning with the Trans America Athletic Conference Championship (now Atlantic Sun Conference) in 1980, the courts have hosted seven league championship events.  ULM has hosted two Atlantic Sun Championships (1980 - 1981) and four Southland Conference Championships (1982 - 1994 - 1996 - 1998) at Heard Stadium.

Most recently, ULM tennis became the first Warhawk program to host a Sun Belt Conference Championship after welcoming the league's men's and women's teams for the 2008 Championships. The championship event marked the first on-campus league championship tournament hosted by the Warhawks since joining the league as full members prior to Heard Stadium has also played host to a trio of National Invitational Tournaments (1982 - 1983 - 1984) and has been the host site of several United States Tennis Association tournaments.

The stadium recently underwent a face-lift to prepare it for the Sun Belt Conference Championship and now features 15 fully illuminated courts and elevated grandstand seating. The courts were resurfaced for the 2003 regular season and again prior to the 2008 campaign.

'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Lesotho]], and its predecessor [[Basutoland]]''' is a minor but growing sport.

==Governing body==
The governing body is the Federation of Lesotho Rugby.

==History==

Rugby in Lesotho began after the year 2000 given the influx of students studying in South African schools where rugby union is a major sport. It was further intensified by the expatriate population who worked with local people to develop rugby. In 2008, National University of Lesotho organized a team known as NUL Spears Rugby Club. The club only participated in Intervarsity held between universities of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.

Rugby is centred on the national capital, and only sizable city, [[Maseru]]. Lesotho's poverty and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to maintain a proper national league structure.

The country is surrounded on all sides by [[South Africa]]. [[Rugby union in South Africa]] is a major sport - the country has both hosted and won the [[Rugby World Cup]] - and Lesotho is saturated by South African media of various types. Lesotho can therefore be considered one of several countries within South African rugby's sphere of influence - including Namibia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Botswana.

==Maseru Kings==
In late 2011 the [[Maseru Kings|Maseru Kings Rugby Club]] was established in the capital. The team joined and began competing in the Eastern Free State leagues in South Africa in May 2012. As the only team regularly playing in Lesotho the Maseru Kings have become the de facto national team.

'''Rugby union in Moldova''' is a popular sport.
The governing body in Moldova is the [[Moldovan Rugby Federation]] (''Federatia de Rugby din Moldovei'').

==History==
{{See also|Rugby union in the Soviet Union}}

===Soviet Period===
Rugby union was played in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] as early as in 1908. In 1934, the Moscow Championship was started, and in 1936, the first [[Soviet Championship (rugby union)|Soviet Championship]] took place.

In 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the "fight against the [[cosmopolitanism]]". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975, the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet national team]] played their first match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianrugby.ru/history.php?Id=RUS Rugby union in Russia and USSR] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby union appears to have been introduced to the [[Moldavian SSR]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rugby.md/&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova had its own rugby team in the USSR, but it was not treated as a proper national side.

===Post-independence===
Perhaps surprisingly, the popularity of rugby in [[Moldova]] is growing rapidly, with well over 10,000 fans regularly turning up to their home matches in the [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]]. Since 2004, the number of Moldovan rugby players has more than doubled, due to the national team's growing international reputation. [[Rugby union in Romania]] is quite a major sport, going back ninety years, and as Moldova shares a language, and a border with [[Romania]], this has helped its popularity there.

==National team==
The [[Moldova national rugby union team]] represents [[Moldova]] in international [[rugby union]] matches. They have yet to qualify for the [[Rugby World Cup]].

==Sevens==
According to the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] website, Moldova will play in their first-ever [[IRB Sevens World Series]] event when the season reaches its climax in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/edition=10/news/newsid=2022666.html#moldova+take+scotland International Rugby Board - NEWS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rugby==
Although Moldova's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing [[Women's International Rugby Union Sevens|international sevens rugby]] since 2007. [[Women's international rugby union results summary#Sevens|(Current playing record)]].

It was the first race to feature a keel-less [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel-built]] boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wKXHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34&amp;lpg=PT34&amp;dq=carvel-built+keelless+boat | title = Pleasure Boating on the Thames: A History of Salter Bros 1858&amp;ndash;2010| first= Simon | last = Wenham| page = | isbn=  978-0750958332| date = 5 May 2014| publisher = The History Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Purchased personally by Oxford boat club president [[Arthur Heywood-Lonsdale]] from Newcastle boat builder Matthew Taylor, the Oxford crew rowed a practice time of 19 minutes 50 seconds in it, considered "remarkable" in a boat with fixed seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ee8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 | title = Rowing in England: A Social History : the Amateur Debate| first =Eric | last = Halladay | page =202 | isbn= 978-0719026058 | date = 18 October 1990| publisher= Manchester University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lonsdale engaged Taylor to instruct Oxford how to "send his boat along as quickly as possible", avoiding connotations of professional coaching which was banned in the Boat Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut4lAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38| page = 38 | first = Christopher | last = Dodd | title = Bonnie Brave Boat Rowers: The Heroes, Seers and Songsters of the Tyne| date = 19 March 2014 | isbn = 978-1491895528| publisher = AuthorHouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cambridge rowed in a boat built by Salter of Wandsworth.&lt;ref name=drink43/&gt;  It was also the first race in which both crews rowed with round loom oars.&lt;ref name=mac233&gt;MacMichael, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford "soon showed signs of good pace" in practice and set the course record with 19 minutes 50 seconds, a time which would remain unbeaten until the [[The Boat Race 1873|1873 race]].  Cambridge began their practice rows "very late".&lt;ref name=drink43&gt;Drinkwater, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  The race was umpired by [[Joseph William Chitty]] who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in the [[The Boat Race 1849 (March)|March]] and [[The Boat Race 1849 (December)|December races]]) and the [[The Boat Race 1852|1852 race]].&lt;ref name=drink54&gt;Drinkwater, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crews==
Oxford saw four crew members return from the 1856 race in Gurdon, Lonsdale, Thorley and the [[Coxswain|cox]], Elers, while Cambridge welcomed back just two former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] in Lloyd and Snow.  Oxford were marginally the heavier crew at an average of just over 11&amp;nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 9&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (73.8&amp;nbsp;kg) per rower, about {{convert|1|lb|kg|1}} more on average than Cambridge.&lt;ref name=mac233234/&gt;  The Oxford president, Heywood-Lonsdale, rowed at number seven while his counterpart, R.

{{Cricket deliveries}}
In the sport of [[cricket]] there are two broad categories of [[bowler (cricket)|bowlers]]: pace and spin. Pace bowlers rely mostly on the speed of the ball to [[dismissal (cricket)|dismiss]] batsmen, whereas spin bowlers rely on the rotation of the ball.

==Pace bowlers==
{{Main|Fast bowling}}
'''Pace bowlers''', or ''fast bowlers'' or ''pacemen'', rely on speed to get a [[batsman]] [[dismissal (cricket)|out]]. This type of bowler can be further classified according to the speed at which they bowl the ball on average.

Most pace bowlers are medium-fast to fast in top level cricket. In general, bowlers of this type are described as [[Right-arm|right arm]] or [[Left-arm|left arm]] "fast" or "fast-medium".  Another technique of fast bowling is the sling action. This action generates extra speed but sacrifices control. Exponents include [[Shaun Tait]], [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], [[Fidel Edwards]] and [[Lasith Malinga]].

The highest electronically measured speed for a ball bowled by any bowler is 161.3&amp;nbsp;km/h (100.23&amp;nbsp;mph) by [[Shoaib Akhtar]] (Pakistan) against England on 22 February 2003 in a World Cup match at Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa.

===Swing bowlers===
{{Main|Swing bowling}}
'''Swing bowlers''' are pace bowlers who, apart from being fast, also use the seam of the [[cricket ball|ball]] to make it travel in a curved path through the air.  This is further encouraged by systematically polishing one side of the ball while allowing the other side to become roughened and worn.  The differing airflow around the two sides will cause the ball to swing in the air, towards the roughened side.  By changing the orientation of the ball in his hand, a bowler may therefore cause the ball to swing into or away from the batsman.  In addition to a well-polished ball, other factors help the ball to swing, notably damp or humid weather conditions.  However balls which have been in play for some time do not tend to swing so much due to the deterioration of the seam.  In addition, bowlers of express pace do not tend to get as much swing as the fast-medium-to-medium pace bowlers.

Though younger pace bowlers tend to rely exclusively on speed, as bowlers age they tend to develop this more sophisticated art of swing bowling. Swing bowlers are more effective than sheer pace bowlers as the swing can confuse a batsman. [[Wasim Akram]] and Waqar Younis of Pakistan, James Anderson of England and Dale Steyn of South Africa are masters of this skill, and are capable of causing an older, misshapen ball to swing the opposite way from normal, i.e. toward the shiny side.  This is known as '''reverse swing''' and has become an increasingly important skill in the last 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;years.
Sri Lankan [[Lasith Malinga]] and England's [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]], Indians [[Zaheer Khan]] and [[Irfan Pathan]] are recently active prominent bowlers known for the use of reverse swing.

'''Slow Bowlers'''
These type of bowlers, have bowling action of a seam bowler, but bowl at a speed of 90-110&amp;nbsp;km/hr. They may use leg cutter and off cutter but mainly rely on variations and deception. [[Rajat Bhatia]] is one such example.

===Other tactics===
Pace bowlers frequently dismiss batsmen through variation and deception.  A batter who has been "softened up" by a series of ''[[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]]'', which pitch nearer the bowler than normal and reach the batsman around head height, or even hit the batsman, may tend to play the next ball on the back foot, and thus be susceptible to a full length ''[[yorker]]'' delivery that bounces at his toes.  Many bowlers also develop a "[[slower ball]]"; these are bowled with the same arm action as their normal delivery, but come slower from the hand, usually due the bowler gripping the ball differently or cocking his wrist at the last moment.  With luck, the batsman will misread the pace, and will have finished his shot before the ball arrives.  Other common variations include the ''[[leg cutter]]'' and ''[[off cutter]]'', medium pace deliveries bowled with a spinner's wrist action, which can sometimes "turn" just like deliveries from a spinner.

==Spin bowlers==
{{Main|Spin bowling}}
'''Spin bowlers''' or ''spinners'' impart rotation to the ball to get a batsman out. The spin on the ball makes its movement hard to predict, particularly when it bounces, hence spin bowlers try to deceive batsmen into making a mistake. Speed is not crucial in spin bowling, and spinners tend to bowl in the slow-medium to medium-slow range, around 45-55&amp;nbsp;mph. There are two broad categories of spin bowling: wrist spin and finger spin.

===Wrist spin===
{{Main|Wrist spin}}
Wrist spinners are bowlers who use their wrists to spin the ball. A right-handed wrist spinner is known as a leg spinner and his or her mode of bowling is known as '''[[leg break]]'''. A leg break will move from right to left from the bowler's point of view, or from the leg-side to the off-side for a right-handed batsman. Wrist spinners [[Shane Warne]] of Australia, [[Abdul Qadir (cricketer)|Abdul Qadir]] and [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]] of Pakistan and [[Anil Kumble]] of India rank amongst the most successful bowlers in [[Test cricket]] history.

Left-handed wrist spinners, who are much rarer than right-handed wrist-spinners, are called '''[[Left-arm unorthodox spin|chinaman]]''' bowlers, after an early left-arm finger spinner of Chinese descent, [[Ellis Achong]], who sometimes bowled wrist spinners as a variation while playing for the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. A ball delivered in this way will spin from the off-side to the leg-side for a right-handed batsman. [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]] of South Africa is the best-known recent chinaman bowler. Australian one-day all-rounder [[Brad Hogg]] is another current exponent of left-arm wrist-spin, as is his teammate, batsman [[Simon Katich]]. [[Beau Casson]], another Australian is another fine left arm chinaman bowler.

===Finger spin===
{{Main|Finger spin}}
'''Finger spinners''' make use of their fingers to rotate the ball. A [[right-arm]] finger spinner is known as an [[off-spinner]] and their mode of bowling is known as '''[[off break]]'''. The ball will appear to move just as the chinaman does, from off to leg for a right-handed batsman. [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] (often called "Murali") of Sri Lanka and [[Graeme Swann]] of England, two of the most successful bowlers in Test and ODI cricket history, are off-spinners. Murali's bowling style is unique, while Swann's is more conventional. Indian [[Harbhajan Singh]] and [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] and Pakistanis [[Saqlain Mushtaq]] and [[Saeed Ajmal]] are amongst contemporary bowlers of this type, who also employ this bowling style. Saqlain Mushtaq invented a new delivery with this style of bowling called "[[Doosra]]", this delivery is bowled with almost same action as off break however it spins like a leg break or goes straight on with the angle of the delivery. This delivery has become one of the most effective deliveries in an off spin bowler's variety of deliveries. This delivery has been employed by other famous bowlers after Saqlain Mushtaq, such as Murali and Saeed Ajmal. Another type of delivery, the [[carrom ball]], was invented in the 1940s but largely vanished by the 1970s before being revived in the early 21st century by Sri Lanka's [[Ajantha Mendis]]; Ashwin also uses this delivery as a second style.

Almost all left-handed bowlers are finger spinners. As a result, this style has no fixed name and the bowling mode is simply known as '''[[left-arm orthodox spin|(slow) left-arm orthodox]]'''. The ball turns like a leg break, from leg to off. [[Shakib Al Hasan]] of Bangladesh and New Zealand's [[Daniel Vettori]] employ this bowling style.

==Others==
A bowler equally skilled in both types of bowling is known as a ''mixed bag'' or an ''all round bowler''. Such bowlers are rare. The great West Indian all rounder Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] bowled effectively in the left-arm fast-medium, left-arm orthodox, and chinaman styles.

There are some bowlers who are just regarded as ''slow'', bowlers who bowl at the speed of spinners without turning the ball. Such bowlers need to be accurate in their line and length and have very good variation with the speed of the ball if they are to have any success. However, this type of bowler is now diminishing in the modern game because of their lack of pace and movement with the ball.

==Abbreviations==
Bowling styles are often abbreviated in scorecards (and in player profiles on Wikipedia) as follows :
