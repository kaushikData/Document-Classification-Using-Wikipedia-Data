==Plot==
John Emmett, an American everyman{{Clarification|What is this phrase|date=February 2018}}, is on a fishing and hunting trip when his car breaks down. He is offered a ride by a stranger, Ann Nicholson, who is driving to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and asks him to take turns behind the wheel.

During a stopover a woman identifying herself as a nurse takes John aside in a diner and says she has been following them because Ann is an escaped mental patient of a Dr. Frederick Simmons. And although he is not sure what to believe, John begins to doubt Ann when two policemen attempt to arrest them, claiming to be investigating a murder in Los Angeles.

John and Ann slip away. He demands the truth, whereupon Ann says she is an ex-German citizen who stumbled upon a government plot and is in possession of valuable scientific transcripts embedded on a small cosmetic mirror. In order to prevent Simmons from having Ann committed to a mental institution against her will, John asks Ann to marry him, while also declaring his love for her. They wed in a small town and then continue their journey to find the scientist who wrote the transcripts. The chase ends in a confrontation between Simmons, who is actually a Soviet spy, and his accomplices versus FBI and CIA agents, who verify Ann's story. Ann and John enjoy their honeymoon on the fishing trip John had originally planned.

==Cast==
* [[Ruth Roman]] as Ann Nicholson
* [[Sterling Hayden]] as John Emmett
* [[Werner Klemperer]] as Dr. Simmons
* [[Richard Gaines]] as Dean Brant
* [[Charles Davis (actor)|Charles Davis]] as Kirk
* [[Jeanne Cooper]] as Helen Bethke
* [[Peter Hansen (actor)|Peter Hansen]] as Karl Plesser

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film was "a rather lax and familiar melodrama about Communist espionage in this country, offers two real jolts. The climax, and this may be an unfair revelation, has a known subversive given some leeway inside a vital guided missile plant. Secondly, the place seems about as inaccessible as a drive-in restaurant. [...] The responsibility, or irresponsibility, must be shouldered by Henry S. Kesler, who handled the screenwriting, the directing and producing, and none of it very well."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Release===
''5 Steps to Danger'' was released in theatres on January 30, 1957.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

'''Avala Film''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Aвала филм}}) is a [[Serbia]]n film studio, founded in 1946 as the first studio founded in post-war [[Socialist Federal Republic Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. It is currently declared [[bankrupt]].

==Overview==
In June 1946, the government of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] created the State Committee of Cinematography, in order to replace the provisional Film Enterprise of the SFRY. The Committee set out to establish film production companies in the various constituent states of Yugoslavia: the first and the largest of those was Avala Film, in the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]'s capital [[Belgrade]], which was founded on 15 July. The company was located in the future complex of [[Filmski Grad]], which the Committee had only begun planning.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Goulding. ''Liberated Cinema: The Yugoslav Experience, 1945-2001.'' [[Indiana University Press]] (2002). {{ISBN|978-0253215826}}. pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Avala Film produced the first feature film made in postwar Yugoslavia, [[Vjekoslav Afrić]]'s ''[[:sr:Славица (филм)|Slavica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miera Liehm, Antonin J. Liehm. ''The Most Important Art: Soviet and Eastern European Film After 1945''. [[University of California Press]] (1977). {{ISBN|0-520-04128-3}}. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2000, the studio participated in the creation of 400 documentaries, 200 feature films and 120 co-productions with foreign companies; its pictures won more than 200 awards in various festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filminserbia.com/Stages/Studios/Avala_Film_Studios/116/Default.aspx Avala Film on the Serbian Film Commission's website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081322/http://www.filminserbia.com/Stages/Studios/Avala_Film_Studios/116/Default.aspx |date=June 29, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pravda.rs/2011/02/16/avala-film-pred-stecajem/ Avala Film Facing Bankruptcy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825102153/http://www.pravda.rs/2011/02/16/avala-film-pred-stecajem/ |date=August 25, 2011 }}''. ''Pravda Belgrade'', 16 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]], the studio was partially privatized and 51% of its shares were sold to a company called Yugoexport, while the rest were retained by Avala Film's management.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/kultura.71.html:269521-Holivud-na-srpski-nacin Hollywood, the Serbian Way]''. novosti.rs, 1 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990, it has produced few films, and its last one - ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192346/ Shadows of Memories]'' - was released in 2000. The studio is facing financial troubles, and was threatened with liquidation after Yugoexport was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref name = "A"/&gt; Since 2005, plans to fully privatize it were proposed, but not carried out.&lt;ref name = "A"&gt;''[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/kultura.71.html:323009-Avala-filmu-preti-stecaj Avala Film Threatened by Going Bankrupt]''. novosti.sr., 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the studio was announced to be bankrupt, after accumulating a debt of 111,000,000 [[Serbian dinar]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20120910160607/http://www.pravda.rs/2011/07/06/dug-manji-od-vrednosti/ Avala's Assets exceed its Debt.]'' Pravda Belgrade, 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, the Serbian government announced plans to revitalize Avala Film.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vaseljenska.com/ekonomija/vlada-srbije-spasava-avala-film/ Government will Aid Avala Film.]'' bts.sr., 9 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but assistance never materialized.  The company's real estate, film rights, costumes, props and studios were scheduled to be sold-off in spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/serbia-avala-film-idINDEE92608M20130307/ Tito's pet film studio at risk of Yugoslav fate]" Reuters, by Matt Robinson,  7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B.C.''''' is a daily American [[comic strip]] created by [[cartoonist]] [[Johnny Hart]]. Set in [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, it features a group of [[caveman|cavemen]] and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals from various [[geologic era]]s.

''B.C.'' made its newspaper debut on February 17, 1958, and was among the longest-running strips still written and drawn by its original creator when Hart died at his drawing board in [[Nineveh, New York]], on April 7, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pressconnects/obituary.aspx?n=johnny-hart&amp;pid=87203606 Binghamton Press April 7, 2007]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.creators.com/news/10.html Fellow cartoonists pay tribute to Johnny Hart-Creators Syndicate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415125706/http://www.creators.com/news/10.html |date=2007-04-15 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Now produced by [[Mason Mastroianni]], ''B.C.'' is [[comic strip syndication|syndicated]] by [[Creators Syndicate]].

== Publication history ==
''B.C.'' was initially rejected by a number of syndicates until the [[New York Herald Tribune Syndicate]] accepted it, launching the strip on February 17, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, R.C. [http://www.tcj.com/johnny-hart-to-appear-b-c/ "Hare Tonic: Johnny Hart to Appear B.C.,"] ''The Comics Journal'' (March 22, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was assisted with ''B.C.'' by gag writers Jack Caprio and Dick Boland (who later joined Hart and cartoonist [[Brant Parker]] on ''[[The Wizard of Id]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundymuseum.org/site3/johnny-hart-exhibit-before-bc-collection-of-pre-bc-illustrations-comic-strips-photographs-and-artwork/ "Johnny Hart Exhibit 'Before BC' — Collection of Pre-BC illustrations, comic strips, photographs and artwork,"] Bundry Museum website. Accessed Dec. 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Herald Tribune syndicate folded in 1966, ''B.C.'' was taken over by the [[Publishers Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = Herald Tribune Is Closing Its News Service; But Meyer Says Columns That Appeared in Paper Will Be in Merged Publication| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-07-12| date = 1966-06-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1966/06/24/archives/herald-tribune-is-closing-its-news-service-but-meyer-says-columns.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; That syndicate changed hands and names frequently — [[Publishers-Hall Syndicate]], the [[Field Newspaper Syndicate]], [[News America Syndicate]], and finally [[North America Syndicate]] — eventually becoming part of [[King Features]].&lt;ref name=Storch&gt;Storch, Charles.

After Hart's death in 2007, the strip began being [[zombie strip|produced by Hart's grandsons]] [[Mason Mastroianni]] (head writer and cartoonist) and [[Mick Mastroianni]] (writer for both ''B.C.'' and Hart's other creation, ''[[The Wizard of Id]]''), and Hart's daughter Perri (letterer and colorist). (The Mastroianni Brothers also created an original strip, ''The Dogs of C Kennel'', in 2009.)

==Cast of characters==
For a visual glossary, see [http://johnhartstudios.com/meet-the-actors/ Meet The Actors] at John Hart Studios.

===Character inspiration===
Hart was inspired to draw cavemen (and many other creatures) through the chance suggestion of one of his coworkers at [[General Electric]], and took to the idea "because they are a combination of simplicity and the origin of ideas." The name for the strip "may have been suggested by my wife, Bobby," Johnny recalls.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cartoonician.com/the-johnny-hart-interview/ The Johnny Hart Interview]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart describes the title character as similar to himself, playing the "patsy."  The other major characters — Peter, Wiley, Clumsy Carp, Curls, and Thor — were patterned after friends and co-workers. The animal characters include [[dinosaur]]s, [[ant]]s and an [[anteater]], [[clam]]s, a [[snake]], a [[turtle]] and [[bird]] duo, and an [[apteryx]] (presented in the strip as being the sole surviving specimen, and hence self-aware of its being doomed to [[extinction]]).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:B.C. character Clumsy Carp.png|frame|Clumsy Carp.]] --&gt;

===Human characters===
* '''B.C.''': An orange haired, humble, naïve slob and eternal patsy. B.C. occasionally makes nighttime rounds as his alter-ego, "The Midnight Skulker."
* '''Peter''': A yellow haired, self-styled genius and the world's first philosophical failure, founder of the "Prehistoric Pessimists Society" and the "Truth Pedestal," and the discoverer of oil. Peter is patterned after Hart's friend, Peter Reuter; the two had been co-workers at General Electric.
* '''Thor''': a self-proclaimed ladies' man; inventor of the wheel and the comb. Thor was patterned after another of Hart's friends from GE, Thornton Kinney.
* '''The Fat Broad''': a bossy cavewoman who enjoys clobbering snakes. A reluctant arbiter of congeniality with an unswerving devotion to the domination of men.
* '''The Cute Chick''': a sex object in a world that had not yet discovered objectivity.
* '''Wiley''': a peg-legged, superstitious, unshaven, woman-fearing, water-hating poet and coach of the local [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] teams, not to mention the first bartender. Wiley was patterned after Hart's brother-in-law, Wiley Baxter, who lost his leg in [[World War II]].
* '''Clumsy Carp''': a nerdy, bespectacled [[ichthyologist]] and perpetual klutz, clumsy enough to trip over a shadow, yet with some unusual skills, such as his ability to make and stack "water balls" (similar to snowballs). Clumsy Carp was patterned after Hart's childhood friend, Jack Caprio.
* '''Curls''': a master of sarcastic wit. Curls was patterned after Hart's friend from high school, Richard (Curly) Boland.
* '''Grog''': pure [[Id, ego and superego|Id]], a caveman's caveman; a primitive, semi-evolved wild man with a one-word vocabulary and enough strength to knock the sun out of the sky using a golf ball.
*'''The Guru''': an unnamed, bearded wise man living like a hermit atop a mountain, whence he dispenses wisdom and sarcasm.

===Animals and other non-human characters===
* '''John the Turtle and the Dookie Bird''': this prehistoric odd couple are inseparable friends, especially when making their annual trek south for the winter. The Dookie Bird rides on John's back when they travel.
* '''The Snake''': the put-upon, mortal enemy of the Fat Broad (and her club).
* '''The Eatanter''': eats ants with a sticky, elastic tongue and a ''ZOT!'' sound.  Hart actually drew something of a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]—with the long ears of an [[aardvark]] and the bushy tail of a [[giant anteater]]. (This character was the inspiration for Peter the [[Anteater]], the [[University of California, Irvine]] [[UC Irvine Anteaters|team]] mascot. Also served as the inspiration for the mascot of the now disbanded US Navy fighter squadron VF-114 the "Aardvarks".)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=students&amp;function=anteater The Anteater Mascot, UCI Library]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Maude''': an [[ant]], a nagging wife with a smart-alec son ('''Johnny''') and a quarrelsome, straying husband.
* '''Jake''': ant husband of Maude, who is always threatening to run off with '''Shirley'''.
* '''Queen Ida''': the queen ant, an unfeeling and abusive dictator. (Queen Ida is based on Hart's wife Bobby, whose given name is Ida.  She's featured every year on her birthday, December 3.)
* '''The Dinosaur''': big but not too bright—a sort of [[sauropod]] with spinal plates like a [[stegosaurus]].  Sometimes called '''Gronk''', which is the only sound he makes (although he can talk fluently in recent strips).
* '''The Clams''': talking [[clam]]s with legs, among other appendages. (Clams are also the preferred unit of currency in ''B.C.'')
* '''The Apteryx''' ([[kiwi]]): a "wingless bird with hairy feathers," as he invariably introduces himself.
* '''The Turkey''': makes his yearly appearance at [[Thanksgiving]] time, eluding the mighty hunters.
* '''Oynque''': the turkey's porcine partner in crime, rarely seen without his trademark mud puddle.
* '''Wolf''': the newest ''B.C.'' character, debuted August 24, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.johnhartstudios.com/bc/2009/08/monday-august-24-2009.php John Hart Studios.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005113820/http://www.johnhartstudios.com/bc/2009/08/monday-august-24-2009.php |date=2011-10-05 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; A blissfully deviant domestication of [[Precambrian]] fur. Man's first friend.
* '''Various incidental ants''', including a schoolteacher and her students.
* '''Raptors''': [[velociraptors]] that try to eat the other characters.

There are also several odd inanimate characters, including a talking '''Daisy''' and his/her friend, a talking '''Rock'''.

===Seldom-used or one-shot human characters===
Although the strip seldom expands its human cast outside of the established group of characters, there are a few exceptions. It can be assumed that there are other groups or tribes of humans for Wiley's sports teams to compete against, for example, but these are never actually seen. There have been a few exceptions to this, however, with a few additional human characters seen from time to time, even if only once.

* '''Anno Domini, or A.D.''', introduced during a weeks-long journey by Peter to discover the new world, which he successfully accomplished. His name is arguably a riff on B.C.'s name. He dresses as a caveman very much like the rest of the characters, but has a thick mustache and a stereotypical Italian accent, assuming a bit of a take on Christopher Columbus. He befriends Peter in the "new world."
* '''Conahonty''', a Native American Indian, who also appears in the "new world" storyline, and befriends Peter. He is a friend of A.D.'s, and speaks rather stereotypical broken English. He dresses more like a somewhat stereotyped Indian than a caveman, and at one point even specifically states that he is an American Indian. He and A.D. were not frequently seen after Peter returned from his epic journey. The two are the most oft-appearing non-regular human characters in the history of the strip other than the Guru, due to the strip's tight focus on its core cast of humans. His name is a spoof of the name [[Pocahontas]].
* '''Peter's Pen Pal''', An unseen person whom Peter corresponds with by tossing letters written on wooden slabs into the ocean and receiving answers at a later time.

==Setting==
The characters live, for the most part, in caves, in what appears to be a barren, mountainous desert by an unidentified sea.  Background detail is often limited to a simple horizon line broken up by the occasional silhouettes of a stray volcano or cloud. "Retail stores", "shop counters", and "businesses" are symbolized by a single boulder, labeled (for instance): "Wheel Repair", "Advice Column", "Psychiatrist", etc. The February 5, 2012, strip gives a nearby location of N 53° 24' 17" W 6° 12' 3", which is in present-day [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].

Originally, the strip was set firmly in prehistoric times, with the characters clearly living in an era untouched by modernity. Typical plotlines, for example, include B.C.'s friend, Thor (inventor of the wheel and the comb), trying to discover a use for the wheel. Thor was also seen making calendars out of stone every December. Other characters attempt to harness fire or to discover an unexplored territory, like Peter trying to find the "new world" by crossing the ocean on a raft. Animals, like the dinosaur, think such thoughts as, "There's one consolation to becoming extinct—I'll go down in history as the first one to go down in history."  Grog arrived in early 1966,&lt;ref&gt;''Take a Bow, B.C.'' published in 1970, containing cartoons from 1965 and 1966&lt;/ref&gt; emerging from a miniature glacier which melted to reveal what Wiley called "Prehistoric man!"

''B.C.'', like Hart's ''Wizard of Id'', is a period [[Burlesque#Etymology and early history|burlesque]] with a deliberately broad, unliteral time frame. As time went on the strip began to mine humor from having the characters make explicit references to modern-day [[news|current event]]s, [[invention]]s, and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Increasingly familiar visual devices, like the makeshift "telephone" built into a tree trunk, also started to blur the comic's supposed prehistoric setting and make it rife with intentional [[anachronism]]s.  One of the comic's early out-of-context jokes, from June 22, 1967, was this one:
:'''Peter:''' "I used to think sun revolved around the earth."
:'''B.C.:''' "What ''does'' it revolve around?"
:'''Peter:''' "The United States!"

Another early example: Near [[Christmas]] time, the apteryx, dressed as [[Santa Claus]], modified his usual spiel: "Hi there, I'm an Apterclaus, a wingless toymonger with batteries not included!" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist and comics critic [[Gene Weingarten]] suggested&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15062-2004Jun29.html Chatological Humor]'', The Washington Post, July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; that ''B.C.'' is actually set not in the past but in a dystopic, post-apocalyptic future.

==Format and style==
''B.C.'' follows a gag-a-day format, featuring (mostly) unrelated jokes from day to day, plus a color Sunday page. Occasionally it will run an extended sequence on a given theme over a week or two. It also follows the convention of Sunday strips with a short, setup/payoff joke in the first two panels, followed by an extended gag. The principal cast is small and varied, with each character imbued with a developed personality.  "The art style, like that of [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', masks sophisticated minimalism with a casually scratchy veneer," according to comics historian [[Don Markstein]].&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/bc.htm ''B.C.''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6b6ZNafqT?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftoonopedia.com%2Fbc.htm Archived] from the original on August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry humor, prose, [[verse (poetry)|verse]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], shameless [[pun]]s and wordplay, and [[comedic device]]s such as ''Wiley's Dictionary'' (where common words are defined humorously with a twist, see [[Daffynition]]) make for some of the mix of material in ''B.C.'' Example: "Rock ''(verb)'': To cause something or someone to swing or sway, principally by hitting them with it!"&amp;mdash;from an early 1967 strip.  Or: "Cantaloupe ''(noun)'': What the father of the bride asks after seeing the wedding estimate!"

There are [[running gags]] relating to the main cast and to a variety of secondary, continuing characters.  One such periodic recurring gag has Peter communicating with an unseen pen-pal on the other side of the ocean, writing a message on a slab of rock that he floats off into the horizon.  It is invariably returned the same way, with a sarcastic reply written on the reverse side.  These segments use silent or "pantomime" panels (indicating that time has elapsed; night falls and dawn rises) between the set-up and the delayed punch line&amp;mdash;typical of Hart's idiosyncratic use of "timing" in ''B.C.''

== Religious aspect ==
Late in the run of the strip, and following a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, ''B.C.'' increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to [[Christianity]], anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years.  In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a "ministry" intended to mix religious themes with secular humor.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ptm.org/JulHartofBC.htm The Plain Truth – At the Hart of B.C.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619222856/http://www.ptm.org/JulHartofBC.htm |date=2004-06-19 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Though other strips such as ''[[The Family Circus]]'' and ''[[Peanuts]]'' have included Christian themes, ''B.C.'' strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. [[Easter]] strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and written and oral responses from [[Jew]]ish and [[Muslim]] groups.  The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of [[Jesus Christ]] and a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] transforming into a cross, "religiously offensive" and "shameful."&lt;ref&gt;''Easter Comic Strip Creates An Uproar'', [[Christian Century]], May 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 strip depicting a character using an [[outhouse]] with a [[crescent]] symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, "Is it just me, or does it stink in here?" was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-[[Islam]] message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying "This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam — subliminal or otherwise.... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people’s beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gene Weingarten| title=Cartoon Raises a Stink; Some See Slur Against Islam in a 'B.C.' Outhouse Strip| work=The Washington Post | pages=C1+ |date=November 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wondermark.com/the-comic-strip-doctor-bc/ Wondermark &amp;raquo; Archive &amp;raquo; The Comic Strip Doctor: B.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the [[religion]] pages, instead of the regular comics pages.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/7r2/7r2018.html Johnny Hart: Not Caving In]'', Today's Christian, March/April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of religious themed strips===
[[File:B.C. comic strip, Aug. 18, 06.gif|thumb|600px|left|''B.C.'' strip from August 18, 2006, illustrating Hart's sense of humor as well as incorporation of religious themes and anachronistic references.]]

{{Clear}}

== Other controversy ==
The ''B.C.'' daily strip from December 7, 2006 attracted criticism for defining ''infamy'' as "a word seldom used after Toyota sales topped 2 million." The day was the 65th anniversary of the Japanese military's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the punchline of the strip refers to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "[[Infamy Speech]]" which requested from Congress a [[declaration of war]] against Japan. The day's strip was pulled from at least one newspaper, the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''. The paper's managing editor said the comic was "a regressive and insensitive statement about one of the worst days in American history."

On July 21, 2009, the strip presented a gag that involved the supposed suggestion of animal abuse. John Hart Studios received many angry responses from readers and issued an apology on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhartstudios.com/news/2009/07/21/we_are_so_sorry/|title=We apologize.|publisher=John Hart Studios|date=July 2009|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''B.C.'' in other media ==
*The characters were featured in two [[animation|animated]] [[television specials]]. ''[[B.C.: The First Thanksgiving]]'', first aired on [[NBC]] in 1973, was directed by [[Abe Levitow]], and featured the voice talents of [[Daws Butler]] (as B.C. and Clumsy), [[Don Messick]] as Peter and Thor, [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]] as Wiley and Grog, and [[Joanie Sommers]] as Fat Broad and Cute Chick.
*''[[B.C.: A Special Christmas]]'' first aired on [[HBO]] in 1981, and starred the comedy team of [[Bob and Ray]] as the voices of Peter and Wiley, respectively.
*The characters appeared in animated commercials for the U.S. Federal agency ACTION in the 1970s and for Monroe shocks in the late 1980s.  They were also licensed by [[Arby's]] restaurants in 1981, which issued a collector set of 6 ''B.C.'' cartoon character drinking glasses. In the last half of the 1960s, the BC characters were used in commercials for Marathon gasoline.
*''B.C.'' was turned into two [[video game]]s for the [[ColecoVision]] home video game system, [[Atari 800]],  [[Commodore 64]] and the [[MSX]] home computers:  ''[[B.C.'s Quest For Tires|B.C.'s Quest for Tires]]'' and ''[[B.C. II: Grog's Revenge|B.C. 2: Grog's Revenge]]''.
*Parallax Media Ventures and John Hart Studios will produce an animated ''B.C.'' movie for a potential 2021 release. The production features "an experienced team of film veterans" from big companies including [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], [[Pixar]], [[Illumination Entertainment]], [[Nickelodeon]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/are-you-ready-for-the-feature-length-version-of-the-b-c-comic-strip-158432.html|title=Are You Ready For A Feature-Length Version Of The ‘B.C.’ Comic Strip?|website=Cartoon Brew|last=Amidi|first=Amid|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hometown ==
Influences from ''B.C.'' are found throughout Johnny Hart's home of [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A [[PGA Tour]] event, the [[B.C. Open]], took place every summer in [[Endicott, New York]] through 2005 (the final scheduled B.C. Open in 2006 was disrupted by [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flooding]], prompting a change of venue to the [[Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino]] in central New York state). Each year Johnny would bring in a group of cartoonists to play in the Pro-Am. [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], [[Mort Walker]], [[Paul Szep]], [[Dik Browne]], [[John Cullen Murphy]], [[Dean Young (cartoonist)|Dean Young]], [[Stan Drake]], [[Brant Parker]], [[Lynn Johnston]], and entertainer [[Tom Smothers]] would put on a free show for the community, drawing and signing autographs for golf and cartooning fans.

In the past, Hart has also left his mark on the logos of the [[Broome Dusters]] and [[B.C. Icemen]] hockey teams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3407">'''Big Apple Oriental Tours''' is a travel agency based in [[New York City]] that is at the center of a campaign against [[sex tourism]] operators in the [[United States]].

The company was founded in 1993 and offers all-inclusive trips to [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Cambodia]] "for the single male.” Their advertising brochures highlight the erotic atmosphere and easy availability of women in these regions. Tour guides would meet the men upon arrival, explain everything, and transport them to the local bars and brothels.

Since 1996, the New York based human rights and feminist group [[Equality Now]] has lobbied the local District Attorney to take action against the company, complaining about promotion of prostitution and possible exploitation of minors. The District Attorney declined to prosecute in 2000, stating that the alleged acts did not occur in New York and were thus beyond the reach of state law. Supported by [[Gloria Steinem]] and Congresswoman [[Carolyn B. Maloney]], Equality Now then contacted [[Attorney General|State Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] in 2002.

In response to lobbying by these groups, the first legal action in the U.S. against a business of this type was initiated: Spitzer filed a civil suit against Big Apple Oriental Tours and obtained a restraining order in July 2003, in effect preventing the company from advertising.

Spitzer then made two unsuccessful attempts to charge owners Norman Barabash and Douglas Allen with promoting prostitution. (New York state penal code 230.25(1) defines promotion of prostitution, in part, as running a business that involves prostitution activity by two or more prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Penal Law 3(a)(2) |url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/bclc/web/NewYork/ny3(a)(2).htm |accessdate=25 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622131856/http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/bclc/web/NewYork/ny3(a)(2).htm |archivedate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Attorney General's office obtained the first indictment of Barabash and Allen in February 2004. The case was dismissed in August 2004, because the [[grand jury]] had been presented with [[hearsay in United States law|hearsay]] evidence and because the judge did not find the law applicable. The dismissal was upheld on appeal based on the hearsay argument. The case was returned to the grand jury and Barabash and Allen were indicted for the same crime again in October 2005. These charges were dismissed in January, 2006. The court held that according to the evidence, "What the tour customer did when he arrived at the location is not part of the Big Apple Oriental Tours enterprise."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">A '''contributing editor''' is a [[newspaper]], [[magazine]] or [[online]] job title that varies in its responsibilities. Often, but not always, a contributing editor is a 'high-end'  [[freelancer]], [[consultant]] or expert who has proven ability and has readership draw.&lt;ref name="wordreference1"&gt;[https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/contributing-editor.2605653/]&lt;/ref&gt;  This contributing editor would regularly contribute articles to the publication but does not always edit articles. Here the title "editor" implies a certain level of prestige, rather than a more traditional editing role. In other instances, however, a contributing editor may oversee projects or specific aspects of a publication and have more regular editing duties. At smaller magazines, the title can imply a staff member with regular writing responsibility and some editorial duties.  When a "contributing editor" is listed on the title page of a [[book]], the term generally designates a person who has served as some kind of consultant in the book's preparation but who is not responsible for the book's final content.

'''''Daybreakers''''' is a 2009 Australian-American [[science fiction]] [[action film]] written and directed by [[The Spierig Brothers|Michael and Peter Spierig]]. The film takes place in a futuristic world overrun by [[vampire]]s. A vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm the remaining humans while researching a substitute for human blood. Lead vampire hematologist Edward Dalton's ([[Ethan Hawke]]) work is interrupted by human survivors led by former vampire "Elvis" ([[Willem Dafoe]]), who has a cure that can save the human species.

''Daybreakers'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2010 and in North America on 8 January 2010. The film grossed over US$50&amp;nbsp;million and received mixed to positive critical reception.

==Plot==
In 2019, a plague has transformed most of the world's population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into "subsiders," psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic [[Blood substitutes|blood substitute]].

Edward Dalton is the head [[Hematology|hematologist]] for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley. Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso are developing a blood substitute.

Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey, learns Edward's name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.

At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie ([[Michael Dorman]]). Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edward's sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edward's house, forcing the brothers to kill it.

The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel "Elvis" Cormac, a human who was once a vampire.  Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey.  Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash.  Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.

That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner, a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audrey's group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers  track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.

One of the captured convoy, Alison, is revealed to be Charles' human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alison's death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes [[martial law]] to control the subsider population and preserve order.

Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.

Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute.  Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.

Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders.  Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankie's blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only (what at first appears to be three) six soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered.  Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the six and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.

The three survivors drive off into the sunrise.  In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure, but may be too late as multiple subsiders appear before the screen turns black.

== Cast ==
{{Cast listing|
*[[Ethan Hawke]] as Edward Dalton. He is a 35-year-old vampire hematologist who was turned by his brother Frankie, and started working for the newly formed Bromley Marks to work on a blood substitute. He shows sympathy for the humans, since he refused to be turned at the start of the plague, and refuses to drink human blood, instead relying on animal blood. He volunteers for the project to be turned back into a human and leads a revolution to return the human race back.
*[[Willem Dafoe]] as Lionel "Elvis" Cormac. A former professional mechanic, he was one of the first in the city to adapt cars for daylight driving, with retractable [[Ultraviolet|UV]] screens and exterior cameras. One time, while driving during the daytime, he was exhausted from not drinking blood, which caused him to be distracted, and crash his black [[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevy Bel Air]] into a fence, ejecting him into the sunshine; Elvis was set in flames, but his life was saved when he fell into the water, turning him back human due to the precise exposure to the sun. He was found by Audrey.
*[[Sam Neill]] as Charles Bromley, ruthless owner of Bromley Marks, the largest provider of blood in the U.S.  In 2008, shortly before the plague, he was diagnosed with cancer and expected to live only a few years.  He became a vampire to save himself from cancer, at the cost of being rejected by his beloved daughter Alison.  He has no interest becoming human again, since he wants to use the substitute to become the richest man alive and for all eternity.
*[[Claudia Karvan]] as Audrey Bennett, who was educating at college during the plague. She hid on her family's old vineyard, and refusing to become a vampire, she gathered humans and sheltered them. She also found the already cured Elvis and sheltered him. They lead the group to try to find other survivors.
*[[Michael Dorman]] as Frankie Dalton, Edward's estranged younger brother, who turned his brother into a vampire since he was afraid of losing him. Frankie has an epiphany after turning back into a human and wants to help, but is later killed while trying to help his brother.
*[[Isabel Lucas]] as Alison Bromley, Charles' estranged daughter, forcibly turned into a vampire by Frankie. She rejected her father and turned into a subsider after drinking her own blood. Her death caused Frankie to have an epiphany and change sides.
*[[Vince Colosimo]] as Christopher Caruso, a hematologist, Edward's coworker at Bromley Marks, although much less ambitious than Edward. He succeeds in creating a blood substitute, which would make him wealthy and powerful in a world of vampires, and so is hostile to the possibility of a cure for vampirism.
*[[Jay Laga'aia]] as Senator Wes Turner, another vampire who secretly harbors sympathies with humans and wants to help the human race.

[[Weta Workshop]] created the creature effects for ''Daybreakers''.&lt;ref name="bites" /&gt; The Spierig brothers wanted the vampires in the film to have a classical aesthetic to them while feeling like a more contemporary interpretation. After experimenting with complex makeup designs, they decided that a more minimalistic approach to makeup had a more powerful effect.&lt;ref name="AICNfirstlook"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34516 | title=Quint has your first look at the Spierig Bros' new film, DAYBREAKERS, as well as a chat with the directors!!! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=22 October 2007 | accessdate=15 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke was initially hesitant to join the production as he was "not a big fan" of genre films. He ultimately accepted the role as Edward after deciding the story felt "different" from that of a typical [[B movie]].&lt;ref name="AICNfirstlook" /&gt; Hawke described the film as an allegory of man's pacing with natural resources, "We're eating our own resources so people are trying to come up with blood substitutes, trying to get us off of foreign humans."&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news | author=Shawn Adler | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/07/02/ethan-hawke-gets-ready-to-suck-as-vampire-researcher/ | title=Ethan Hawke Gets Ready To Suck As Vampire Researcher | publisher=MTV | date=2 July 2007 | accessdate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor also said that despite the serious allegory, the film was "low art" and "completely unpretentious and silly".&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

== Release ==
''Daybreakers'' premiered on 11 September 2009 at the [[34th Annual Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film was released on 6 January 2010 in the UK and Ireland, 8 January 2010 in North America, and 4 February 2010 in Australia.

=== Critical reception ===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 67% rating based on reviews from 145 critics, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus states: "Though it arrives during an unfortunate glut of vampire movies, ''Daybreakers'' offers enough dark sci-fi thrills — and enough of a unique twist on the genre — to satisfy filmgoers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/daybreakers/|title=Daybreakers (2010)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 31 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/daybreakers|title=Daybreakers Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review stating the film had a "cold, steely blue, black and gray '[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'-y look" going on to say ''Daybreakers'' "emerges as a competent but routine chase thriller that lacks attention-getting dialogue, unique characters or memorable setpieces that might make it a genre keeper rather than a polished time-filler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dennis |last=Harvey |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/daybreakers-1200475774/ |title=Daybreakers |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' gave the film two and a half out of four stars and called the film a [[B movie]] and a "nifty genre piece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/daybreakers-20100107|title=Daybreakers Review|date=7 January 2010|work=Rolling Stone|author=[[Peter Travers]]|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] also gave the film two and a half stars stating the "intriguing premise ... ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/daybreakers-2010|title=Daybreakers |date=6 January 2010 |work=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|authorlink=Roger Ebert|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a B+ and called it "a bloody good time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/daybreakers.aspx|title=Daybreakers Review|authorlink=Richard Roeper|last=Roeper|first=Richard|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Shirley''' (16 October 1948 – 16 April 2013), was a rock and roll tour organiser, film studio manager, and impresario. He co-founded Edwin Shirley Trucking (later abbreviated to EST) in 1974, which became one of the largest music transport companies in Europe. He went on to convert old bonded warehouses in the east end of London into the successful film and television recording studio, [[Three Mills|Three Mills Island Studios]]. In his later life he returned to the transport business, particularly for theatre companies and other parts of the entertainment industry.

==Early life==
Edwin Antoine Shirley was born in Cranbrook, Kent on 16 October 1948 to Herbert Shirley and Marie Gates. He was educated at [[Cranbrook School, Kent|Cranbrook School]], and then [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], where he took a BA in Modern Languages (specialising in French and German). He was involved in numerous undergraduate stage productions as an actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plsn.com/news/21-news/10961-in-memoriam-edwin-shirley-1948-2013.html|title=Story of death}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted in a number of plays with the [[National Youth Theatre]].

==Edwin Shirley Trucking==
Shirley's language skills and knowledge of theatre lighting and sound led him into jobs on tour with [[the Rolling Stones]] and other prominent bands of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22352718|title=Obituary on BBC News website | date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working on numerous Rock and Roll tours, he established Edwin Shirley Trucking with Roy Lamb. The company was run from his family farm in Kent, and later expanded into premises in East London. 

Edwin Shirley Trucking became indelibly associated with live music tours. In an obituary on Planet Rock Radio, Bernard Doherty referred to the apocryphal notion that "You haven't really made it until Edwin Shirley is moving your gear around". [[Brian May]] of Queen, noted Shirley's importance to their touring operation: "Edwin was at the head of Queen's vehicle convoy for so many years I can't begin to remember how many... He was a great pal of Gerry Stickells, our illustrious Tour Manager
and the two of them wrote the book on how to party on tour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbapr13.html#20|title=Brian May's tribute to Edwin Shirley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Shirley Staging===
Having built a successful trucking company, Shirley started a new company Edwin Shirley Staging which built stages for a number of large concerts including Live Aid in 1985. Shirley left both companies in the 1990s.

==Three Mills Island Studios==
While looking for rehearsal space in East London, Shirley viewed [[Three Mills|Three Mills Island]], and realised the potential to develop a film studio there. After meeting with [[Peter Bazalgette]], Shirley secured the site as the location for the first ''[[Big_Brother_(TV_series)|Big Brother]]'' reality TV programme, which went on to become a major domestic television series. The studio proved a success, but a dispute with the landlord led to the site being taken over by another company. As of 2013, the studio is still operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3mills.com/|title=Three Mills Studio today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Having suffered from [[bowel cancer]] since 2009, Shirley had undergone effective surgery and carried on working for four years. On 14 April 2013 Shirley was hospitalised due to a massive bleed, and after two days in Homerton Hospital, Hackney, died on 16 April 2013.

'''Elephant hunting''' or '''elephant [[poaching]]''' and exploitation of the [[ivory trade]] are illegal in [[Chad]] and pose a major threat to elephant populations. The profitable [[ivory]] industry is also a threat to the lives of rangers, even in the national parks, such as [[Zakouma National Park]], the worst-affected area.

==History==
Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|title=African Elephants Slaughtered in Herds Near Chad Wildlife Park|first=Brian|last=Handwerk|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=17 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017173341/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/central-africas-wildlife-rangers-face-deadly-risks.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382003098-yauBx4MSdHcb4DxeUgSrUw|title=Rangers in Isolated Central Africa Uncover Grim Cost of Protecting Wildlife|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, since the mid-1980s the elephant population has declined from 150,000 to a reported figure of just 2,000 in the Chad-[[Cameroon]] region by one source&lt;Ref name=Guard&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/19/86-elephants-chad-poaching-massacre|title= 86 elephants killed in Chad poaching massacre|first=Celeste|last=Hicks|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 in Chad alone in 2013 according to another source&lt;ref name = IvoryCurse&gt;Vera, Varun and Ewing, Thomas (April 2014) [http://www.bornfreeusa.org/downloads/pdf/Ivorys-Curse-2014.pdf Ivory's Curse] Born Free USA and C4ADS, Retrieved 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; because of intense poaching. American journalist [[Lisa Ling]] has visited Chad to explore the country's elephant poaching problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |title=Renowned journalist Lisa Ling speaking @ UMSL |first=Shannon |last=Howard |date=3 March 2012 |publisher=NOCO ~ The online magazine of North St. Louis County |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194325/https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2012 attack by mounted poachers near the SOS Elephants camp in the [[Chari-Baguirmi Region]], 28 elephants were slaughtered and most of their tusks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/44721/print|title=Dozens of elephants massacred in Chad|first=Laurel |last=Neme|publisher=Environmental News Network|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another attack in September 2012, about {{convert|50|mi}} from the boundaries of the Zakouma National Park, five rangers were killed; one is still missing and presumed dead. The [[Sudanese Armed Forces|Sudanese military]] have been blamed for the attacks and the slaughtering of elephants not only in Zakouma and elsewhere in Chad, but also in other African nations, including Cameroon.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; As of 2012, a small team was responsible for battling to protect the remaining 450 elephants in Zakouma. One of the worst massacres took place in 14–15 March 2013 when 89 elephants, including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves, were slaughtered by poachers near the town of [[Gamba, Chad|Gamba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/press-releases/poachers-kill-at-least-89-elephants-in-chad|title=Poachers Kill at Least 89 Elephants in Chad|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]]|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Stephanie Vergniault, a French lawyer, screenwriter, and conservationist who has been working in Chad since 2009, founded the SOS Elephants organization to protect the elephant population. In an interview in 2010, Vergniault stated that the population of elephants in Chad had declined by 85 percent in the previous three decades, and that if the same rate of poaching continues, "not a single elephant" would be alive in Chad within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0512-hance_chad.html#Ll676J36vAfPYtVV.99|title=A nation of tragedies: the unseen elephant wars of Chad |first=Jeremy |last=Hance|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=18 October 2013|publisher= Mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The '''European Top 100 Albums''' chart was the [[Europe]]an adaptation of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It ran from March 1984 until December 2010. Also commonly referred to as Eurochart Top 100 Albums, the chart showcased the sales of an act in 19 European countries based on [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] data.

The European Top 100 combined album sales (both retail and digital) of new and older albums. The methodology was different from the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where albums would only be allowed to chart if they weren't 18 months old. If an album older than 18 months had enough sales to enter the 200 chart after having already dropped out of the 100th position, it would chart on [[Billboard_200#Catalog_albums|The ''U.S. Billboard'' Catalog Albums]]. Later ''Billboard'' reviewed the criteria and decided the older albums would also be allowed to chart in the 200, as it should show what's being sold.

The chart update and issue dating followed the rules of the ''Billboard'' 200: sales tracking week began on Monday and ended on Sunday. A new chart was published the following Thursday with an issue date of the following Saturday.

The first Eurochart number one album was ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]]. The final chart was published on 11 December 2010, following the news of Billboard closing their London office and letting their UK-based staff go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billboard closing London office|url=http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/billboard-closing-london-office/ |publisher=CMU |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album with the longest stay at number one was [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'', with 34 weeks.&lt;ref name="europarade"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Europarade|language=Dutch|date=1986-07-19|work=Hitkrant|publisher=Nationale Hitkrant Productions|location=Amsterdam|volume=10|issue=29|issn=0165-4942|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last number one album on the chart was ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]]'' by [[Take That]].

'''George Shapiro''' (born May 18, 1931) is an [[United States|American]] [[talent manager]] and [[television producer]]. He is among the most successful managers in [[show business]], best known for representing [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Carl Reiner]]  and [[Andy Kaufman]], and served as a producer for the highly successful sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whetsell |first1=Tripp |title=Veteran Talent Manager George Shapiro Looks Back on Early Career |url=https://variety.com/2018/vintage/features/talent-manager-george-shapiro-1202819107/ |accessdate=September 24, 2018 |work=Variety |date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

==Career==
After graduating from NYU, Shapiro went to work in the mailroom at the [[William Morris Agency]] in [[New York City|New York]]. He advanced within the company and soon became an agent. One of his first assignments was to accompany [[Elvis Presley]] during his appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Eventually, he began packaging programs including the hits ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'' starring [[Marlo Thomas]], and ''[[Gomer Pyle]]'' starring [[Jim Nabors]]. He also packaged a number of specials for [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]] and [[Carol Channing]].&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsweek"/&gt;

Shapiro left William Morris to become a [[personal manager]] and producer along with his partner and friend, Howard West. They formed Shapiro/West Productions and executive produced the [[Emmy]], [[Peabody Award|Peabody]], and [[Golden Globe]] award-winning series, ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Shapiro was Andy Kaufman's personal manager for many years, executive producing the performer's special for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], ''Andy Kaufman at [[Carnegie Hall]]'', and one for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The Andy Kaufman Show]]''. He was executive producer with West on the 1999 [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]] in the role of Andy Kaufman and  [[Danny DeVito]] as Shapiro, and had a cameo in the movie as Mr. Besserman. He played a prominent role in the documentary ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]''.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsweek"/&gt;

On June 30, 2012, people from the world of comedy gathered at the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]] in Beverly Hills to honor Shapiro.

'''''I Want My Phone Back''''' is an American [[game show]] [[Web television|web television series]] that premiered on November 2, 2016 on Comcast Watchable. In 2017, it was subsequently picked up by [[Facebook Watch]] where it has since aired two seasons.

The series was created by Luke Kelly-Clyne and is hosted by Alana Johnston. The show's team of improvisers include Blake Rosier, Inessa Frantowski, Brandon Gardner, Laci Mosely, Kausar Mohammed, and Oscar Montoya.

==Premise==
''I Want My Phone Back'' follows host "Alana Johnston and a cast of improv performers take to the streets of Los Angeles, giving passersby the chance to win up to $1,000 — by handing over their mobile phones and letting the show’s pranksters post to social media, and text and call their contacts. The longer contestants stay in the game, the more money they make."&lt;ref name="ComcastOrder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Comcast’s Watchable Unveils First Original Series, Including Show With Vine Star Logan Paul|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/comcast-watchable-logan-paul-original-series-1201841193/|website=Variety|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
The series originated as a short video entitled ''I Want My Phone Back: The Scariest Game Show Ever'' that was produced by Big Breakfast for [[CollegeHumor]] and initially released on [[YouTube]] on November 13, 2015. The short was created by Luke Kelly-Clyne, directed by Todd G. Bieber, and featured Brandon Gardner as host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'I Want My Phone Back' Game|url=http://www.tastefullyoffensive.com/2015/11/the-i-want-my-phone-back-game.html|website=Tastefully Offensive|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Want My Phone Back: The Scariest Game Show Ever|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&amp;v=SaKVvBsMa54|website=YouTube|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collegehumor's I Want My Phone Back: The Scariest Game Show Ever|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5200028/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt|website=IMDb|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video proved to be quite successful on CollegeHumor's YouTube channel where it quickly earned a million views. After testing how the idea could be turned into a 30-minute TV show or 10-minute web series, the series was sold to streaming service Comcast Watchable.&lt;ref name="AdExchanger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sluis|first1=Sarah|title=How CollegeHumor Created A Successful Facebook Watch Show - AdExchanger|url=https://adexchanger.com/ad-exchange-news/collegehumor-created-successful-facebook-watch-show/|website=AdExchanger|accessdate=January 13, 2018|date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, it was announced that the short had been developed into a series and that Comcast Watchable had ordered a first season consisting of ten episodes.&lt;ref name="ComcastOrder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Geoff|title=Comcast’s Watchable Platform Premieres Exclusive Shows From Refinery29, Mitú, and Cut.com - Tubefilter|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/08/22/comcasts-watchable-platform-exclusive-shows-refinery29-mitu-cut/|website=Tubefilter|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamedy|first1=Saba|title=New series from WatchCut, mitú, Refinery29 headed to Comcast's Watchable|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/23/comcast-watchable-new-series-mitu/#V80gHzmdMEq0|website=Mashable|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=January 6, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Megh|title=Here’s an Episode of CollegeHumor’s New Game Show ‘I Want My Phone Back’|url=http://splitsider.com/2016/12/heres-an-episode-of-collegehumors-new-game-show-i-want-my-phone-back/|website=Splitsider|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutelle|first1=Sam|title=Contestants Shout "I Want My Phone Back" In New Episodes Of CollegeHumor’s Game Show - Tubefilter|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/12/06/i-want-my-phone-back-college-humor-watchable/|website=Tubefilter|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on November 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="I Want My Phone Back" on Watchable|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/video/7041257/i-want-my-phone-back-on-watchable|website=College Humor|accessdate=January 8, 2018|date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, it was reported that Comcast was reassessing their Watchable platform and planning to de-emphasize over-the-top distribution, and halt future work centered on Watchable originals including ''I Want My Phone Back''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Jeff|title=Comcast Sees New Path Ahead for ‘Watchable’ {{!}} Broadcasting &amp; Cable|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/platforms/comcast-sees-new-path-ahead-watchable/168852|website=Broadcasting Cable|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Sahil|title=Comcast puts its OTT play Watchable on life support - Digiday|url=https://digiday.com/media/comcasts-watchable-is-no-longer-funding-original-content-may-shut-down-soon-sources-say/|website=Digiday|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28124">'''Japanese Mahjong scoring rules''' are used for [[Japanese Mahjong]], a [[game]] for four players common in [[Japan]]. The rules were organized in the [[Taishō period|''Taishō'']] to [[Shōwa period]] as the game became popular. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The scoring system uses structural criteria as well as bonuses. Player start scores may be set to any value.  Usually, it is set to 20,000 to 30,000 points. Scores are counted using sticks of 10,000 points, 5,000 points, 1,000 points and 100 points. A game often ends when all the points of a player are lost, which is a situation called ''hakoten'',&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Literally "(empty) box points." Japanese mahjong sets often have four boxes to store tiles, and they are often used for point sticks. (Japanese: ハコテン)&lt;/ref&gt; ''dobon'',&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Sound of something heavy like a stone falling into water. (Japanese: ドボン)&lt;/ref&gt; ''buttobi'',&lt;ref group ="nb"&gt;(Japanese: ぶっとび)&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

There are two criteria in determining the winning points: ''[[#Counting han|han]]'' and ''[[#Counting fu|fu]]'', which correspond to a [[#Scoring tables|points table]]. ''Han'' is the unit for the value of ''[[Japanese Mahjong yaku|yaku]]'', which are particular patterns or conditions of a hand.  ''Fu'' is the value of melds, waits and "going out".

==Steps of calculation==
The payment to the winner of a hand is calculated as follows:
:1. Counting ''[[#Counting han|han]]'' (飜)
:2. If it is five ''han'' or more, it is ''[[#Mangan|mangan]]'' (満貫) or more and the calculation of [[#Calculating basic points|basic points]] is omitted
:3. Counting ''[[#Counting fu|fu]]'' (符)
:4. If it is clear that the ''han'' and ''fu'' yield more than ''mangan'', the calculation of basic points is omitted
:5. Calculating the basic points based on the ''fu'' and ''han''
:6. Multiplying the basic points depending on whether the winner is the dealer or non-dealer, and whether the hand is won by ''tsumo'' or ''ron''
:7. Adding bonuses based on the number of [[#Counters|counters]]''
:(8. Adjusting the payment by the ''[[#Wareme|wareme]]'' rule)

In the case of a draw, points are transferred according to the ''[[#Nō-ten bappu|nō-ten bappu]]'' rule.  In the event of a penalty, such as claiming a win with an illegal hand, then points are transferred via the ''[[#Chombo|chombo]]'' rule.

===Counting han===
The total number of ''han'' (飜) of all the kinds of ''[[Japanese Mahjong yaku|yaku]]'' (役; winning hand) in the hand is summed up. Each ''[[Japanese Mahjong#Dora|dora]]'' (ドラ) increases the ''han'' value of a hand. ''Dora'' are not regarded as ''yaku'', and no hand can be won without a ''yaku'' even if there are some ''dora'' tiles.

If there is more than one way to arrange the winning hand, the arrangement with the highest ''han'' is used. For example, a hand could be either ''ryanpeikou'' (二盃口) or ''chītoitsu'' (七対子), but since ''ryanpeikou'' is three ''han'' where ''chītoitsu'' is two ''han'', ''ryanpeikou'' should prevail. Some ''yaku'' have their ''han'' value reduced by one if the hand is not closed.

If a hand has five ''han'' or more, it is always counted by ''[[#Mangan|mangan]]'' (満貫) as a unit and it is not necessary to calculate ''[[#Counting fu|fu]]'' (符) or [[#Calculating basic points|basic points]].

===Counting fu===
''Fu'' (符) is counted in the order below and then rounded up to the tens. There may be variations of rules for counting it.

[Three ''han'' with 70 ''fu'' or more] and [four ''han'' with 40 ''fu'' or more] yield more than ''mangan'' and there is no need to calculate basic points. 

# A winning hand is automatically awarded 20 ''fu''. This is called ''fūtei'' (副底).
# Ten ''fu'' are added if one wins by claiming a discarded tile with a closed hand.  This is called ''menzen-kafu'' (門前加符).
# Add ''fu'' of the melds and the pair. (See the list below.)
# Add ''fu'' according to how the waiting was. (See the list below.)
# Add two ''fu'' if one wins by self-draw. This way of winning is called ''tsumo'' (自摸, or ツモ). However, if the winning hand includes a ''yaku'' of [[Japanese_Mahjong_yaku#No-points hand|no-points hand]] (''pinfu'', 平和), in most rules the two ''fu'' are not awarded and the hand is counted as a total of 20 ''fu''.
# Winning with ''yaku'' which include [[Japanese_Mahjong_yaku#Special criteria|seven pairs]] (''chītoitsu'', 七対子) is counted as 25 ''fu'' altogether. The value is not rounded up to the tens. Some rules say seven pairs has 50 ''fu'' and one ''han'', especially in the [[Kansai region]].
# As an exception, if one wins by claiming a discard with an open hand with melds and waits to which no ''fu'' is awarded, the hand is not 20 ''fu'' but counted as a total of 30 ''fu''. This is the ''fu'' for an open ''pinfu''.

===Calculating basic points===
The basic points of a hand is calculated as follows:

:[ basic points = ''fu'' × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+''han'')&lt;/sup&gt; ]

*When a non-dealer (''ko'', 子: child) goes out by self-draw, the dealer (''oya'', 親: parent) pays the winner 2 × basic points, and the other two non-dealers pay the winner 1 × basic points.
*When a non-dealer goes out by discard, the discarding player pays the winner 4 × basic points.
*When the dealer goes out by self-drawn, all the three non-dealers pay the winner 2 × basic points.
*When the dealer goes out by discard, the discarding non-dealer pays the winner 6 × basic points.

The actual points given are rounded up to the nearest 100. Even if the values of ''han'' and ''fu'' are the same, the points received for self-draw wins often slightly deviate from those received for discard wins because of rounding.

==Example calculations==
Example 1: The player on the right of the dealer goes out by self-draw. (The dealer's wind is always East in Japanese rules.) The winner's hand is closed and has a closed triplet (''ankō'') of Souths. The player also has two Whites as the pair (''toitsu'') and the winning tile is a White. The ''yaku'' are "self-pick" (''menzenchin-tsumo-hō'') and "honor tiles" (''yakuhai''), and they yield a total of two ''han''. The sum of ''fu'' is 20 (''fūtei'') + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (a pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) + 2 (self-draw) = 34 ''fu'', rounded up to 40 ''fu''.

The basic points are thus 40 × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+2)&lt;/sup&gt; = 640. The dealer pays the winner 640 × 2 = 1,280, rounded up to 1,300 points. The other two non-dealers pay the winner 640, rounded up to 700 points.

Example 2: The same player goes out by the same hand, except this time the winning tile was discarded by the player on the right. The resulting hand has one ''han'' of ''honor tiles''. The number of ''fu'' is 20 (''fūtei'') + 10 (''ron'' with a closed hand) + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (the pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) = 42 ''fu'', rounded up to 50 ''fu''.

The basic point is thus 50 × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+1)&lt;/sup&gt; = 400. The discarder pays the winner 400 × 4 = 1,600 points. The other two players pay the winner nothing.

===One han 110 fu===
It is possible for a hand to have one ''han'' with 102 ''fu'' (rounded up to 110 ''fu'') if the rules allow a pair to have four ''fu'' when it is made of wind tiles that are both the seat wind and the prevailing wind. Some rules consider that such a pair is still worth two ''fu'', making the hand have exactly 100 ''fu''.

An example of a hand that has one ''han'' with 110 ''fu''.
[[Image:MJt3.png|25px]][[Image:MJt4.png|25px]][[Image:MJt5.png|25px]][[Image:MJf1.png|25px]][[Image:MJf1.png|25px]][[Image:MJd3.png|25px]][[Image:MJd3.png|25px]], closed [[Image:MJw1.png|25px]][[Image:MJw1.png|25px]][[Image:MJw1.png|25px]][[Image:MJw1.png|25px]], closed [[Image:MJs1bird.png|25px]][[Image:MJs1bird.png|25px]][[Image:MJs1bird.png|25px]][[Image:MJs1bird.png|25px]], winning by a discard [[Image:MJd3.png|25px]].

The hand has [[Japanese Mahjong yaku#Yaku based on terminal or honor tiles|''yakuhai'']] of one ''han'' with 20 ''fu'' of ''fūtei'', 10 ''fu'' of ''menzen-kafu'', 32 ''fu'' of ''ankan'', 32 ''fu'' of ''ankan'', four ''fu'' of ''minkō'', and four ''fu'' of ''toitsu''. East is both the player's seat wind and the round's prevailing wind in this case. This is the largest amount of ''fu'' that a hand with one ''han'' can have.

==Scoring table==
Since the method of calculating a winning hand's score in mahjong is quite tedious, many players refer to a scoring table to look up the final score of a hand. Expert and professional players have this table memorized and can thus tell the value of a hand at a glance.  Each of the table's point values are derived from the scoring equation and procedure with each corresponding ''han'' and ''fu'' values.

To use the table, simply look up the values that correspond to the [[#Counting han|''han'']] and [[#Counting fu|''fu'']] counts of the hand.  The top numbers in each cell indicate the payout from a player who discards a winning tile. The numbers in brackets indicate the payout for each player in the event the winning tile is self-drawn.  If the winner is the dealer, each player pays the same amount. If the winner is a non-dealer, then the other two non-dealers pay the smaller number, while the dealer pays the larger number.

The reason why there are no scores in the 1 ''han'' 20 ''fu'' cell is that such a hand is impossible. The only 20 fu hands are the [[Japanese_Mahjong_yaku#No-points hand|no-points hand]] (''pinfu'', 平和) where the winning tile is self-drawn. However, since a no-points hand must be closed, it makes winning via a self-drawn tile automatically add 1 ''han'' ''yaku'' of [[Japanese_Mahjong_yaku#Yaku based on luck|self pick]] to the hand. Therefore, a 1 ''han'' 20 fu hand cannot exist.  A [[Japanese_Mahjong_yaku#Seven pairs|seven pairs]] hand is fixed at 25 fu.  Since the hand is always closed, it adds 1 ''han'' of self pick when won by self-draw.

==Mangan==
When it is clear that a hand reaches basic points of more than 2,000, it is limited to full basic points of 2,000 and called ''mangan'' (満貫). A hand of five ''han'' or more is always counted as a multiple of ''mangan''. In those cases there is no need to calculate basic points.

One ''han'' cannot reach ''mangan'' because 110 ''fu'' × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+1)&lt;/sup&gt; = 880 &lt; 2,000. (With one han, [[#One han 110 fu|110 ''fu'']] is the maximum.)

Two ''han'' cannot reach ''mangan'' because 110 ''fu'' × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+2)&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,760 &lt; 2,000. (With two han, 110 ''fu'' is also the maximum.)

When a hand has 120 ''fu'' or more, it always has some ''[[Japanese Mahjong yaku|yaku]]'' of three ''han'' or more.

[Four ''han'' with 40 ''fu'' or more] is ''mangan'' as 40 × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+4)&lt;/sup&gt; = 2,560 &gt; 2,000. (In some rules [four ''han'' with 30 ''fu''] is regarded as ''mangan'' because 30 × 2&lt;sup&gt;(2+4)&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,920 is close to 2,000. [Three ''han'' with 60 ''fu''] is the same.)

==Exhaustive draws==
In plenty of occasions, a hand ends with all tiles drawn and the 14 tiles in the dead wall remain.  Yet, no player wins the hand.  This is the exhaustive draw.  In this case, points may be exchanged barring any ''tenpai'' hands vs ''nōten'' hands.  After each exhaustive draw, the [[Japanese_Mahjong_scoring_rules#Counters|counter]] increases by one.

===Tenpai===
''Tenpai'' (聴牌) means one tile short of a winning hand. To be ''tenpai'', a hand does not need any particular ''[[Japanese Mahjong yaku|yaku]]'' partly because winning by the last discard is ''yaku'' itself. When a hand is not ''tenpai'', the situation is called ''nōten'' (ノー聴: ''nō'' is English "no" and ''ten'' for ''tenpai''). 

Players must show their hand to verify that it is ''tenpai'' when a hand is a draw and if they declared ''[[Japanese Mahjong#Rīchi|rīchi]]'' or if they declare ''tenpai''. If a hand with ''rīchi'' declaration is ''nōten'', a ''[[#Chombo|chombo]]'' penalty is imposed. In some cases, a player who didn't declare ''rīchi'' can declare ''nōten'' even when the hand is ''tenpai'' to keep their hand concealed.

===Point exchange===
Players receive or pay points called ''nō-ten bappu'' (ノー聴罰符; ''fu'' of penalty for ''nōten'') in the following way, when a hand ends in an exhaustive draw: 
* (1) one player is in a state of ''tenpai'', the player gets 1,000 points from each of the other three players and receives total of 3,000.
* (2) two players are ''tenpai'', they get 1,500 each and the other two players pay 1,500 each.
* (3) three players are ''tenpai'', they get 1,000 each and the other player pays 3,000.
* (4) the players are all  ''tenpai'' or all ''nōten'', no payment is made.

In most rules when a dealer's hand is ''nōten'', the dealer changes and the game wind may change. But if it's the last hand of the last round, in some rules, a game does not end if the dealer declares ''nōten''.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia contributors, [http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB&amp;oldid=36496081 "麻雀のルール,"] ''[[Japanese Wikipedia|Wikipedia: Japanese language version]]'', February 23, 2011, 20:37 UTC, retrieved June 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counters==
When there are counter sticks (''honba'') on the table, winners get bonus points calculated by multiplying 300 by the number of those counters. ''Honba'' (本場) is a unit of continuous dealer wins and draws, and to be exact, ''hon'' (本) is a unit of numbers of some bars and so on, and ''ba'' (場) means a scene or a situation.

The dealer keeps count of the number of continuous dealer wins and draws by placing point sticks on the table. While point sticks are usually used for scoring, here they are used merely as counters, a visual aid. The initial count is zero. The number of counters increases by one when:
* (1) the dealer wins a hand
* (2) a hand is a draw (''ryūkyoku'', 流局)
* (3) an [[Japanese Mahjong#Abortive draws|abortive draw]] happens. 

In the case of (1) or (3), the dealer remains the same. In the case of (2), when the dealer cannot declare ''[[#Tenpai|tenpai]]'', the dealer changes, but the number of counters increases regardless of whether the dealer declares tenpai. In all other cases, namely when only a non-dealer wins, the count is reset to zero.

''Renchan'' (連荘)  is a situation in which a player successively plays the dealer, and is often only caused by dealer's win or ''tenpai''; therefore, draws are not always ''renchan''. On the other hand, the number of ''honba'' always increases when a draw or a dealer's win occurs. If the dealer changes, it is called ''rinchan'' (輪荘) instead of ''renchan'', and happens for example by their ''nōten'' in the case of a draw. &lt;!--See Japanese article [[:ja:連荘]].--&gt;

In a state of ''n'' counters (suppose ''n'' is a number), when a player wins a hand by self-draw (''tsumo''), the player gets a bonus of ''n'' × 100 points from each of other three players for a total of ''n'' × 300, and when a player wins by claiming a discard (''ron'', 栄), the player gets a bonus of ''n'' × 300 from the discarder.

Example: 
* East round, 4th rotation with 0 counters (東4局0本場). The dealer (East) wins the hand. The seat winds don't rotate. Dealer puts 1 counter on the table.
* East round, 4th rotation with 1 counter (東4局1本場). Hand is a draw with the dealer not declaring ''tenpai''. The seat winds rotate. The former dealer retrieves the 1 counter and the new dealer places 2 counters.
* South round, 1st rotation with 2 counters (南1局2本場). North wins by ''ron'' (claiming a discard), getting a bonus of 600 points from the discarder. The seat winds rotate and the former dealer retrieves the 2 counters.
* South round, 2nd rotation with 0 counters (南2局0本場).

Optionally, a rule may restriction of ''ryanhan-shibari'' (二飜縛り; literally "two-''han'' binding").  Here, players must produce hands of two ''han'' or more from yaku when the honba count surpasses a certain number.  Usually, this count is five or more.

==Chombo==
Under the rule of ''chombo'' (チョンボ, 錯和 or 冲和), a player is given an infraction.  Point penalties vary by organizations and/or events.  Typically, a player pays a penalty of the same amount as ''mangan'' to other players in most rules. A non-dealer pays 4,000 to East and 2,000 to the other two players, while a dealer pays 4,000 to each.&lt;ref&gt;http://japanese-mahjong.com/riichi-mahjong.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mahjong-europe.org/rules/downloads/riichisheet_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other times, ''chombo'' does not affect the current score of the game; and instead, the penalty is applied at the end of the game.  Chombo occurs for any of the following:

* Invalidly claiming a winning hand
* Winning on a discard under the situation of [[Japanese Mahjong#Sacred discard|sacred discard]] (''furiten'')
* Revealling a false ''rīchi'', that is, ''rīchi'' with a hand that is not in the state of ''[[#Tenpai|tenpai]]''
* Closed ''kan'' after ''rīchi'' if the ''kan'' changes the hand structure (in other words a ''kan'' of a tile after ''rīchi'' is not allowed if the hand can be interpreted such that the tile is a part of a sequence)
* Having more tiles than allowed (depending on the rules)&lt;ref name="chombo01"&gt;Wikipedia contributors, [http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80%E3%81%AE%E5%8F%8D%E5%89%87%E8%A1%8C%E7%82%BA&amp;oldid=37248657 "麻雀の反則行為,"] ''[[Japanese Wikipedia|Wikipedia: Japanese language version]]'', April 19, 2011, 14:16 UTC, retrieved June 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knocking the wall over so that it cannot be recovered to the way it was before &lt;ref name="chombo01"/&gt;

In game infractions, such as the false ''rīchi'' and invalid ''kan'' after ''rīchi'', they are caught only after draws or winning declarations by players who declared the ''rīchi''.  If other players happen to win the hand, then the infractions are not revealed and therefore made null and void.  Any ''rīchi'' bets are returned to the players after the end of a ''chombo'' hand.

==Final points and place==
After the game is finished, the points of each of the three players other than the winner is rounded off to the nearest 1,000. The winner's points are the difference between 120,000 (30,000 × 4) and the total of these three players' points. The number of points is divided by 1,000, and 30 is finally subtracted from it. The sum of these final points is always zero. In most cases there are additional points transferred based on the players' final places (''uma''). (For example: 1st gets +20, 2nd gets +10, 3rd gets -10 and 4th gets -20)

Example: The initial points are 25,000 each. A (winner): 43,600, B: 14,500, C: 15,400, D: 26,500, and rounded off to B:15,000, C:15,000, D:27,000. The number of the winner's points is calculated as follows irrespective of initial points: 120,000 − (15,000 + 15,000 + 27,000) = 63,000 (There sometimes happens the case like this. The result of the winner differs from 64,000 that was counted rounding 43,600 off and adding 4 × 5,000 (difference between 30,000 and initial points)). The final points and place: A:+33 (1st), D:−3 (2nd), C:−15 (3rd), B:−15 (4th). The 1st place is also counted like: (30 − 15) + (30 − 15) + (30 − 27) = +33.

&lt;!-- New text to replace old text

At the end of the game, the final scores may be calculated.  Under casual game settings, this calculation is not necessary.  However, under more formal settings, it may be required.  This calculation takes the game's scores and adjusts them according the setting of ''oka'' and ''uma'', which were predetermined before the game.  The calculation for each player is as follows:

 End score = ((Points + Oka - Target)/1000) + Uma

* End score - the final score for the player
* Points - the player's points at the end of the final hand
* Oka - the point difference between the target score and the initial score
* Target - the target score, or the minimum score needed for a player to be declared first or the winner
* Uma - a set of four numbers applied to each player's placement

Under this calculation, the placement between players do not change.

Editor's note: This text was confusing, when I first tried to understand this system 5 years ago. --&gt;

==Optional scoring rules==

===Wareme===
In the optional rule ''wareme'' (割れ目, ワレメ; fissure, split), the player in front of whom the wall was split to indicate the end of the dead wall, acquires and pays double the normal points. They are doubled after the points for counters are added.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia contributors, [http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80%E3%81%AE%E5%BE%97%E7%82%B9%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97&amp;oldid=38506122 "麻雀の得点計算,"] ''[[Japanese Wikipedia|Wikipedia: Japanese language version]]'', July 24, 2011, 05:20 UTC, retrieved November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often especially called ''oya-ware'' (親割れ; parent's ''wareme'') when the player is the dealer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3743">:''For the Act concerning the licensing of premises to sell alcohol, see [[Licensing Act 2003]].''

The '''Licensing Act''' '''of 1737''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and a pivotal moment in theatrical history. Its purpose was to control and censor what was being said about the British government through theatre. The act was modified by the [[Theatres Act 1843]] and was finally named as the [[Theatres Act 1968]].

==Forerunner==
The function of censorship of plays for performance (at least in London) fell to the [[Master of the Revels]] by the time of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The power was used mostly with respect to matters of politics and religion (including blasphemy). It was certainly exercised by [[Edmund Tylney]], who was Master from 1579 to 1610. Tylney and his successor, [[George Buck]], also exercised the power to censor plays for publication.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Kincaid, Arthur.

The film is a loose sequel to his 1998 film ''[[Happiness (1998 film)|Happiness]]'', with new actors playing the same characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/todd-solondz-life-during-wartime|title=Todd Solondz on his quasi-sequel to Happiness, Life During Wartime|last=Brooks|first=Xan|date=2009-09-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Life During Wartime'' premiered at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival|2009 Venice Film Festival]], where it won the [[Golden Osella]] award for Best Screenplay.&lt;ref name="CorriereLDWAward"&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cultura_e_spettacolo/Venezia-Premio-migliore-sceneggiatura-Todd-Solondz/12-09-2009/1-A_000046588.shtml Venezia-Premio-migliore-sceneggiatura-Todd-Solondz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915180308/http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cultura_e_spettacolo/Venezia-Premio-migliore-sceneggiatura-Todd-Solondz/12-09-2009/1-A_000046588.shtml|date=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot revolves around the Jordan sisters: Trish, Joy, and Helen. Joy has married Helen's former neighbor Allen Mellencamp, who continues to struggle with his compulsion to make obscene phone calls.

Trish has been raising her three children, Billy (now off at college), Timmy and Chloe. She has begun dating recently divorced Harvey Weiner, who she hopes is normal. Trish's ex-husband, Bill has been released from prison after serving a sentence for [[child molestation]], and heads to [[Florida]] to find out how his family, particularly his eldest son, are doing. He finds brief solace in a one-night stand with Jacqueline, a self-described "monster" as filled with loneliness and self-hatred as he is; however, she kicks him out the next morning when she catches him taking money from her purse.

Trish's middle child, Timmy, is preparing for his [[bar mitzvah]] and trying to determine what it means to become a man. Trish has for years told Timmy and Chloe that Bill had died, to avoid telling them that he is a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]. Timmy finds out, however, and is angry at her that she lied to him. When he asks her about the mechanics of rape, Trish urges him to scream as soon as any man touches him.

Meanwhile, Joy takes a break from Allen, and heads to Florida to spend time with Trish. She begins having visions of Andy, a former co-worker who had committed suicide shortly after dating her. She briefly goes to California to visit Helen, who has become a successful screenwriter, and calls her husband to leave a message that she is coming home. The audience sees that Allen has committed suicide. She returns to Florida to attend Timmy's bar mitzvah.

In the meantime, Bill sneaks into Trish's house to find Billy's college address. He pays Billy an unexpected visit at Northern Oregon University, where they discuss their past and the time that passed while Bill was in prison; in particular, Bill asks Billy a few very blunt questions about his sex life. Bill asks for forgiveness, but Billy refuses, saying his actions are unforgivable. Bill then disappears again, reassured that Billy will not turn out to be like him.

Harvey brings his adult son Mark to dinner at Trish's, where he and Trish introduce their children to each other. At Timmy's request, Harvey comes to Timmy's room to have a talk. Timmy asks Harvey whether he is [[gay]] or a pedophile. Harvey denies being either, and, suspecting Timmy has been molested, tries to comfort him, touching his shoulder and hugging him. Terrified, Timmy starts to scream as per his mother's earlier instructions. Trish believes that Harvey tried to molest Timmy, and dumps him.

Timmy has his bar mitzvah, during which Joy experiences visions of Andy and then Allen, who implores her to commit suicide as he has, but Joy refuses and banishes him from her life. Timmy leaves the reception to find Mark, Harvey's son. He begs Mark (who revealed he had dealt with allegations of pedophilia) for forgiveness, as he made his mistakes before his bar mitzvah (an event marking the beginning of moral accountability). Mark grants him forgiveness, but notes that such gestures are meaningless. Timmy then says that all he wants is his father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The classic Viennese ball has a proud tradition stretching back over four centuries, and has even taken the first steps towards inclusion in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. The full spectacle extends from the opening ceremony featuring a debutant's committee to midnight stage shows with dance and music performances.  There is also traditional ball etiquette to consider - from the "Damenspenden", a gift presented to the ladies, to the requisite gown, tuxedo or formal traditional Austrian dress, Austrian culture runs through every aspect of the Viennese Ball.

"'''Love the Way You Lie (Part II)'''" is a song by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]] from her fifth [[studio album]] ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). It features guest vocals from American rapper [[Eminem]], who wrote the song alongside [[Skylar Grey]] and the producer [[Alex da Kid]]. It is the sequel to the 2010 hit single "[[Love the Way You Lie]]", which appears on Eminem's seventh studio album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]''. It received positive reviews from critics and was performed for at the [[American Music Awards of 2010]] on November 21, 2010, as part of a medley with "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]".

==Background==
Following the release and commercial success of "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" in 2010, [[Eminem]] wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna as the lead vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhammad|first=Latifah|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2010/10/19/rihanna-eminem-love-the-way-you-lie-sequel|title=Rihanna and Eminem to make a Love the Way You Lie sequel|work=The Boombox|publisher=[[AOL Inc.]]|date=October 19, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for [[MTV]], Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's no way you can outdo that, so why compete with it?".&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; She said when she first heard the original [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter [[Skylar Grey]], her reservations about recording it went away.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2010/10/30/15890306-wenn-photo.html|title=Rihanna worried about Eminem duet sequel|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|publisher=Mention|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Love the Way You Lie" and "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" were based on a demo written and recorded in late 2009 by Grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dombrowski|first=Chris|title=Going to Grammys|url=http://theworldlink.com/news/local/article_4f9bdb96-30fe-11e0-9f4b-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=July 17, 2011|newspaper=The World|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey told [[PopEater]] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I have a little bit of a launching pad to put out my own stuff." Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on ''Loud'', saying "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too."&lt;ref name=PopEater&gt;{{cite web|last=Baltin|first=Steve|title=New music: Skylar Grey – ‘Love the Way You Lie’ (Demo)|url=http://www.popeater.com/2011/02/01/skylar-grey-love-the-way-you-lie-demo/|work=[[PopEater]]|publisher=[[AOL Television]]|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The demo track by Grey is on her [[extended play]] ''[[The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey]]'', which was released on January 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/01/05/skylar-grey-unveils-buried-sessions-artwork/ |title=Skylar Grey Unveils 'Buried Sessions' Artwork |work=Rap-Up |publisher=Devin Lazerine |date=January 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671UCck5I?url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/01/05/skylar-grey-unveils-buried-sessions-artwork/ |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piano and drums version, which features Eminem, appears as the final song on the standard edition of ''Loud'', while the piano version, which excludes Eminem's part in the song, appears as a bonus track on the [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] edition of ''Loud''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Rihanna Initially Against 'Love The Way You Lie (Part II)' With Eminem|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651117/20101029/eminem.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" is a mid-tempo song,&lt;ref name="sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rihanna, 'Love The Way You Lie Part II'&amp;nbsp;– Composition Sheet Music|work=''Musicnotes.com''|publisher=[[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporates the musical genres of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[R&amp;B]]. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes, the song is written in [[Time signature|common time]] with a moderate tempo of 83 [[Tempo|beats per minute]] and is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[G minor]].&lt;ref name="sheet"/&gt; Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of [[F (musical note)|F]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the high note of [[D (musical note)|D]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="sheet"/&gt; Emily Mackay of ''[[NME]]'' commented about the vocals provided by Rihanna and Eminem in the song, stating that "There’s great contrast in Part II of ‘Love The Way You Lie’. With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama, it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage, and sounding, frankly, mental. The contrast with Rihanna’s smoothly pitched pain (“Maybe I’m a masochist/Try to run but I don’t wanna never leave”) is delicious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/11718|title=Album Review: Rihanna - Loud |work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that “''Loud'' works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until it gets to 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/arts/music/16choice.html|title=Critics Choice - New CDs|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Richards of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Chris|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/15/AR2010111506697.html|title=Rihanna's new albums: 'Loud,' yes, but what's clear?|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]]|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Skinner of [[BBC Online]] viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skinner|first=James|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/x5fd |title=Music – Review of Rihanna – Loud|publisher=BBC|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Jones of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave a mixed review of the collaboration,  commenting, "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his Recovery album."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Steve|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-11-16-listen16_ST_N.htm|title=Listen Up: Rihanna is living out 'Loud' on new album|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song, stating, "She collaborated with [[Eminem]] this summer on the controversial '"[[Love the Way You Lie]]"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on "[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]" with "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conner|first=Thomas|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article|title='Loud' a well-deserved party for Rihanna|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=John Barron|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DAw10jQo?url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article|archivedate=December 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maxim Alexandrovich Galkin''' ({{lang-ru|Максим Алeксандpoвич Галкин}}; born  18 June 1976 in [[Naro-Fominsky District]]) is a [[Russia]]n [[comedian]],&lt;ref name="Pop_Cult"&gt;{{cite book|first=Birgit|last=Beumers|title=Pop culture Russia!: media, arts, and lifestyle|page=35|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|isbn=1-85109-459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; television presenter and singer.

==Biography==

He first became famous as an [[impersonator]] and is known for his talent at [[parody]] and his [[duet]]s with the famous Russian pop singer [[Alla Pugacheva]] and [[Ani Lorak]].

Galkin was also the host of the Russian version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'',&lt;ref name="Pop_Cult"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1299458/bio|title=Bio at IMdb|accessdate=Sep 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it was renamed from ''O, Schastlivchik'' (Oh, Lucky Man) and to 2008. He currently hosts the Russian adaptation of ''[[The Million Pound Drop]]''.

During his University years Galkin appeared in [[KVN]], the Russian youth stand-up comedy competition, which kickstarted his career. Recently, he acted as a judge on the show.

Galkin and Pugacheva are hosts of a Russian TV show similar to ''[[But Can They Sing?]]'', ''Dve Zvezdy'' (Two Stars). Pairs made up of a professional singer and a celebrity compete for the honour of being named Two Stars. Famous alumnae include the singers [[Zhasmin]], [[Alsou]] and [[Nastya Kamenskikh]].

Galkin had a very classical and strict upbringing. His mother was a teacher, and he finished music and math school, and knows four languages, Russian, English, German and French. He is a graduate of the Russian State University of the Humanities.

Galkin is one of the few comedians currently performing an impression, albeit 'light-hearted', of President Vladimir Putin, on Russia's Channel One TV channel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/new-cartoon-show-puts-putin-among-men/397362.html|publisher=Moscow Time|date=Jan 14, 2010|last=Bratersky|first=Alexander|title=New Cartoon Show Puts Putin Among Men|accessdate=Jan 25, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629080430/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/new-cartoon-show-puts-putin-among-men/397362.html|archivedate=Jun 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2016 he has been hosting a children's talent show on TV "Best of all" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.vokrug.tv/product/show/767081127/ |script-title=ru:Лучше всех|trans-title= Best of all|website= vokrug.tv|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Personal life==

Since 2001, Maxim Galkin was romantically involved with the venerated Soviet and Russian singer [[Alla Pugacheva]]. On December 24, 2011, the couple got married, despite the significant age gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lady.mail.ru/article/457142|title=News article in Russian|publisher=Mail.ru|accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2013 Maxim Galkin and Alla Pugacheva became the biological parents of twins (using a surrogate mother) – Elizaveta and Harry.

== Political views ==
He spoke up negatively about the [[Russian gay propaganda law]], comparing it to a '[[witch-hunt]]', which is created only for political PR and public distraction from more important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/288917/|title=Галкин защитил геев от «охоты на ведьм»|last=ntv.ru|website=НТВ|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he doesn't think that it's necessary to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption]] because it can provoke a negative reaction in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gay.ru/news/rainbow/2013/05/31-26151.htm|title=GAY.RU - Максим Галкин поддержал супругу: "Усыновление детей геями я принять не могу..."|website=www.gay.ru|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in the People's Republic of China}}
{{Politics of China |expanded = Publicity }}

The '''Media of the People's Republic of China''' (alternatively '''Media of China, Chinese Media''') consists primarily of television, newspapers, radio, and magazines. Since 2000, the Internet has also emerged as an important form of communication by media, and is placed under the supervision of the Chinese government.

Since the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949 and until the 1980s, almost all media outlets in Mainland China were state-run. Independent media outlets only began to emerge at the onset of [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]], although state-run media outlets such as ''[[Xinhua]]'', [[China Central Television|CCTV]], and ''[[People's Daily]]'' continue to hold significant market share. Independent media that operate within the PRC (excluding Hong Kong and [[Macau]], which have separate media regulatory bodies) are no longer required to strictly follow journalistic guidelines set by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hong-kong-clings-to-separate-identity-8201862.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Andrew | last=Higgins | title=Hong Kong clings to separate identity | date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2013}} Hong Kong, though, is witnessing increasing complaints about [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jun/20/press-freedom-china | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Roy | last=Greenslade | title=Hong Kong journalists complain about editor's self-censorship | date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} However, regulatory agencies, such as the [[General Administration of Press and Publication]] (GAPP) and the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT), continue to set strict regulations on subjects considered taboo by the government, including but not limited to the legitimacy of the Communist Party, government policies in Tibet and Xinjiang, [[pornography]], and the banned religious topics, such as the [[Dalai Lama]] and the [[Falun Gong]].

Despite heavy government monitoring, however, the Mainland Chinese media has become an increasingly commercial market, with growing competition, diversified content, and an increase in investigative reporting. Areas such as sports, finance, and an increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face little regulation from the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/11515/ Council on Foreign Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Media controls were most relaxed during the 1980s under [[Deng Xiaoping]], until they were tightened in the aftermath of the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]]. They were relaxed again under [[Jiang Zemin]] in the late 1990s, but the growing influence of the Internet and its potential to encourage dissent led to heavier regulations again under the government of [[Hu Jintao]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/china_southerland-04042008152923.html Radio Free Asia: China's Media Controls: Could Bloggers Make a Difference?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]]{{Unreliable source?|reason=Arguable, quite biassed against countries that employ any form of censorship|date=September 2013}} consistently ranks China very poorly on media freedoms in their annual releases of the [[Press Freedom Index]], labeling the Chinese government as having "the sorry distinction of leading the world in repression of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/report-china,57.html |title=Reporters Sans Frontieres: Enemies of the Internet: China |access-date=2011-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205045445/http://en.rsf.org/report-china,57.html |archive-date=2010-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2010, China ranked 168 out of 178 nations.

== History ==
{{See also|Media history of China}}
The government is heavily involved in the media in the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]], and the largest media organizations (namely [[China Central Television|CCTV]], the [[People's Daily]], and [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]) are agencies of the Party-State: "The first social responsibility and professional ethic of media staff should be understanding their role clearly and being a good mouthpiece. Journalists who think of themselves as professionals, instead of as propaganda workers, are making a fundamental mistake about identity," Hu Zhanfan, the president of CCTV.&lt;ref name=NYT81612 /&gt; Media [[taboo]]s include topics such as the legitimacy of the [[Communist Party of China]], the governance of [[Tibet]], and [[Falun Gong]].  Within those restrictions there is a diversity of the media and fairly open discussion of social issues and policy options within the parameters set by the Party.

The diversity in mainland Chinese media is partly because most [[state media]] outlets no longer receive heavy subsidies from the government, and are expected to cover their expenses through commercial advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Yuezhi Zhao (1998), ''Media, Market, and Democracy in China.'' Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They can no longer merely serve as mouthpieces of the government, but also need to attract advertising through [[television programming|programming]] that people find attractive.&lt;ref name="rowman.com"&gt;[https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739182925] Jesse Owen Hearns-Branaman, ''A Political Economy of News in China'', Lexington Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While the government issues [[wiktionary:directive|directive]]s defining what can be published, it does not prevent, and in fact encourages outlets to compete for viewers and advertising.

The era of Government control over the Mainland Chinese media, however, has not come to an end. For example, the Government utilises financial incentives to manipulate journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Esarey, Ashley (2005), "Cornering the Market: State Strategies for Controlling China's Commercial Media."  ''Asian Perspective'' 29(2), 37–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, though, the Government's command over the nation's media has begun to falter. Despite government restrictions, much information is gathered either at the local level or from foreign sources and passed on through personal conversations and [[text message|text messaging]]. This paired with the withdrawal of government media subsidies has caused many newspapers (including some owned by the Communist Party) in [[Chinese tabloid|tabloid]]s to take bold editorial stands critical of the government, as the necessity to attract readers and avoid bankruptcy has been a more pressing fear than government [[Political repression|repression]].&lt;ref name="rowman.com"/&gt;

In addition, the traditional means of media control have proven extremely ineffective against newer forms of communication, most notably text messaging.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Although the government can and does use laws concerning [[Classified information|state secrets]] to [[Censorship|censor]] [[news|press]] reports about social and political conditions, these laws have not prevented the press from all discussion of Chinese social issues. {{Citation needed span|text=Chinese newspapers have been particularly affected by the loss of government subsidies, and have been especially active at gaining readership though must engaging in hard hitting [[investigative reporting]] and [[muckraking]].|date=April 2010}} As a result, even papers which are nominally owned by the Communist Party are sometimes very bold at reporting social issues. However, both commercial pressures and government restrictions have tended to cause newspapers to focus on lurid [[scandal]]s often involving local officials who have relatively little political cover, and Chinese newspapers tend to lack depth in analysis of political events, as this tends to be more politically sensitive.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Among social issues first reported in the press of mainland China include{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} the unsafe state of mines in mainland China.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In addition, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] coverup was first revealed by a fax to CCTV which was forwarded to Western news media.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Television ==
{{Main article|Television in the People's Republic of China}}
In 1978, the PRC had less than one television receiver per 100 people, and fewer than ten million Chinese had access to a television set. According to a [[World Bank]] report in 2003, there are about 35 TVs for every 100 people. Roughly a billion Chinese have access to television.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly, in 1965 there were 12 television and 93 radio stations in mainland China; today there are approximately 700 conventional television stations—plus about 3,000 [[cable television|cable]] [[television channel]]s—and 1,000 radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-chinese-media-more-autonomous-and-diverse-within-limits/copy_of_1.htm|title=The Chinese Media: More Autonomous and Diverse--Within Limits — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television broadcasting is controlled by [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), which, with its 22 program channels, is the country's only national network. CCTV, which employs about 10,000 people{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and has an annual income of ¥1.12 billion yuan a year (2012,=$177 million U.S. dollars), falls under the dual supervision of the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Propaganda Department]], responsible ultimately for media content, and the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]], which oversees operations. A Vice [[Political minister|Minister]] in the latter ministry serves as chairman of CCTV. The network's principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State. So are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China—nearly all of which are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality—that receive CCTV broadcasts.

CCTV produces its own news broadcasts three times a day and is the country's most powerful and prolific television program producer. It also has a monopoly on purchases of programming from overseas. All local stations are required to carry CCTV's 7&amp;nbsp;pm main news broadcast; an internal CCTV survey indicates that nearly 500 million people countrywide regularly watch this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-chinese-media-more-autonomous-and-diverse-within-limits/copy_of_1.htm|title=The Chinese Media: More Autonomous and Diverse--Within Limits — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if CCTV is the most powerful network of mainland China, it has only about 30% of audience share{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} all over the national territory.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The fact shows how the Chinese viewers are biased in favor of local TV programs, that are more likely to represent the differences of an audience that is the largest in the world, more than the national or even international programs, that can hardly attend the needs of such a wide public.{{Original research inline|date=November 2013}}

Since September 1, 2006, the Chinese government has banned foreign-produced animation between the hours of 5:00 to 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm on state-run television to protect struggling Chinese animation studios affected by the popularity of such cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Joe.

== Newspapers and journals ==
[[File:Hangzhou-Renmin-Ribao-2600.JPG|thumb|A current issue of [[People's Daily|Renmin Ribao]] posted on a newspaper display board in [[Hangzhou]]]]
The number of newspapers in mainland China has increased from 42—virtually all Communist Party papers—in 1968 to 382 in 1980 and more than 2,200 today. By one official estimate, there are now more than 7,000 magazines and journals in the country. The number of copies of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines in circulation grew fourfold between the mid-1960s and the mid-to-late 1980s, reaching 310 million by 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-chinese-media-more-autonomous-and-diverse-within-limits/copy_of_1.htm|title=The Chinese Media: More Autonomous and Diverse--Within Limits — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures, moreover, underreport actual circulation, because many publishers use their own distribution networks rather than official dissemination channels and also deliberately understate figures to circumvent taxation. In addition, some 25,000 [[printing house]]s and hundreds of individual [[bookstore]]s produce and sell unofficial material—mostly [[romance novel|romance literature]] and pornography but also political and [[intellectual]] journals.

&lt;ref name="factsanddetails.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=234&amp;catid=7&amp;subcatid=43 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710222218/http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=234&amp;catid=7&amp;subcatid=43 |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; China has many newspapers but the front runners are all State-run: the [[People's Daily]], Beijing Daily, [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]] and the [[Liberation Daily]].  The two primary news agencies in China are Xinhua News Agency and the China News Service. Xinhua was authorised to censor and edit the news of the foreign agencies in 2007. Some{{who|date=September 2013}} saw the power of Xinhua as making the press freedom weak and it allowed Xinhua to control the news market fully.&lt;ref name="factsanddetails.com"/&gt;

Much of the information collected by the Chinese mainstream media is published in [[neican]]s (internal, limited circulation [[report]]s prepared for the high-ranking government officials), not in the public outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Roger V. Des Forges, Ning Luo, Yen-bo Wu, ''Chinese democracy and the crisis of 1989: Chinese and American reflections'', SUNY Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7914-1269-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bcl8jLxcXboC&amp;pg=PA299 Google Print, p.299]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulators ==
The media and communications industry in mainland China is administered by various government agencies and regulators. The principal mechanism to force media outlets to comply with the Communist Party's requests is the vertically organized ''[[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee#Nomenklatura|nomenklatura]]'' system of cadre appointments, and includes those in charge of the media industry.&lt;ref name=esarey2006&gt;p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]]&amp;nbsp;– administers and oversees the administration of state-owned enterprises involved in the radio, television and broadcasting industry.
*[[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]]&amp;nbsp;– administers the physical communications infrastructure and the Internet service providers.
*[[General Administration of Press and Publication]]&amp;nbsp;– administers the newspaper, periodical, video and audio media and news industry.
*[[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]]'s Cyber Police force&amp;nbsp;– agency for regulating online content and investigation of Internet fraud, scams and pornography.

== Media reform ==
The media in mainland China also are becoming more autonomous and more diverse. Since [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976 and the subsequent emergence of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (who died in February 1997) as the country's paramount leader, an overall climate of economic and social reform in mainland China has been reflected in media content.

A prime example of the liberalisation has been the party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, which had been rigidly controlled under Mao, used against his enemies, and copied verbatim by every other newspaper in the country during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. This leading daily was reformed and enlivened in the late 1970s and early-to-middle 1980s by then editor-in-chief [[Hu Jiwei]]. Hu expanded the paper's size and coverage, encouraged public criticism through letters to the editor, called for promulgation of a press law to spell out journalists' rights, and introduced a sprightlier writing style.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Nevertheless, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that China "continues to be the world's leading jailer of journalists," with 42 imprisoned journalists at the end of 2004, and accuses private companies, both foreign and domestic, of having been complacent toward or complicit with government censorship.&lt;ref name=hottype&gt;Michael Miner, [http://www.chicagoreader.com/hottype/2005/051014_2.html Down With the Chinese Tyrants!] Hot Type, [[Chicago Reader]], week of October 14, 2005
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in their ''Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007 '', [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked China 163rd (or 7th from bottom) in terms of press freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=24021 Worldwide Press Freedom Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053644/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=24021 |date=2007-10-25 }}, [[Reporters Without Borders]], retrieved&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] issued a report in 2006 claiming that the Internet is still closely monitored by the state, with access to websites and publications critical of the government being restricted, as well as foreign satellite television and radio broadcasts being censored.&lt;ref name=esarey2006&gt;Esarey, Ashley. "Speak No Evil: Mass Media Control in Contemporary China." Freedom House Special Report, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation of the [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th National Party Congress]] in 2007,  new restrictions were placed on all sectors of the press, Internet-users, bloggers, website managers, foreign journalist, more than 30 of which have been arrested since the start of the year. In addition, a thousand discussion forums and websites have been shut down, and "a score of dissidents" have been imprisoned since July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23987 Reporters Without Borders activists rally in front of Olympic museum in Lausanne as Chinese Communist Party’s 17th congress opens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017230821/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23987 |date=2007-10-17 }} , [[Reporters Without Borders]], October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to stem growing unrest in China, the propaganda chief of the State Council, Hua Qing, announced in the [[People's Daily]] that the government was drafting a new press law that would lessen government involvement in the news media. In the editorial, CPC General secretary, President Hu Jintao was said to have visited the People's Daily offices and said that large scale public incidents should be "accurately, objectively and uniformly reported, with no tardiness, deception, incompleteness or distortion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3447904/China-considers-media-freedoms-to-stem-unrest.html "China considers media freedoms to stem unrest"], ''The Telegraph'', November 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reports by Chinese media indicate a gradual release from party control. For example, the detention of anti-government petitioners placed in mental institutions was reported in a state newspaper, later criticised in an editorial by the English-language ''[[China Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/09/content_7284120.htm Probe into dubious detentions], China Daily, December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hcT05IfKenQTw0XXxrfByZhQhizA China city locks up 'petitioners' in mental asylum: state media], AFP, December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and journalists believe that such reports are a small sign of opening up in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/27/AR2008122701218_2.html?hpid=sec-world In China, Media Make Small Strides], Washington Post, December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversified content ===
The media's growing autonomy has been reflected in their increasingly diversified content. Since the late 1970s, despite periodic reversals, media in mainland China have frequently criticized party cadres and have published debates on such fundamental issues as the [[rule of law]], [[freedom of the press]], and universal human rights. They also have reported on a myriad of previously untouched social and lifestyle subjects. The only inviolable restrictions appear to be an unwritten ban on challenges to the party's right to rule and to the legitimacy and decision-making authority of top party leaders.

=== Talk radio ===
[[Talk radio]] in mainland China allows a much freer exchange of views than other media formats. In effect, talk radio has shifted the [[paradigm]] from authorities addressing the people to people addressing the authorities. For example, until 1991 the 14 million inhabitants of Shanghai were served by only one radio station—Radio Shanghai—which primarily aired predictable, pro-government propaganda.  Today, there are over 100 talk radio stations throughout the Shanghai area.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelbarth, Todd. "The Chinese Media: More Autonomous and Diverse--within Limits: an Intelligence Monograph," Central Intelligence Agency, Center for the Study of Intelligence, 1997, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines and journals ===
Magazines and journals published in mainland China also have become much less inhibited in their coverage. These publications appear to enjoy more freedom than newspapers, which in turn have more leeway than radio (other than talk radio) and television. Magazines now print internal police reports on jailings of religious leaders and other dissidents. The State is unwilling to shut down such publications because it worries about public reaction, is anxious to avoid drawing more popular attention to the magazines, and knows that its own resources are already stretched thin.

Chinese journalists in Hong Kong on occasion have written politically controversial articles for mainland intellectual journals without encountering problems. Such opportunities have abounded because of the range of publications on the [[Mainland China|Chinese mainland]] and because party officials there are too busy with weightier matters to review such journals systematically.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Greater prosperity and literacy ===
Mainland China's rapid [[economic]] development, as well as educational advances leading to greater [[literacy]], have been important reasons for the dramatic expansion of the media and the diversification of coverage.

* Per capita gross domestic product, as measured in 1990 yuan, has increased fourfold since 1980. Rising disposable incomes have freed many Chinese from worrying about the basics of survival and provided them the wherewithal to purchase more television sets, newspaper and magazine subscriptions, and, more recently, [[satellite dish]]es and computers.
* Rising literacy rates have produced tens of millions of additional readers in the past decade, creating ever-expanding markets for the print media. According to UN statistics, Mainland China's adult literacy rate rose from 65.5 percent in 1982 to 81.5 percent in 1995.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Ideological and political trends ===
Other overarching factors that are helping to make the mainland Chinese media more [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] and diverse include a general decline in the influence of political [[ideology|ideologies]] and systems of belief;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} growing Chinese popular [[skepticism]] toward authority;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} increased contact with the West;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} greater competition in the media market;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} ebbing government resources;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} improved professional training for journalists;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and new communication technologies.

=== Ideological shift ===
The waning influence of [[Maoism|Marxist–Leninist–Maoist]] thought has weakened the State's ability to use the media to shape public [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and has made it harder for the authorities to penalize the media for publishing material that is not strictly consistent with Marxist theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although Marxism remains the official [[doctrine]] of the PRC, the de-emphasis of ideology has strengthened the media's hand in two fundamental ways: it has helped undercut government efforts to indoctrinate the public and micromanage the content of political and social reporting in the media, and it has opened the door for the media to pursue capitalist marketing practices that respond to customer wants and bring increasing financial independence from the State.

Other practices that are emerging in mainland China, such as [[decision making]] based on verifiable data and stronger quality controls on information, also have helped dilute the impact of ideology. In a change driven by the dual need for scientists to have reliable data with which to work and for the business sector to use in making investment and commercial decisions, the State Statistical Board since the mid-1980s has gained increased power to acquire and disseminate data for media and business use, reducing or eliminating the hither to common practice in which each sector used "its own" data.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Skepticism toward authority ===
Although difficult to quantify, growing skepticism toward authority in mainland China appears to be spurring public support for media [[criticism]] (often indirect and carefully couched) of the State and slowly diluting the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the party {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. This rise in skepticism is reported by informed observers to be occurring all across East Asia. Such observers point to increased publicity given to cases of official corruption, [[malfeasance]], and ineptness—along with broader declines in [[value (ethics)|social values]] such as civility and respect—as at least partly responsible for greater media and popular doubts about elected and appointed officials as compared to the past. At the same time, public skepticism of authority can and often does include skepticism toward the media themselves. Journalists, like individuals in other sectors of the mainland Chinese society, are far less willing than in the past to submit blindly to authority. Journalists were active participants in the 1989 demonstrations that culminated in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|events at Tiananmen Square]]. The Tiananmen episode made it all but impossible to reconcile the growing desire of mainland Chinese journalists for control over their own profession with the party's interest in not letting that happen.  There have even been occasional acts of open, outright defiance of the party, though these acts remain rare.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Hassid (2008), "China's Contentious Journalists: Reconceptualizing the Media."  ''Problems of Post-Communism'' 55(4), 52–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contact with the West ===
{{See also|Radio jamming in China}}
Closer and more varied contact with the West appears to be increasingly influencing educated urban opinion in mainland China on concepts such as a [[Freedom of the press|free press]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. This [[phenomenon]] is consistent with trends elsewhere in East Asia, where principles such as [[freedom of expression]] and legal guarantees of [[individual right]]s are playing a growing role. Many mainland Chinese journalists trained or educated in the West appear to have an outlook that is much closer to Western ideals of media freedom than to the attitudes of other Chinese, although a gap persists between mainland China and the West in professionalism and in grasping the principles of [[objective journalism]].

Virtually all foreign reporters in mainland China operate under restrictions that are considerably more severe than in most Asian countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} One result is that Western media influence on mainland Chinese media agencies as a whole is generally limited.

=== Market competition ===
Intense competition for the media market is among the most important factors behind the emergence of more diverse and autonomous media in China. As indicated earlier in this study, efforts by the Chinese media to respond to an increasingly demanding print and broadcast market have created an expanding spectrum of media products ranging from serious news journalism to purely entertainment stories. Monetary rewards for meeting such demands continue to grow, resulting in greater financial autonomy for the growing numbers of Chinese media firms that win sizeable market shares. As a result, these companies are able to hire and retain more and better journalists, further boosting their capacity to compete. Commercialization thus has been a major liberating force for the media in China. The [[regime]] is far less able than before to wield financial leverage over the media, which have increasingly become self-supporting through [[advertisement|advertising]] revenues and circulation. According to one estimate, advertising in all media forms increased 35-fold between 1981 and 1992. Print ad revenues jumped ten times between 1990 and 1995—from 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion yuan to 15&amp;nbsp;billion yuan.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Television revenues also are growing dramatically: they totaled about $2&amp;nbsp;billion in 1995 and are expected to rise above $6&amp;nbsp;billion by 2005. In 1995, China Central Television earned nearly $150&amp;nbsp;million in advertising revenue,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} covering almost 90 percent of its total costs. In the past, radio and television tended to run well behind the print press in their news coverage. More recently, television has come under market pressure to be as timely, informative, and responsive as the print media.

Competition from outside mainland China has further impelled domestic media groups to become more diverse, assertive, and skeptical of official authority. For example, in order to compete against Hong Kong radio stations that could be heard in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], Guangdong radio managers created Pearl River Economic Radio (PRER) in 1986. PRER, copying Hong Kong radio's approach, began to emphasize daily life, entertainment, "celebrity" [[deejay]]s, and caller phone-in segments, while eliminating ideological, preachy formats that included little information beyond what was provided by government sources. By 1987, PRER had obtained 55 percent of the Guangdong market; previously, Hong Kong radio stations had held 90 percent of this market. Local party cadre in southern China reportedly are unhappy about PRER, mainly because some of the station's commentators, as well as its talk radio programs, highlight party failures and the misdeeds of individual party members in the region.

The top national Chinese Communist Party papers (People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and Economic Daily)—which mostly feature party speeches, announcements, propaganda, and policy viewpoints—are steadily losing circulation and much-sought advertising revenues to evening municipal papers that have far more diverse content. For example, People's Daily's circulation fell from 3.1&amp;nbsp;million copies a day in 1990 to 2.2&amp;nbsp;million in 1995; the paper's 1994 advertising revenues were down as well. Moreover, its subscriptions consist overwhelmingly of mandatory ones by party and government agencies. Similarly, the Liberation Army Daily has become almost entirely dependent on State subsidies. Its circulation has fallen from 1.7&amp;nbsp;million in 1981 to fewer than 500,000 at present.

By contrast, the circulation of the Xinmin Evening News, operated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, has risen from 1.3&amp;nbsp;million to 1.7&amp;nbsp;million over the same time period. The Guangzhou Daily, owned by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, doubled its circulation in six years to 600,000 in 1994, and its ad revenues also were up.

=== Improvements in personnel ===
The media also have attracted and are retaining more competent people than before. Journalism is widely seen as a more promising career field than in the past, while government work has lost much of its allure as other opportunities open up. At the same time, the explosion of business and entrepreneurial opportunities in recent years has complicated efforts by both the media and the government to attract good people. Journalism and government both face stiff competition from the relatively high salaries and profits available in the business sector. But the rising popularity and profitability of [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] evening newspapers offer the prospect that higher quality, better paid jobs in journalism will expand in the years ahead.

Improved training, more education, and higher professional standards are bolstering the skills and confidence of journalists across East Asia, better positioning media outlets to gain positions of influence in their societies. Although mainland Chinese journalists only recently have begun to participate in these opportunities, there is some evidence that such training is having an effect. Many of the young mainland Chinese journalists being trained at US and other universities and professional programs in the West have been characterized by their trainers as "smart," "aware," and devoted to the profession.

Beginning in the 1980s, it became necessary in most cases for reporters to have a college education, and often a university degree, to get good jobs with the top party newspapers. The highly profitable evening papers, sponsored in the main by municipal governments, usually also require a college education.

==== Cable television ====
Residents of the Chinese mainland now receive more than 20 outside television channels by [[satellite]], including Chinese-language services of CNN, Star TV, and the United States Information Agency. In the southern province of Guangdong, 97 percent of the households have television sets, and all—except those in a few parts of the city of Guangzhou, where reception is poor—have access to Hong Kong television through cable networks. Some local stations even intercept the signals and insert their own commercials. Beijing is unable to effectively monitor, let alone control, the illicit cable operators who have sprung up since the early 1990s. As of 1995, about 1,000 of the 3,000 cable stations in mainland China, linked to perhaps 50&amp;nbsp;million homes, were unlicensed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==== Satellite dishes ====
The administration of satellite receivers falls under the jurisdiction of the State Administration for Radio, Film, and Television, which stipulates that foreign satellite televisions channels may only be received at high-end hotels and the homes and workplaces of foreigners. Foreign satellite televisions channels may seek approval to broadcast, but must be "friendly toward China." Foreign television news channels are, in theory, ineligible for distribution in China.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040623205930/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/exp/explaws.php#satforeignmeasures 'Measures on the Administration of Foreign Satellite Television Channel Reception'],  Aug 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Home satellite dishes are officially illegal. Black market satellite dishes are nonetheless prolific, numbering well into the tens of millions.&lt;ref&gt;PC World, [https://www.pcworld.com/article/194755/illegal_satellite_tv_in_china_brings_cnn_to_the_masses.html 'Illegal Satellite TV in China Brings CNN to the Masses'], April 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese authorities engage in regular crackdowns to confiscate and dismantle illicit dishes, expressing concerns both over the potential for copyright infringements and over their ability receive "reactionary propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Pang Geping, “China’s fight against the sale of illegal satellite receivers achieves significant results,” People’s Daily Online, Oct 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internet ====
{{internet}}
{{Main article|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China}}
Widening Chinese use of the Internet is also undercutting government efforts to control the flow of information. According to [[CNNIC]]'s 22nd Statistical Survey Report on the [[Internet in the People's Republic of China|Internet Development in China]], more than 250 million people in mainland China now have Internet access. &lt;!--and the figure is likely to surpass one billion within four years, according to a Chinese specialist on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Four years of when? Who?--&gt;

Since the beginning of 1996, the State has suspended all new applications from Internet service providers seeking to commence operations in the PRC; moved to put all existing Internet services under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Electronics Industry, and the State Education Commission; and attempted—without much success—to establish [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], limit the contents of [[home page]]s, and block access to certain Internet sites through [[routing]] filters. Although much of the Internet access in China is subjugate to the so-called "[[Great Firewall of China]]", which blacklists certain websites and even blocks chat sessions, it has proven relatively ineffective:{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} there are logistical problems with a firewall over such a large network, and in most instances its effects can be negated with a simple [[Proxy server|proxy]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Government officials are worried that, as the number of Chinese homes with telephone lines grows from the present level of less than 4%, the State will become totally unable to monitor Internet access at residences.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Communist Party control ==
Over the last decade, the ways in which the Chinese Communist Party does its business—especially the introduction of [[reform movement|reform]]s aimed at decentralizing power—have spurred greater media autonomy in several ways:

* The growth of "peripheral"—local and some regional—media. This trend has decentralized and dampened party oversight. In general, the greater the distance is between reporters and media outlets, and Beijing and important provincial capitals, the greater their leeway.
* A shift toward administrative and legal regulation of the media and away from more fluid and personal oversight. Party efforts to rely on regulations rather than whim to try to control the media—as evidenced by the dozens of directives set forth when the State Press and Publications Administration was created in 1987, and by new regulations in 1990 and 1994—probably were intended to tighten party control, making it a matter of law rather than personal relationships. In fact, however, these regulations came at a time when official resources were being stretched more thinly and individual officials were becoming less willing—and less able—to enforce regulations.
* Vicissitudes of media acceptability. Since the early 1990s, the types of media coverage deemed acceptable by the regime have risen sharply. Growing uncertainties about what is permissible and what is out of bounds sometimes work to the media's interests. Often, however, these uncertainties encourage greater self-censorship among Chinese journalists and work to the benefit of the party's media control apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Hassid (2008), "Controlling the Chinese Media: An Uncertain Business."  ''Asian Survey'' 48(3), 414–430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provincial broadcasters increasingly are trying to identify subjects on which the party will allow them more autonomy. Recent demands—unmet thus far—by such broadcasters include seeking authority to carry international news, to contract out television and radio programming to [[NGO]]s, and to explore possibilities for quasi-private media ownership.

As State resources have become stretched more thinly, the media have found it far easier than before to print and broadcast material that falls within vaguely defined [[wikt:grey area|grey areas]], though again, this uncertainty can also work to the advantage of the party.&lt;ref name="rowman.com"/&gt; Officials are too few, too busy, and often too incompetent to be able to micromanage the media as in the past. Prior to the 1990s, it was common for party and government officials to participate in the actual drafting of newspaper editorials. Now, for the most part, these officials merely discuss editorial policies with newspaper managers.

In the past, prime-time news on Chinese Central Television was routinely examined, prior to airing, by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. Since 1994, however, the Ministry has ceased to prescreen CCTV news programs; now the programs are examined after they have aired. The diversity and quantity of material, moreover, have compelled officials to prioritize their reviews of broadcasts; the 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm news broadcasts, for instance, receive far more attention from the authorities than does the midnight news. In another manifestation of weakening government controls, recently launched news programs such as CCTV's Focal Report and Beijing Television's Express News include moderate criticisms of the party and government and explore some controversial public topics in an effort to make programs relevant to—and more popular with—viewers.

Evidently acknowledging the limits on their ability to maintain tight control over an industry that has been expanding rapidly, party leaders during the last decade have publicly addressed the need to establish priorities. In particular, they have spoken of the high priority attached to maintaining control over the "big media"—national party papers and central and provincial TV and radio stations.

Many PRC officials appear anxious to avoid confronting the media because they are afraid they will be accused of transgressions in newspapers, in magazines, or on television or radio. As media autonomy has expanded, print and broadcast organs have tried to flex their independence, albeit cautiously, in their coverage of State activities. Such coverage often focuses on specific government officials suspected of illegal actions and corruption.

Although the media's leverage stems mostly from officials' worries that rival [[insider]]s will use such publicity against them, it also appears to reflect growing respect within Chinese officialdom for the emerging influence of public opinion. A case in point is the Beijing Youth Daily. This paper has been punished{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} for criticizing government actions and policies, but the authorities have stopped short of shutting it down.

=== Party resistance to media autonomy ===
Although the trend in mainland China clearly is toward greater media autonomy and diversity and away from government control and intimidation, crosscurrents of resistance persist. Powerful domestic institutions like the [[Central Propaganda Department]] and the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] still constrain efforts by the media to become more autonomous and politically diverse.&lt;ref name="rowman.com"/&gt;

=== Efforts to reinforce Party controls ===
Beijing still tries to compel the media to report positively on government activities and to limit negative coverage of official policies and actions.&lt;ref&gt;An, Alex and An, David, "Media control and the Erosion of an Accountable Party-State in China." ''China Brief'', October 7, 2008. [http://www.jamestown.org/china_brief/article.php?articleid=2374463]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|PRC Constitution]]—promulgated in 1982—nor the Communist Party-directed judiciary provides the media with meaningful legal protection from the State. Although Article 35 of the Constitution guarantees the citizens the rights of free speech, press, and assembly, in reality citizens do not have such rights. The authorities in Beijing continue to give precedence to the principles enunciated in the Constitution's preamble—including upholding Marxist–Leninist–Maoist thought and the party's leadership role.

The lack of an independent [[judiciary]] further hamstrings efforts by the media to mount court challenges against restrictions on media activities. The party appoints judges, and the position of the courts is merely equal to—not above—that of the [[bureaucracy]].  Media outrage over nationally publicized criminal cases can also bring pressure on members of the judiciary to act in ways that might be contrary to their initial desires and to the best interests of the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Liebman (2005), "Watchdog or Demagogue? The Media in the Chinese Legal System."  ''Columbia Law Review'' 105(1), 1–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government uses a variety of approaches to retain some control over the media:

* It requires that newspapers be registered and attached to a government ministry, institute, research facility, labor group, or other State-sanctioned entity. Entrepreneurs cannot establish newspapers or magazines under their own names, although they reportedly have had some success in setting up research institutes and then creating publications attached to those bodies.
* It still occasionally [[Prison|jail]]s or fines journalists for unfavorable reporting.
* It imposes other punishments when it deems that criticism has gone too far. For example, it shut down the magazine Future and Development in 1993 for publishing two articles calling for greater democracy in mainland China, and it forced the firing of the Beijing Youth Daily's editor for aggressively covering misdeeds and acts of poor judgment by party cadre.
* It continues to make clear that criticism of certain fundamental policies—such as those on PRC [[sovereignty]] over territories under [[Republic of China]] administration and [[Tibet]] and on Hong Kong's future in the wake of the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty on July 1, 1997&amp;nbsp;—are off limits.
* It has set up numerous official journalists' associations—the largest is the All-China Journalist Federation, with more than 400,000 members—so that no single entity can develop major autonomous power.
* It holds weekly meetings with top newspaper editors to direct them as to what news items they want focused upon and which stories they want to go unreported. The controversial closure of the [[Freezing Point (magazine)|Freezing Point]] journal was generally unreported in mainland China due to government orders.
* It has maintained a system of uncertainty surrounding the boundaries of acceptable reporting, encouraging self-censorship.  One media researcher has written that "it is the very arbitrariness of this control regime that cows most journalists into more conservative coverage."&lt;ref&gt;Hassid (2008), "Controlling the Chinese Media," p415.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also exploits a longstanding hierarchical relationship among Chinese print and broadcast entities in seeking to maintain some control over the media. It appoints the leaders of the most powerful media institutions, and then uses these entities to try to dominate the rest of the media countrywide.

== Official media channels ==
[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] (the New China News Agency) and [[People's Daily|''People's Daily'']], the two most important print media, have status as separate [[Ministry (government department)|government ministries]]; their directors sit on the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]]. Just below, hierarchically, are the two national newspapers under the control of the Propaganda Department&amp;nbsp;– the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]] and the English-language'' China Daily''. These entities have the rank of vice ministries, as does the State Council-controlled Economic Daily. The National Propaganda Department appoints publishers, chief editors, and other key officials of the above-mentioned newspapers—plus a few others—while provincial and local party leaders make similar appointments for party papers in their jurisdictions.

In many ways, Xinhua is the fuel propelling mainland China's print media. Perhaps unique in the world because of its role, size, and reach, Xinhua reports directly to the party's Propaganda Department; employs more than 10,000 people—as compared to about 1,300 for the UK's Reuters, for example; has 107 bureaus worldwide both collecting information on other countries and dispensing information about mainland China; and maintains 31 bureaus in China—one for each province plus a military bureau. In as much as most of the newspapers in mainland China cannot afford to station correspondents abroad—or even in every province in mainland China—they rely on Xinhua feeds to fill their pages. People's Daily, for example, uses Xinhua material for approximately 25 percent of its stories.(b) Xinhua is a publisher as well as a news agency—it owns more than 20 newspapers and a dozen magazines, and it prints in Chinese, English, and four other languages.

Like other government entities, Xinhua is feeling the pinch of reduced State financial subsidies. Beijing has been cutting funding to the news agency by an average of seven percent per year over the past three years, and State funds currently cover only about 40 percent of Xinhua's costs. As a result, the agency is raising revenues through involvement in public relations, construction, and information service businesses.

In the past, Xinhua was able to attract the top young journalists emerging from the universities or otherwise newly entering the field, but it can no longer do so as easily because of the appeal and resources of other newspapers and periodicals and the greater glamour of television and radio jobs. For example, midlevel reporters for the Xinmin Evening News often are given an apartment, whereas at Xinhua and People's Daily this benefit is reserved for the most senior journalists.

Like many other media groups, Xinhua struggled to find the "right line" to use in covering the Tiananmen Square events of April–June 1989. Although more cautious than People's Daily in its treatment of sensitive topics during that period—such as how to commemorate reformist Communist Party leader [[Hu Yaobang]]'s April 1989 death, the then ongoing [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in Beijing and elsewhere, and basic questions of press freedom and individual rights—Xinhua gave some positive coverage to demonstrators and intellectuals who were questioning top party leaders. Even so, many Xinhua reporters were angry with top editors for not going far enough and for suppressing stories about the Tiananmen Square crackdown. For several days after the violence on June 4, almost no one at Xinhua did any work, and journalists demonstrated inside the Agency's Beijing compound.

=== The role of the PRC internal media ===
The mainland Chinese media's internal publication system, in which certain journals are published exclusively for government and party officials, provides information and analysis not generally available to the public. The State values these internal reports because they contain much of mainland China's most sensitive, controversial, and high-quality investigative journalism.

Xinhua and many other media agencies produce reports for the "internal" journals ([[neican]]s). Informed observers note that journalists generally like to write for the internal publications—typically, only the most senior or most capable print and broadcast reporters are given such opportunities—because they can write less polemical and more comprehensive stories without having to omit unwelcome details as is commonly done in the print media directed to the general public. A Chinese historian has claimed, as an example of such [[self-censorship]], that only a minority of China's population are aware 30 million people starved to death in the early 1960s, because the Party has never allowed the subject to be openly explored in the media. At the time, one of the Top Secret information channels through which news of what was really happening reached a select readership of high-level decision-makers was the Ministry of Public Security's [[Public Security Work Bulletin]].

The [[PRC internal media]] publication system follows a strict hierarchical pattern designed to facilitate party control. A publication called Reference Information (Cankao Ziliao)—which includes translated articles from abroad as well as news and commentary by senior Xinhua reporters—is delivered by Xinhua personnel, rather than by the national mail system, to officials at the working level and above. A three-to-ten-page report called Internal Reference (Neibu Cankao) is distributed to officials at the ministerial level and higher. The most highly classified Xinhua internal reports, known as "redhead reference" (Hong Tou Cankao) reports, are issued occasionally to the top dozen or so party and government officials.

[[He Qinglian]] documents in chapter four of ''Media Control in China'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrichina.org/public/contents/article?revision%5fid=29582&amp;item%5fid=29576 Media Control in China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313020226/http://hrichina.org/public/contents/article?revision_id=29582&amp;item_id=29576 |date=2007-03-13 }} published in Chinese in 2004 by Human Rights in China, New York. Revised edition 2006 published by Liming Cultural Enterprises of Taiwan. Accessed February 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many grades and types of internal documents [neibu wenjian 内部文件].  Many are restricted to a certain level of official&amp;nbsp;– such as county level, provincial level or down to a certain level of official in a ministry. Some Chinese journalists, including Xinhua correspondents in foreign countries, write for both the mass media and the internal media. The level of classification is tied to the administrative levels of Party and government in China.  The higher the administrative level of the issuing office, generally the more secret the document is.  In local government the issuing grades are province [sheng 省], region (or city directly subordinate to a province) [diqu 地区or shengzhixiashi 省直辖市] and county [xian 县]; grades within government organs are ministry [bu 部], bureau [ju 局] and office [chu 处]; in the military corps ([jun 军], division [shi 师], and regiment [tuan 团]. The most authoritative documents are drafted by the Central Committee to convey instructions from CCP leaders.  Documents with Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Document [Zhonggong Zhongyang Wenjian 中共中央文件] at the top in red letters are the most authoritative.

There are signs the PRC internal media publication system is breaking down as more information becomes widely available in mainland China. A Hong Kong-based political journal circulated on the Chinese mainland has questioned the need for such a system in light of mainland China's modern telecommunications and expanding contacts with the outside world. Internal publications are becoming less exclusive; some are now being sold illegally on the street and are increasingly available to anyone with money.

Some of the internal publications have changed substantially in an effort to avoid becoming [[obsolete]]. For example, the publication News Front—started in 1957 as a weekly tool for the Communist Party to instruct journalists on what to write—no longer was limited to that function when it reappeared after the Cultural Revolution. It continued to change gradually and is now a monthly publication that serves as a professional rather than political guide for journalists.

==International operations==
As of 2012 CCTV and Xinhua had greatly expanded international coverage and operations particularly in Africa.&lt;ref name=NYT81612 &gt;{{cite news|title=Pursuing Soft Power, China Puts Stamp on Africa’s News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/africa/chinas-news-media-make-inroads-in-africa.html|accessdate=August 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 2012|author=Andrew Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medieval pageant''' is a form of [[procession]] traditionally associated with both [[secular]] and religious [[ritual]]s, often with a narrative structure. Pageantry was an important aspect of [[medieval]] European seasonal festivals, in particular around the celebration of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], which began after the thirteenth century. This festival reenacted the entire history of the world, in processional performance, from [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to the [[Apocalypse]], employing hundreds of performers and mobile scenic elements. Plays were performed on mobile stages, called waggons, that traveled through towns so plays could be watched consecutively. Each waggon was sponsored by a [[guild]] who wrote, designed, and acted in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;James, Mervyn. "Ritual Drama in the Late Medieval English Town". ''Past &amp; Present''. No. 98 (Feb., 1983), pp. 3-29
Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pageants in the [[Christian world]] have centered on Saints' festivals, [[Carnival]] (Mardi Gras), and [[Easter]], while vernacular agrarian festivals have celebrated seasonal events such as the harvest, and the [[Midsummer's Night|Summer]] and [[Winter solstice#History and cultural significance|Winter]] solstices.

Drawing on this medieval tradition contemporary artists such as [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], the [[Welfare State International|Welfare State]], [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]], [[Spiral Q Puppet Theater|Spiral Q]], and [[Superior Concept Monsters]] have used pageants as a potent community-based performance form.

'''Music in [[Varanasi]]''' is a tradition linked to the ancient times of the [[Puranas|Pauranic]] legends. Lord [[Shiva]], who is reported to have established this city, was credited with developing music and dance forms. Legend also attributes that [[Renu]], son of sage [[Vishvamitra]] and [[Mahagobind]], was the precursors of music tradition in [[Varanasi|Kashi]] (Varanasi) when nymphs ([[Apsaras]]), [[Gandharvas]] and [[Kinnaras]] were the traditional practitioners of this art form, and saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] and [[Vallabhacharya]] were the pioneers in spreading this music tradition in Varanasi.&lt;ref name=Music&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.varanasicity.com/varanasi-music.html|title=Varanasi Music|accessdate=30 May 2013|publisher=Varanasi City.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable musicians of Varanasi include the iconic sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]], the Shehnai maestro [[Bismillah Khan]] and singer [[Girija Devi]]. Varanasi has joined the global bandwagon of UNESCO "Cities of Music" under the Creative Cities Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/creative-cities-map&lt;/ref&gt; Varanasi chosen in music category of creative cities network clearly signifies the rich musical heritage of this ancient city.

==History==
{{Double image|right| ShriGuruRavidasJikijai.png|200|Gosvami Tulsidas II.jpg|225|Left: [[Ravidas]] propounded Ravidassia religious movement; right: Gosvami [[Tulsidas]].}}
Archeological finds of figurines of [[apsara]]s playing musical instruments indicate that music has long been important to Varanasi.&lt;ref name=Music/&gt; In medieval times, the [[Bhakti movement#Vaishnava Bhakti|Vaishnava Bhakthi movement]] swept through the country. Literature attests to the fact that the [[Kingdom of Kashi]] centering on Varanasi was a major centre for music. The noted saint musicians were [[Surdas]], [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Meera]] and [[Tulsidas]].&lt;ref name=Music/&gt;

The music culture of devotional music permeated in Varanasi during the neo-[[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] movement when holy men singing devotional songs attracted people to the fold of the Bhakthi movement.&lt;ref name="Maheswar1980"&gt;{{cite book|first=Neg |last=Maheswar|title=Early History of the Vaiṣṇava Faith and Movement in Assam: Śaṅkaradeva and His Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcReZM-rI0MC&amp;pg=PA276|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|isbn=978-81-208-0007-6|pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the monarchic rule of [[Govind Chandra]] in the 16th century, the [[Dhrupad]] style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as [[Dhamar (music)|Dhamar]], [[Hori (music)|Hori]] and [[Chaturanga]]. Under Muslim rulers, the [[Nawab of Awadh]], the Nirgun singers of Kashi not only popularized the [[Asavari|Assarwari]], "Ghunghat ke pat Khol" song but also popularized the singing concerts such as festivals on the boats floating on the Ganges River. Some of the popular festivals were Jhoola, Jhoomar, Kajri, Birha, Dangal and Gulab Bari, a tradition which is continued even today. One of the singing styles made popular by Muslim artists [[Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori|Shori Miyan]], Gammu Khan and Shade Khan during this time was the [[Tappa]] form of singing.&lt;ref name=Music/&gt;

In recent times, the tutelary head, the Maharajas of Kashi of Varanasi, particularly Maharaj [[Prabhu Narayan Singh]], have patronized music. During the [[Mughal Empire|Moghal Emperor]] [[Bahadur Shah II]]'s reign, the noted musicians were Waris Ali, Akbar Ali, Nisar Khan, Sadiq Ali and Ashiq Ali Khan. Ali Mohammad and Ali Bux, the sons of Basat Khan, who were hailed as the "jewels" of the Royal court of Kashi. During this time, the local music styles which developed were the Banarasi Thumri, Dadra, Chaiti, Hori, Bhairavi, Kajri, Tarana, Ghato and many more. In addition, new forms were created such as Tirwat, Sadra, Khamsa, Lavni, Chaturang, Sargam, Ragmala, Kirtan, Qauwali, Kathagayan, Bhajan and Ramayan kirtan.&lt;ref name=Music/&gt; Two hundred years ago, Pandit Ram Sahai developed the [[Benares gharana]] of the [[tabla]], and within this genre, the notable musicians include [[Kishan Maharaj]], [[Samta Prasad]], [[Kumar Bose]], and Samar Saha.&lt;ref name=Out2010 /&gt; A class of musicians, ''[[gandharva]]'', train their daughters in music and dancing.&lt;ref name="Shastri1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shastri|first=A.M.|title=India As Seen in the Kuttanimata of Damodara Gupta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=979BKkAiQowC&amp;pg=PA217|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishing|isbn=978-81-208-1336-6|pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varanasi School of Music that has evolved is very similar to the [[Lucknow]] style ([[gharana]]) of music and has also imbued local folk traditions of ''[[chaiti]]'' and ''[[kajri]]''. This form of music spread quickly. Shankara Deva, a devotional music singer saint in his own right, was instrumental in composing [[Bhakti|Bhakthi]] songs.&lt;ref name="Deva1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bigamudre C. Deva|title=Indian music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-XKAfoa8WMC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Indian Council for Cultural Relations|isbn=978-81-224-0730-3|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biajis, a courtesan sect of Varanasi, are credited with maintaining and contributing to the traditions of Hindustani music and dance in Varanasi.{{Sfn|BruynBain|2010|p=211}}

'''Outset Media Corporation''' is a Canadian company which develops and distributes family entertainment products, specializing in [[board games]], [[party games]], [[card games]], and [[jigsaw puzzles]].  In addition to developing its own games, Outset Media also distributes games and puzzles in Canada for United States-based companies.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1996 by 23-year-old university student David Manga, originally with the sole purpose of publishing and distributing a single board game called All Canadian Trivia.  Development of the product was 16 months.  The original edition of All Canadian Trivia was released in May 1997.  While the Original edition went on to become a Canadian bestseller - breaking 100,000 copies sold in Canada, the French edition was a flop and sold less than 3,000 copies.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.buycanadianfirst.ca/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Member-Spotlight-Outset-Media.html&amp;Itemid=51 "Member Spotlight"], Buy Canadian First, March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited print-run Millennium Edition of All Canadian Trivia was released in 1999.  The game's creator embarked on a two-month [[guerilla marketing]] campaign across Canada to promote the game.  David Manga was selected as one of a hundred young Canadians to watch in the new millennium by [[Maclean's]] magazine.

In 2002, Outset Media nearly closed its doors after its largest customer, Stewart House Publishing, a former gift division of book publisher [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]], ran into financial difficulties and went into bankruptcy.  With nearly 50% of its annual revenue in bad debt and unrecoverable, Outset Media was bailed out with angel investments from family members and financing from the [[Royal Bank of Canada]].  Later that year, Outset Media added a new division, distributing other companies' games in Canada, when it began to distribute the line of "opoly" games from US-based [[Late for the Sky Production Company|Late for the Sky]].

In 2003, Outset Media made its first appearance on the Profit magazine's annual ranking of Canada's Fastest-Growing Companies.  The company would appear on the Profit 100 list for six consecutive years from 2003 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;ProfitGuide. "The Next 100". Profit Magazine, 2003, pp. 94, 96; 2005, p. 96; 2006, p. 106; 2008, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pastoral Landscape by Alvan Fisher, 1854.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Alvan Fisher]], ''Pastoral Landscape'', 1854]]

A '''pastoral''' lifestyle (see [[pastoralism]]) is that of shepherds [[herd]]ing livestock around open areas of [[Landscape|land]] according to [[season]]s and the changing availability of water and pasture. It lends its name to a [[genre]] of literature, art, and music that depicts such life in an idealized manner, typically for [[Urban culture|urban audiences]]. A ''pastoral'' is a work of this [[genre]], also known as '''bucolic''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|βουκολικόν}}, from {{lang|grc|βουκόλος}}, meaning a [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|boukoliko/s|βουκολικόν|ref}}. {{LSJ|bouko/los|βουκόλος|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bucolic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoral literature==

===Pastoral literature in general===
Pastoral is a [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of literature in which the author employs various techniques to place the complex life into a simple one.  Paul Alpers distinguishes pastoral as a mode rather than a genre, and he bases this distinction on the recurring attitude of power; that is to say that pastoral literature holds a humble perspective toward nature.  Thus, pastoral as a mode occurs in many types of literature (poetry, drama, etc.) as well as genres (most notably the pastoral elegy).

Terry Gifford, a prominent literary theorist, defines pastoral in three ways in his critical book ''Pastoral''. The first way emphasizes the historical literary perspective of the pastoral in which authors recognize and discuss life in the country and in particular the life of a shepherd.&lt;ref name = Gifford1-12&gt;{{cite book |last=Gifford |first=Terry |title=Pastoral |location=London; New York |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |series=The New Critical Idiom |isbn=0415147328 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is summed up by [[Leo Marx]] with the phrase "No shepherd, no pastoral."&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt; The second type of the pastoral is literature that "describes the country with an implicit or explicit contrast to the urban."&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt; The third type of pastoral depicts the country life with derogative classifications.&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt;

[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' presents a 'golden age' when people lived together  in harmony with nature. This [[Golden Age]] shows that even before [[Alexandria]], ancient Greeks had sentiments of an ideal pastoral life that they had already lost. This is the first example of literature that has pastoral sentiments and may have begun the pastoral tradition. [[Ovid's Metamorphoses]] is much like the ''Works and Days'' with the description of ages (golden, silver, brazen, iron and human) but with more ages to discuss and less emphasis on the gods and their punishments. In this artificially constructed world, nature acts as the main punisher. Another example of this perfect relationship between man and nature is evident in the encounter of a shepherd and a goatherd who meet in the pastures in [[Theocritus]]' poem ''Idylls 1''.
Traditionally, pastoral refers to the lives of herdsmen in a romanticized, exaggerated, but representative way.  In [[literature]], the adjective 'pastoral' refers to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside among [[shepherd]]s, [[Pastoral farming|cowherds]] and other farm workers that are often [[romanticism|romanticized]] and depicted in a highly unrealistic manner. The pastoral life is usually characterized as being closer to the [[Golden age]] than the rest of human life. The setting is a [[Locus Amoenus]], or a beautiful place in nature, sometimes connected with images of the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year,'' p 96, {{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of the use of the genre is the short poem by the 15th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[makar]] [[Robert Henryson]] ''[[Robene and Makyne]]'' which also contains the conflicted emotions often present in the genre. A more tranquil mood is set by [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s well known lines from ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'':

:''Come live with me and be my Love,''
:''And we will all the pleasures prove''
:''That hills and valleys, dale and field,''
:''And all the craggy mountains yield."

:''There will we sit upon the rocks''
:''And see the shepherds feed their flocks,''
:''By shallow rivers, to whose falls''
:''Melodious birds sing madrigals.''

"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love" exhibits the concept of Gifford's second definition of pastoral. The speaker of the poem, who is the titled shepherd, draws on the idealization of urban material pleasures to win over his love rather than resorting to the simplified pleasures of pastoral ideology. This can be seen in the listed items: "lined slippers," "purest gold," "silver dishes," and "ivory table" (lines 13, 15, 16, 21, 23). The speaker takes on a voyeuristic point of view with his love, and they are not directly interacting with the other true shepherds and nature.

Pastoral shepherds and maidens usually have [[Greek language|Greek]] names like [[Corydon (character)|Corydon]]  or Philomela, reflecting the origin of the pastoral genre. Pastoral poems are set in beautiful rural landscapes, the literary term for which is "locus amoenus" (Latin for "beautiful place"), such as [[Arcadia]], a rural region of [[Greece]], mythological home of the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], which was portrayed as a sort of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] by the poets.  The tasks of their employment with sheep and other rustic chores is held in the fantasy to be almost wholly undemanding and is left in the background, abandoning the shepherdesses and their swains in a state of almost perfect [[leisure]].  This makes them available for embodying perpetual [[erotica|erotic]] fantasies.  The shepherds spend their time chasing pretty girls &amp;mdash; or, at least in the Greek and Roman versions, pretty lads as well.  The eroticism of [[Virgil]]'s second [[eclogue]], ''Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin'' ("The shepherd Corydon burned with passion for pretty Alexis") is entirely [[homosexual]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goethe Yearbook|last=Richter|first=Simon|publisher=Camden House|year=2008|isbn=9781571133144|location=Suffolk|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Pastoral poetry===
[[File:Meister des Vergilius Romanus 001.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Georgics]] Book III, ''Shepherd with Flocks'', [[Vergil]] ([[Vatican Library]])]]
Pastoral literature continued after Hesiod with the [[poetry]] of the [[Hellenistic]] Greek [[Theocritus]], several of whose ''Idylls'' are set in the countryside (probably reflecting the landscape of the island of [[Kos|Cos]] where the poet lived) and involve dialogues between herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction (p.14) to Virgil: ''The Eclogues'' trans. Guy Lee (Penguin Classics)&lt;/ref&gt; Theocritus may have drawn on authentic folk traditions of Sicilian shepherds. He wrote in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] but the metre he chose was the [[dactylic hexameter]] associated with the most prestigious form of Greek poetry, [[Epic poetry|epic]]. This blend of simplicity and sophistication would play a major part in later pastoral verse. Theocritus was imitated by the Greek poets [[Bion of Smyrna|Bion]] and [[Moschus]].

The Roman poet [[Virgil]] adapted pastoral into Latin with his highly influential ''[[Eclogues]]''.  Virgil introduces two very important uses of pastoral, the contrast between urban and rural lifestyles and political allegory&lt;ref&gt;Article on "Bucolic poetry" in ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in Eclogues 1 and 4 respectively.  In doing so, Virgil presents a more idealized portrayal of the lives of shepherds while still employing the traditional pastoral conventions of Theocritus.  He was the first to set his poems in Arcadia, an idealized location to which much later pastoral literature will refer.

[[Horace]]'s The [[Epodes]], ii Country Joys has "the dreaming man" Alfius, who dreams of escaping his busy urban life for the peaceful country. But as "the dreaming man" indicates, this is just a dream for Alfius. He is too consumed in his career as a [[usurer]] to leave it behind for the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/HoraceEpodesAndCarmenSaeculare.htm#_Toc98670050 Horace's ''Delights of the Country'' Epode ii] Retrieved October 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Silver Latin]] poets who wrote pastoral poetry, modeled principally upon Virgil's Eclogues, include [[Titus Calpurnius Siculus|Calpurnius Siculus]] and [[Nemesianus]] and the author(s) of the [[Einsiedeln Eclogues]].

Italian poets revived the pastoral from the 14th century onwards, first in Latin (examples include works by [[Petrarch]], [[Pontano]] and [[Baptista Mantuanus|Mantuan]]) then in the Italian vernacular ([[Jacopo Sannazaro|Sannazaro]], [[Boiardo]]). The fashion for pastoral spread throughout Renaissance Europe. In Spain, [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] was an important pioneer and his motifs find themselves renewed in the 20th-century Spanish-language poet [[Giannina Braschi]].  Leading French pastoral poets include [[Clément Marot|Marot]] and [[Pierre Ronsard|Ronsard]].
[[File:Blake shepherd.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist, illustrator and poet William Blake's hand painted print illustrating his pastoral poem "[[The Shepherd (Blake)|The Shepherd]]" depicts the pastoral scene of a shepherd watching his flock with a shepherd's crook. This image represents copy B, printed and painted in 1789 and currently held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=s-inn.b.illbk.04&amp;java=no | title = Songs of Innocence, copy B, object 4 (Bentley 5, Erdman 5, Keynes 5) "The Shepherd"| editors =Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi | publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| accessdate = January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first pastorals in English were the ''[[Eclogues]]'' (c. 1515) of [[Alexander Barclay]], which were heavily influenced by [[Mantuan]]. A landmark in English pastoral poetry was [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]’s ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'', first published in 1579. Spenser's work consists of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year, and is written in dialect. It contains [[elegy|elegies]], [[fable]]s and a discussion of the role of poetry in contemporary England. Spenser and his friends appear under various pseudonyms (Spenser himself is "Colin Clout"). Spenser's example was imitated by such poets as [[Michael Drayton]] (''Idea, The Shepherd's Garland'') and [[William Browne (poet)|William Browne]] (''Britannia's Pastorals''). During this period of England's history, many authors explored "anti-pastoral" themes. Two examples of this is [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s “The Twenty-Third Psalm” and “The Nightingale” focus on the world in a very anti-pastoral view. In “The Twenty-Third Psalm,” Nature is portrayed as something we need to be protected from, and in “The Nightingale,” the woe of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] is compared to the speaker's own pain. Additionally, he wrote ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' which is filled with pastoral descriptions of the landscape. "[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]" (1600) by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] also comments on the anti-pastoral as the nymph responds realistically to the idealizing shepherd of ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'' by embracing and explaining the true course of nature and its incompatibility with the love that the Shepherd yearns for with the nymph.

In the 17th century came the arrival of the [[Country house poem]]. Included in this genre is [[Aemilia Lanyer]]’s ''The Description of Cooke-ham'' in 1611, in which a woman is described in terms of her relationship to her estate and how it mourns for her when she leaves it.  In 1616, [[Ben Jonson]] wrote ''To Penshurst,'' a poem in which he addresses the estate owned by the Sidney family and tells of its beauty. The basis of the poem is a harmonious and joyous elation of the memories that Jonson had at the manor. It is beautifully written with iambic pentameter, a style that Jonson so eloquently uses to describe the culture of Penshurst.  It is very important to note the insertion of Pan and Bacchus as notable company of the manor. Pan, Greek god of the Pastoral world, half man and half goat, was connected with both hunting and shepherds; [[Bacchus]] was the god of wine, intoxication and ritual madness.  This reference to Pan and Bacchus in a pastoral view demonstrates how prestigious Penshurst was, to be worthy in the company with gods, notions of just how romanticized the estate was.

"A Country Life", another 17th-century work by [[Katherine Philips]], was also a country house poem. Philips focuses on the joys of the countryside and looks upon the lifestyle that accompanies it as being  "the first and happiest life, when man enjoyed himself."  She writes about maintaining this lifestyle by living detached from material things, and by not over-concerning herself with the world around her.  [[Andrew Marvell]]'s "[[Upon Appleton House]]" was written when Marvell was working as a tutor for Lord Fairfax's daughter Mary, in 1651.  The poem is very rich with metaphors that relate to religion, politics and history.  Similar to Jonson's "To Penshurst", Marvell's poem is describing a pastoral estate.  It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future.  Marvell used nature as a thread to weave together a poem centered around man.  We once again see nature fully providing for man.  Marvell also continuously compares nature to art and seems to point out that art can never accomplish on purpose what nature can achieve accidentally or spontaneously.

[[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'s ''The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home'' was also written in the 17th century. In this pastoral work, he paints the reader a colorful picture of the benefits reaped from hard work.  This is an atypical interpretation of the pastoral, given that there is a celebration of labor involved as opposed to central figures living in leisure and nature just taking its course independently.  This poem was mentioned in [[Raymond Williams]]', ''The Country and the City''.  This acknowledgment of Herrick's work is appropriate, as both Williams and Herrick accentuate the importance of labor in the pastoral lifestyle.

The [[pastoral elegy]] is a subgenre that uses pastoral elements to lament a death or loss. The most famous pastoral elegy in English is [[John Milton]]'s "[[Lycidas]]" (1637), written on the death of Edward King, a fellow student at Cambridge University. Milton used the form both to explore his vocation as a writer and to attack what he saw as the abuses of the Church. Also included is [[Thomas Gray]]'s, "Elegy on a Country Churchyard" (1750).

The formal English pastoral continued to flourish during the 18th century, eventually dying out at the end. One notable example of an 18th-century work is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Pastorals'' (1709). In this work Pope imitates [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''Shepheardes Calendar'', while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with [[Virgil]]. In 1717, Pope's ''Discourse on Pastoral Poetry'' was published as a preface to ''Pastorals.'' In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Phillips.  During this time period [[Ambrose Phillips]], who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the Native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man.  He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature.  As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature.  [[John Gay]], who came a little later was criticized for his poem's artificiality by [[Samuel Johnson|Doctor Johnson]] and attacked for their lack of realism by [[George Crabbe]], who attempted to give a true picture of rural life in his poem ''The Village.''

In 1590, Edmund Spenser also composed a very famous pastoral epic called ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', in which he employs the pastoral mode to accentuate the charm, lushness, and splendor of the poem's (super)natural world.  Spenser alludes to the pastoral continuously throughout the work and also uses it to create allegory in his poem, with the characters as well as with the environment, both of which are meant to have symbolic meaning in the real world.  It is composed of six books but Spenser intended to write twelve.  He wrote the poem primarily to honor [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]]. [[William Cowper]] addressed the artificiality of the fast-paced city life in his poems ''Retirement'' (1782) and ''The Winter Nosegay'' (1782). Pastoral nevertheless survived as a mood rather than a genre, as can be seen from such works as [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''Thyrsis'' (1867), a lament on the death of his fellow poet [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]. [[Robert Burns]] can be read as a Pastoral poet for his nostalgic portrayals of rural Scotland and simple farm life in ''To A Mouse'' and ''The Cotter's Saturday Night''. Burns explicitly addresses the Pastoral form in his ''Poem on Pastoral Poetry''. In this he champions his fellow Scot [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsey]] as the best Pastoral poet since [[Theocritus]].

Another subgenre is the Edenic Pastoral, which alludes to the perfect relationship between God, man, and nature in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It typically includes biblical symbols and imagery. In 1645 John Milton wrote ''[[L'Allegro]]'', which translates as the happy person. It is a celebration of [[Gladness|Mirth]] personified, who is the child of love and revelry. It was originally composed to be a companion poem to, ''[[Il Penseroso]]'', which celebrates a life of melancholy and solitude. Milton's, ''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]'' (1629) blends Christian and pastoral imagery.

====Pastoral epic====
Milton is perhaps best known for his epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', one of the few Pastoral epics ever written. A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan’s trespass into paradise. Milton’s iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan’s perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of [[Adam and Eve]]’s pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve's care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to Satan, constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience’s understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‘truths’ they hold for themselves.

===Pastoral romances===
Italian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose. Although there was no classical precedent for the form, it drew some inspiration from ancient Greek novels set in the countryside, such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]''. The most influential Italian example of the form was [[Sannazzaro]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1504). The vogue for the pastoral romance spread throughout Europe producing such notable works as [[Bernardim Ribeiro]] "Menina e Moça" (1554) in Portuguese,&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Charles Dudley|title=A Library of the World's Best Literature - Ancient and Modern - Vol.XLIII|year=2008|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=1-60520-251-7|pages=456|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6k3F_89oyEC&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=bernardim%20ribeiro%20pastoral%20romance%20menina%20e%20mo%C3%A7a&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge de Montemayor|Montemayor]]'s [[Diana (pastoral romance)|''Diana'']] (1559) in Spain, [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1590) in England, and [[Honoré d'Urfé]]'s ''Astrée'' (1607–27) in France.

===Pastoral plays===
[[File:John Reinhard Weguelin – A Pastoral (1905).jpg|thumb|275px|&lt;center&gt;''A Pastoral'' (watercolour, 1905)&lt;br&gt;by [[John Reinhard Weguelin]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Pastoral drama also emerged in Renaissance Italy. Again, there was little Classical precedent, with the possible exception of Greek [[satyr play]]s. [[Poliziano]]'s ''Orfeo'' (1480) shows the beginnings of the new form, but it reached its zenith in the late 16th century with [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Aminta]]'' (1573), [[Isabella Andreini]]'s ''Mirtilla'' (1588), and [[Giambattista Guarini|Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' (1590). [[John Lyly]]'s ''Endimion'' (1579) brought the Italian-style pastoral play to England. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''The Sad Shepherd''  and Sidney's ''[[The Lady of May]]'' are later examples. Some of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays contain pastoral elements, most notably ''[[As You Like It]]'' (whose plot was derived from [[Thomas Lodge]]'s pastoral romance ''Rosalynde'') and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', of which Act 4 Scene 4 is a lengthy pastoral digression.

The forest in ''As You Like It'' can be seen as a place of pastoral idealization, where life is simpler and purer, and its inhabitants live more closely to each other, nature and God than their urban counterparts. However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate pastoralism. His protagonists [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] and [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]] metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love. She is the only character throughout the play who embraces and appreciates both the real and idealized life and manages to make the two ideas coexist. Therefore, Shakespeare explores city and country life as being appreciated through the coexistence of the two.

==Pastoral music==
Theocritus's ''Idylls'' include strophic songs and musical laments, and, as in [[Homer]], his shepherds often play the [[syrinx]], or [[Pan flute]], considered a quintessentially pastoral instrument. Virgil's ''Eclogues'' were performed as sung mime in the 1st century, and there is evidence of the pastoral song as a legitimate genre of classical times.

The pastoral genre was a significant influence in the development of [[opera]]. After settings of pastoral poetry in the [[pastourelle]] genre by the [[troubadour]]s, Italian poets and composers became increasingly drawn to the pastoral. Musical settings  of pastoral poetry became increasingly common in first polyphonic and then [[monodic]] [[madrigal]]s: these later led to the [[cantata]] and the [[serenata]], in which pastoral themes remained on a consistent basis. Partial musical settings of [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' were highly popular: the texts of over 500 madrigals were taken from this one play alone. [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''Aminta'' was also a favourite. As [[opera]] developed, the dramatic pastoral came to the fore with such works as [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Dafne]]'' and, most notably, [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]''. Pastoral opera remained popular throughout the 17th-century, and not just in Italy, as is shown by the French genre of ''[[pastorale héroïque]]'', Englishman [[Henry Lawes]]'s music for [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (not to mention [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]''), and Spanish [[zarzuela]]. At the same time, Italian and German composers developed a genre of vocal and instrumental pastorals, distinguished by certain stylistic features, associated with Christmas Eve.

The pastoral, and parodies of the pastoral, continued to play an important role in musical history throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. [[John Gay]] may have satirized the pastoral in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', but also wrote an entirely sincere libretto for [[Handel]]'s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]''. [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Le Devin du village]]'' draws on pastoral roots, and [[Metastasio]]'s libretto ''[[Il re pastore]]'' was set over 30 times, most famously by [[Mozart]]. [[Rameau]] was an outstanding exponent of French pastoral opera.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cuthbert Girdlestone]], ''Jean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work'', particularly p.377 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beethoven]] also wrote his famous [[Pastoral Symphony]], avoiding his usual musical dynamism in favour of relatively slow rhythms. More concerned with psychology than description, he labelled the work "more the expression of feeling than [realistic] painting". The pastoral also appeared as a feature of [[grand opera]], most particularly in Meyerbeer's operas: often composers would develop a pastoral-themed "oasis", usually in the centre of their work. Notable examples include the shepherd's "alte Weise" from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''. The 20th-century continued to bring new pastoral interpretations, particularly in ballet, such as Ravel's ''Daphis and Chloe'', Nijinsky's use of Debussy's ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', and [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Le sacre du printemps]]'' and ''Les Noces''.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: [[Geoffrey Chew (musicologist)|Geoffrey Chew]] and Owen Jander (2001).

The [[Pastorale]] is a form of [[Italian folk music|Italian folk song]] still played in the regions of Southern Italy where the [[zampogna]] continues to thrive. They generally sound like a slowed down version of a [[tarantella]], as they encompass many of the same melodic phrases. The pastorale on the zampogna can be played by a solo zampogna player, or in some regions can be accompanied by the piffero (also commonly called a [[ciaramella]], 'pipita', or [[bifora]]), which is a primitive key-less double reed [[oboe]] type instrument.

==Pastoral art==
{{main|commons:Category:Shepherds in art}}
Idealised pastoral landscapes appear in Hellenistic and Roman wall paintings. Interest in the pastoral as a subject for art revived in Renaissance Italy, partly inspired by the descriptions of pictures Sannazzaro included in his ''Arcadia''. The ''Fête champêtre'' (''Pastoral Symphony'') attributed to [[Giorgione]] is perhaps the most famous painting in this style. Later, French artists were also attracted to the pastoral, notably [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], [[Poussin]] (e.g. [[Et in Arcadia ego]]) and [[Watteau]] (in his ''Fêtes galantes'').&lt;ref&gt;Article on "Pastoral" in ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (ed. H. Osborne)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Cole]] has a series of paintings titled ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', and the second of these paintings (shown on the right) depicts the perfect pastoral setting.

==Pastoral theory==
In the past four hundred years, a range of writers have worked on theorizing the nature of pastoral.  These include [[Friedrich Schiller]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schiller, ''On Naive and Sentimental Poetry'' (1795).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Puttenham]],&lt;ref name="English Poesie 1589"&gt;[[George Puttenham]], ''Arte of English Poesie'' (1589).&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Empson]],&lt;ref&gt;William Empson, ''Some Versions of Pastoral.'' (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Kermode]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode, ''English Pastoral Poetry: From the Beginnings to Marvell.'' (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams, ''The Country and the City.'' Oxford U P, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renato Poggioli]],&lt;ref&gt;Renato Poggioli, ''The Oaten Flute: Essays on Pastoral Poetry and the Pastoral Ideal.'' Harvard U P, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Annabel Patterson,&lt;ref&gt;Annabel Patterson. ''Pastoral and ideology : Virgil to Valéry.'' U of California P, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Alpers,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alpers, ''What is Pastoral?'' U of Chicago P, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ken Hiltner.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hiltner, ''What Else is Pastoral?: Renaissance Literature and the Environment.'' Cornell U P, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Puttenham]] was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to “contain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour”.&lt;ref name="English Poesie 1589"/&gt;

[[Friedrich Schiller]] linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an “image of our infancy irrevocably past”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://schillerinstitute.org/transl/Schiller_essays/naive_sentimental-1.html|title = On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry|last = Schiller|first = Friedrich|website = The Schiller Institute|publisher = Translated by William F. Wertz, Jr|access-date = March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Empson]] spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as 'putting the complex into the simple.' Empson argues that "...&amp;nbsp;good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral", and uses Soviet Russia's propaganda about the working class as evidence.  Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.

[[Raymond Williams]] argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a "myth functioning as a memory" that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city's relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country new-comers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside.  With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the "inheritance of titles and making of family names".

[[Renato Poggioli|Poggioli]] was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as 'funeral elegy', the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In ''[[The Oaten Flue]]'', he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were “an ideal kind of leisure class."

[[Frank Kermode]] discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance.  His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale urban sprawl left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living.  His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham. Kermode elaborates on this and says, "the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life". Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it  as "one of the fundamental laws of literary history" because it "gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition". Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle.  This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.

Annabel Patterson emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil’s Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius' Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil's Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of [[Robert Frost]] on pastoral ideology. His poem, ''Build Soil'' is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, "turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration". [[William Wordsworth]] was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, ''Prelude,'' published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.

Paul Alpers, in his 1996 book, ''What is Pastoral?'', describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds.  With William Empson's notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory.  Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature.  Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters.  However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers.  Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says "a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place″. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd.  And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in ''The Garden''.  Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in ''L’Allegro''. Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts “normal” narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil’s works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.

In ''What Else Is Pastoral?'', Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of nature writing than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance Pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.

'''''The Rainbow Minute''''' is a serial radio show created and produced by Judd Proctor and Brian Burns. An article called ''The Rainbow Minute'' from the website ''Diversity Richmond'' describes Proctor's inspiration for the show, “In February of 2005, retired public school teacher Judd Proctor was out running errands, when he happened to tune in to “This Way Out,” a gay and lesbian international news magazine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diversityrichmond.org/16-programs/cvrp/33-the-rainbow-minute.html|title=The Rainbow Minute - Diversity Richmond|website=Diversity Richmond|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He, alongside his partner Brian Burns, who is a former art director, began underwriting ''This Way Out'' and their first airing was on February 16, 2005 with a dedication to [[Harvey Milk]]. They then moved on to create their own radio broadcast in Virginia called ''The Rainbow Minute''. The official website, WRIR.org, for ''The Rainbow Minute'' describes the show, “''The Rainbow Minute'' is a radio show about gay and lesbian heroes, history and culture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrir.org/index.php?/shows/program/rainbow-minute/|title=97.3 WRIR - Richmond Independent Radio|website=wrir.org|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two work as a team, with Judd doing the research and mixing, while Brian edits episodes and sets the music. Their first episode of ''The Rainbow Minute'' aired on September 25, 2006.  It airs on [[WRIR-LP|WRIR]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and enjoys frequent airings on other radio stations across the United States. ''The Rainbow Minute'' documents the contributions and relationships of Lesbian and Gay people throughout history. Segments are read by a diverse group of volunteers. Those outside the Richmond, Virginia listening area can hear The Rainbow Minute at www.wrir.org every weekday at 7:59am, 12:29pm, and 4:59pm.

== Diversity Richmond ==
''Diversity Richmond'' is a voice and support system for the [[LGBT community]] that was founded in 1999. ''Diversity Richmond'' sponsors ''The Rainbow Minute''. Like ''The Rainbow Minute'', the ''Diversity Richmond'' is an organization that works for the equality of the LGBT community and gives people the opportunity to feel comfortable when around LGBT people, become involved in working for LGBT equality, and also become educated about the hardships LGBT people face daily and how we can make a difference. They hold numerous classes and discussion groups including a women’s coming out support group. ''The Rainbow Minute'' and ''Diversity Richmond'' both hold volunteer opportunities. ''The Rainbow Minute'' allows volunteers to become a talk show hosts, all-nighter DJs, weekday board operators, for example. ''Diversity Richmond'' has volunteer opportunities like diversity bingo and diversity thrift to help raise money for their organization and to also get more people involved. Phylis Johnson, author of ''Radio Cultures: The Sound Medium in American Life'', acknowledges that because of the [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-stonewall-riot Stonewall Rebellion], queer radio stations emerged across the United States with the help of volunteers (98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TXPG9-dA4BcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=lgbt+radio&amp;ots=RY_TfCzkNf&amp;sig=dk_n7-UrTq6EuWuYKA4cMV_0wbQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lgbt%2520radio&amp;f=false|title=Radio Cultures: The Sound Medium in American Life|last=Keith|first=Michael C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820486482|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers make this organization and other radio station and media possible through their dedication and work.

== History ==
Previously, there weren’t many radio stations having to do with LGBT communities because not many people identified with being LGBT due to lack of knowledge as to what the term LGBT meant. The only terms people referred to were gay, lesbian, or straight. An article by Bonnie Morris describes the history of gay and lesbian people, "In the United States, few attempts to make advocacy groups supporting gay and lesbian relationships until after World War II, although prewar gay life flourished in urban centers such as Greenwich Village and Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/history.aspx|title=History of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Social Movements|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, more and more radio stations and other forms of media are emerging that are geared specifically towards the LGBT community. Christopher Pullen and Margaret Cooper support this in their book "LGBT Identity and Online New Media" by describing the opportunities that online media give LGBT people to connect with each other, "Through online new media, LGBTs offer person expressions of self, in the construction of public identity." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=LGBT Identity and Online New Media|last=Pullen;Cooper|first=Christopher;Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=0-203-85543-4|location=New Yorl|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article called “Romeo in love: a community format in a community radio,” Tiziana Cavallo talks about the video cast Romeo in Love, which was created in 2008 by one heterosexual and one gay friend (281).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Romeo in love:a community format in a community radio|last=Cavallo|first=Tiziana|publisher=Radio Evolution: Conference Proceedings|year=2011|isbn=978-989-97244-9-5|location=Braga|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Rainbow Minute'', it is a video cast about the lives of LGBT people. This video cast demonstrates the ways in which times have changed regarding associating with LGBT individuals and how people of different communities, such as heterosexual communities, racial communities, etc., are working together to create fairness and respect for everyone of the LGBT community. ''The Rainbow Minute'' and ''Diversity Richmond'' give people a place of comfort and safety that give them inspiration and hope for equality.

[[Image:Regency TR-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Regency TR-1 transistor radio]]

The '''Regency TR-1''' was the first commercially manufactured [[transistor radio]]. First sold in 1954, it was a novelty due to small size and portability; about 150,000 units were sold despite mediocre performance. The device demonstrated the use of transistors for consumer electronics; previously transistors had only been used in military or industrial applications. Surviving specimens are sought out by collectors.

==History==
Two companies—[[Texas Instruments]] of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]—worked together to produce the Regency TR-1.  Previously, Texas Instruments produced instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the [[U.S. Navy]]—and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters.  The two companies worked together on the TR-1 to grow revenues for their respective companies by pioneering this new product area.&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/2/2004_2_12.shtml|title=The Revolution in Your Pocket|author=Smicoe, Robert J.|

In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype transistor radio and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors.  No major radio maker, including [[RCA]], [[Philco]], and [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]], was interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios would be "20 million radios in three years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Transistor Radios: A Collector's Encyclopedia and Price Guide |author1=David Lane  |author2=Robert Lane  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Wallace-Homestead Book Company | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87069-712-9}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regency Division of I.D.E.A announced the TR-1 on October 18, 1954, and put it on sale in November 1954. It  was the first practical transistor radio made in significant numbers.

One year after the TR-1 release, sales approached 100,000 units. The look and size of the TR-1 were well received, but reviews of its performance were typically adverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Transistor Radios: A Collector's Encyclopedia and Price Guide |author1=David Lane  |author2=Robert Lane  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Wallace-Homestead Book Company | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87069-712-9}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, {{cite patent|US|2892931}}, former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.{{citation needed|date = October 2012}}

The Regency TR-1 circuitry was refined from the [[Texas Instruments]] prototype, reducing the number of parts, including two expensive transistors.  Though this severely reduced the audio output volume, it let I.D.E.A. sell the radio for only a small profit.  The initial TR-1 retail price was $49.95 (roughly $443 in year-2016 dollars) and it sold about 150,000 units.{{citation needed|date = October 2012}}

The TR-1 used Texas Instruments' [[NPN transistor]]s, hand-picked in sets of four. A 22.5 volt battery provided power, since the only way to get adequate [[radio frequency]] performance out of early transistors was to run them close to their collector-to-emitter [[breakdown voltage]]. The current drain from this battery was only 4 mA,&lt;ref name='ts'/&gt; allowing 20 to 30 hours of operation, in comparison to only several hours for the portable receivers based on vacuum tubes.&lt;ref name='alife'&gt;Schiffer, M. B. The portable radio in American life. — University of Arizona Press, 1991. — P. 170–178. — 259 p. — {{ISBN|9780816512843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such battery consumption rate still made the TR-1 rather expensive to run.

While the radio was praised for novelty and small size, the sensitivity and sound quality were behind the tube-based competitors. A review in ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' mentions the high level of noise and instability on certain radio frequencies, recommending against the purchase.&lt;ref name='alife'/&gt;

===Design===
I.D.E.A. outsourced the TR-1 exterior design to the industrial design firm of [[Painter, Teague and Petertil]]. The design was created within six weeks by way of telephone and design sketches exchanged by mail. The design won an award from the [[Industrial Designers Society of America|Industrial Design Society]] of New York and was selected by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] for the [[American Art and Design Exhibition]] in Paris in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Made In Japan : Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s | author = Handy, Erbe, Blackham, Antonier | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8118-0271-X}} pages 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The TR-1 was initially offered in black, bone white, mandarin red, and cloud gray. It was later uncommonly offered in olive green and mahogany. Other later, rare colors included lavender, pearl white, turquoise, pink, and lime. It was advertised as being 3" x 5" x 1.25" and weighed 12 ounces including the 22.5 volt battery. It came in a cardboard box with the color stamped on the end. An optional earphone sold for $7.50.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;Reyer, Steve (Dr.) "[http://www.mequonsteve.com/regency/ Regency TR-1 Transistor Radio Facts and Figures]". mequonsteve.com, Retrieved December 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:22,5Volt-AA-Battery.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|22.5 Volt battery used in the Regency TR-1 (AA battery for comparison shown on left)]]

The TR-1 was a [[superheterodyne]] receiver made&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060805200859/http://people.msoe.edu/~reyer/regency/patent3.jpg Regency schematic]&lt;/ref&gt; with four n-p-n transistors and one diode. It contained a single transistor converter stage, followed by two intermediate-frequency amplifier stages. After detection, a single-transistor stage amplified the sound frequency. All amplifier stages used [[common emitter]] amplifiers. Stages were transformer coupled, with tuned transformers for the intermediate frequency amplifiers and a miniature audio transformer for the loudspeaker. The intermediate frequency transformers were paired with capacitors, and hand tuned to the intermediate frequency (262&amp;nbsp;kHz&lt;ref name='ts'&gt;[http://members.cox.net/regencytr1.com/TR-1_tech_serv_man.pdf TR-1, The First Transistor Radio Receiver.

The receiver had [[automatic gain control]]. The DC level of the detected signal was filtered with a large capacitor and used to control the gain of the first IF stage (VT2, first after the heterodyne).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, T. C.

The 22.5 V battery, while now uncommon, is still used in some devices and as of 2018 remains available on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batteriesinaflash.com/exell-412a-alkaline-22-5v-battery-neda-215-replaces-15f20-blr122-v72px|website=Batteriesinaflash.com|title=Eveready 412 Carbon Zinc 22.5V Battery NEDA 215, 15F20, BLR122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum required voltage is lower, about 15 V. The electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel to the battery. It improves stability but would be damaged if the battery is reversed. The power switch was coupled with the volume control.

The initial six-transistor Texas Instruments design used a two-transistor converter stage with a separate oscillator, and a more powerful two-transistor sound amplifier.{{citation needed|date = October 2012}}

===Manufacture===
Regency began manufacturing the TR-1 on October 25, 1954. The manufacture was a collective effort by manufacturers around the country. The transistors and transformers came from Texas Instruments in Dallas. Capacitors came from [[International Electronics, Inc.]] of [[Nashville]],&lt;ref name="revolution" /&gt; [[Erie Electronics]] of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and [[Centralab]] of [[Milwaukee, WI|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. The speakers came from [[Jensen Loudspeakers|Jensen]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. [[transformer|IF transformer]]s came from [[Vokar]] of [[Dexter, MI|Dexter, Michigan]]. The volume control came from the [[Chicago Telephone Supply]] in [[Elkhart, Indiana]]. The [[tuning capacitor]] came from [[Radio Condenser Co.]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. The [[Richardson Company]] in [[Melrose Park, Illinois]] and Indianapolis supplied the circuit board material to [[Croname]] in Chicago, who manufactured the circuit boards. The actual plastic case for the TR-1 was produced by [[Argus Plastics]] in Indianapolis, Indiana.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

'''Simultaneous substitution''' (also known as '''simsubbing''' or '''signal substitution'''&lt;ref name="CRTC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Signal substitution replaces one TV signal with another|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/Eng/INFO_SHT/Bdt10.htm|website=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|accessdate=March 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225172410/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/bdt10.htm|archivedate=February 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a practice mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) requiring [[pay television|broadcast distribution undertaking]]s (BDUs) in [[Canada]] to distribute the [[signal (electronics)|signal]] of a local or regional [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] station in place of the signal of a foreign or non-local television station (typically one that is affiliated with a U.S. commercial [[television network]] such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), when the two stations are broadcasting identical programming simultaneously.

The CRTC first introduced the policy in 1972, and it is sometimes erroneously called "[[simulcast]]ing", the name of a practice different from simultaneous substitution in that there is no signal replacement.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Simultaneous substitution on cable TV|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_Simultaneous_Substitution_on_TV.html|website=Canadian Communications Foundation|accessdate=March 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009235633/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_Simultaneous_Substitution_on_TV.html|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simulcasting|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulcasting|website=[[Merriam Webster]]|accessdate=March 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CRTC, the practice of simultaneous substitution is necessary "to protect the rights of broadcasters, to enable television stations to draw enough advertising revenue and to keep advertising money in the Canadian market".&lt;ref name="CRTC1"/&gt;  Canadian broadcast networks, which must request each and every substitution on an individual basis, have been criticized for exploiting the regulation and not investing enough money into [[Canadian content]].&lt;ref name="Junos"&gt;{{cite news|title=CTV backs down on Juno air time|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/03/28/juno-change.html|website=[[CBC News]]|via=Friends of Canadian Broadcasting|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most prominent public criticism of simsubs centered around the [[Super Bowl]]—the championship game of the U.S. [[National Football League]]—which is well-known for featuring high-profile [[Super Bowl commercials|commercials]] on its U.S. broadcast. In 2015, citing the ads as having become an "integral part" of the broadcast, the CRTC announced that it would implement a policy to prevent broadcasters from requesting simsubs for the game; it was officially implemented prior to [[Super Bowl LI]] in 2017. The CRTC faced criticism over the change in policy from the game's rightsholder, [[CTV Television|CTV]] owner [[Bell Media]]. The company argued that it singled out a specific program for policy in violation of the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], and devalued its rights to the league. Bell has attempted to appeal the policy, while the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]] contains an annex that would require the CRTC to withdraw this policy.

==History==
During the 1950s, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) had a monopoly on television broadcasting in Canada (its first television station, [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]], began operating in [[Montreal]] in 1952). In 1960, the [[Board of Broadcast Governors]], the predecessor of the CRTC, began granting [[broadcast license|licenses]] for commercial stations in order to provide an alternative to the [[CBC Television|CBC]]. These broadcasters began operating in 1961, and through international distributors, acquired the domestic broadcast rights to many American television programs.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

Since about 30% of the Canadian population – those who resided close enough to the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] – had access to over-the-air broadcast signals from networks based in both Canada and the [[United States]], they could choose to watch American programs on either a Canadian or an American network.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Many of these Canadians chose to watch the American network (either CBS, ABC or NBC) rather than the Canadian networks' broadcasts. Consequently, many [[television in Canada|Canadian broadcasters]] began broadcasting programs purchased from American-based broadcast networks before they aired on the American networks to attract more viewers and to earn money from domestic advertising, and some Canadian businesses that advertised on the domestic stations also purchased broadcast time on the American stations that were receivable in the same areas, although federal legislation was eventually passed that limited the tax-deductibility of these purchases.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

Several of the stations in smaller border markets in the United States openly targeted the larger cities in Canada by getting as close to the border as possible. Examples include most of the stations in the [[Buffalo, New York]] television market, which targeted [[Toronto]] and the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region, and in the most extreme case, [[Pembina, North Dakota]] station [[KCND-TV]] (channel 12), which was based in a town with fewer than 1,000 residents but made its money by targeting the much larger city of [[Winnipeg]] across the border to its north.

When [[multichannel television in Canada|cable television]] began to proliferate across Canada in the early-1970s, viewers far from the Canada–US border began to obtain access to American television services that were once unobtainable. In 1972, in response to pressure from Canadian broadcasters, the CRTC introduced the simultaneous substitution regulation as a method to circumvent diminution of the value of Canadian networks' exclusive broadcast rights to American programs&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; (within three years, KCND was effectively moved to Winnipeg and relicensed as [[CKND-DT|CKND-TV]]). Through the 1990s, as [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] services gained popularity and then were granted licenses in Canada, simultaneous substitution became a requirement on these as well.

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the simultaneous substitution regulation had reached its full potential, with Canadian broadcast networks telecasting nearly all of their American programming at the same time as the U.S. network's broadcasts to ensure maximum eligibility to request substitution.

==Effects==
The high incidence of simultaneous substitution requests by privately owned Canadian television networks to draw advertising revenue&lt;ref name="CRTC1"/&gt; has had profound effects on various spectrums, ranging from Canadian network schedules to portions of programming being lost due to mistimed substitutions.

===Network schedules===
Since private Canadian broadcast networks such as [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[CTV Two]] and [[City (TV network)|City]] often rely heavily on American programs, their programming schedules are often effectively dictated by the schedules of corresponding United States network broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Television Today|author=B. Beaty|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=[[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]|page=71|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55238-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a U.S. broadcaster moves a series to a new time slot, the Canadian broadcaster that holds domestic rights to carry first-run episodes of that program would need to move its broadcast to correspond with the new time slot if it wished to retain simultaneous substitution rights.&lt;ref name="cbc-nosimsub" /&gt;
 
Many American networks telecast their most popular programming during [[prime time]], meaning that in order to maximize simsubbing opportunities, Canadian private broadcasters are often unable or unwilling to broadcast their own original programming during these hours. As a result, [[Canadian content]] programming is commonly scheduled as a secondary concern, to fill holes where an American program cannot be placed for substitution. This issue has also extended beyond scripted entertainment programming – all three major networks in Canada have faced criticism for at least one incident in which the network seemingly deemed a live Canadian news or cultural awards program to be less important than simsubbing an American [[reality television]] series:
* In 2003, Global flagship station [[CIII-DT|CIII]] (channel 41) in [[Paris, Ontario]] (since relicensed to Toronto) transferred its coverage of the [[Ontario general election, 2003|Ontario provincial election]] to its sister station [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] (channel 11) in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], to maintain simsubbing rights to an episode of ''[[Survivor: Pearl Islands]]''; earlier the same year, the network's Winnipeg station CKND had opted not to produce any coverage of the [[Manitoba general election, 2003|Manitoba general election]] at all, instead airing its regularly scheduled prime time lineup.
* In 2006, [[CBC Television]] received criticism after it announced plans to bump its primary network newscast, ''[[CBC News: The National|The National]]'', to a later time slot one night a week to broadcast the short-lived singing competition series ''[[The One: Making a Music Star]]''.
* In 2007, CTV was forced to back down on a plan to [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] the [[2007 Juno Awards]] to maintain its simsubbing rights to an episode of ''[[The Amazing Race]]''.&lt;ref name="Junos"/&gt;

Since 2008, [[CTVglobemedia]] (now [[Bell Media]]) has held both the exclusive rights to the [[Canadian Football League]] and the rights to Sunday afternoon and playoff games of the American National Football League, broadcasting most NFL games on CTV, while relegating CFL games (including the Grey Cup) to cable channel [[The Sports Network|TSN]], making CFL games unavailable on broadcast television for the first time in Canadian history. The move was in part due to the desire to gain simsubbing rights over the NFL broadcasts, something that was not necessary for CFL games because, as of 2015, those games are only available on cable television in the United States.

===Portions of programming lost===
Due to the high number of simultaneous substitutions requested by Canadian broadcasters, portions of programs are sometimes lost. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including the cable provider erroneously timing the substitution or substituting over the incorrect distant signal, the Canadian broadcaster making a scheduling error when requesting a substitution, the American broadcaster making a last minute change to its schedule, or adverse weather conditions sometimes affecting a Canadian station's local signal. In addition, should a Canadian network interrupt its programming to provide information on a [[breaking news]] event while simsubbing an American show, the American program cannot be telecast.

With the increasingly common practice of American networks extending programs by one to two minutes into the start of the next hour in order to avoid audience loss,&lt;ref name="HouseExtend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extended episode of ''House'' could plague DVR users|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/11/house-runover-m.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=November 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; such errors are sometimes unavoidable if the Canadian station is not able to match the altered start time. This slight differentiation in timing between the Canadian and American stations can lead to a short period during which the Canadian viewer is watching the original American station's signal before the Canadian network starts its simsubbing, resulting in the show's jumping back to the start again. This is not a problem for American viewers who choose to watch the same network across time slots, but Canadian viewers could miss critical content.

===High-definition television===
[[High-definition television]] signals must also be simultaneously substituted, although this only applies if a local over-the-air [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] transmitter that broadcasts HD content is receivable in the market served by the local cable provider. Since many broadcasters were only required to convert their main, typically major-market transmitters during the 2011 [[Digital television in Canada|digital television transition in Canada]], this means that HD simsubbing is not currently enforceable in many rural areas.

Although the CRTC's policy regarding simultaneous substitutions for high definition broadcasts do not require them to be applied if the quality of the Canadian feed is not equal or better than the American feed, there have been instances in which inferior Canadian feeds were substituted over higher-quality American feeds. In such cases, complaints can be filed to the CRTC, whereas the commission will confer with the applicable BDU and Canadian network about the issue.

Implementation of simultaneous substitutions can also cause issues involving [[digital on-screen graphic]]s applied by the originating broadcaster; if a [[clean feed (television)|clean feed]] of the program is not available (particularly for live programming), the Canadian broadcaster will often place their own bug in a different corner of the screen, or not add one at all. CTV and CTV Two occasionally used an opaque logo to cover the logo bugs of US-based networks on simsubbed broadcasts of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' on CTV and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on CTV Two, but have since discontinued this practice.

==Implementation and exceptions==
Enforcement, or lack thereof, of the regulations, as well as legal exceptions and simple circumstance, has led to instances where some Canadian cable and satellite subscribers are able to receive the original American channels in Canada without simultaneous substitution. Cable providers with less than 2000 subscribers are not legally required to have simultaneous substitution implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/2014-444.htm section 19&lt;/ref&gt;
Many viewers in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] can pick up American stations from Buffalo, New York, over-the-air, as well as high-definition versions of the stations from both Buffalo and [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], on cable television. Similarly, cable television viewers in [[Greater Vancouver]] may receive unmatched HD stations from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. However, high-definition feeds are also subject to simsub, and such substitutions began to increase as local broadcasters performed wider deployments of [[digital terrestrial television]].&lt;ref name="CRTC-HD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-358: Complaint regarding the simultaneous substitution of the high definition broadcast of the 2008 Super Bowl|url=http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-358.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|date=December 22, 2008|accessdate=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule changes and Super Bowl simsub ban ===
On January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced changes to the simsub rules as a result of ''Let's Talk TV'', a series of hearings which mulled reforms for the Canadian television industry. While the CRTC did not completely eliminate the simsub rules, "despite certain reservations," it did propose that its policies explicitly state that only over-the-air channels may invoke simsubs, and that broadcasters and television providers be accountable for programming lost from improperly implemented simsubs: providers will be required to provide rebates as compensation, and stations could temporarily lose their ability to simsub programming. The CRTC also proposed that, citing viewer complaints over their inability to see what they felt was a "integral part" of the event, and that many ads were often seen multiple times throughout the game, it would ban the use of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl beginning in [[Super Bowl LI|2017]], thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event and its [[Super Bowl commercials|commercials]] to co-exist with Canadian simulcasts.&lt;ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub&gt;{{cite news|title=CRTC opens door for U.S. Super Bowl ads to air on Canadian TV|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crtc-2015-25&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-25|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bell Media, the current Canadian rightsholder to the Super Bowl through CTV, filed an appeal, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violates the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], which forbids the CRTC from making regulations that single out specific programs.&lt;ref name="gandm-bellappealB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell appeals CRTC decision to air U.S. Super Bowl commercials|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL itself has backed Bell Media's complaints.&lt;ref name=torstar-nflcrtc&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL enters battle with CRTC over Super Bowl|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2015/07/18/nfl-enters-battle-with-crtc-over-super-bowl.html|accessdate=21 July 2015|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order implementing these new rules was issued on August 19, 2016. The prohibition only applies to the game itself; the typically extended pre-game and post-game coverage is not covered by the policy, and thus may still be simsubbed by CTV.&lt;ref name="faguy-sbli"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2017/01/27/ctv-super-bowl-li-plans/|title=CTV Super Bowl LI plans|date=January 27, 2017|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-334.htm|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2016-334 and Broadcasting Order CRTC 2016-335|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2016, after being denied an appeal because the CRTC had not yet issued official policy when the suit was filed,&lt;ref name="gandm-yesnoads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court dismisses Bell appeal of CRTC policy on Super Bowl ads|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/court-rules-against-bells-attempt-to-swap-super-bowl-commercials/article31722299/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-lawsuitdismiss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court rules against Bell in bid to overturn ban on U.S. ads airing during Super Bowl|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crtc-super-bowl-ads-appeal-1.3751203|website=CBC News|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was granted the right to appeal the ruling in the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="gandm-bellappealA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell wins right to appeal new Super Bowl ad policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telecast of [[Super Bowl LI]] was available directly from Fox affiliates carried on pay television in Canada.&lt;ref name="cbc-nosimsub"/&gt;

[[Michael Geist]] of the [[University of Ottawa]] believed that this decision was a test case for eventually phasing out the simsub rules entirely, arguing that the practice was becoming increasingly irrelevant due to changing viewing habits (such as the consumption of TV content via video-on-demand services rather than linear networks), and that dropping the rules could force domestic broadcasters to make greater investments into original, Canadian content, rather than scheduling it as an afterthought around fluctuating U.S. schedules.&lt;ref name="cbc-nosimsub"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are the Academy Awards next?

On May 18, 2017, the NFL testified to the [[United States Department of Commerce]] that the CRTC's August 2016 ruling was a violation of copyright protections under [[NAFTA]]. The NFL and BCE continued to fight to overturn this policy in the Federal Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/nfl-to-testify-that-crtc-super-bowl-ad-decision-violates-nafta|title=NFL to testify that CRTC Super Bowl ad decision violates NAFTA|work=Financial Post|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FP_Jackson_SC_Jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/supreme-court-dismisses-bell-and-nfls-last-minute-play-to-stall-super-bowl-ad-policy |title=Supreme Court dismisses Bell and NFL's last minute play to stall Super Bowl ad policy |first=Emily |last=Jackson |date=January 26, 2018  |access-date=October 7, 2018 |newspaper=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="FP_Jackson_CRTC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/technology/nfl-hands-the-ball-off-to-trump-in-its-super-bowl-ad-spat-with-the-crtc  |title=NFL hands the ball off to Trump in its Super Bowl ad spat with the CRTC |first=Emily |last=Jackson |date=January 30, 2017  |access-date=October 7, 2018 |newspaper=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's case, ruling that the CRTC's policy was reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-loses-appeal-of-crtcs-super-bowl-ad-ruling/article37387000/|title=Bell loses court appeal of CRTC’s Super Bowl ad ruling|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/football-sports-pmn/bell-media-and-nfl-take-appeal-over-super-bowl-ad-policy-to-supreme-court|title=Bell Media and NFL take appeal over Super Bowl ad policy to Supreme Court|date=2018-01-22|work=National Post|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the NFL and Bell's appeal of the Federal Court of Appeal's decision. In an unprecedented step, the top court announced that it intended to use this appeal as an opportunity to revisit the law governing standard of review of administrative tribunals. The appeal was tentatively scheduled to be heard in December 2018.&lt;ref  name="FP_Jackson_BellFeb2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/technology/bells-super-bowl-tv-audience-drops-39-per-cent-after-new-crtc-ad-policy |title=Bell’s Super Bowl TV audience drops 39 per cent after new CRTC ad policy |first=Emily |last=Jackson |date=February 7, 2017  |access-date=October 7, 2018 |newspaper=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2018, Canada agreed to the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]]. The trade deal, which replaces NAFTA, contains an annex that would require the CRTC to apply its simsub policies equally across the programming that it covers, and as such, withdraw its policy forbidding simsubs of the Super Bowl. NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] had lobbied for the condition, and praised U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] after the agreement was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/03/roger-goodell-nfl-appreciates-trumps-leadership-trade-deals-super-bowl-provision/|title=Roger Goodell: NFL appreciates Trump’s ‘leadership’ on trade deal’s Super Bowl provision|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcconnell-usmca-free-trade-vote-1.4864887|title=New trade deal between Canada, U.S. and Mexico won't be ratified this year|work= CBC News|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the trade deal, Bell requested that the CRTC withdraw the policy in time for [[Super Bowl LIII]]; Bell was denied due to the pending Supreme Court appeals hearing, as well as the fact that the agreement has not yet been ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/crtc-passes-on-bells-attempt-to-overturn-super-bowl-ads-policy-leaves-ball-in-supreme-court|title=Canadians will still be watching American Super Bowl ads after CRTC refuses to change policy despite USMCA deal|date=2018-11-12|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific television providers===
In terms of television providers, the practice of simsubbing is implemented in different ways, depending on the company, especially in the case of satellite providers, which operate on a national basis and not regionally as cable providers do;
* [[Shaw Direct]] invokes simsubs according to a subscriber's [[Canadian postal code|postal code]], and is implemented by the receiver's firmware; this method enforces simsubs only in areas where they are legally needed. Beginning in February 2012, however, Shaw Direct began implementing simsubs for the [[Global Television Network#Global HD|Global]] network's HD feed ([[television channel|channel]] 256) for all of their high-definition subscribers, which affects ABC East HD ([[WXYZ-TV]]), CBS East HD ([[WWJ-TV]]), Fox East HD ([[WUHF]]) and NBC East HD ([[WDIV-TV]]). It is speculated that this is due to the 2010 purchase of the Global Television Network by [[Shaw Communications]]. At first, no other channels were simsubbed, but Shaw Direct later began implementing simsubs for City, but still does not do so for CTV, its main competitor.
* [[Bell TV]] invokes simsubs to all subscribers nationwide, implemented by its uplink centre (which also provides services for other service providers); by doing so, simsubs for a particular channel are implemented nationwide, regardless of where the subscriber lives or which feed the subscriber watches. Notably, Bell's feeds also invoked simsubs on network programming being simulcast by specialty channels owned by Bell Media, such as TSN.
* Similarly, Rogers Cable has periodically invoked simsubs on U.S. network affiliates for sports programming simulcast on its [[Sportsnet]] specialty channels (such as the [[2013 World Series]] on Fox in lieu of the [[MLB International]] feed).

==Other uses==
Although simultaneous substitution was conceived to substitute the signal of a foreign station, the practice has been applied as well to substitute the signal of an out-of-market Canadian station in a given market. For example, in [[Montreal]], the signal of [[Ottawa]] station [[CJOH-DT]] (channel 13) has frequently been substituted by the signal of locally based [[CFCF-DT]] (channel 12), even though both stations are part of the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] network.

Simultaneous substitution has also been implemented on [[French language]] television stations. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]]'s flagship Montreal station [[CFTM-DT|CFTM-TV]] (channel 10) had its signal substituting that of its [[Sherbrooke]] sister station [[CHLT-DT|CHLT-TV]] (channel 7) (which was receivable in the Montreal area through 1995).

'''Sound-on-film''' is a class of [[sound film]] processes where the sound accompanying picture is physically recorded onto photographic film, usually, but not always, the same strip of film carrying the picture.  Sound-on-film processes can either record an [[Analog signal|analog]] sound track or [[Digital data|digital]] sound track, and may record the signal either [[optical sound|optically]] or [[magnetism|magnetically]]. Earlier technologies were [[sound-on-disc]], meaning the film's soundtrack would be on a separate [[phonograph record]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&amp;pg=PA596&amp;lpg=PA596&amp;dq=film+sound+new+york+times+analog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s8e_z4rkRS&amp;sig=ICFoQAQ5HNLHdvkIS8xoZvHaUmM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IMw1TZHCD4-asAOlzaTfBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=film%20sound%20new%20york%20times%20analog&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|1=see [[Theodore Case]] and [[Lee_De_Forest#Phonofilm_sound-on-film_process]]|date=October 2012}}

==Analog sound-on-film recording==
The most prevalent current method of recording analogue sound on a [[film print]] is by [[stereo variable-area]] (SVA) recording, a technique first used in the mid-1970s as [[Dolby Stereo]]. A two-channel audio signal is recorded as a pair of lines running parallel with the film's direction of travel through the projector.  The lines change area (grow broader or narrower) depending on the magnitude of the signal.  The projector shines light from a small lamp, called an [[Exciter bulb|exciter]], through a perpendicular slit onto the film.  The image on the small slice of exposed track modulates the intensity of the light, which is collected by a photosensitive element: a photocell, a [[photodiode]] or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]].

In the early years of the 21st century distributors changed to using cyan dye optical soundtracks on color stocks instead of applicated tracks, which use environmentally unfriendly chemicals to retain a silver (black-and-white) soundtrack. Because traditional incandescent exciter lamps produce copious amounts of infra-red light, and cyan tracks do not absorb infra-red light, this change has required theaters to replace the incandescent exciter lamp with a complementary colored red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or laser. These LED or laser exciters are backwards-compatible with older tracks.

Earlier processes, used on [[70 mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm film]] prints and special presentations of [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] prints, recorded sound magnetically on [[Iron(III) oxide|ferric oxide]] tracks bonded to the film print, outside the sprocket holes. 16&amp;nbsp;mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded to one side of the film on which the sprocket holes had not been punched ("single perforated") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16&amp;nbsp;mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.

== Digital sound-on-film formats ==
Three different digital soundtrack systems for 35&amp;nbsp;mm cinema release prints were introduced during the 1990s.  They are: [[Dolby Digital]], which is stored between the perforations on the sound side; [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]], stored in two [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] strips along the outside edges (beyond the perforations); and [[Digital Theatre System|DTS]], in which sound data is stored on separate [[compact disc]]s synchronized by a [[timecode]] track on the film just to the right of the analog soundtrack and left of the frame&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dts.com/Corporate/About_Us/Milestones.aspx DTS &amp;#124; Corporate &amp;#124; Milestones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609183206/http://www.dts.com/Corporate/About_Us/Milestones.aspx |date=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sound-on-disc]]). Because these soundtrack systems appear on different parts of the print, one movie can contain all of them, allowing broad distribution without regard for the sound system installed at individual theatres.

==Sound-on-film formats==
Almost all sound formats used with motion-picture film have been sound-on-film formats, including:

===Optical analog formats===
* [[Fox Film|Fox]]/[[Western Electric]] (Westrex) [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], are variable-density formats of [[sound film]]. (No longer used, but still playable on modern 35 mm projectors.)
* [[RCA Photophone]], a variable-area format now universally used for optical analog soundtracks—since the late 1970s, usually with a [[Dolby]] encoding matrix.
* [[Tri-Ergon]], the patent of this Berlin based company was bought by Fox in 1926.

====Encoding matrices====
* [[Dolby Stereo]] 
* [[Dolby SR]]
* [[Ultra Stereo]]

===Optical digital formats===
* [[Dolby Digital]]
* [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]]

===Obsolete formats===
* [[Cinema Digital Sound]], an optical format which was the first commercial digital sound format, used between 1990 and 1992
* [[Fantasound]]. This was a system developed by RCA and Disney Studios with a multi-channel soundtrack recorded on a separate strip of film from the picture. It was used for the initial release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)
* [[Phonofilm]], patented by [[Lee De Forest]] in 1919, defunct by 1929

{{about|prize competition|market competition|space industry|geopolitical competition|Space race (disambiguation)}}

A '''space competition''' is an [[inducement prize contest]] offering a prize to be given to the first competitor who demonstrates a space vehicle, or a space exploration apparatus, which meets a set of pre-established criteria. It spurs pioneering development in [[private spaceflight]].

== X PRIZE ==
{{Main article|Ansari X PRIZE}}
The ''Ansari X PRIZE'' was a space competition in which the [[X PRIZE Foundation]] offered a [[United States dollar|US$]]10,000,000 [[prize]] for the first [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organization]] to launch a reusable [[manned spaceflight|manned spacecraft]] into [[outer space|space]] twice within two weeks.  It was modeled after early 20th-century [[aviation]] prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight.  The prize was won on October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the [[Sputnik 1]] launch, by the [[Scaled Composites Tier One|Tier One]] project designed by Burt Rutan and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, using the experimental [[spaceplane]] [[SpaceShipOne]].  $10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.

== Google Lunar X Prize ==
{{main article|Google Lunar X Prize}}
''Google Lunar X Prize'' calls for teams to compete in successfully launching, landing, and operating a [[Lunar rover|rover]] on the [[lunar surface]]. The prize awards US$20 million to the first team to land a rover on the moon that successfully roves more than 500 meters and transmits back high definition images and video. There is a $5 million second prize, as well as $5 million in potential bonus prizes for extra features such as roving long distances (greater than 5,000 meters), capturing images of man made objects on the moon, detecting ice on one of the Moon's craters, or surviving a lunar night. The X Prize offers the first prize until December 31, 2012, thereafter it offers $15 million until December 31, 2014.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Lunar X PRIZE Competition Guidelines|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/competition/guidelines|publisher=googlelunarxprize.org|accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==America's Space Prize==
{{Main article|America's Space Prize}}
''America's Space Prize'' is a [[United States dollar|US$]]50 million [[orbital spaceflight]] competition established and funded by hotel entrepreneur [[Robert Bigelow]]. The prize would have been awarded to the first US-based privately funded team to design and build a reusable manned capsule capable of flying 5 astronauts to a [[Bigelow Aerospace]] inflatable space module.  The prize expired January 10, 2010.  There must be two flights within 60 days. The teams must be based in the United States.

==Other, sub-million dollar prizes==
In addition, there are several minor space competitions, with prizes being less than one million dollars or its equivalent.

=== Centennial Challenges ===
{{main article|Centennial Challenges}}
Seeking to continue this incentive-based approach, in
2006 the X PRIZE Foundation organized the [[Wirefly X PRIZE Cup]] at Las Cruces International Airport in
New Mexico. Cash awards were offered in three areas
as part of the NASA [[Centennial Challenges]] Program:
the Beam Power Challenge, the Tether Challenge, and
the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge.

Although no contestants fulfilled the criteria necessary
to win any of the three challenges, the competition
elicited promising technology developments and
demonstrated their potential to the general public.
Subsequent annual X PRIZE Cups are planned to
encourage further innovation in the personal spaceflight
industry, and are expected to feature cash prizes
for vehicle developers who achieve milestones such
as fastest launch turnaround time, maximum altitude,
and fastest speed record.&lt;ref&gt;

The challenge posed by the N-Prize is to launch a satellite weighing between 9.99 and 19.99 grams into Earth [[orbit]], and to track it for a minimum of nine orbits.  Most importantly, though, the launch budget must be within £999.99 (about $2000) - and must include all of the required non-reusable hardware and fuels.  According to the full rules of the N-Prize, it is "intended to encourage creativity, originality and inventiveness in the face of severe odds and impossible financial restrictions" and "is aimed at amateurs, enthusiasts, would-be boffins and foolhardy optimists."&lt;ref name='ITWire'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/18033/1066/|title="Nines" have it for Nanosatellite space race: The N-Prize|date=2008-05-03|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=ITWire|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618064846/http://www.itwire.com/content/view/18033/1066/|archivedate=2008-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T. E. Dunville''' (29 July 1867 - 21 March 1924) was a leading English [[music hall]] comedian, described by [[Charlie Chaplin]] as "an excellent funny man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chaplin |first=Charles |date=2003 |title=My Autobiography |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ncaOcdTocAMC&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=%22t.+e.+dunville%22+and+%22chaplin%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uvguH1v0ua&amp;sig=B2ly1F8iCMAIqnhAcbcNgyrJiTI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ05Him6LcAhVsDsAKHUlzCncQ6AEIVzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22t.%20e.%20dunville%22%20and%20%22chaplin%22&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn=0141011475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Dunville was born Thomas Edward Wallen at 32 New Street, [[Coventry]], England on 29 July 1867. He was educated at [[Bablake School]], and worked briefly for [[Rudge-Whitworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/backbeat-te-dunville-coventrys-first-6851652 |title=Backbeat: TE Dunville... Cov's first £100-a-week superstar |date=2014 |work= |publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his stage name from the [[whisky]] firm [[Dunville &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name="Dumville"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dumville.org/music_hall.html |title=Music-Hall Star Mr T.E. Dunville |date=2009 |work= |publisher=Dumville website |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having established himself in the northern [[music hall]]s, Dunville took his act to London in 1890, performing first at the [[Gillian Lynne Theatre|Middlesex Music Hall]] in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Richard Anthony |date=2014 |title=British Music Hall: An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtKwBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=%22dunville%22+and+%22anthony+baker%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yBJmbnLKZD&amp;sig=CjY1MdCsaooeMkiSqohDFcol8HA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD4LveqJDcAhXLSsAKHe0-D-sQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dunville%22%20and%20%22anthony%20baker%22&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] |page=84 |isbn=1783831189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was billed as an "eccentric comedian and contortionist". His appearance accounted for the "eccentric" part: he had a high forehead, and wore a black wig with a wide parting on the left; he wore a loose black jacket with large buttons, tight black trousers, and large boots. A disabled arm contributed to the "contortionist" part: the arm would jerk and swing with a life of its own as he performed an eccentric dance.&lt;ref name="Monologues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monologues.co.uk/musichall/T.E.Dunville.htm |title=The Lyrics: T.E. Dunville (1868-1924) |date=2018 |work= |publisher=Monologues website |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunville's first wife, Fanny Warriss, attempted, with Dunville's support, a singing career on the music hall stage under the name Millie Lindon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2005/music-hall-of-fame-millie-lindon/ |title=Music hall of fame |date=2005 |work= |publisher=''[[The Stage]]'' |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunville's autobiography, ''The Autobiography of an Eccentric Comedian'', was published by Everett &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Everett_%26_Co.,_Ltd. |title=Everett &amp; Co., Ltd. |date=2018 |work= |publisher=The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912.

==Death==
Remaining successful for more than thirty years, Dunville gave his last performance at the [[Grand Theatre, Clapham]] on 20 March 1924. The following day he disappeared, and on 22 March 1924 his body was found in the [[River Thames]] at [[Caversham Lock]] near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Dunville had suffered with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] for several years, and he left his (second) wife, Dora, a [[suicide note]] including the words "I feel I cannot bear it any longer."&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; He is buried near [[Bridport]] in [[Dorset]], in a grave marked with a white cross bearing the words "[[Jesus Wept]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Burials.htm |title=Music Hall and Variety Artistes' Burial Places |date=2018 |work= |publisher=Arthur Lloyd website |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
Dunville recorded five [[phonograph cylinder]]s:

* ''Enquire Within'' ([[Thomas Edison|Edison]] cylinder 13023)
* ''Nine Gallant Highlanders'' (Edison cylinder 13024)
* ''Scoot'' (Edison cylinder 13025)
* ''The Volunteer Fireman'' (Edison cylinder 13036)
* ''The Three Stages of Women'' (Edison cylinder 13037)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/edisonphonograph02moor/edisonphonograph02moor_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The Edison Phonograph Monthly (Mar 1904- Feb 1905)" |date=2018 |work= |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Made on the earliest commercial medium for [[Sound recording|recording and reproducing sound]], the recordings may have disintegrated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now a very real danger that T.E. Dunville's cylinders no longer exist - if any of them do turn up they should be committed to tape or microgroove as soon as possible, the fragility of wax cylinders making such a step particularly necessary. Should they have parted company with their original boxes, the only identification on the cylinders themselves may well be the Edison serial number ... would anyone knowing of the existence of any Dunville cylinders please arrange for them to be transferred electrically to a more permanent "record". How tragic it would be if the voice of one of the premier examples of the "eccentric comedian" were allowed to slip into oblivion."&lt;ref name="Dumville"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}

==Legacy==
[[P. G. Wodehouse]] refers to Dunville in his 1909 comic novel ''[[The Swoop!]]'' (Part Two, Chapter Four).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wodehouse |first=P. G. |date=2013 |title=The Swoop -Or- How Clarence Saved England |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yA6MpN-BZ_EC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=%22dunville%22+and+%22wodehouse%22+and+%22the+swoop%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WfetZWZTWB&amp;sig=bV9fcS3VaJ-foJjRVaw2ofADt5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv8Lzb-aHcAhWnJsAKHQNPDbIQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dunville%22%20and%20%22wodehouse%22%20and%20%22the%20swoop%22&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Everyman's Library]] |page=53 |isbn=1841591904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunville created a style of movement called "leg mania", which influenced later comic performers including [[Max Wall]] and [[Billy Dainty]].&lt;ref name="Dumville"/&gt;

'''''The Ganzfeld''''' is an art magazine&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801590.html, The Washington Post, The Insider Comic Book Guru Dan Nadel, 29, New York, By Greg Zinman Special to The Washington Post Sunday, June 11, 2006, Retrieved March 11, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; created by three New York City artists in 2000; Dan Nadel, Patrick Smith (of Vectorpark.com) and Tim Hodler (a [[Details (magazine)|''Details'']] editor), who were art graduates of [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. It is similar to the ''Meathaus'' anthology, created by artists who attended the New York [[School of Visual Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/print/review.php?id=62&amp;rid=85' [[Eye Magazine]], Issue 79 Review Spring 2002, The Ganzfeld #2, Retrieved March 11, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first issue, Smith and Hodler left the publication due to creative differences and were replaced by [[Peter Buchanan-Smith]], art director for ''[[The New York Times]]''.

''The Ganzfeld'' combines art and art criticism, much of it related to [[comic books]] and [[cartoonists]]. Contributors include [[Chris Ware]], [[Lauren Weinstein (comics)|Lauren Weinstein]], [[Renée French]], [[Ron Rege, Jr.]], [[Sasha Hirschfeld]], [[Peter Blegvad]], [[Blexbolex]] and [[Brian Ralph]].

Buchanan-Smith left in 2005; Nadel is now the sole editor of the anthology, which has ceased publication as of issue seven.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTE: The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events. PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. See "Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. --&gt;
[[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the Dwarves watch from the [[Lonely Mountain]] as the dragon [[Smaug]] sets [[Esgaroth|Laketown]] ablaze. [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]] breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the [[Middle-earth weapons and armour#Black Arrow|black arrow]] brought to him by his son [[List of kings of Dale|Bain]]. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while [[Legolas]] travels to investigate [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#Mount Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] with [[Tauriel]]. Thorin, now struck with "dragon sickness" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the [[Arkenstone]], which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.

Meanwhile, [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Saruman]] arrive at [[Dol Guldur]] and free [[Gandalf]], sending him to safety with [[Radagast]]. They battle and defeat the [[Nazgûl]] and a formless [[Sauron]] himself, banishing them to the East. [[Azog]], marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son [[Bolg]] to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.

[[Thranduil]] and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by [[Middle-earth dwarf characters#Thrór|Thrór]]. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin [[Dáin II Ironfoot|Dáin]] arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men begins, until [[Wereworms]] emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city.

Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards [[Ravenhill (Middle-earth)|Ravenhill]] with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using [[One Ring|his magic ring]] to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] arrive with Radagast and [[Beorn]] to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name [[Aragorn|"Strider"]].

Bilbo bids farewell to the remaining members of Thorin's company and journeys home to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Sixty years later]], Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.

''The Hobbit'' was originally envisioned as a two-part film, but Jackson confirmed plans for a third film on 30 July 2012, turning his adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' into a trilogy.&lt;ref name=THR30712&gt;{{cite news| first =Zakarin | last = Jordan |date=30 July 2012 |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-confirmed-355817 |title=Third 'Hobbit' Film Confirmed |work= The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PJFB30712&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Peter |authorlink= Peter Jackson | date= 30 July 2012 | url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/an-unexpected-journey/10151114596546558 | title = An unexpected journey |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jackson, the third film would contain the [[Battle of the Five Armies]] and make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote to expand the story of [[Middle-earth]] (published in the back of ''[[The Return of the King]]''). Jackson also stated that while the third film will largely make use of footage originally shot for the first and second films, it would require additional filming as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://screenrant.com/hobbit-3-peter-jackson/ |title='The Hobbit 3' Edges Closer to Production | publisher =ScreenRant |last=Outlaw |first=Kofi |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third film was titled ''There and Back Again'' in August 2012.&lt;ref name="McClintock"&gt;{{cite news| last= McClintock|first= Pamela| title= Third 'Hobbit' Film Sets Release Date |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-sets-release-367258 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=31 August 2012 |date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Jackson changed the title of the film to ''The Battle of the Five Armies'' as he thought the new title better suited the situation of the film.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson retitles The Hobbit part three The Battle of the Five Armies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/peter-jackson-hobbit-battle-of-the-five-armies|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 May 2014|first=Ben |last=Child|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated on his [[Facebook]] page, "''There and Back Again'' felt like the right name for the second of a two film telling of the quest to reclaim Erebor, when Bilbo's arrival there, and departure, were both contained within the second film.

===Score===
{{Main|Music of The Hobbit film series#The Battle of the Five Armies}}
As with all the previous films, [[Howard Shore]] composed the score. Conrad Pope (who conducted the orchestra) and James Sizemore orchestrated the music for the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] and for two [[Gamelan]] orchestra, while the [[London Voices]] and Tiffin' Boys choir were recorded in [[Air Lyndhurst|AIR Lyndhurst]], London. The score featured a few new themes for Dain, Gundabad (featuring a "chorus" of didgeridoos) and the Dwarves' war preparations, but focused more on blending and clashing the themes against one another, eventually bringing the themes to a resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbwritingblogblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/interview-h-shore/|title=Interview: Howard Shore|date=10 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Two video games were developed to coincide with the film's theatrical release. A tie-in fighting video game ''The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies – Fight for Middle Earth'' was released simultaneously with the film for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] platforms to negative reviews from critics and users. An [[action-adventure]] video game ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] &amp; [[Xbox One]] in October 2014 and for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] on November 21, nearly a week prior to The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies world [[premiere]] in London, on 1 December. The events of the game take place directly after [[Sauron]] fled to [[Mordor]], escaping [[The White Council]], which was shown at the beginning of the film. The game was planned to act as an overlap between [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit film series]] and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings film series]].

===Critical response===
[[MTV]] reported that early reviews for ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' were "generally positive" with critics praising the film "for its energy, shorter running time and satisfying closure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin P.|date=2 December 2014|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2013811/hobbit-battle-of-five-armies-reviews/|title=Early The Hobbit: The Battle Of Five Armies Reviews Are Here|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[International Business Times|IBT]], reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics "praising director Peter Jackson's effort at transforming J.

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "The result is at once the trilogy's most engrossing episode, its most expeditious (at a comparatively lean 144 minutes) and also its darkest—both visually and in terms of the forces that stir in the hearts of men, dwarves and orcs alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foundas |first=Scott |date=1 December 2014|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-1201367492/ |title=Film Review: 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "After six films, 13 years and 1031 minutes of accumulated running time, Peter Jackson has concluded his massively remunerative genuflection at the altar of J.R.R.

But action-wise, it certainly goes out with a very pleasing bang."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baillie |first=Russell |date=11 December 2014 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment-reviews/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502967&amp;objectid=11372636 |title=Movie review: The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Inkoo Kang of [[TheWrap]] said "The 144-minute running time showcases Jackson's worst tendencies: eons-long battle scenes, sloppy and abrupt resolutions, portentous romances, off-rhythm comic timing, and, newly in this case, patience-testing fan service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kang |first=Inkoo |date=1 December 2014|url=http://www.thewrap.com/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-review-martin-freeman-ian-mckellen-cate-blanchett/ |title='The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies' Review: Martin Freeman and Company End Trilogy, Provide Fan Service |publisher=[[The Wrap]] |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the film as "a paragraph on steroids" that was "neither very terrible nor remotely unexpected.

'''Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)''' is a form of habituation therapy designed to help people who suffer from [[tinnitus]], a ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sound in the ears when no external sound is present.  Two key components of TRT directly follow from the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. One of these principles includes [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|directive counseling]] aimed at reclassification of tinnitus to a category of neutral signals,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} while the other includes [[neurologic music therapy|sound therapy]]&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2&gt;Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Implementing the Neurophysiological Model, Jastreboff, P.J. and Hazell, J.W.P. (2004). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at weakening tinnitus related neuronal activity.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jastreboff|first=P.J.|title=Tinnitus retraining therapy|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2007|volume=166|pages=415–423|issn=0079-6123|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612307660403|accessdate=23 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)66040-3|series=&lt;!-- --&gt;|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of TRT is management of tinnitus; there is no evidence that TRT can attenuate or eliminate tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The efficacy of TRT in reducing the distress of tinnitus has not been established.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} TRT is not a medical treatment for tinnitus or any other condition, and is not administered by a medical doctor or other medical professional.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An alternative to TRT is [[tinnitus masking]], the use of noise, music or other environmental sounds to obscure or mask the tinnitus.  Hearing aids can provide a partial masking effect for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler et.al.|first1=R.S.|title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy: Mixingpoint and Masking are Equally Effective.|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=2012|volume=33|issue=5|pages=588–594|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e31824f2a6e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a review of tinnitus retraining therapy trials indicate that it may be a more effective treatment than tinnitus masking.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John S|author2=Don McFerran |title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) for tinnitus|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2010|issue=3|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007330.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
Not everyone who experiences tinnitus is significantly bothered by it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, some of the problems caused by tinnitus include annoyance, anxiety, panic, and loss of sleep and/or concentration.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt; The distress of tinnitus is strongly associated with various psychological factors; loudness, duration and other characteristics of the tinnitus are secondary.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

TRT may offer real although moderate improvement in tinnitus suffering for adults with moderate-to-severe tinnitus, in the absence of hyperacusis, significant hearing loss and/or depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer, et.al.|first1=CA|title=Effect of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy on the Loudness and Annoyance of Tinnitus: A Controlled Trial.|journal=Ear &amp; Hearing|date=2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=145–55|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e3181f5374f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone is a good candidate for TRT.  Factors associated with suitability for TRT and predisposing for favorable outcome are: lower loudness of tinnitus, higher pitch of tinnitus, shorter duration of tinnitus since onset, recognition of tinnitus attenuation by sound generator, lower hearing thresholds (i.e. better hearing), high Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman, et.al|first1=CW|title=Development of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory|journal=Arch Otolaryngol|date=1996|volume=122|issue=2|pages=143–148|doi=10.1001/archotol.1996.01890140029007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive attitude toward therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariizumi|first1=Y|title=Clinical prognostic factors for tinnitus retraining therapy with a sound generator  in tinnitus patients|journal=J Med Dent Sci|date=2010|volume=57|issue=1|pages=45–53|pmid=20437765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other secondary hearing symptoms===
Despite the fact that there haven't been any recent studies which concluded in its optimal treatment, tinnitus retraining therapy has been applied to treating [[hyperacusis]], [[misophonia]], and [[phonophobia]].&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Limitations===
There is no evidence that TRT or any other treatment can eliminate or decrease tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. As such, the optimal treatment strategy should be directed toward eliminating the disease, rather than simply alleviating the symptom.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} More than half of people with tinnitus have a comorbid psychological injury or illness (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, stress, dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, etc.) that can exacerbate the tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Cause==

===Physiological basis===
It has been proposed that tinnitus is caused by mechanisms that generate abnormal neural activity, specifically one mechanism called discordant damage (dysfunction) of outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Psychological model===
{{See also|Neuroplasticity}}
The psychological basis for TRT stems from the fact that the brain exhibits a high level of plasticity. In turn, this allows it to adjust to any sensory signals as long as they do not lead to negative effects. TRT is imputed to work by interfering with the neural activity causing the tinnitus at its source, in order to prevent it from spreading to other nervous systems such as the limbic and autonomic nervous systems.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

==Methodologies==

===Classification===
Clients are classified into 5 categories. These categories are numbered 0 to 4, and based on whether or not the patient has tinnitus with hearing loss, tinnitus with no hearing loss, tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis, and tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis for an extended amount of time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Counseling===
{{Further|Cognitive behavior therapy}}
The first component of TRT, directive counseling, may change the way tinnitus is perceived. The patient is taught the basic knowledge about the auditory system and its function, the mechanism of tinnitus generation and the annoyance associated with tinnitus. The repetition of these points in the follow-up visits helps the patient to perceive the signal as a non-danger.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Efficacy==
Measuring the efficacy of TRT is beset by confounding factors: tinnitus reporting is entirely subjective therefore not reliable; tinnitus or at least subjects' perception of it varies over time and repeated evaluations are not consistent. Researchers have noted that there is a large placebo component to tinnitus management.  In many commercial TRT practices, there is a large proportion of dropouts; reported 'success' ratios may not take these subjects into account.

There are few available studies, but most show that tinnitus naturally declines over time (years) in a large proportion of subjects surveyed, without any treatment. The annoyance of tinnitus also tends to decline over time.  In at least some, tinnitus spontaneously disappears.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2/&gt;

A Cochrane review found only one sufficiently rigorous study of TRT and noted that while the study suggested benefit in the treatment of tinnitus, the study quality was not good enough to draw firm conclusions.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt; A separate Cochrane review of sound therapy (though they called it masking), an integral part of TRT, found no convincing evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in the treatment of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006371.pub3|chapter=Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2012|last1=Hobson|first1=Jonathan|last2=Chisholm|first2=Edward|last3=El Refaie|first3=Amr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary in The Lancet concluded that in the only decent study, TRT was more effective than masking; in another study in which TRT was used as a control methodology, TRT showed a small benefit.  A study which compared cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in combination with the counselling part of TRT versus standard care (ENT, audiologist, maskers, hearing aid) found that the specialized care had a positive effect on quality of life as well as specific tinnitus metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baguley|first1=D|title=Tinnitus|journal=The Lancet|date=2013|volume=382|issue=9904|pages=1600–07|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60142-7|pmid=23827090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical practice==
Tinnitus activities treatment (TAT) is a clinical adaptation of TRT that focuses on four areas: thoughts and emotions, hearing and communication, sleep, and concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler, et.al.|first1=RS|title=Tinnitus activities treatment|journal=Prog Brain Res.|date=2007|volume=166|pages=425–34|pmid=17956807|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)66041-5|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a 5-step structured clinical protocol for management of tinnitus which may include tinnitus retraining therapy. The five steps are:
# triage – determining appropriate referral, i.e. audiology, ENT, emergency medical intervention, or mental health evaluation;
# audiologic evaluation of hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis and other symptoms;
# group education about causes and management of tinnitus;
# interdisciplinary evaluation of tinnitus;
# individual management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=Using Therapeutic Sound With Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management|journal=Trends Amplif.|date=2008|volume=12|issue=3|pages=188–209|doi=10.1177/1084713808321184|pmc=4134892|pmid=18664499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) now employs PTM to help patients self-manage their tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=VA Clinical Practice Recommendations for Tinnitus|url=http://www.ncrar.research.va.gov/Education/Documents/TinnitusDocuments/TinnitusPracticeGuidelines.pdf|website=National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
* Sound therapy for tinnitus may be more effective if the sound is patterned (i.e. varying in frequency or amplitude) rather than static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reavis, et.al.|first1=KM|title=Patterned sound therapy for the treatment of tinnitus. Hear Jour. 2010;60(11):21–24|journal=Hear jour.|date=2010|volume=60|issue=11|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For persons with severe or disabling tinnitus, techniques that are minimally surgical involving magnetic or electrical stimulation of areas of the brain involved in auditory processing may suppress tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridder, et.al.|first1=DD|title=Magnetic and electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus|journal=J Neurosurg|date=2004|issue=100|doi=10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Notched music therapy, in which ordinary music is altered by a one octave notch filter centered at the tinnitus frequency, may reduce tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henning, et.al.|first1=S|title=Customized notched music training reduces tinnitus loudness|journal=Commun Integr Biol|date=2010|volume=3|issue=3|pages=274–277|pmid=20714412|pmc=2918775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Cognitive behavior therapy===
[[Cognitive behavior therapy]] (CBT), the counselling part of TRT, as a generalized type of psychological and behavioral counselling, has also been used by itself in the management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyung, et.al.|first1=JJ|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Evidence and Efficacy|journal=Korean J Audiol|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=101–104|doi=10.7874/kja.2013.17.3.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing aids===
If tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, a tuned hearing aid that amplifies sound in the frequency range of the hearing loss (usually the high frequencies) may effectively mask tinnitus by raising the level of environmental sound, in addition to the benefit of restoring hearing.

=== Masking ===
{{See also|Tinnitus masker}}
White noise generators or environmental music may be used to provide a background noise level that is of sufficient amplitude that it wholly or partially 'masks' the tinnitus (tinnitus masker).  Composite hearing aids that combine amplification and white noise
generation are also available.

===Other===
Numerous other non-TRT methods have been suggested for the treatment or management of tinnitus.
* pharmacological – No drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating tinnitus. However, various pharmacological treatments, including antidepressants, anxiolytics, vasodilators and vasoactive substances, and intravenous lidocaine have been prescribed for tinnitus
* lifestyle and support – Things like loud noise, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, quiet environments and psychological conditions like stress and depression may exacerbate tinnitus.  Reducing or controlling these may help manage the condition.
* alternative medicine – vitamin, antioxidant and herbal preparations (notably ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' extract, also called [[EGb761]]) are advertised as treatments or cures for tinnitus.  However, none are approved by the FDA, and controlled clinical trials on their efficacy are lacking.

'''''Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission''''', 512 U.S. 622 (1994), is the first of two [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] cases dealing with the [[must-carry]] rules imposed on [[cable television]] [[companies]]. ''Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (II)'', 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second.  ''Turner I'' established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In ''Turner II'' the court decided that the must-carry provisions were constitutional. Under the [[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo|''Miami Herald v. Tornillo'']] case, it was unconstitutional to force a [[newspaper]] to run a story the [[Editing|editors]] would not have included absent a [[government]] statute because it was compelled speech which could not pass the [[strict scrutiny]] of a compelling state interest being achieved with the [[least restrictive means]] necessary to achieve the state interest. However, under the rule of ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'' the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and radio) with far greater discretion.  In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means. 

==Concurrence (Stevens)==
*Congress' policy judgment is entitled to substantial deference
*Statute did not regulate the content of speech and therefore does not require the court to examine it with heightened scrutiny

[[File:IMPORTEXPO IMG 5707 (5972344377).jpg|A wet T-shirt event in [[Toronto]], Canada, 2011|thumb|250px]]

A '''wet T-shirt contest''' is a [[competition]] involving [[exhibitionism]], typically featuring young women contestants at a nightclub, bar, or resort. They have traditionally been a staple of college [[spring break]] celebrations at locations such as [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] and [[Cancún]]. 

Contestants generally wear white or light-colored T-shirts without bras, bikini tops, or other garments beneath. Water (often ice water) is then sprayed or poured onto the participants' chests, causing their T-shirts to turn translucent and cling to their breasts. Contestants may take turns dancing or posing before the audience, with the outcome decided either by crowd reaction or by judges' vote.

In racier contests, participants may tear or crop their T-shirts to expose midriffs, cleavage, or the undersides of their breasts. Depending on local laws, participants may or may not be allowed to remove their T-shirts or strip completely naked during their performance.

In the United States, skiing filmmaker [[Dick Barrymore]] claims in his memoir ''Breaking Even'' to have held the first wet T-shirt contest at [[Sun Valley, Idaho]]'s Boiler Room Bar in January 1971, as part of a promotion for [[K2 Sports|K2]] skis.&lt;ref name=Barrymore&gt;{{cite book |title=Breaking Even |first1=Dick |last1=Barrymore |authorlink=Dick Barrymore |year=1997 |location=Missoula, Mont. |publisher=Pictorial Histories |chapter=Chapter 20: Hot Dogs and Wet T-Shirts |isbn=9781575100371 |oclc=39924562 |url=http://www.dickbarrymore.com/book4.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225173401/http://www.dickbarrymore.com/book4.asp |archivedate=25 December 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was promoted as a simple "T-shirt contest" in which airline stewardesses would dance to music wearing K2 promotional T-shirts. However, the first contestant to appear was a professional stripper who danced topless and the amateur contestants responded by drenching their T-shirts before competing. Barrymore held a second "K2 Wet T-Shirt Contest" in the Rusty Nail at [[Stowe Mountain Resort]], [[Vermont]] in order to film it, despite the fact that Stowe City Council had passed a resolution banning nudity at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=Sep 1998|volume=10|issue=3|issn=1082-2895|publisher=International Skiing History Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlgEAAAAMBAJ|title=Roots of an Olympic sport: freestyle – Part II: Freestyle Comes of Age|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held another promotional contest for K2 on 10 March 1971 at [[Aspen, Colorado]]'s [[The Red Onion]] restaurant and bar,&lt;ref name=Barrymore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ski.curbed.com/archives/2013/07/k2-sun-valley-aspen-the-first-wet-tshirt-contest.php |title=K2, Sun Valley, Aspen &amp; The First Wet T-Shirt Contest |first1=Ryan |last1=Dunfee |date=3 July 2013 |publisher=Curbed Ski |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the contests were featured in a pictorial in the March 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://members.i.playboy.com/Playboy-Magazine-Archive/19720301/page-151 |title=The Shirt Off Her Back |date=March 1972 |journal=[[Playboy]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=151–153 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232459/http://members.i.playboy.com/Playboy-Magazine-Archive/19720301/page-151 |archivedate=30 December 2013 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known mention of the term ''Wet T-shirt contest'' in the press occurred in 1975 in ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', describing the contest's appearance at New Orleans discotheques. The contest subsequently became established at [[spring break]] events in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], with some bar owners being fined under [[public indecency]] laws for holding one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wet T-Shirt Contests Pack Pubs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8SYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qs0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=848,4319900&amp;dq=history+of+the+wet+t+shirt+contest |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |page=B20 |date=11 November 1975 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kutner&gt;{{cite web|title=The Short, Sexist History of the Wet T-Shirt Contest, a Symbol of Spring Break Debauchery|url=https://mic.com/articles/138633/the-short-sexist-history-of-the-wet-t-shirt-contest-a-symbol-of-spring-break-debauchery|author=Jenny Kutner|date=25 March 2016|access-date=13 July 2018|website=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacqueline Bisset]]'s appearance in the 1977 film [[The Deep (1977 film)|''The Deep'']], where she swam underwater wearing only a T-shirt for a top, helped to bring the wet T-shirt contest to broader public awareness.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite web |author=Chodin |title=A History of the Wet T-Shirt Contest |url=http://www.uproxx.com/feature/2010/05/a-history-of-the-wet-t-shirt-contest/ |publisher=Uproxx |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67PVzbZwG?url=http://www.uproxx.com/feature/2010/05/a-history-of-the-wet-t-shirt-contest/ |archive-date=4 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1979 album ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' the track "Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt" tells of Mary from [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Canoga Park]] who takes part in a wet T-shirt contest in order to raise money to return home after being abandoned by a rock group in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC|first=Kelly Fisher|last=Lowe|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2007|isbn=9780803260054|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 American [[reality film]] ''[[The Real Cancun]]'' included a wet T-shirt contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Hypersexual Society: Sexual Discourse, Erotica, and Pornography in America Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQjIAAAAQBAJ|first=K.|last=Kammeyer|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9780230616608|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish festival of [[La Tomatina]], a large public tomato fight where participants become soaked with juice from tomatoes, has been suggested as another possible origin of the wet T-shirt contest, although La Tomatina began in 1945.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kutner/&gt;

==Controversies==
===Law firm===
In 1983 the [[King &amp; Spalding]] law firm in Atlanta asked women summer interns attending that firm's annual picnic to participate in a wet T-shirt contest. The proposed contest was replaced with a [[swimsuit competition]] and the winner was promised a permanent job on graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Wet T-Shirt Lawyers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1983/12/23/wet-t-shirt-lawyers/c46ac2e6-2827-49a7-9041-f00ac5f21753/|date=23 December 1983|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants said they felt humiliated but did not protest because they were candidates for jobs with the firm. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' included details of the event in a front page article on sex discrimination in large law firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Follow the Story: How to Write Successful Nonfiction|first=James B.|last=Stewart|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzE21nIvPWMC|isbn=9780684850672|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a wet T-shirt contest was proposed led to the case being used to demonstrate institutional sexism in law firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Why Are There So Few Black Lawyers in Corporate Law Firms: An Institutional Analysis|first1=David B.|last1=Wilkins|first2=G. Mitu|last2=Gulati|date=May 1996|volume=84|issue=3|journal=California Law Review|url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1648&amp;context=californialawreview|page=557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In-flight contest===
In 1997, teenagers from [[Portland, Oregon]], celebrating the completion of [[high school]] held a wet T-shirt contest on a [[Boeing 727]] en route to a [[Mexico|Mexican]] resort, with a [[flight attendant]] encouraging the activity. An [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigation followed, as pilots supposedly judged the contest on the flight deck, disregarding rules that passengers are not allowed in the cockpit. A video showed contestants emerging from the cockpit wearing wet T-shirts. The FAA disciplined the pilots for sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wet T-Shirt Blog |url=http://www.wetTshirtBlog.com/wet-t-shirt/flight-scandal-wet-t-shirt-contest-at-25-000-feet/ |title=Flight Scandal – wet t-shirt contest at 25.000 feet |publisher=Wet T-Shirt Blog |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underage contestants===
Lawsuits have been filed on behalf of underaged contestants who lied about their age to participate in wet T-shirt contests.

In 2002, the parents of teenager Monica Pippin brought a federal lawsuit against [[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy Entertainment]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], Deslin Hotels, [[Best Buy]], and other companies relating to her appearance the previous year in a Daytona Beach wet T-shirt contest, at which time she had been a 16-year-old high school student. Pippin had danced topless during the contest and had allowed men to pour jugs of water over her bare breasts. After footage of her performance began to appear in videos and on cable television, a neighbor alerted Pippin's parents, who retained a lawyer. Although Pippin admitted in court that she had lied to contest organizers about her age, her attorney claimed that, as a minor, she was unable to give informed consent to perform or be filmed topless. Pippin settled with Anheuser-Busch and Playboy in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Graham |url=http://www.SPtimes.com/2006/04/28/Hillsborough/Lawsuit_says_video_ex.shtml/ |work=St. Petersburg Times |title=Lawsuit says video exploits teen's naivete |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar suit in 2007, two women sued Deslin Hotels, [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]], and various websites that published footage of their appearance in another 2001 Daytona Beach contest. The two girls, who were both sixteen at the time, had been filmed exposing their breasts, buttocks, and pubic areas. Like Pippin, they had lied about their age to gain admission to the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=''Times'' staff writer |url=http://www.SPtimes.com/2007/03/14/Hillsborough/Two_sue_over_footage_.shtml |title=Two sue over footage of wet t-shirt contest |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=14 March 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zvyazda''''' ({{lang-be|Звязда}}, {{IPA-be|zʲvʲaˈzda|}}, literally: ''"The Star"'') is a [[state-owned]] daily newspaper in [[Belarus]].

==History and profile==
''Zvyazda'' was founded in 1917 as an organ of the [[Minsk]] Committee of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ([[Bolsheviks]]).

''Zvyazda'' was twice closed down by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] but continued being published under different names. At some periods of [[World War I]] and the [[Polish-Soviet war]] Zvyazda was printed in [[Smolensk]]. From 10 July 1944 ''Zvyazda'' has been published in [[Minsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zbigniew Brzezinski|author2=Paige Sullivan|title=Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States: Documents, Data, and Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&amp;pg=PA303|accessdate=22 December 2014|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-1-56324-637-1|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Till 1991 it was an official newspaper of the [[Communist Party of Belarus]] and the Communist parliament and government of Belarus. During the Soviet era, the paper received the [[Order of the Great Patriotic War]] and the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Since August 1927 the newspaper has been printed in [[Belarusian language]] only. It is the only daily newspaper published in the Belarusian language in the country.&lt;ref name=inas&gt;{{cite news|author=Ina Studinskaya|title=Belarusian Economic Woes Hit State Media|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/belarus_economic_woes_hit_state_media/24497546.html|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=Radio Free Europe|date=27 February 2012|location=Minsk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] remaining communists tried to publish the newspaper illegally on the territory of [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany|Nazi-occupied Belarus]].

''Zvyazda'' is owned by the [[Government of Belarus|Belarus government]].&lt;ref name=inas/&gt; In 2012 its print run was reduced to 30,000 copies.&lt;ref name=inas/&gt;
