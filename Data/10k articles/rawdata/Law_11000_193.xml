__NOTOC__
On 30 November 2007, the business leaders of 150 global companies published a communiqué to world leaders calling for a comprehensive, legally binding [[United Nations]] framework to tackle [[climate change]].

The initiative represents an unprecedented coming together of the international business community and includes some of the biggest companies and brands from around the world, including the [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[China]].

It has been led by The [[Prince of Wales]]’s UK and EU Corporate Leaders Groups on Climate Change [https://web.archive.org/web/20070417135017/http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/bep/clgcc/], which are developed and run by the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]].

It was hoped that the Bali Communiqué will have a significant impact on the UN climate negotiations starting on December 3, 2007 in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]] (see [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]).

The Bali Communiqué calls for:

*a comprehensive, legally binding United Nations framework to tackle climate change 
*emission reduction targets to be guided primarily by science 
*those countries that have already industrialised to make the greatest effort 
*world leaders to seize the window of opportunity and agree on a work plan of negotiations to ensure an agreement can come into force after 2012 (when the existing [[Kyoto Protocol]] expires)

== Text ==
The Bali Communiqué reads as follows:

{{quote|This communiqué comes from the business leaders of over 150 global companies. It is being issued in advance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2007, taking place from December 3 to 14 in Bali, Indonesia.

The scientific evidence is now overwhelming. Climate change presents very serious global social, environmental and economic risks and it demands an urgent global response.

As business leaders, it is our belief that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the costs of not acting:

The economic and geopolitical costs of unabated climate change could be very severe and globally disruptive. All countries and economies will be affected, but it will be the poorest countries that will suffer earliest and the most. 
The costs of action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change are manageable, especially if guided by a common international vision. 
Each year we delay action to control global emissions increases the risk of unavoidable consequences that will likely necessitate even steeper reductions in the future, causing potentially greater economic, environmental and social disruption. 
The shift to a [[low-carbon economy]] will create significant business opportunities. New markets for low-carbon technologies and products, worth billions of dollars, will be created if the world acts on the scale required. 
In summary, we believe that tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy. Ignoring it will ultimately undermine [[economic growth]].

It is our view that a sufficiently ambitious, international and comprehensive legally binding United Nations agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will provide business with the certainty it needs to scale up global investment in low-carbon technologies. We believe that an enhanced and extended [[emissions trading|carbon market]] needs to be part of this framework as it offers the necessary flexibility, allows for a cost-effective transition and provides financial support to developing countries.

In order to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous climate change]], the overall targets for emissions reduction must be guided primarily by science. Even an immediate peaking in global emissions would require a subsequent reduction of at least 50% by 2050, according to the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change]], and the later the peak in emissions, the greater the required reduction. All countries will need to play their part but we recognise that the greatest effort must be made by those countries that have already industrialised.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December in Bali, Indonesia, countries will have an opportunity to agree a work-plan of comprehensive negotiations to ensure such an agreement can be signed in [[Copenhagen]] in 2009, to come into force after 2012.

We urge world leaders to seize this window of opportunity.

In return, we pledge to engage positively with governments to help develop the policies and measures that are needed internationally and nationally for the business sector to contribute effectively to building a low carbon economy.}}

The '''International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments''' ('''Ballast Water Management Convention''' or '''BWM Convention''') is a 2004 international [[maritime law|maritime treaty]] which requires signatory [[flag state]]s to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with standards and procedures for the management and control of ships' [[ballast water]] and sediments.&lt;ref name=IMO-BWM&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Control-and-Management-of-Ships%27-Ballast-Water-and-Sediments-(BWM).aspx|title=BWM Convention |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another and halt damage to the marine environment from [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water discharge]], by minimising the uptake and subsequent discharge of sediments and organisms.&lt;ref name=IMO-BWM/&gt; From 2024 all ships are required to have approved Ballast Water Management Treatment System, according to the D2 standard (see below). Existing ships are required to install an approved system, which may cost up to 5 million USD per ship to install.&lt;ref name=BWMCost&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ballastwatermanagement.co.uk/news/view,counting-the-cost-of-ballast-treatment_42146.htm|title=BWM Convention: counting the cost |publisher=Ballast Water Treatment Technology |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assist with implementation the IMO has released 14 Guidance documents in regards to the Convention including the G2 Guidelines for Ballast Water Sampling, G4 Guidelines for Ballast Water management and G6 Guidelines for Ballast Water Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Development and Entry into force==
The first scientifically recognised occurrence of a non-indigenous marine species being transported in ships water occurred in the North Sea in 1903, with the Asian phytoplankton Odontella appearing. The issue became more prevalent with the increase in shipping in the late 20th century and the issue was raised for the first time at the IMO in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Following several years of development, the Convention was adopted by the [[International Maritime Organization]] in 2004. &lt;ref name=IMO-BWM/&gt; To enter into force, the Convention required ratification by a minimum of 30 States, representing 35% of world merchant shipping tonnage, subject to which it would enter into force 12 months later.&lt;ref name=Mar-Exec1&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ballast-water-convention-to-enter-into-force-in-2017|title=BWM Convention to enter into force in 2017 |publisher=Maritime Executive|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 2016, [[Finland]] acceded to the Convention, bringing the contracting states to 52 and the combined tonnage of States to 35.14%.&lt;ref name=Mar-Exec1/&gt; This triggered the applicability of the entry into force date of the Convention, which occurred on 8 September 2017.&lt;ref name=IMO-BWM-media&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/BWM/Pages/default.aspx|title= Ballast water management - the control of harmful invasive species|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldMaritimeNews&gt;{{cite web |url= http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/201520/imos-bwm-convention-to-enter-into-force-in-september-2017/|title= IMO’s BWM Convention to Enter Into Force in September 2017|publisher=World Maritime News |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mar-Exec1/&gt; Since Finland, a number of States have continued to ratify the treaty, bringing the total as of November 2018 to 78 contracting States, representing 77.19 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage.&lt;ref name=IMO-Treaties&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/Status%20of%20Treaties.pdf|title=Status of Treaties |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements of the Convention==
All international sea going [[ships]] under the Convention must implement a ‘Ballast water management plan’ that enables the ship to manage their ballast water and sediment discharge to a certain standard.&lt;ref name=IMO-BWM-media/&gt; The plan is designed to meet the requirements for compliance with the Convention and the G4 Guidelines produced by the IMO. It includes standard operational guidance, planning and management, as well as additional details including sampling points and systems.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.123 - 124&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally all ships over 400GT must also carry a ballast water record book that details such requirements as the filling and discharge of each tank, according to time, date, location and the treatment applied to the water.&lt;ref name=WitherbyBallast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.witherbyseamanship.com/ballast-water-record-book-3rd-edition.html |title=Ballast Water Record Book, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Witherby Publishing Group]] |access-date=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019003921/http://www.witherbyseamanship.com/ballast-water-record-book-3rd-edition.html |archive-date=2017-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ships that comply with the Convention will receive and are duly required to carry an international ballast water management [[certification|certificate]].&lt;ref name=LRGuidance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lr.org/en/_images/229-77062_Understanding_Ballast_Water_Management_0314_tcm155-248816.0_August%202016.pdf |title=Understanding ballast water management |publisher=[[Lloyd’s Register]] |access-date=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712215631/http://www.lr.org/en/_images/229-77062_Understanding_Ballast_Water_Management_0314_tcm155-248816.0_August%202016.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To receive a certificate, a ship will have to supply the necessary documentation showing compliance with the Convention and a survey will be carried out on-board.&lt;ref name=DNVGL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swedishclub.com/media_upload/files/Member%20Alerts/2017/Technical_Regulatory_News_No_02_2017.pdf|title=BWM CONVENTION – APPLICATION AND REQUIREMENTS |publisher=[[DNV GL]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey may be carried out by a flag State, or by a Classification Society who have been authorised by a flag State.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; The convention is monitored by Port State Control, who must assess the ballast water management plan and its operation on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Standards===
Under the Convention, ships are required, according to a timetable of implementation, to comply with the D1 or D2 standards.&lt;ref name=LRGuidance/&gt; 
The D1 standard requires ships to carry out a ballast water exchange, and specifies the volume of water that must be replaced. &lt;ref name=BritanniaP&amp;I&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britanniapandi.com/focus/ballast-water-management/|title=Ballast Water Management|publisher=Britannia [[P&amp;I club]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard involves exchanging the uptaken discharge water from the last port, with new sea water; it must occur at a minimum of 200 nautical miles from shore. The D2 standard is more stringent and requires the use of an approved ballast water treatment system. The system must ensure that only small levels of viable organisms remain left in water after treatment so as to minimise the [[Environmental impact of shipping]].&lt;ref name=BritanniaP&amp;I/&gt;

New ships will be required to install and comply with the D2 standard from the 8th September 2017, once the Convention has entered into force.&lt;ref name=HellenicShippingNews&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/mepc-71-brief-ballast-water-management-implementation-scheme-agreed-in-principle/|title= MEPC 71 Brief: Ballast Water Management Implementation Scheme Agreed in Principle|publisher=Hellenic Shipping News |access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing ships, who are subject to the phased implementation schedule, have potentially (depending on the renewal of their ship certificates) until the 8th September 2024, by which time all ships will comply with the D2 standard.&lt;ref name=HellenicShippingNews/&gt;

It is also possible for ships to discharge ballast at approved shore reception facilities in [[ports]], as article 5 requires that when cleaning or repair of a ships [[ballast tank]]s occurs, ports should have adequate reception facilities for the sediments.&lt;ref name=IMO-BWM/&gt; Facilities must include safe disposal arrangements, storage and treatment equipment, safe and suitable mooring and emergency arrangements and the necessary reducers for connections to ships.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar &amp; Churcher, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ships may be exempted from complying with the Convention, according to certain conditions and the appropriate permission being given by a flag State.&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt; These include ships trading in a limited area, small vessels including [[sailboats]] and [[fishing vessels]], vessels only operating on one coast and also [[FPSO]]s.&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt;

The '''Bermuda Agreement''' (formally '''Agreement between the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the United States relating to Air Services between their respective Territories'''), reached in 1946 by [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] negotiators in [[Bermuda]], was an early [[bilateral air transport agreement]] regulating civil [[air transport]]. It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the [[Bermuda II Agreement]], which was signed in 1977 and effective in 1978.

==Background==
[[File:Boeing_314_Clipper-cropped.jpg|thumb|Boeing 314 flying boat]]
During [[World War II]], transatlantic air service between Britain and America was limited to [[Boeing 314]] [[flying boat]] service between Baltimore and Foynes, which [[Pan American World Airways]] had begun in July 1939. [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) also flew the route using three Boeing 314s purchased from Pan Am.&lt;ref name="cof"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginnings of Commercial Transatlantic Services|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/atlantic_route/Tran4.htm|publisher=US Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bermuda Agreement arose in the wake of the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Conference]] of 1944, where the United States and United Kingdom disagreed about economic control of international air transport. The US and UK had generally agreed on the first two [[freedoms of the air]] (overflight and landings for repair/refueling) but the UK and several other countries refused to accept the US position on the third, fourth and fifth freedoms regarding the handling of passenger and cargo traffic.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=John C.|title=The Bermuda Plan: World Pattern for Air Transport|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1946-10-01/bermuda-plan-world-pattern-air-transport|accessdate=8 May 2015|work=Foreign Affairs|date=October 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the US sought the freedom for its carriers to determine capacity and frequencies on international routes, while the UK sought predetermined routes and an equal division of capacity between the two nations' carriers on those routes.&lt;ref name="azzie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azzie|first1=Ralph|title=Specific Problems Solved by the Negotiation of Bilateral Air Agreements|journal=McGill Law Journal|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303-308|url=http://www.lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/7941147-azzie.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain had lost much of its air fleet in the course of [[World War II]] and was reluctant to place itself in full competition with the stronger American air fleet.&lt;ref name="haanappel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haanappel|first1=PPC|title=Bilateral Air Transport Agreements - 1913-1980|journal=Maryland Journal of International Law|date=1980|volume=5|issue=2|pages=241-267|url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1067&amp;context=mjil|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Bermuda Agreement, the United States signed bilateral aviation agreements with several other European countries (Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark), and had signed a multilateral Transport Agreement with several European and Latin American countries, but service to and from the United Kingdom had to be negotiated with the British government on an ad hoc basis. As of late 1945, the UK had limited transatlantic traffic by the US to 14 services per week, 500 seats per week and a minimum fare of $375.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; 

In July 1945, the US government granted Pan Am, [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) and American Export Airlines (shortly thereafter acquired by [[American Airlines]] and renamed [[American Overseas Airlines]]) the right to operate transatlantic service. American began its [[Douglas DC-4]] service between New York and [[Bournemouth]] that October.&lt;ref name="cof" /&gt; Pan Am announced its own DC-4 service in October 1945 at prices less than 50% of the previous [[flying boat]] fares, which led the British government to pressure both Pan Am and the US government to back away from what Britain described as a "wholly uneconomic proposition."&lt;ref name="masefield"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masefield|first1=Peter|title=Bermuda 1|journal=Putnam Aeronautical Review|date=1990|volume=2|issue=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOGCd7QreKgC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;ots=pif5u2PL4O&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US and UK governments agreed in late 1945 to meet and discuss the terms of a bilateral aviation agreement. Bermuda was chosen to host the meeting due to its location between the two countries and isolation from their respective governments. In a sign of the rapidly advancing technology of the time, the British delegation arrived in January by [[Boeing 314]] flying boats, and departed in February by [[Lockheed 049 Constellation]] pressurized landplanes.&lt;ref name="masefield" /&gt;

Unlike the existing bilateral and multilateral aviation agreements, the Bermuda Agreement defined specific routes on which each countries' carriers could fly, with the right to pick up or discharge international traffic (but no [[cabotage]] rights) at any point along the routes:&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

* British carriers:
** London - New York - San Francisco - Honolulu / Midway / Wake / Guam / Manila - Singapore / Hong Kong
** London - New York - New Orleans - Mexico
** London - New York - Cuba - Jamaica / Panama - Colombia / Ecuador / Peru / Chile
* United States carriers: 
** US points - London - Netherlands / Germany / Scandinavia / Russia
** US points - London - Belgium - Central Europe - Near East - India
** Honolulu - Hong Kong - China / India
** Honolulu - Hong Kong - Singapore - Netherlands East Indies

The inclusion of many fifth freedom routes (beyond the United States and British Isles) reflected the fact that many territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore and India were still British colonies at the time the agreement was signed, and that many third countries were eager for air service and willing to provide rights to British and American carriers without restrictions.&lt;ref name="haanappel" /&gt;

As a compromise on the capacity issue, the Bermuda Agreement provided for equitable principles that "there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex" and that "in the operation by the air carriers of either Government of the trunk services described in the Annex to the Agreement, the interest of the air carriers of the other Government shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides."&lt;ref name="azzie" /&gt;

Fares were made subject to regulatory approval by authorities in each country or by the [[International Air Transport Association]], effectively giving the IATA immunity from US antitrust law, which immunity remained in effect on North Atlantic routes until 1979.&lt;ref name="haanappel" /&gt;

==Operations under the agreement==
===1940s===
[[File:Pan Am L-049 Constellation at London.jpg|thumb|Pan Am Lockheed Constellation at [[Heathrow Airport]], London]]
Pan Am took delivery of the [[Lockheed 749 Constellation]] in June 1947 and began its "round-the-world" route with eastbound stops in New York, Gander, Shannon, London, Istanbul, Dhahran, Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Manila, Shanghai, Tokyo, Guam, Wake, Midway, Honolulu and San Francisco, taking advantage of Bermuda Agreement fifth freedom rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pan Am Series – Part XXI: The Constellation|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg52856.html|publisher=California Aviation Alliance|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100049/http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg52856.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newfoundland]], an essential refueling stop on any transatlantic air route in the 1940s, was part of Britain at the time the Bermuda Agreement was signed. In 1949, following its accession as a Canadian province, the United States signed an agreement with Canada to provide for fifth freedom rights to and from [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]].&lt;ref name="haanappel" /&gt;

===1950s===
[[File:DH_Comet_1_BOAC_Heathrow_1953.jpg|thumb|BOAC de Havilland Comet jet]]
Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines in 1950, concentrating the US-UK air travel market to three carriers: Pan Am, TWA and BOAC.

BOAC, still Britain's sole transatlantic carrier, sought to compete with Pan Am's "round the world" service by offering an "all-red" route from Britain to Australia via Canada, but bilateral agreements between the UK and these countries stalled in the early 1950s. BOAC proceeded to open a London-Chicago route in May 1954, with the intention to extend the service to San Francisco and Tokyo. The San Francisco extension was not realized until 1957, and US government approval for the Tokyo service did not come until 1959 due to objections by [[Northwest Airlines]].&lt;ref name="higham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higham|first1=Robin|title=Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC|date=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780764627|pages=179-182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcPhDaUNSHwC&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BOAC introduced [[de Havilland Comet]] jet service on the London-New York route in 1958. TWA began jet service on the New York-London-Frankfurt route in 1959.

===1960s===

The United States began to exercise an even more dominant position in the transatlantic market during the 1960s. One key issue was that Pan Am and TWA began to use the [[hub and spoke]] system to feed passengers from many US destinations through a transatlantic "gateway" and on to Europe, giving the US carriers an advantage in serving secondary markets. Partly as a result of this competitive pressure, the market share of BOAC on transatlantic routes fell from 37.8% in 1961-62 to 30.9% by 1966-67.&lt;ref name="hoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Eighteenth Report: AIR SERVICE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmenvtra/532/53206.htm|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===

The British government added a privately owned carrier, [[British Caledonian]], to the transatlantic market in 1973, with flights from London's [[Gatwick Airport]] to New York and Los Angeles. BCal was forced to exit the market in 1976 after the British government determined that competition was not improving Britain's overall market share.

==Termination==
In 1976, the British government announced its intention to renounce the agreement, beginning the negotiation of the [[Bermuda II Agreement]] which became effective in 1978.&lt;ref name="hoc" /&gt; Although the UK initially sought an equal division of capacity between UK and US carriers, the final Bermuda II agreement largely preserved the liberal capacity provisions of Bermuda I.&lt;ref name="haanappel" /&gt;

The Bermuda agreements were replaced in two stages on 30 March 2008, and 24 June 2010, by the [[EU–US Open Skies Agreement]] between the European Union (representing 25 European countries) and the United States, providing for an Open Skies regime even more liberal than Bermuda I.

==Effect on other aviation agreements==

Both the United States and the United Kingdom made the Bermuda Agreement their model for bilateral agreements with other countries until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Aeroflot]] as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details of service to the airlines' prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and sixth freedom rights (traffic rights to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary.&lt;ref name="haanappel" /&gt; The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements.&lt;ref name="azzie" /&gt;

A '''cartel''' is a group of apparently independent producers whose goal is to increase their collective profits by means of [[price fixing]], limiting supply, or other [[anti-competitive practices|restrictive practices]]. Cartels typically control selling prices, but some are organized to control the prices of purchased inputs. [[Competition law|Antitrust]] [[law|laws]] attempt to deter or forbid cartels. A single entity that holds a [[monopoly]] by this definition cannot be a cartel, though it may be guilty of abusing said monopoly in other ways. Cartels usually occur in [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], where there are a small number of sellers and usually involve [[commodity|homogeneous products]]. 

In general, cartels can be divided into domestic and international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regulating Competition: Cartel registers in the twentieth-century world|last=Fellman|first=Susanna|last2=Shanahan|first2=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138021648|location=London|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Export cartels constitute a special case of international cartels. Unlike other cartels they are legal in virtually all jurisdictions, despite their harmful effects on affected markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martyniszyn |first1=Marek |title=Export Cartels: Is it Legal to Target your Neighbour? Analysis in Light of Recent Case Law |journal=Journal of International Economic Law |date=2012 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=181 |doi=10.1093/jiel/jgs003 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bid rigging]] is a special type of cartel.

== Overview ==
{{Quote|text=People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. |author=Adam Smith |source=''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776}}

A survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is about 23 percent.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Connor. Cartel Overcharges, pp. 249-387 of The Law and Economics of Class Actions, in Vol. 29 of Research in Law and Economics, edited by James Langenfeld (March 2014). Bingley, UK: Emerald House Publishing Ltd. June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Private international cartels (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28 percent, whereas domestic cartels averaged 18 percent. Less than 10 percent of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices.

In general, cartel agreements are [[economics|economically]] unstable in that there is an [[incentive]] for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel (see also [[game theory]]). This has caused many cartels that attempt to set product [[price]]s to be unsuccessful in the [[long term]]. Empirical studies of 20th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years. However, once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly-known cartels that do not follow this [[Business cycle|cycle]] include, by some accounts, the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).

[[Price fixing]] is often practiced internationally. When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral [[treaty]] or protected by national sovereignty, no antitrust actions may be initiated. Examples of such price fixing include oil whose price is partly controlled by the supply by OPEC countries. Also international airline tickets have prices fixed by agreement with the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], a practice for which there is a specific exception in antitrust law. 

Prior to World War II (except in the United States), members of cartels could sign contracts that were enforceable in courts of law. There were even instances where cartels are encouraged by states. For example, during the period before 1945, cartels were tolerated in Europe and were promoted as a business practice in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competition Policy in the European Union|last=Cini|first=Michelle|last2=McGowan|first2=Lee|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=0-230-00675-2|location=New York|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the norm due to the accepted benefits, which even the U.S. Supreme court has noted. In the case, ''the'' ''U.S. v. National Lead Co. et al.'', it cited the testimony of individuals, who cited that a cartel, in its protean form, is "a combination of producers for the purpose of regulating production and, frequently, prices, and an association by agreement of companies or sections of companies having common interests so as to prevent extreme or unfair competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies to Achieve a Binding International Agreement on Regulating Cartels: Overcoming Doha Standstill|last=Lee|first=John|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=978-981-10-2755-0|location=Berlin|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, however, price fixing by private entities is illegal under the antitrust laws of more than 140 countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are [[lysine]], [[citric acid]], [[graphite]] [[electrode]]s and bulk [[vitamin]]s. This is highlighted in countries with market economy wherein price-fixing and the concept of cartels are considered inimical to free and fair competition, which is considered the backbone of political democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Controlling International Technology Transfer: Issues, Perspectives, and Policy Implications|last=Sagafi-Nejad|first=Tagi|last2=Moxon|first2=Richard|last3=Perlmutter|first3=Howard|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=2017|isbn=0-08-027180-4|location=New York|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current condition makes it increasingly difficult for cartels to maintain sustainable operations. Even if international cartels might be out of reach for the regulatory authorities, they will still have to contend with the fact that their activities in domestic markets will be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Fellman &amp; Shanahan, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]
[[OPEC]]: As its name suggests, OPEC is organized by [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state (polity)|states]].  The traditional view holds that it cannot be held to antitrust enforcement in other [[jurisdiction]]s by virtue of the [[doctrine]] of [[state immunity]] under [[public international law]]. It serves as an example of state entanglement in anticompetitive conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martyniszyn |first1=Marek |title=Foreign State’s Entanglement in Anticompetitive Conduct |journal=World Competition |date=2017 |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=299 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3116910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[trade association]]s, especially in [[industry|industries]] dominated by only a few major companies, have been accused of being fronts for cartels or facilitating secret meetings among cartel members.

Although cartels are usually thought of as a group of [[corporation]]s, the free-market economist [https://web.archive.org/web/20100624071027/http://www.cbe.csueastbay.edu/~sbesc/99septcol.html Charles W. Baird] considers [[trade union]]s to be cartels, as they seek to raise the price of labor ([[wage]]s) by preventing [[competition]]. For example, [[negotiated cartelism]] is a labor arrangement in which labor prices are held above the market clearing level through union leverage over employers.

An example of a new international cartel is the one created by the members of the [[Asian Racing Federation]] and documented in the [[Good Neighbour Policy (horse racing)|Good Neighbor Policy]] signed on September 1, 2003.

==Australia==
{{see also|Censorship in Australia}}
In 2010, the [[Australian Labor Party]] announced its intent to subject the 220,000 mobile apps available on the Australia App Store to [[Australian Classification Board]] regulations, which require that developers pay evaluation fees ranging from $470 to $2040.&lt;ref name='Bodey 2010-08-16'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Bodey | title = Apps and games to face censor, says ALP | date = 16 August 2010 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/apps-and-games-to-face-censor-says-alp/story-e6frg996-1225905609780 | work = The Australian | accessdate = 2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 article in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' clarified that "Australians will soon be able to complain about mobile game apps they take offence to and get them removed from app stores such as Apple's iTunes if they're deemed 'refused classification'. And if mobile game apps are classified anything above MA15+ and the government doesn't introduce an R18+ games classification (which it plans to vote on in July), then any game app rated over MA15+ will also be refused classification." Sentiments were also expressed over other apps: "What is unclear, however, is how the Classification Board will classify apps that aren't necessarily games like [[Grindr]], an app for gay users which uses [GPS] to find nearby males".&lt;ref name='SMH 2011-03-09'&gt;{{cite news | first = Ben | last = Grubb | title = Government to censor iTunes app store | date = 9 March 2011 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/smartphone-apps/government-to-censor-itunes-app-store-20110309-1bng2.html | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Admiralty law}}
In a [[contract of carriage]], the '''consignee''' is the entity who is financially responsible (the buyer) for the receipt of a [[shipment]].  Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver.

If a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the ''sender'', the recipient is the ''consignee'', and the deliverer is the ''carrier''.

==A brief statement of law==
This is a difficult area of [[law]] in that it regulates the mass [[transport]]ation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that [[good (accounting)|goods]] will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or [[freight]] carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and [[fraudulent]] individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimate]] consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the [[documentation]]. The standard form of contract is a [[bill of lading]] which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a [[Charter-party|charter party]]. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. 

=== Documentation and legal requirements for delivery ===

A straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air [[waybill]] are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an "order" or "bearer" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the [[Hague Rules]], and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in [[Hong Kong]], there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in "The Rafaela S" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and "The Happy Ranger" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of [[cargo]] being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge [[port]].

=== Consignee rights ===

The rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the [[Warsaw Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the [[Montreal Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)
This is very important as per export documents.

The receiver can be different than that of the consignee.

===IMPORTANCE===
It is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received.
It helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of [[trade]] and payment.
It informs the selling price to the [[consignee]]. 
It helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer.</text>

A '''courtroom sketch''' is an artistic depiction of the proceedings in a [[court]] of law. In many jurisdictions, cameras are not allowed in courtrooms in order to prevent distractions and preserve privacy. This requires news media to rely on [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] artists for illustrations of the proceedings.

==Creating courtroom sketches==
Courtroom sketch artists attend judicial proceedings as members of the public or as credentialed media depending on the venue and jurisdiction. Judges may require or allow artists to sit in a designated area or they may sit in general public seating. In some jurisdictions, including the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/contempt_of_court/|title=Contempt of Court|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |author= Guy Dammann |title= A sketchy future for courtroom artists |date=14 November 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2006/nov/14/courtroomartblog |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/7889947f4e45de60c825648300287125?OpenDocument |title=Chapter 228, Section 7 – Summary Offences Ordinance |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; courtroom artists are not permitted to sketch proceedings while in court and must create sketches from memory or notes after leaving the courtroom.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Courtroom artists can quickly capture a moment on paper and then sell their work to media outlets who would otherwise be denied a visual record of the trial. They may be paid per sketch or on a [[per diem]] commission. Sketches are often sold to television stations, newswire services, newspapers, or the subjects of a sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=As courtroom sketch artist, she's the people's witness |date=23 February 2009 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/courtroom-sketch-artist-people-witness-article-1.307429 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtroom sketches may also be acquired by institutional archives. The entire set of courtroom sketches related to the [[Lindy Chamberlain]] trial were purchased by the [[National Museum of Australia]] from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Courtroom drawings sketch Chamberlain's history |author=Anna Morozow |date=25 July 2011 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-25/chamberlain-court-sketches-go-on-display/2808280 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected works of American court artists Richard Tomlinson and Elizabeth Williams are held at the Lloyd Sealy Library at the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name=cuny&gt;{{cite web |title=Classified Information the Lloyd Sealy Library Newsletter |date=Spring 2012 |url=http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/newsletter/spring2012/Spring2012.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other collections of courtroom art include the works of [[Howard Brodie]] held in the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; and the Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States, which holds selected court artwork from artist Aggie Kenny.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom/&gt;

A courtroom artist must work quickly, particularly during [[arraignment]] hearings where a witness may appear in court for only a few minutes. A television-ready illustration can be produced in that time, and viewed on television after a court proceeding is finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sakai |first=Mike |title=Courtroom sketch artist in Loughner case says eyes tell the story |date=16 January 2011 |publisher=East Valley Tribune |url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/article_6bb05b78-202c-11e0-b4df-001cc4c03286.html |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtroom artists can be barred from drawing alleged victims of sexual abuse, minors, and jurors or some witnesses in high-profile trials.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom /&gt;

==In the United States==
[[File:Katy Metz cross examined.jpg|thumb|An 1889 courtroom sketch from the trial of ex-[[Alderman]] Thomas Cleary, which was published in ''[[The New York Times]]''.]]
Courtroom sketches in the United States date back as far as the 19th century. Courtroom sketch artists were present for the trial of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and the impeachment of [[Andrew Johnson]].&lt;ref name=coveringcourts&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giles |first1=Robert H. |last2=Snyder |first2=Robert W |title=Covering the courts: free press, fair trials &amp; journalistic performance |year=1999 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0462-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=syracuse&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary Courtroom Artists |publisher=Syracuse University |url=http://suart.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1976-Contemporary-Courtroom-Artists.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, there were well-known court artists and [[printmaker]]s such as [[George Caleb Bingham]] and David G. Blyth. Sketches during this era were reproduced as engravings in print publications, because photography was not a practical option for courtroom news coverage.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt;

As mass media technology advanced in the early twentieth century, courts began experimenting with allowing photography and radio broadcasts of court proceedings. Following the media "circus" surrounding the trial of [[Richard Hauptmann|Richard Bruno Hauptmann]] for the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], broadcasts from federal courtrooms were banned by Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.&lt;ref name=setonhall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarner |first=Joshua |date=Summer 2000 |title=Comment: Justice, Take Two: The Continuing Debate over Cameras in the Courtroom|journal=Seton Hall Constitutional Law Journal |publisher=Seton Hall University |volume=10 |issue= |pages=1053–1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[American Bar Association]] adopted Judicial Canon 35, which prohibited the use of motion or still [[cameras in the courtroom]] and was codified into law by the majority of states.&lt;ref name=setonhall /&gt; On the other hand, no state or federal court prohibited the publication of courtroom sketches and courtroom sketch artistry continued.&lt;ref name=usvcbs&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States of America v.

In 1973, courtroom artist Aggie Whelan (Kenny) was hired by [[CBS]] to illustrate the [[Gainesville Eight]] trial.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt; The judge presiding over the trial, [[Winston E. Arnow]], ordered that no sketches were to be made in the courtroom and that no sketches of the trial be published, even if those sketches were made outside of the court from memory.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt; In the United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System (1974), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit of Appeals]] overruled the trial judge's order and protected Aggie Whelan's right to create sketches and CBS's right to broadcast courtroom sketches.&lt;ref name=newengland&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Mark C. |date=1974 |title=United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.: Courtroom Sketching and the Right to Fair Trial |journal=New England Law Review |publisher=New England School of Law |volume=10 |issue= |pages=541–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions were too broad and violated both CBS and Whelan's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt;

Television networks began using sketches to illustrate courtroom events during news broadcasts in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=newengland /&gt; As long as the artist arrived on time, and did not disturb the proceedings by making unnecessary noise, their presence was rarely challenged in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=newengland /&gt; In jurisdictions where artists were restricted from sketching inside the courtroom, they created sketches from memory.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt; Courtroom artists including Ida Libby Dengrove protested these restrictions, and gradually courtrooms began allowing sketch artists to work during trials whilst seated in the public gallery.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt;

The reintroduction of camera into courtrooms has been credited with a decline in courtroom sketch artists.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Artists Brace for Entry Of Cameras Into Courts |date=29 November 1987 |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/nyregion/artists-brace-for-entry-of-cameras-into-courts.html |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite news |title=Need for courtroom artists fade as cameras move in |author=Michael Tarm |date=28 January 2012 |publisher=Associated Press |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/salem/articles/2012/01/28/need_for_courtroom_artists_fade_as_cameras_move_in/ |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, courtroom photography was allowed in 44 states.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; While the creation of [[Court tv#As Court TV|Court TV]] and the [[O.

[[File:Castle Buildings, Stormont Estate - geograph.org.uk - 1393935.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castle Buildings]], headquarters of the Department of Justice]]

The '''Department of Justice''' is a government department in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], which was established on 12 April 2010 as part of the devolution of justice matters to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. The position of [[Minister of Justice (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Justice]] is currently vacant. The department's Permanent Secretary is Nick Perry. It combines the previous work of the [[Northern Ireland Office]] and the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], within the [[United Kingdom Government]], which were respectively responsible for justice policy and the administration of courts in Northern Ireland.

==History==
The partition of Ireland created a separate jurisdiction of [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]] in June 1921.  A local ''[[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]'', initially led by [[Dawson Bates]], was established at that time and oversaw most aspects of justice policy until the introduction of direct rule in March 1972. The ''[[Northern Ireland Office]]'', led by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], was subsequently responsible for security and political affairs during the remainder of [[the Troubles]].

The post of ''[[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]'' was abolished in 1922 and subsequently replaced in Northern Ireland by the [[Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]]. His supporting [[Lord Chancellor's Department|department]] and the subsequent ''[[Department for Constitutional Affairs]]'' (2003–2007) oversaw the courts until the formation of the ''Ministry of Justice'' in May 2007.

Most aspects of social and economic policy were devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in December 1999.  The devolution of policing and justice was pledged in the [[St Andrews Agreement]] (of October 2006) and the [[Hillsborough Castle Agreement]] (of February 2010) and occurred in April 2010.

==Minister==

The Minister of Justice is elected by a [[cross-community vote]] in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/21A Section 21A(3A), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt; unlike all other [[Northern Ireland Executive]] posts, which are either allocated by the [[d'Hondt method]] or appointed directly by the largest parties (i.e. the First Minister&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/16A Section 16A(4), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the deputy First Minister&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/16A Section 16A(5), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The exception was made to resolve a dispute between the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) and [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7735489.stm |title=Deal brokered to end NI deadlock |publisher=BBC News |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance Party (UK)|Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] successfully nominated its party leader, [[David Ford]], on 12 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8615741.stm |title=David Ford secures justice job |publisher=BBC News |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was re-elected to the position on 16 May 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13408394 |title=New Stormont ministers announced |publisher=BBC News |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was Minister until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/work-of-the-executive/ministers-and-their-departments.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016032100/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/work-of-the-executive/ministers-and-their-departments.htm |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }} Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May 2016, independent [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Claire Sugden]] was elected the new Minister of Justice, following the Alliance Party's refusal of the justice ministry.  Sugden's tenure as minister ended on 26 January 2017, when the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] was dissolved following further disputes between the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Sinn Féin]].

==Aim==
Under the Programme for Government for 2016-2020, the department has been tasked with the outcome of "a safe community where we respect the law, and each other”. Its objectives are based on the concept of 'problem-solving justice' which seeks to drive forward "new and more imaginative" strategies, which will seek to address the underlying causes of offending behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Department of Justice|url=https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/about-department-justice|website=www.justice-ni.gov.uk|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Department of Justice's headquarters is located in [[Castle Buildings]] in [[Belfast]]. Its remit includes the following executive agencies:

* the [[Northern Ireland Prison Service]]
* the [[Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service]]
* the [[Legal Services Agency for Northern Ireland]]
* the [[Youth Justice Agency]]
* [[Forensic Science Northern Ireland]]

The department also oversees the following non-departmental public bodies:

* the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]]
* the Office of the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]]
* the [[Probation Board for Northern Ireland]]
* Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland
* the [[Northern Ireland Law Commission]] (non-operational since April 2015)
* the Northern Ireland Police Fund
* the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] George Cross Foundation
* the Police Rehabilitation and Retraining Trust Advisory
* the Advisory Committee on Justices of the Peace

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] is operationally independent and accountable to the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]]; the Minister of Justice has overall responsibility for legislation on policing.

==Responsibilities==

The Department of Justice is responsible for most everyday policing and justice powers in Northern Ireland. The [[Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010]] outlines the policy areas transferred to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].  These include:

* [[Northern Ireland law|criminal law]]
* [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|policing]]
* [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland|prosecution]]
* public order
* [[Courts of Northern Ireland|courts]]
* [[Northern Ireland Prison Service|prisons]] and [[probation]]
* [[Criminal history|criminal history disclosure]] (the ''AccessNI'' service)

Some justice matters remain [[Reserved and excepted matters#List of key reserved matters|reserved]] to Westminster, with the Assembly's agreement e.g. the [[prerogative of mercy]] in terrorism cases, [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|illicit drug classification]], the [[National Crime Agency]], the accommodation of prisoners in separated conditions within the [[Northern Ireland Prison Service]], [[Parades in Northern Ireland|parades]] and the security of [[explosives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Northern Ireland Assembly Information Office |url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/100309.htm#4 |title='&amp;#39;Policing and Justice'&amp;#39; motion, Northern ireland Assembly, 12 April 2010 |publisher=Niassembly.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some justice matters remain [[Reserved and excepted matters#List of key excepted matters|excepted]] and devolution was either not discussed or not considered feasible: [[extradition]] (as an [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|international relations]] matter), [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom|military justice]] (as a [[British Armed Forces|defence]] matter), the enforcement of [[British nationality law|immigration]] law, and [[national security]] (including [[UK security services|intelligence]] services).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_11#sch2 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998, Schedule 2 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=25 June 1998 |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice's main counterparts in the [[United Kingdom Government]] are:
* the [[Home Office]] (on policing, drugs and public order);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Home Office |date= |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] (on criminal law, courts, prisons, probation);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/about.htm |title=Ministry of Justice: About us |publisher=Justice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=24 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123140725/http://www.justice.gov.uk/about.htm |archivedate=23 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Northern Ireland Office]] (on national security in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/index/about-the-nio.htm |title=Northern Ireland Office: About the NIO |publisher=Nio.gov.uk |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917112740/http://www.nio.gov.uk/index/about-the-nio.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Irish Government]], its main counterpart is the [[Department of Justice and Equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/What_we_do |title=Department of Justice and Equality: What We Do |publisher=Justice.ie |date= |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable proportion of law enforcement in Northern Ireland (and media coverage of policing and justice stories) is taken up with unresolved cases arising from [[the Troubles]], continuing paramilitary activity and tensions caused by sectarian division. The [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|border]] results in differences in law between Northern Ireland (the only UK jurisdiction with an international land border) and the Republic of Ireland, which are exploited through [[smuggling]] and other forms of crime.  The border is expected to become an external border of the [[European Union]], following [[Brexit]].

==Finance==
The 2016-2017 [[Northern Ireland Executive]] budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Budget 2016-17|date=13 January 2016|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|location=Belfast|page=88|url=https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/nigov/2016-17-budget-document.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allocated a £1,050.5 million resource budget to the Department of Justice:

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] was also provided with £32 million for national security in relation to Northern Ireland, £30 million for legacy bodies to deal with [[the Troubles]] (not yet established), £5 million to tackle paramilitary activity, and £800,000 to assist with the monitoring of paramilitary activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Budget 2016-17|date=13 January 2016|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|location=Belfast|page=25|url=https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/nigov/2016-17-budget-document.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Since the devolution of policing and justice, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has enacted seven Acts mainly relating to justice policy:

*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2011/24/contents Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2011]
*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2013/7/contents Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2013]

A liability insurance company's '''duty to settle''' is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt "in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Ins. Code}} [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ins&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=790-790.15 § 790.03(h)(5)].&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Typical language is: "We may, at our discretion, investigate any ‘occurrence' and settle any claim or 'suit' that may result." {{sm|Peter J. Kalis et al., Policyholder's Guide to the Law of Insurance Coverage}} F-15 (Aspen Publishers Online 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In California, "an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13974532515441078311&amp;q=comunale&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Comunale v. Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co.], 50 Cal. 2d 654, 659–61 (1958) (ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; A rationale for this duty is that "[w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11597490784555170138&amp;q=merritt+reserve&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co.], 34 Cal. App. 3d 858, 870 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; "An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk. Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&amp;q=johansen+cal&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Johansen v. California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau], 15 Cal. 3d 9, 15-16 (1975) (citations and ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12734399634269452649&amp;q=kinder+western&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Kinder v. Western Pioneer Ins. Co.], 231 Cal. App. 2d 894, 901 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14859133972975123124&amp;q=aguerre&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Aguerre, Inc. v. American Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co.], 59 Cal. App. 4th 6, 15 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

An insurer may not "discriminate in its claims settlement practices based upon" certain protected classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Code Regs}} [http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm § 2695.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts''' (the "Electronic Communications Convention", or ECC) is a treaty that aims at facilitating the use of electronic communications in international trade. It was prepared by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (UNCITRAL) and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 23 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = United Nations  | first = General Assembly  | title = Resolution 60/21   | location = New York  | date = 9 December 2005  | url = https://undocs.org/A/RES/60/21 | accessdate = 12 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to Article 23, it entered into force on 1 March 2013, the first day of the month after six months passed following adoption by three States parties, namely the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Honduras]], and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=X-18&amp;chapter=10&amp;lang=en|title=STATUS AS AT : 11-29-2015 |accessdate=29 November 2015|date=29 November 2015|work=United Nations Treaty Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and policy goals ==
UNCITRAL has been active in formulating uniform legislative standards for the use of electronic communications in trade since the 1980s. A first result of such work was the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, 1996 (MLEC), followed by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (MLES), 2001. However, a number of issues remained unsolved, namely, the possibility to enable to use of electronic communications in cases where a formal written requirement is mandated by another treaty, usually drafted before the widespread use of electronic means. Moreover, as model laws may be enacted with variations in the various jurisdictions, it was felt that establishing a core of common provisions would increase uniformity and therefore predictability in international trade law. Finally, it was felt that some of the provisions of the MLEC and of the MLES could be outdated and complemented.&lt;ref&gt;Alysia Davies, "[http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/prb0012-e.htm The Development of Laws on Electronic Documents and E-Commerce Transactions]", Parliament of Canada, Library of Parliament Research Publications, Background Paper No. PRB 00-12-E.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Electronic Communications Convention addresses different policy goals:
1) it removes obstacles arising from formal requirements contained in other international trade law treaties;
2) it provides a common substantive core to the law of electronic communications, thus ensuring a higher level of uniformity both in the legislative text and in its interpretation;
3) it updates and complements the provisions of the MLEC and of the MLES;
4) it provides core legislation on electronic communications to those States not having yet any, or having partial and insufficient provisions.&lt;ref&gt;L. Castellani, ‘The United Nations Electronic Communications Convention - Policy Goals and Potential Benefits’, 19(1) Korean Journal of International Trade &amp; Business Law 1 (2010), at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 14.5.1 of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] sets forth that: "Each Party shall maintain a legal framework governing electronic transactions consistent with the principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 or the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, done at New York November 23, 2005".

== Provisions ==

=== General provisions ===
With respect to substantive provisions, the Electronic Communications Convention builds extensively, on the fundamental principles of the uniform law of electronic commerce developed by UNCITRAL (non-discrimination, technological neutrality, functional equivalence, and irrelevance of place of origin) as well as on several specific articles of the MLEC and of the MLES.&lt;ref&gt;The main source of information on the Electronic Communications Convention is the "[http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/electcom/06-57452_Ebook.pdf Explanatory note by the UNCITRAL secretariat on the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts]".&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Electronic Communications Convention is also inspired by a number of provisions of the CISG, especially in the parts relating to scope of application, to general principles and to final clauses. Thus, article 3 ECC corresponds to article 6 CISG, giving effect to the principle of party autonomy. Article 5 ECC is the equivalent of article 7 CISG, introducing a duty of uniform interpretation of the treaty, and defining the ancillary criteria for interpretation.

Article 6 builds on the notion of "place of business" introduced by the CISG and adapts it to the electronic environment. In particular, it is specified that the location of  equipment and technology supporting an information system, or the location where the information system may be accessed by other parties, are not, as such, decisive to determine the place of business. Those elements may, however, concur to determine the place of business. Similar considerations apply to the use of a domain name or electronic mail address connected to a specific country. The sources of paras. 2 and 3 of article 6 ECC are found in article 15(4)(a) and (b) MLEC.

=== Scope of application ===
Article 1 ECC defines the scope of application of the Convention. The source of inspiration of that article is clearly article 1 of the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]] (CISG). However, a major difference lies in the fact that the ECC, unlike the CISG, does not require that the concerned parties have their places of business in States parties to the ECC. Therefore, the ECC applies if the law applicable to the communications is the law of a State party to the ECC, or if the parties have validly chosen as the law applicable to their communications the law of a State party to the ECC. A third option is the application of the substantive provisions of the ECC if chosen by virtue of agreement of the parties.

According to art. 4(a) ECC “Communication” means any statement, declaration, demand, notice or request, including an offer and the acceptance of an offer, that the parties are required to make or choose to make in connection with the formation or performance of a contract; it is therefore not necessary that the contract is concluded. Moreover, it is possible that only some or one clause of the contract are in electronic form, including, for instance, the arbitration clause. Moreover, according to art. 4(b) ECC “Electronic communication” means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages; the notion of data message is defined in art. 4 (c) ECC along the lines of the same definition contained in the MLEC and MLES. The outcome of such broad approach is that the notion of electronic communication encompasses the use of different technologies, including, e.g., SMS, but also digital audio and video recording.

Art. 2(1)(a) ECC is inspired by article 2(a) CISG. Both provisions aim at excluding consumers' transactions from the scope of application of the respective conventions. 
Art. 2(1)(b) ECC excludes from the scope of application of the convention certain fields that already enjoy uniform legal provisions, contractually (e.g., international payments systems) or otherwise (e.g., treaties relating to securities held with an intermediary). 
Art. 2(2) ECC excludes from the scope of application of the convention electronic transferable records. These are electronic records that entitle the entity controlling them to the delivery of goods or the payment of a sum, as evidenced in the record. This exclusion is due to the fact that uniform legal standards for the functional equivalence of notions such as “possession” in the electronic world have yet to be developed. Since 2011, UNCITRAL Working Group IV (Electronic Commerce) is tasked with defining those standards.

States may vary the scope of application of the Convention by lodging declarations. Thus, the declaration foreseen in article 19(1)(a) limits the application of the Convention to cases when all the States where the parties involved in the transaction have their place of business are contracting States. This is the same mechanism envisaged in article 1(1)(a) CISG. Article 19(1)(b) limits the application of the Convention to cases when the parties so choose.

Article 19(2) ECC gives States the possibility to exclude certain matters from the scope of application of the ECC. These exceptions could be similar to those made in corresponding national legislation: Singapore has lodged this type of declaration upon ratification of the Electronic Communications Convention.

Last, but not least, parties may vary or derogate from any provision of the Convention under its article 3. This is a provision common in international trade law treaties, where freedom of contract is considered an overarching principle. However, in practice there might be limits of public order, or other mandatory provisions, that might limit the freedom of the parties.

=== Substantive provisions ===
Article 8 ECC sets forth at the international level the principle of non-discrimination of electronic communications already established, for national legislation, in article 5 MLEC.

Article 9 ECC is the core provision establishing the parameters for functional equivalence between electronic and paper-based communications.

In particular, article 9(2) ECC deals with functional equivalence of the notion of "written form". The provision follows that of article 6(1) MLEC.

Article 9(3) ECC deals with functional equivalence for "signature". In practice, this provision enables cross-border recognition of all types of electronic signatures. To do so, art. 9(3) ECC departs from both UNCITRAL relevant precedents, i.e. article 7(1) MLEC and article 12 MLES. Two major innovations were introduced with respect to article 7(1) MLEC: a) the notion of "person's approval" was substituted with that of "party's intention" in order to better capture the various functions associated with signatures, which go well beyond mere approval; and b) a safety clause was introduced in article 9(3)(b)(ii) ECC to ensure that electronic signatures that provide for a method to identify the party and to indicate the party's intention, and that have indeed fulfilled that function by themselves or together with other evidence, may not be repudiated. In other words, if it is possible to identify the signatory of an electronic communication, that signatory may not challenge the signature on the basis of the signature's method or nature.

Article 9(4) and (5) ECC provides for the functional equivalent of original, along the lines of article 8(1) and (3) MLEC.

Article 10 ECC deals with time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications. Its predecessor is article 15 MLEC.

Article 10(1) ECC innovates on article 15(1) MLEC: in the ECC, the electronic communication is dispatched when it leaves the system under the control of the originator, while in the MLEC it (or, better, the data message in the terminology of that Model Law) has to enter a system outside the control of the originator: the rule has been changed in order to avoid consequences for the originator when the message may not enter the information system for reasons not under control of the originator (e.g., firewall; filter; system down...).

Article 10(2) ECC follows article 15(2) MLEC in introducing the difference between designated and non-designated electronic address for determining the time of receipt of an electronic communication. Article 10(2) ECC contains a novel element by requiring that the recipient should be aware that the communication was sent (and the communication is capable of being retrieved), while the provision of the MLEC requires actual retrieval by the addressee, which might again expose the originator to liability for circumstances under the addressee's control.

Article 10(3) ECC corresponds to article 15(4) MLEC. This provision must be read in conjunction with article 6 ECC, as must be article 10(4) ECC.

=== Final clauses ===
The Electronic Communications Convention contains, in its Chapter IV, rather elaborate final clauses. Final clauses aimed at modifying the scope of application of the Convention are discussed above.

==== Relation to regional legislation ====
Article 17 ECC sets forth the applicable rules for those cases where electronic communications fall under the legislative authority of a regional economic integration organisation (REIO). The rationale of article 17 is, on the one hand, to ensure that the Convention will not be applied to commercial relations falling under the scope of application of the legislation of the REIO and, on the other hand, to clarify the distribution of legislative power between REIOs (and therefore unaffected by the Convention) and national States (and therefore under the scope of the Convention in case of cross-border exchanges). In other words, the Convention does not intend to interphere with regional regimes.

In particular, article 17(2) ECC requires the REIO that intends to become a party to the ECC to deposit a declaration on the distribution of competences between the REIO and its member States. The REIO member States are supposed to do the same. Article 17(4) contains the "disconnection clause" that should ensure that REIOs' legal regimes are unaffected by the operation of the Electronic Communications Convention.

The matter has important practical consequences. In fact, the absence of an agreed declaration on the distribution of competences between the European Union and its member States has prevented those States from signing or becoming a party to the Electronic Communications Convention:&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kilian, "The Electronic Communications Convention: a European Union Perspective", in Amelia H. Boss and Wolfgang Kilian (eds), ''The United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts: An In-Depth Guide and Sourcebook.'' (2008), 407-414, at 410 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; among the 20 States that are signatory or party to the Convention, none is an EU member State.

==== Interaction with other international trade law treaties ====
One major goal of the Electronic Communications Convention is the removal of obstacles to international trade arising from the insertion of formal requirements in treaties concluded before the broad adoption of electronic means. Article 20 ECC lists several treaties prepared by UNCITRAL as treaties that will be "electrified" by the adoption of the ECC. In other words, by virtue of adoption of the ECC formal requirements contained in those treaties, especially written form requirements, will be satisfied with the use of electronic communications under the conditions set forth in the ECC.

Some UNCITRAL treaties are excluded from the list in article 20, in particular, the [[United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea]], 1978 (the "Hamburg Rules") and the United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes, 1988. The reason for the exclusion is that those two treaties contain provisions on negotiable documents, which are excluded from the scope of the ECC (art. 2(2)). The [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea]], 2008 (the "Rotterdam Rules"), which was also prepared by UNCITRAL and contains provisions on electronic transferable records, was concluded after the ECC.

Article 20(2) ECC indicates that the Convention will apply also to all other treaties where the exchange of electronic communications is relevant, unless a State declares not to be bound by this provision. Even if this "opt out" declaration is made, the declaring State may still choose, under article 20(3) ECC, certain treaties to which the ECC will apply.

Article 20(4) ECC gives the possibility of a State to prevent the interaction of the ECC with a given treaty even if the State has not lodged any other declaration regarding the Convention's scope of application. In other words, under article 20(3) ECC the State makes a general opt out and a selective opt in, while under article 20(4) the State makes a general opt in, and a selective opt out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="734">In the [[German law|German legal system]], the obsolete designation '''Gerichtsassessor''' was held by [[judge]]s or [[federal prosecutor]]s, whose employment status today would be "on [[probation]]". Attainment of the second state legal qualification (the so-called "Competence to the Justiceship") was always a pre-requisite. The appointment took place with the intention that the Gerichtsassessor would be employed later in his lifetime as a judge.

The Gerichtsassessor usually held this designation for one year after receiving his Certificate of Appointment, before being appointed as a judge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Americans accept no law other than their own on US soil, yet expect other nations to submit to the rule of US troops; a [[double standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[drone strikes]] on terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan goes against the presumption of innocence. The CIA, exempt from the [[Geneva Convention]], is 'secretly sentencing people to death for an unproven crime, without trial or inquest.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson]], 'Drone attacks go against every Human Right in the book', [[New Statesman]], 13/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] is not a state, so 'war law' which permits killing of combatants, does not apply.

'''''Gravi de pugna''''' is a [[pseudepigrapha|forged]]&lt;!--For the preference of this term over the more conventional ''[[pseudepigrapha]]'', see Bart Ehrman ''Forged''--&gt; letter written in the name of [[Augustine of Hippo]] which asserts that the morally superior side is always superior in battle and therefore that wars are proven to be [[just war]]s by their military success. The letter was widely accepted as authentic, and reassured soldiers that [[Gott mit uns|God was on their side]].

== Ideology ==
{{quotebox|width=25em|align=right|quote="You are concerned with whether you will prevail in battle: I don't wish you to doubt... when you are fighting God will look down from heaven, and discern which side is just and give that side the victory"|source=''Gravi de pugna'', translated by David A. Lenihan.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=58-59}}}}

''Gravi de pugna'' is best known for its simple assertion that [[God in Christianity|God]] will assure that the morally superior side will win military battles,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and conversely, that victory itself validates that the use of force was appropriate.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}{{efn|This is a form of the [[just-world hypothesis]].}} Udo Heyn claims this was a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] notion,{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}} and Phillip Wynn reports that it had long been believed in pagan antiquity by the time of this letter.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} This understanding was, in fact, utterly rejected by Augustine.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} Kelly DeVries regards the theology of ''Gravi de pugna'' as shallow and considers it to raise problems of [[theodicy]] and legitimacy as soon as the first Christian army loses.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}

Gravi also urges prayer for victory before battle, which was also rejected by Augustine, who found such prayers inappropriate.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}}

== History ==
''Gravi de pugna'' was written in the fifth century.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}
The letter was widely accepted as authentic from its introduction through the medieval era,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and was the most frequently cited text in this period on holy war.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}} It was invoked to justify numerous wars, including by [[Hincmar of Reims]], [[Rabanus Maurus]], [[Sedulius Scottus]], [[Ivo of Chartres]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=29,37,38}} It was also recited at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] in {{CE|1147}}.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}
''Gravi'' imbued the [[Crusaders]] with confidence that God was on their side, squelching all moral concerns and leading to behavior that did not comply with then-accepted [[rules of war]].{{sfn|Chan|2016|p=17}}

The work lost influence with the [[renaissance of the 12th century]], which developed more sophisticated [[jurisprudence]] and moral reasoning,{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=27}} At the same time, Augustine's own opinions, which had been largely unknown, were studied by the [[decretists]] and through them, [[Aquinas]] as well.{{sfn|Lenihan|1996|p=76-77}} The authenticity of ''Gravi de Pugna'' was not conclusively rejected until [[Erasmus]].{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=37-38}}
Although it is regarded by contemporary scholars as "obviously un-Augustinian",{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=59}}
it is now widely recognized that ''Gravi de pugna'' has inaccurately influenced scholars of Augustine's views on war even up through modern times.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=38}}{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}}

The '''Height of Buildings Act of 1899''' was a U.S. [[height restriction law]] passed by the [[55th Congress]] in response to advancements in construction technology, specifically the use of iron and [[steel frame]]s, along with thin veneer facades, which made it possible to build lighter, and consequently much taller buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=George H.|title=Skyscrapers: A Social History of the Very Tall Building In America|year=1996|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0-7864-2030-8|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of densely populated cities, including [[Washington D.C.]], felt that the new technology was untested and steel-framed structures may suffer "serious and fatal defects" due to corrosion from steam pipes and electrical wiring – another relatively recent advancement.&lt;ref name="HRRep1704"&gt;H.R. Rep. 1704, 55th Congress, 3rd Session (Dec 20, 1898)&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that these new tall buildings would ultimately collapse. In an 1899 Senatorial Report, Senator Warren Curtis speculated that, "the life of these structures might not be more than seventy-five years."&lt;ref name="HRRep1704" /&gt;

Another concern was the difficulty of extinguishing fires in the upper floors of tall buildings. At the time, firefighting equipment had been designed to fight flames primarily in low-rise buildings. The growing popularity of [[skyscraper]]s presented a new fire hazard. In his report, Senator Curtis wrote that, "It would seem that the fire chiefs in the large cities who have had experience with high buildings are agreed that it is absolutely impossible for them to successfully fight flames over 85 feet (26 m) above the ground with the fire apparatus now manufactured, as the pressure is so great that no hose now made can stand the strain and the men are unable to handle the hose."&lt;ref name="HRRep1704" /&gt;

In response to these concerns, on March 1, 1899, [[United States Congress]] approved the Act to Regulate the Height of Buildings in the District of Columbia, or more commonly referred to as the Height of Buildings Act of 1899. The law limited the heights of new buildings based on building use and type of construction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Of America in Congress assembled'',

::SEC. 1. That from and after the date of the approval of this Act no combustible or nonfireproof building intended to be used or occupied as a residence or as an apartment house or hotel in the District of Columbia shall be erected to a height of more than five stories or raised to a height exceeding sixty feet [18.2 m] above the sidewalk, the measurement to be made as hereinafter prescribed.

::SEC. 2. That buildings intended for business purposes solely may be erected to a height of seventy-five feet [22.86 m] without being of fireproof construction.

::SEC. 3. That all buildings, except churches, hereafter erected or altered to exceed seventy-five feet [22.86 m] in height shall be fireproof or noncombustible and of such materials throughout as may be prescribed by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. Churches must be of fireproof construction up to and including the main or auditorium floor.

::SEC. 4. That no building shall be erected or altered on any street in the District of Columbia to exceed in height above the sidewalk the width of the street in its front, and in no case shall a building exceed ninety feet in height on a residence street nor one hundred and ten feet [33.5 m] on a business street, as designated by schedule approved by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, except on business streets and business avenues one hundred and sixty feet wide, where a height not exceeding one hundred and thirty feet [39.6 m] may be allowed. The height of buildings on corner lots shall in all cases be regulated by the limitations governing on the broader street: Provided That spires, towers, and domes may be erected to a greater height than the limit herein prescribed, when approved by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia: Provided further, That on streets less than ninety feet [27.4 m] wide, where building lines have been established so as to be a matter of public record and so as to prevent the lawful erection of any building in advance of said lines, the width of the street, in so far as it controls the height of buildings under this law, may be held to be the distance between said building lines.

::SEC. 5. That no wooden or frame building hereafter erected or altered and intended to be used for human habitations shall exceed in height three stories, or forty feet [12.1 m] to the roof.

::SEC.6. That the height of all buildings shall be measured from the level of the sidewalk opposite the middle of the front of the building to the highest point of the roof; if the building has more than one front the measurement shall be made upon the front facing the street of steepest grade. No parapet wall shall extend above the limit of height.

::SEC. 7. That the limitations of height herein prescribed shall not apply to Federal or municipal buildings.

::SEC. 8. That Congress reserves the right to alter, amend, or repeal this Act.

:::— [http://www.committeeof100.net/Height-Act/index.html An Act to regulate height of buildings in the District of Columbia (1899), P.L. 55-322]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Height of Buildings Act of 1899 was later amended by the [[Height of Buildings Act of 1910]].

Structural corrosion and limitations of inadequate firefighting equipment are less of a concern today than at the turn of the century, and many major U.S. cities updated their zoning laws to reflect advancements in building technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York City, Dept of City Planning|title=NYC Zoning - About Zoning, background|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zonehis.shtml|publisher=NYC.gov|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[590 Madison Avenue|1961 New York City zoning resolution]] used a Floor Area Ratio, rather than a height restriction, and allowed for taller buildings when an adjacent public space was provided on the site. Yet, in [[Washington D.C.]] subsequent zoning laws followed the precedent set by the 1899 Act, and limited buildings to lower heights. As a result, the skyline of [[Washington D.C.]] lacks [[skyscrapers]], and is much lower than that of other major [[U.S. cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pershing|first=Ben|title=Congress considers lifting height limits on District buildings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congress-considers-lifting-height-limits-on-district-buildings/2012/07/19/gJQAxrulwW_story.html|work=D.C.

==The Height-of-the-Capitol-Building Myth==

In a 2006 article published in [[The Washington Post]], staff writer Michael Grunwald alluded to the popular belief that the building height restriction in [[Washington D.C.]] was originally based on the height of the [[U.S. Capitol Building]]. Referring to the Height of Buildings Act of 1899, he wrote, "The original law limited buildings to the height of the Capitol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grunwald|first=Michael|title=D.C.'s Fear of Heights|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063001316.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief has been further perpetuated by The American Surveyor Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wendy|first=Lathrop|title=Vantage Point: The Curse of (Certain) Tall Buildings|url=http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/5661/|publisher=The American Surveyor Magazine|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the city's residents. In an article aimed at dispelling the myth that zoning laws in the District are currently bound to the height of the Capitol building, the blog ''We Love DC'' maintained that, "the 1899 Height of Buildings Act established that no building could be taller than the Capitol (289 feet [88 m])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shannon|title=DC Mythbusting: The Height Limit!|url=http://www.welovedc.com/2009/05/19/dc-mythbusting-the-height-limit/|publisher=We Love DC|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the belief that buildings in [[Washington D.C.]] are currently, or were at one time, restricted to the height of the [[U.S. Capitol building]] remains popular to this day, it is untrue, and has even become "the stuff of local lore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BERG|first=REBECCA|title=Congress Takes a New Look at Low-Slung Washington|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/us/politics/congress-rethinks-height-limits-on-washington-buildings.html|work=Politics|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Representatives of the United States|House of Representatives]] Report from December 1898, along with the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] Report from the following year, show that when the [[Bill (law)|bill]] to restrict the height of buildings was debated on the floor of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], no mention had been made of the [[U.S. Capitol Building|U.S. Capitol building]], or the height of its dome.&lt;ref name="HRRep1704" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''Immigration detention''' is the policy of holding individuals suspected of visa violations,  illegal entry or [[unauthorised arrival]], and those subject to deportation and removal in detention until a decision is made by immigration authorities to grant a visa and release them into the community, or to repatriate them to their country of departure.  '''Mandatory detention''' is the practice of compulsorily detaining or imprisoning people seeking [[political asylum]], or who are considered to be [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] or [[unauthorised arrival]]s into a country. Some countries have set a maximum period of detention, while others permit indefinite detention.

In the United States, a similar practice began in the early 1980s with [[Haiti]]ans and [[Cuba]]ns detained at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], and other groups such as Chinese in jails and detention centres on the mainland.  The practice was made mandatory by legislation passed in 1996 in response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], and has come under criticism from organizations such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Human Rights First]], all of whom have released major studies of the subject, and the [[ACLU]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/ImmigrantsRights/ImmigrantsRights.cfm?ID=5075&amp;c=95 aclu.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, about 31,000 non-citizens were held in immigration detention on any given day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html | title=In-Custody Deaths | work=New York Times | first=Nina | last=Bernstein | accessdate=2010-05-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914160753/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html | archivedate=14 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including children, in over 200 detention centres, jails, and prisons nationwide.&lt;ref name=Kalhan2010&gt;{{Citation | title = Rethinking Immigration Detention | ssrn = 1556867 | year = 2010 | author = Anil Kalhan | journal = Columbia Law Review Sidebar | pages = 42–58 | volume = 110 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Asian nations are known to imprison immigrants on visa violations or for alleged [[Human trafficking|trafficking]], including the victims of trafficking and smuggling. These include Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Australia===
{{main|Immigration detention in Australia}}
[[File:Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (5424306236).jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre]]
In Australia, mandatory immigration detention was adopted in 1992 for all non-citizens who arrive in Australia without a visa. That only 'border applicants' are subject to detention has sparked criticism, as it is claimed to unfairly discriminate against certain migrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/09/3australia.cfm wcl.american.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325162428/https://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/09/3australia.cfm |date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other unlawful non-citizens, such as those that overstay their visas, are generally granted bridging visas while their applications are processed, and are therefore free to move around the community. The long-term detention of immigrant children has also sparked criticism of the practice by citizen's groups such as [[ChilOut]] and human rights organisations. Nonetheless, the High Court of Australia has confirmed, by majority, the constitutionality of indefinite mandatory detention of aliens.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562&lt;/ref&gt; This and related decisions have been the subject of considerable academic critique.&lt;ref&gt;Zagor M, 'Uncertainty and Exclusion: Detention of Aliens and the High Court' Federal Law Review 2006; 34: 127–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has also sub-contracted with other nations to detain would-be immigrants offshore, including [[Indonesia]], Papua New Guinea, and [[Nauru]].  Australia also maintains an [[Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|offshore detention facility]] on [[Christmas Island]]. In July 2008, the Australian government announced it was ending its policy of automatic detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/world/asia/30australia.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title=Australia Announces Changes on Asylum Seekers | author=Tim Johnston |work=New York Times | date=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by September 2012, offshore detention was reinstated. Following the [[Australian federal election, 2013]] policies have been toughened and [[Operation Sovereign Borders]] has been launched.

=== Spain===
There are eight detention centers known as CIEs (Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros) run by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Expulsion paperwork can be initiated when a person is in one of the following situations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1985/07/03/pdfs/A20824-20829.pdf|format=pdf|title= Ley Orgánica 7/1985, de 1 de julio, sobre derechos y libertades de los extranjeros en España.|accessdate=3 November 2011 |author= Gobierno de España |date= 3 July 1985 |editor= [[Boletín Oficial del Estado]] número 158 |language=español }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Lacking documentation in Spanish territory.
# Working without a work permit, even if they have a valid resident permit.  
# Be involved in activities that violate public order or interior or exterior state security or any activity contrary to Spanish interests or that could put in danger Spain's relations with other countries.
# Be convicted inside or outside of Spain of a crime punishable by incarceration for greater than one year. 
# Hiding or falsifying their situation from the Ministry of the Interior.
# Lacking a legal livelihood or taking part in illegal activity. 

Various civil organizations, such as ([[APDHA]], SOS Racismo and [[Andalucía Acoge]]) have appealed to the Spanish Supreme Court to declare the regulations behind the CIEs null and void for violating eight aspects of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apdha.org/andalucia-acoge-junto-a-sos-racismo-y-apdh-a-recurren-ante-el-tribunal-supremo-el-reglamento-de-los-centros-de-internamiento-de-extranjeros-cie/|author= Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de Andalucía |title=Andalucía Acoge junto a SOS Racismo y APDHA recurren ante el Tribunal Supremo el Reglamento de los Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
[[File:Fuoco ai CIE graffiti in Turin.jpg|thumb|"Fuoco ai CIE" (let us burn CIEs (Identification and Expulsion Centres): graffiti in Turin, October 2016]]
In [[Italy]], the situation is mostly the same as in The Netherlands: irregular immigrants are sent to "CIE" (Identification and Expulsion Centres) if they don't have proper documents. Illegal entry and stay on the Italian territory became a criminal offence in 2009 (l. July 15, 2009, n. 94), after the [[Umberto Bossi|Bossi]]-[[Gianfranco Fini|Fini]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Also before that law, the centre-right governments tried to restrain the judicial review of the expulsion. Against the fundamental principle of ''habeas corpus'', which should be given to the judge, the "owner of the body" of the alien is the chief constable, who embarks the foreigner on the first flight: if after forty-eight hours he should be right in having the measure lapsed, he will know it in his new home abroad: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Ma la conversione del dl sull'immigrazione clandestina s'intreccia in modo incerto (e confuso) con il ddl governativo |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89333419}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they have the function of allowing confirm{{clarify|date=August 2016}} the identity of the persons held in view of a possible expulsion, or to hold persons awaiting expulsion to some, their sense of political track in relation to the legislative apparatus in its immigration entirety{{clarify|date=August 2016}}.

=== Malta ===

In 2002 and the following years, [[Malta]] began to receive a large influx of migrants.&lt;ref name=EMN&gt;Joseph St. John, Martha Delicata, Mario Azzopardi, "The Organisation of Asylum and Migration Policies in Malta", National Report 2008 of the National Contact Point of the European Migration Network, Malta, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The government then begun to apply the 1970 Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta (Immigration Act),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/download.action;jsessionid=Yh1JTLPXc2x3nf0Yr1V08W7GyqhQkTk50H5TyyL7nTJTL2BDnfcp!741669820?nodeId=81ca50e0-05d4-4a63-abcd-6a908c52fdc5&amp;fileName=Immigration+Act+Malta_en.pdf&amp;fileType=pdf Chapter 217 (Immigration Act)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715025544/http://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/download.action |date=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing for detention for all "prohibited migrants", including prospective [[asylum seekers]], soon after apprehension by the immigration authorities. In 2003, the Maltese government substituted the indefinite detention policy with an 18-month detention length (the maximum under [[EU law]]) after which the applicant is transferred to an open centre if the processing of his/her application has not been finished.&lt;ref name=LU&gt;Björn Kårén, "Malta and Immigration. Sovereignty, Territory and Identity". University of Lund [http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1317141&amp;fileOId=1317142], p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maltese detention policy, the strictest in Europe,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} gathered heavy criticism by the [[UNHCR]] for the extensive duration of detention,&lt;ref&gt;Amore, Katia (2007). “Malta”, pp. 237–248 in European Immigration – a Sourcebook, edited by Anna Triandafyllidou and Ruby Gropas. Egland: Ashgate Publishing Limited&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 it was also criticized by the Commissioner for Human Rights of [[Council of Europe]], [[Álvaro Gil-Robles]], as international standards required cautious and individual examination of each case and proper legal checks before incarceration, which were missing in the Maltese legislation. The [[Council of Europe]] also criticised four of the administrative detention centres as in "deplorable conditions" and failing to live up to legally binding international standards&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kårén, p.. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs pursued the migrants detention policy nevertheless, justifying it in 2005 by "national interest, and more specifically, for reasons concerning employment, accommodation and maintenance of public order".&lt;ref&gt;Government of Malta (2005). “Irregular Immigrants, Refugees and Integration – Policy Document, Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs, Ministry for the Family and Social Security” [http://www.mjha.gov.mt/downloads/documents/immigration_english.pdf], p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 an [[European Parliament|EP]]-[[International Organisation for Migration|OIM]] comparative study found that "following a long stay in detention [illegal immigrants] are then released into the community [...] joining the black market economy and suffering abuse with regard to conditions of work.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Parliament]]-[[International Organisation for Migration]], Comparative study of the laws in the 27 EU member states for legal immigration including an assessment of the conditions and formalities imposed by each member state for newcomers, [http://jcp.ge/info/Malta.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;

The detention policy was criticised, in the following years, by NGOs and international bodies, including [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/18/malta-migrant-detention-violates-rights Human Rights Watch], 18 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jesuits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrsmalta.org/content.aspx?id=225267|title=Jesuits in Malta :: Detention in Malta|work=jrsmalta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNHCR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120701/local/unhcr-seeks-review-of-malta-s-detention-policy.426796 Times of Malta], 1 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Council of Europe]] reiterated that such a policy is contrary to the prohibition of arbitrary detention in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1797917&amp;Site=CommDH&amp;BackColorInternet=FEC65B&amp;BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&amp;BackColorLogged=FFC679 Report by Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, following his visit to Malta from 23 to 25 March 2011], 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===

In the [[Netherlands]], foreigners who fail to obtain a residence status can be detained prior to deportation, as to prevent them from avoiding deportation. Detention centers are located in [[Zaandam]], [[Zeist]], and [[Alphen aan den Rijn]]. Besides these detention centers there are deportation centers in [[Schiphol]] and Rotterdam (at [[Rotterdam Airport]]).

Immigration detention in the Netherlands is criticised for the circumstances immigrants are held in, which is often worse than that of criminal detainees, especially because of the lack of probationary leave, rehabilitation assistance, legal assistance, laws restricting the maximum detention time and a maximum time for judicial review from a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Van barbaren en illegalen (Dutch) | url = http://www.allincluded.nl/index.php/bajesboten-voor-criminelen-of-uitgeprocedeerden/130 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130222192501/http://www.allincluded.nl/index.php/bajesboten-voor-criminelen-of-uitgeprocedeerden/130 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-22 | year = 2005 | author = Anton van Kalmthout | journal = Zandschrift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Home Office]] has a number of detention centres, including, {{as of|2015|01}}, 11 designated Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs), four designated Residential and Short Term Holding Facilities and one Non Residential Short Term Holding Facility. Four of the IRCs are managed by the [[Prison Service]] and the others are outsourced to private companies including [[Mitie]], [[GEO Group]], [[G4S]] and [[Serco]]. People can be detained under Immigration Act powers for a number of reasons. The largest category of detainees is people who have claimed asylum. Other people include those detained awaiting determination of their right to entry to the UK, people who have been refused permission to enter and are awaiting removal, people who have overstayed the expiry of their visas or have not complied with their visa terms, and people lacking the required documentation to live in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/immigration-detention-uk|title=Immigration Detention in the UK|publisher=Migration Observatory, University of Oxford|first1=Stephanie J.|last1=Silverman|first2=Ruchi|last2=Hajela|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] formally changed the name of "detention centres" to "removal centres".

The former [[Oakington Immigration Reception Centre]] near [[Cambridge]] was closed in November 2010.

Additionally, some prisons detain migrants or asylum seekers purely under Immigration Act powers, usually if they have been serving a prison sentence which has expired. There are also four short term holding facilities in Manchester, Dover, Harwich and Colnbrook.

The British government has been given powers to detain asylum seekers and migrants at any stage of the asylum process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20041--e.htm#62|title=Legislation.gov.uk|work=opsi.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of asylum has increased with the introduction of the process of 'fast track', or the procedure by which the Immigration Service assess asylum claims which are capable of being decided quickly. Fast-tracking takes place in Oakington Reception Centre, Harmondsworth and Yarl's Wood.

There are three situations in which it is lawful to detain an asylum seeker or migrant.
# To fast track their claim
# If the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the asylum seeker or migrant will abscond or not abide by the conditions of entry.
# If the asylum seeker or migrant is about to be deported.

Once detained it is possible to apply for bail. It is preferable but not necessary to provide a surety and conditions will be provided, usually reporting, if bail is granted. There is legal aid for representation at bail hearings and the organisation Bail for Immigration Detainees provides help and assistance for those subject to detention to represent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biduk.org/|title=Bail for Immigration Detainees|work=biduk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since summer 2005 there has been an increase in the detention of foreign nationals since the [[Charles Clarke]] scandal which revealed that there were a number of foreign nationals who had committed crimes and had not been deported at the end of their sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Criticism of immigration detention focuses on comparisons with prison conditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.co.uk/issues/immigration-detention-centres-$2108038.htm politics.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313203450/http://www.politics.co.uk/issues/immigration-detention-centres-%242108038.htm |date=13 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which persons are kept though they have never been convicted of a crime, the lack of [[judicial oversight]], and on the lengthy bureaucratic delays that often prevent a person from being released, particularly when there is no evidence that the detainee will present a harm or a burden to society if allowed to remain at large while their situation is examined.

Recently, the conditions of detention centres have been criticised, by the United Kingdom Inspector of Prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk/hmiprisons/inspect_reports/irc-inspections.html/irccampsfieldhouse042.pdf?view=Binary |title=inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk |work=homeoffice.gov.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929222438/http://inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk/hmiprisons/inspect_reports/irc-inspections.html/irccampsfieldhouse042.pdf?view=Binary |archivedate=29 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">"'''Judicial scrivener'''" is a term used to refer to similar legal professions in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. Judicial scriveners assist clients in commercial and real estate registration procedures and in the preparation of documents for [[litigation]].

==Japan==
In [[Japan]], {{nihongo|judicial scriveners|司法書士|'''shihō shoshi'''}} are authorized to represent their clients in [[real estate]] registrations, commercial registrations (e.g. the incorporation of companies), preparation of court documents and filings with legal affairs bureaus. Judicial scriveners may also represent clients in summary courts, [[arbitration]] and [[mediation]] proceedings, but are not allowed to represent clients in district courts or more advanced stages of [[litigation]]. The more familiar term "solicitor" is also sometimes used to refer to them, although the division of responsibilities is not the same as between [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s in the English legal system. The term "judicial scrivener", while somewhat archaic in tone, is a fairly accurate literal translation of the Japanese term.

Judicial scriveners must pass an examination administered by the Ministry of Justice. The examination tests knowledge of twelve Japanese statutes, the four principal ones being the Civil Code, Real Estate Registration Act, Commercial Code and Commercial Registration Act. (The Corporations Act was added to the examination in 2006.) The examination consists of two written tests followed by one oral test; the overall pass rate is 2.8%. A person may also become qualified as a judicial scrivener by working for ten years as a court secretary, judicial secretary, or prosecutor's secretary.

Judicial scriveners must maintain a membership in the {{nihongo|judicial scrivener association|司法書士会|shihō shoshi kai}} for the prefecture in which they work. They can be found in solo practice or attached to law firms as employees of [[attorney at law (Japan)|attorneys at law]]. A small number of judicial scriveners work as in-house counsel for companies, but there are strict conditions for registration of in-house judicial scriveners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nikkei.com/paper/article/?n_cid=kobetsu&amp;ng=DGKKZO20385940V20C17A8TCJ000|title=〈法トーク〉企業法務で存在感高める 日本組織内司法書士協会会長　浜野雄治氏|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nikkei.com|language=ja|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

When Japan adopted a Western-style court system in 1872, it established a profession of {{nihongo|''daishonin''|代書人}} to represent clients in the preparation of documents, alongside the {{nihongo|''daigennin''|代言人}} who represented clients in courtroom arguments (this latter profession became known as {{nihongo|[[attorney at law (Japan)|'''Attorneys at law''']]|弁護士|bengoshi}} in 1890). A 1919 statute established a separate tier of {{nihongo|''shihō daishonin''|司法代書人}} to handle court documents. The modern ''shihō shoshi'' title was adopted under a revised statute in 1935, which was superseded by a new law in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=司法書士の歴史|url=http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/about_shiho_shoshi/history.html|publisher=Japan Federation of Shiho-Shoshi Lawyer's Associations|accessdate=16 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127121423/http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/about_shiho_shoshi/history.html|archivedate=27 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the ''daishonin'' profession was replaced by the [[administrative scrivener]] profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=司法書士制度、行政書士制度の歴史と現在|url=http://ace.wisnet.ne.jp/wada/wadai/seido/rekishi.htm|publisher=さがみ法務事務所|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
[[South Korea]] has a similar legal profession known as '''''beopmusa''''' (Hangul: {{lang|ko|법무사}}, Hanja: {{lang|ko|法務士}}).

The '''Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony''' (also called "'''Bookville'''" by former residents) was an encampment of banished, registered [[sex offender]]s who were living beneath the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]]—a highway in [[Miami, Florida]], United States—from 2006 to April 2010. The colony was created by a lobbyist named [[Ron Book]], who wrote ordinances in several different [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] cities to restrict convicted sex offenders from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, parks, bus stops, or homeless shelters. Since Book was also head of the Miami Homeless Trust, he was also in charge of finding housing for the released sexual offenders. Under these ordinances, the only areas where sex offenders could legally reside within Miami-Dade County were the [[Miami International Airport|Miami Airport]] and the [[Florida Everglades]]. Miami-Dade laws are significantly stricter than State of Florida laws on residency restrictions for sex offenders.  Florida State Law required that no sex offender could live within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} from "where children gather". Under that requirement, housing was possible; however, because of Book's lobbying, the Dade County Commission increased that number to {{convert|2500|ft|m}}, thereby banishing hundreds of local citizens who then began gathering under the Julia Tuttle Causeway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2009-04-16/news/julia-tuttle-bridge-sex-offenders-might-get-a-new-home/ Miami sex offenders form outcast colony], UPI (May 3, 2009).

==Colony setup==
Before the colony was established, the [[Florida|State of Florida]] provided sex offenders a list of locations where they could live that did not violate the boundaries set by the City of Miami, but the closest was in adjacent [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, Isaiah (February 6, 2008).

== Conflicts over responsibility ==
As the number of residents grew, the City of Miami and the State of Florida disagreed over who was ultimately responsible for the sex offenders. Miami City Commissioner Marc Sarnoff, worried about how tourists perceived the colony, prompted an attorney from the Florida Department of Corrections to write a letter to the City of Miami absolving the Department of responsibility. The City of Miami responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, citing public health and safety concerns. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had also filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami for imposing the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} rule for sex offenders when the State of Florida's law restricts them to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from where children congregate. The ACLU said that the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} rule would allow many of the offenders to return home.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, Greg (July 21, 2009) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106689642&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1001 Bridge Still Home For Miami Sex Offenders], National Public Radio. Retrieved on July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was under further scrutiny for being within the forbidden area; a city park on an island in [[Biscayne Bay]] caused questions about the Julia Tuttle Causeway colony's itself being in violation of the sex offender laws.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

Local clergyman Vincent Spann likened the camp to a Biblical [[leper colony]] and offered to house the sex offenders in a manner similar to that which he employed to treat those recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. He predicted it would cost more than a million dollars a year.&lt;ref name="garciaroberts"&gt;Garcia-Roberts, Gus (April 14, 2009).

Retrieved on September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 Miami-Dade County passed a new ordinance that still prevented sex offenders from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools but only forbade them from living within {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of places such as parks and daycares. The county also made this ordinance effective throughout the whole county and declared any stricter ordinances passed by other Miami-Dade cities to be superseded and repealed. With this new county ordinance, various pockets of the county were now legal for sex offenders to live in, and most, but not all, of the sex offenders ceased to be homeless. Previously, the sex offenders had been banned in most parts of the county from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, daycare centers, parks, and in some places even school bus stops.  As of March 2015, however, the problem continues.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Attempts to relocate colony residents==

Throughout the camp's existence, the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, an organization tasked by the county to help end street homelessness in Miami-Dade County, had been working to find permanent housing for all of the sex offenders living under the bridge. The trust is chaired by [[Ron Book]], the lobbyist who helped write and pass into law the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} restriction, prompted by the abuse of his daughter at the hands of a hired caretaker. On April 15, 2010, the Trust moved the last of the sex offenders living under the bridge into other housing. However, further protest from nearby communities ensued. Several former residents of the encampment were evicted from a Miami hotel in late April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Valdemoro, Tania (April 25, 2010). "Shorecrest residents unhappy about relocation of sex offenders - Sex offenders? Not in my backyard, Miami residents tell their mayor and other city officials", '' The Miami Herald'', Shorecrest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebovick, Jennifer; Beasley, Adam (April 20, 2010). "Hotel evicts sex offenders", ''The Miami Herald'', p. 3B.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported on the fate of the former Julia Tuttle Causeway colony, which former residents nicknamed "Bookville". Analysts studying the colony unanimously agreed on two relevant issues: the inability to find a stable home for offenders increased the risk that they would re-offend, and the close proximity of offenders to schools or parks did not increase the possibility that past offenders would re-offend. Despite these findings, Book solicited for and applied [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|federal stimulus money]] to buy short-term stays for offenders, eventually costing [[US$]]1,000 a month which, as noted by the ''Herald'', would have been unnecessary without the more stringent law that Book championed. This is incorrect according to David Raymond, former executive director of the Homeless Trust: federal Stimulus funds were never utilized for this population in Miami-Dade County; the funds used were from the local Homeless Food &amp; Beverage Tax.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Rent subsidies, along with job placement services and case management, were provided for up to six months.

Residents of Miami's Shorecrest neighborhood protested about the 13 sex offenders who had relocated there. Book placed another 43 offenders in a trailer park also housing many children. Book forewarned that the stimulus funds for housing the sex offenders would run out. The ''Herald'' reported that out of 1,960 sex offenders who had registered to live in Miami-Dade, 256 stopped reporting their locations to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas, Valerie and Bradley, Walter (November 5, 2011).

Retrieved on November 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2013 and 2014, evidence began to reach the news media that there was still a problem of homelessness amongst Miami-Dade sex offenders, despite the county's relaxation of the residency restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, Sarnoff himself has built miniature "pocket parks" in order to prevent sex offenders from being able to move into the Little River area of Miami, which Sarnoff represents.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Now, many of the homeless sex offenders are sleeping on railroad tracks (although most have homes during the day since the Miami-Dade residency restriction only applies from 10 pm to 6 am.) In October 2014, the ACLU announced plans to again sue the county over the residency restrictions. A similar lawsuit by the ACLU against Miami-Dade County failed in the 2009 case Exile v. Miami-Dade County, when it was ruled that Florida law does not prevent localities from enacting stricter sex offender residency restrictions. (This is contrary to a [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] ruling that invalidated local sex offender ordinances on those grounds.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}})

When [[Hurricane Irma]] hit in September, 2017, there were 233 sex offenders registered "to the area of NW 71st Street and NW 36th Court" in [[Hialeah, Florida]], i.e., adjacent to the train tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Ken Freedman''' (born February 18, 1959) is general manager of [[WFMU]], a [[freeform radio]] station. He also co-hosts the conceptual comedy program [[Seven Second Delay]] with [[Andy Breckman]], as well as hosting his own freeform radio program on Wednesday mornings (9:00–noon Eastern Time). He is the co-founder of [[The Audience Engine|Congera]], a public benefit corporation.

Freedman hosted his first radio program in 1976 as a [[DJ]] at [[Highland Park High School (New Jersey)|Highland Park High School]] station WVHP. He served as station manager of [[WCBN-FM]], the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor]]'s freeform outlet, where he marked the 1980 election of [[Ronald Reagan]] by playing [[Lesley Gore]]'s "It's My Party (And I'll Cry If I Want To)" for eighteen consecutive hours.&lt;ref name="WCBN"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wcbn.org/history/wcbntime.html | title = CBN History: Radio/Broadcasting Timeline| author = | publisher = WCBN Online | date = May 10, 2005 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman joined WFMU as a DJ in December 1983, and succeeded Bruce Longstreet as general manager in August 1985. At the time, WFMU was licensed to and owned by [[Upsala College]], and based in [[East Orange, New Jersey]].

In February 1986, Freedman launched a program guide/[[zine]] called LCD (Lowest Common Denominator), featuring work by many internationally known writers and artists, including [[Nick Tosches]], [[Jim Woodring]], [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], [[Gary Panter]], [[Harvey Pekar]], [[Dan Clowes]], [[Tony Millionaire]], and [[Chris Ware]]. In November 2007, ''The Best of LCD: The Art and Writing of WFMU'', was published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]]. It was compiled and edited by longtime WFMU radio host Dave "The Spazz" Abramson.

In 1989, Freedman successfully fended off a challenge to the station's license from four rival broadcasters, who claimed that WFMU was broadcasting above its legal power limit.

In 1992, he founded the non-profit organization Auricle Communications, which purchased WFMU's license from Upsala in 1994. These actions allowed WFMU to survive when the college went bankrupt in 1995.&lt;ref name="Wolf2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wfmu.org/times/ | title = No Hits All the Time| author = Wolf, Jaime| publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = April 11, 1999 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A core strategy for the station was to embrace the [[World Wide Web]], launching its website in 1993, streaming its broadcasts full-time in 1997, and archiving most broadcasts from 2000.&lt;ref name="Applebome"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/24towns.html | title = Looking for Music, but Not 'Celebration,' to Remember Castro? Put the Radio On | author = Applebome, Peter |authorlink=Peter Applebome| publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 24, 2008 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freedman's management, annual donations to the station (which is funded exclusively by listener support) grew from $50,000 in 1983, to $750,000 in 1999, to over $1,800,000 in 2012.&lt;ref name="Wolf2"/&gt; Freedman has made it his mission to keep up with digital technological developments and how they impact radio. "I keep abreast of new technology mainly from my children and their friends, as well as the youngest generation of programmers and superfans at WFMU," he explained in a 2018 ''[[Radio World]]'' interview. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/0002/keeping-up-with-digital-technology-a-challenge-for-small-broadcasters/340977 Vernon, Tom, "Keeping Up With Digital Technology a Challenge for Small Broadcasters,"] ''[[Radio World]]'', January 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman pioneered the use of direct licensing for broadcasters, obtaining alternative copyrights and waivers to address restrictions placed on broadcasters by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In 2007, Freedman built on these direct licensing activities and founded WFMU's [[Free Music Archive]], an open source library of copyright-cleared music and audio which launched in April 2009.&lt;ref name="Berkman"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjTWFBNn1rA | title = Ken Freedman's Open Source Marriage of Audio, Music &amp; Radio| author = Freedman, Ken| publisher = Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University | date = 2007-05-09 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman has served on the board of public science and technology company New Brunswick Scientific Company (purchased in 2004 by Eppendorf) and was a board member (for four years) and technology advisor to [[National Federation of Community Broadcasters (NFCB)]]. He has spoken and presented at conferences sponsored by [[The Future of Music Coalition]], [[National Public Radio]], the Integrated Media Association, the [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES), [[O'Reilly Media]]'s Newsfoo Conference, The [[Awesome Foundation]] Summit, the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[National Federation of Community Broadcasters]].

In 2013, Freedman initiated the creation of a suite of software for broadcasters, journalists and online publishers known as [[the Audience Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6648509/wfmu-wants-to-change-how-media-talks-to-its-audiences-and-raises-money-for Flanagan, Andrew, "WFMU Wants to Change How Media Talks to Its Audiences and Raises Money — For Free," [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], July 29, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he began performing stand-up comedy and has performed acts at the New York Comedy Club, the Broadway Comedy Club, the Greenwich Village Comedy Club and other venues in New York, New Jersey and San Francisco.

==History==
In some societies, in the late 18th century and early 19th century, these developed within the context of maintaining a layered societal structure and the protection of property.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Larry J. |title=Criminology |pages=515, 516 |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2005}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PRmhu3M2jv8C&amp;pg=PA515&amp;lpg=PA515&amp;dq=police+american+colonies&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Dxk8AuzQR6&amp;sig=KokKB0NmB0Gs5DWxF3Jl3OhQQcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom in the late 18th century: {{quote |The modern police department was born out of...the desire of the wealthy to restructure ... society. The swelling population of urban poor, whose miniscule [sic] wages could hardly sustain them, heightened the need for police protection.}}&lt;ref name="studymode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Governments-Secure-Wealth-To-Defend-The-1773414.html|title=Governments Secure Wealth to Defend the Rich from the Poor - Research Paper - Roijster|publisher=studymode.com|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in the 19th century: {{quote |The police role was only minimally directed at law enforcement. Its primary function was serving as the enforcement arm of the reigning political power, protecting property, and keeping control of the ever increasing numbers of foreign immigrants{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}}}

In 1690 [[John Locke]]&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr09.htm |title=John Locke: Second Treatise of Civil Government: Chapter 9|publisher=constitution.org|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that:
{{quote |[t]he great and chief end ... of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property}}

Similarly, [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-b5-c1-pt-2.htm Adam Smith - An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations - The Adam Smith Institute]
&lt;/ref&gt; described how:
{{quote |... as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property ... Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions ... The appropriation of herds and flocks which introduced an inequality of fortune was that which first gave rise to regular government. Till there be property there can be no government, the very end of which is to secure wealth, and to defend the rich from the poor}}

This close link between property and government (and thus police function) was also noted by [[John Jay]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.bartleby.com/73/764.html Frank Monaghan, John Jay, chapter 15, p. 323 (1935)
&lt;/ref&gt; who repeatedly said that:

'''Lean Government''' refers to the application of [[lean production]] (also known as "Lean") principles and methods to both identify and then implement the most efficient, [[value added]] way to provide government services. Government agencies have found that when Lean is implemented, they see an improved understanding of how their own processes work, that it facilitates the quick identification and implementation of improvements and that it builds a culture of [[continuous improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 2008) and Graham Richard (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean for government focuses on governing and serving citizens with respect and continuously improving service delivery by cutting out "waste" and "inefficiency" in processes; this in turn will result in better services overall, engaged civil servants as well as more [[Value (economics)|value]] for tax-supported programs and services. Generally, proponents also see that a Lean government is a means to expand the capacity of government to provide more services per [[Unit of account|unit]] of [[investment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Miller, [http://www.governing.com/column/promise-going-lean &amp;ldquo; The Promise of Going Lean&amp;rdquo;], ''Governing,'' May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common methods and approaches==
Many Lean manufacturing methods have been successfully adapted to identify non-value added activities (waste) in administrative, transactional, and office processes that are common in government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Carlos | last = Venegas | title = Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements  | publisher= Productivity Press  | year =2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Lean methods include:

* [[Value Stream Mapping]] (VSM) – Value stream mapping refers to the development of a high‐level visual representation of a process flow that is involved in delivering a product or service (called a “value stream”) to customers. VSM events, which are typically 3–4 days, focus on identifying the sources of non‐value added activity and prioritizing possible improvement activities.
* [[Kaizen]] – Kaizen means to change for the good of all and is based on the philosophy of improvement, without regard to its size, type or duration. Kaizen activity is often focused on rapid process improvement events (called kaizen events) that bring together a cross‐functional team for 3‐5 days to study a specific process followed by implementing process changes.
* [[5S (methodology)|5S]] – 5S is the name of a workplace organizational method that uses a list of five Japanese words which, when translated into English, start with the letter S—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.

As more and more government services are delivered electronically, Lean government initiatives are commonly applications of [[Lean IT]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Maria. [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS119892+06-Mar-2009+PRN20090306 &amp;ldquo;The City of Cape Coral Enables Leaner Government with AMX and JD Edwards&amp;rdquo;] ''Reuters''. March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean government approaches typically have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/primer/resources/LeanGovtPrimer.pdf | title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Council of States, Working Smart for Environmental Protection: Improving State Agency Processes with Lean and Six Sigma | publisher= U.S. EPA | work = Publication #EPA-100-R-08-007 | date = March 2008 | pages =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Take a [[customer service]] perspective that seeks to optimize value delivered to the public, the regulated community, and/or other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s;
*Involve employees and external stakeholders in continual improvements and [[problem-solving]] activities;
*Deploy a rapid [[continuous improvement]] framework that emphasizes implementation over prolonged planning;
*Seek to reduce the complexity of processes and the variation in process outputs;
*Use [[performance metrics]] and visual controls to provide rapid feedback to improve real-time [[decision-making]] and problem-solving; and
*Approach improvement activities using [[systems thinking]].

Lean government does not necessarily promote low [[taxes]], only efficient use of those taxes levied. Tax policy is discerned by the [[legislative]] and executive branches of government with oversight of the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Lean government is implemented by the administrative function of government through executive order, legislative mandate, or departmental administrative decisions.  Lean government can be applied in legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

==Types of waste==
Several types of non-value added activity, or waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] in Japanese), are common in government administrative and service processes.  Lean methods focus on identifying and eliminating these wastes.  The list below identifies common administrative process wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/starterkit/index.htm|title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lean in Government Starter Kit: How to Implement Successful Lean Initiatives at Environmental Agencies, Version 2.0|publisher=U.S. EPA Publication # EPA-100-K-09-007, May 2009, p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative process wastes with examples===

* Inventory = Backlog of Work, Excess Materials or Information
* Defects = Data Errors, Missing Info
* Overproduction = Unneeded Reports, Doing Work Not Requested
* Complexity = Unnecessary Process Steps
* Waiting = Unnecessary Approval Cycles
* Excess Motion = Trips to Remote Printer or Files
* Moving Items = Report Routing, File Storage

Wastes in administrative and service processes can relate to:
# collection, use, and management of information
# design and implementation of work processes
# the efficiency and effectiveness with which individuals work.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Venegas, Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements, Productivity Press, 2007, pp. 10-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lean government activity==
Numerous government agencies, such as the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the States of [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]] [[Washington (state)|and Washington]], are using Lean to improve the quality, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and speed of government processes. As in the manufacturing and service sectors, some government agencies are implementing Lean methods in conjunction with [[Six Sigma]] process improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Michael L. George, Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed &amp; Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions, The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal science''' is one of the main components in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition (after [[Roman law]], [[canon law]], [[commercial law]], and the legacy of the revolutionary period).

Legal science is primarily the creation of German legal scholars of the middle and late nineteenth century, and it evolved naturally out of the ideas of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].  Savigny argued that German codification should not follow the rationalist and [[secular natural law]] thinking that characterized the French codification but should be based on the principles of law that had historically been in force in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Merryman et al., The Civil Law Tradition: Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, Cases and Materials 481 (LexisNexis ed., 1994) (reprinted 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

'''MDV''' is a joint venture television station between [[Prime Media Group]] and [[WIN Corporation]].  Based in [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], it is a [[digital television|digital]]-only [[Network Ten]] affiliate run under the company name ''Mildura Digital Television Pty Ltd'', and began broadcasting on 1 January 2006. On 1 July 2016, due to [[WIN Television]] becoming the Network Ten affiliate in the region, MDV switched its affiliation to the [[Nine Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/nine-inks-affiliate-deal-to-run-signal-into-regional-victoria/news-story/ce0e9b776624e5e71b5ae59d7e6d15a6 |title=Nine reaches affiliate deal to run signal into regional Victoria |last=Mitchell |first=Jake |date=28 June 2016 |publisher=The Australian |access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
The station is a Nine Network affiliate, which is jointly owned by Prime Media Group and WIN Television. MDV is available on [[Logical channel number|LCN]] 5 in the Mildura and Sunraysia area in [[standard-definition]].

Nine's mulitchannels [[9Gem]] (in [[High-definition television|high definition]]) and [[9Go!]] are available on LCN 50 and LCN 55 respectively. Before MDV's affiliation change on 1 July 2016, Ten's multichannels [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] and [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] were available on LCN 50 and LCN 55 respectively.

WIN is responsible for handling playout and then transmits this signal via satellite to transmission facilities in Mildura. WIN also handles the business administration and advertising sales for MDV.

The Mildura/Sunraysia region changed frequencies as part of a nationwide retune process on 26 August 2014, and the station moved from UHF 33 to VHF 10 as a result of the retune.

A '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|madhhab}}''''' ({{lang-ar|مذهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏhab}}'', {{IPA-ar|ˈmaðhab|IPA}}, "way to act"; pl. {{lang|ar|مذاهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏāhib}}'', {{IPA-ar|maˈðaːhɪb|}}) is a school of thought within ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic [[jurisprudence]]). In the first 150 years of [[Islam]], there were numerous ''madhahib'', most of which have become extinct or merged with other schools. The [[Amman Message]], which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] schools ([[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]), two [[Shia Islam|Shia]] schools ([[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]]), the [[Ibadi]] school and the [[Zahiri]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amman Message|url=http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ancient" schools===
According to John Burton, “modern research shows” that fiqh was first “regionally organized” with “considerable disagreement and variety of view”. In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists  to the legal practices of their local communities, whether [[Mecca]], [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], Syria, etc.&lt;ref name=JBSILITA1990:13&gt;[[#JBSILITA1990|Burton, ''Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', 1990]]: p.13&lt;/ref&gt; (Egypt's school in [[Fustat]] was a branch of Medina's school of law and followed such practices -- up until the end of the 8th century -- as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa'd.){{#tag:ref|
It is usually assumed that no regional school developed in Egypt (unlike in Syria, Iraq and the Hijaz). Joseph Schacht states that the legal milieu of [[Fustat]] (ancient Cairo) was a branch of the Medinan school of law.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding judicial practices, the qadis (judges) of Fustat resorted to the procedure called "''al-yamin ma'a l-shahid''", that is, the ability of the judge to base his verdict on one single witness and the oath of the claimant, instead of two witnesses as was usually required. Such a procedure was quite common under the early Umayyads, but by the early Abbasid period it had disappeared in Iraq and it was now regarded as the {{'}}''amal'' ("good practice") of Medina. Up until the end of the 8th century, the qadis of Fustat were still using this "Medinan" procedure and differentiated themselves from Iraqi practices. From a doctrinal point of view, however, the legal affiliation of Egypt could be more complex. The principal Egyptian jurist in the second half of the 8th century is al-Layth b. Sa'd.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Khoury, "Al-Layth Ibn Sa'd (94/713-175/791), grand maître et mécène de l’Egypte, vu à travers quelques documents islamiques anciens", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 40, 1981, p. 189–202&lt;/ref&gt; The only writing of his that has survived is a letter he wrote to Malik b. Anas, which has been preserved by Yahya b. Ma'in and al-Fasawi. In this letter, he proclaims his theoretical affiliation to the Medinan methodology and recognizes the value of the {{'}}''amal''. Nevertheless, he distances himself from the Medinan School by opposing a series of Medinan legal views. He maintains that the common practice in other cities is also valuable, and thus implicitly defends the Egyptians’ adherence to their own local tradition. Thus it is possible that, even though it did not develop into a formal school of law, a specific Egyptian legal milieu was distinct of the Medinan School in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu Tillier, "[https://www.academia.edu/1470575/Les_premiers_cadis_de_Fus_a_et_les_dynamiques_regionales_de_linnovation_judiciaire_750-833_ Les “premiers” cadis de Fusṭāṭ et les dynamiques régionales de l’innovation judiciaire (750-833)]", ''Annales Islamologiques'', 45 (2011), p. 214–218&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} 
[[Al-Shafi‘i]] writes that, `every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings`.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-246&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tr-III-148&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shafi'i |page=148. Kitab Ikhtilaf Malid wal-Shafi'i | title=Kitab al-Umm vol. vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "real basis" of legal doctrine in these "ancient schools" was not a body of reports of Muhammad's sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the `living tradition` of the school as "expressed in the consensus of the scholars", according to Joseph Schacht.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-98&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shafi‘i and after===
It has been asserted that ''madhahib'' were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Islamic_law.aspx |title=Law, Islamic |work=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged.  One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially{{when|date=December 2013}} split into four groups: the [[Hanafi]]tes, [[Maliki]]tes, [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Zahiri]]tes.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, ''Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers'', pg. 34. [[New Delhi]]: Ashish Publishing House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Hanbali]]tes and [[Jariri]]tes developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites;&lt;ref name=mel&gt;[[Christopher Melchert]], ''The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law'': 9th-10th Centuries C.E., pg. 178. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] established a total of four independent [[Qadi|judicial positions]], thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools.&lt;ref name="stewart" /&gt;  The Ottoman Empire later reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi'ite Persia.&lt;ref name=chib&gt;Chibli Mallat, ''Introduction to Middle Eastern Law'', pg. 116. [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: ''Ahl al-Ra'i'' ("people of opinions", emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and ''[[Ahl al-Hadith]]'' ("people of traditions", emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).&lt;ref&gt;Murtada Mutahhari, [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ijtihad-legislation.htm ''The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation''], [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ Al-Tawhid] volume IV, No.2, Publisher: [http://www.itf.org.ir/ Islamic Thought Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

10th century [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim]] named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Zahiri, [[Twelver|Imami Shi'ite]], Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]].&lt;ref name=mel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Devin J.

Historically, the ''fiqh'' schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions.&lt;ref name=chib /&gt;  Geographer and historian [[Al-Muqaddasi]] once satirically categorized competing ''madhahib'' with contrasting personal qualities: Hanafites, highly conscious of being hired for official positions, appeared deft, well-informed, devout and prudent; Malikites, dull and obtuse, confined themselves to observance of prophetic tradition; Shafi'ites were shrewd, impatient, understanding and quick-tempered; Zahirites haughty, irritable, loquacious and well-to-do; Shi'ites, entrenched and intractable in old rancor, enjoyed riches and fame; and Hanbalites, anxious to practice what they preached, were charitable and inspiring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Massignon]], ''The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam''. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 130. [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; While such descriptions were almost assuredly humorous in nature, ancient differences were less to do with actual doctrinal opinions than with maneuvering for adherents and influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== List of schools ==
Generally, Sunnis have a single preferred ''madhhab'' from region to region, but also believe that ''[[ijtihad]]'' must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so.  Most rely on ''[[taqlid]]'', or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=MNJ06&amp;articleID=MNJ060001&amp;articlePages=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts and scholars of ''fiqh'' follow the ''[[usul al-fiqh|usul]]'' (principles) of their own native ''madhhab'', but they also study the ''usul'', evidences, and opinions of other ''madhahib''.

===Sunni===
{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Law}}

[[Sunni]] schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them.  The four primary Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] rites. The [[Zahiri]] school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the [[Jariri]], [[Laythi]], [[Awza'i]] and [[Thawri]] have  become extinct.

The extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to [[Qiyas|analogical]] reason and pure reason.

* The [[Hanafi]] school was founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]]. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of [[Islam in Russia|Russia's Muslim community]]. There are movements within this school such as [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]], which are concentrated in South Asia.
* The [[Maliki]] school was founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]]. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The [[Murabitun World Movement]] follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of [[Islam in Europe|Europe under Islamic rule]], particularly [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].
* The [[Shafi'i]] school was founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]]. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the [[Mappila]]s of [[Kerala]] and [[Konkani Muslims]] of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia.
* The [[Hanbali]] school was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.
* The [[Zahiri]] school was founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain.

===Shia===
{{Shia Islam|collapsed=1}}
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}

* [[Twelver]]s (see also ''[[Imami]]'')
** [[Ja'fari]]: associated with [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].  The time and space bound [[Fatwa|rulings]] of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imams]].  The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the [['aql|intellect]] instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice.
*** [[Usulism]]: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a [[Marja'|Marja-i Taqlid]] on the subject of [[taqlid]] and fiqh. They are concentrated in &lt;nowiki&gt;Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
*** [[Akhbarism]]: similar to Usulis, however reject [[ijtihad]] in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.
*** [[Shaykhism]]: an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the [[Bábism|Bábí]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.
** The [[Batiniyyah]] school consists of [[Alevis]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashis]], and [[Alawites]], who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].
*** [[Alawism]] is followed by [[Alawites]], who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their [[madh'hab]] was established by [[Ibn Nusayr]], and their [[aqidah]] is developed by [[Al-Khaṣībī]]. They follow ''Cillī'' [[aqidah]] of ''"Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh"'' of the [[‘Alawi]]s.&lt;ref name="Meymûn"&gt;"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī [[aqidah]]" of "Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh" (Sūlaiman Affandy, ''Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah - [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14-15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both ''Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī'' and ''Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim’at-Tabarānī]]'' were the [[murid]]s of ''"[[Al-Khaṣībī]]"'', the founder of the [[Nusayri]] [[tariqat]].&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-alawi.htm|title=Alawi Islam|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Alevism]], sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many ''[[Tasawwuf]]ī'' characteristics and express belief in the [[Qur'an]] and [[The Twelve Imams]], but reject [[polygamy]] and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish [[shamanism]]. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in [[Turkey]], with the rest in the [[Balkans]], [[Albania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].
* [[Ismaili]] Muslims who adhere to the [[Shi'a]] [[Ismaili]] [[Fatimid]] fiqh, follow the ''[[Daim al-Islam]]'', a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including [[Ibadat]] in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought.
** Tāyyebī Mustā'līyyah: the [[Mustaali]] group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Nizāriyya in that they believe that the successor-Imām to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, was his younger son al-Mustaʻlī, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]]. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Mustaʻlī over Nizār as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the [[Taiyabi]], which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the [[Hafizi]] branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized [[Al-Amir]] as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]] was the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The [[Hafizi]] themselves however considered [[Al-Hafiz]] as the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (الداعي المطلق), Ma'zoon (مأذون) and Mukasir (مكاسر). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]], and [[Alavi Bohra]].
** [[Nizari]]: the largest branch (95%) of [[Ismā'īlī]], they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is currently invested in [[Aga Khan IV]]. Their present living Imam is [[Mawlānā]] [[Shah Karim Al-Husayni]] who is the 49th Imam. [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]]s believe that the successor-Imām to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] was his elder son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|al-Nizār]]. While ''[[Nizārī]]'' belong to the "[[Imami]] jurisprudence" or [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fāriyya Madhab ''(school of Jurisprudence)'']], believed by Shias to be founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]] they adhere to sumpremacy of "[[Kalam]]", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh ''(traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]),'' which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] approach to [[revelation]].
* [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] jurisprudence follows the teachings of [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Sayyid 2005"&gt;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين (A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], Imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]] worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars{{fact|date=November 2018}}. [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] did not themselves write any books{{fact|date=November 2018}}. But their views are Hadiths in the books written by Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]]. Therefore, the [[Zaydis]] to this day and originally the [[Fatimids]], used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as do most Sunnis.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ElRUvoVRxYC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Finance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="Arab-Israeli Conflict Page 917"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA917&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Iraq Effect Page 91"&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-3LAlfW7DIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=The Iraq Effect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

===Ibadi ===
The [[Ibadi]] school of Islam is named after [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh]], though he is not necessarily the main figure of the school in the eyes of its adherents. Ibadism is distinct from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam not only in terms of its jurisprudence, but also its core beliefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">'''Master of Jurisprudence''' is sometimes used as an alternative name for both [[Master of Laws]] and Master of Juridical Science.

Offered within [[United States]] law schools, students of an M.J., or M.Jur., curriculum are often business professionals and/or [[Juris Doctor]] degree holders who wish to enhance their knowledge in a specialized field of law.  A Master of Jurisprudence is highly beneficial for those that need an in-depth understanding of the law within current executive level positions.&lt;ref&gt;St. Mary's University School of Law. [https://law.stmarytx.edu/academics/programs/master-of-jurisprudence/ ''Master of Jurisprudence'']&lt;/ref&gt;

M.J. students are required to develop a comprehensive understanding of the operation of law as it applies to a specified area of law. Master of Jurisprudence program offerings may focus on Business and Corporate Governance Law&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M University School of Law. [http://law.tamu.edu/llm-mjur-programs/san-antonio-mjur-program/m-jur-program ''Business Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;, Immigration Law, Health Law, Administrative Law, Real Estate Law, and Risk Management&lt;ref&gt;Drake University. [http://www.drake.edu/law/future/academics/mj/compliance/ ''Risk Management'']&lt;/ref&gt;. Some M.J. programs combine a combination of graduate level legal courses with MBA-style courses in concentrated areas of study.

The M.J. program typically ranges between 30 and 45 credit hours. Some students may be able to complete the program in as little as one year, depending on their academic status.

Master of Jurisprudence degrees are designed to provide a deeper understanding of the U.S. legal system to business professionals. While some classes may be shared with J.D. candidates, the MJur does not prepare recipients to sit for the bar exam to practice law, but rather provides a better understanding of legal issues related to the recipient's chosen field.

'''Matthew Henry Kramer''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 9 June 1959)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U282253 KRAMER, Prof. Matthew Henry], ''Who's Who 2014'', A &amp; C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is an American philosopher, currently Professor of Legal and Political Philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/academic/mh-kramer/51 Cambridge Faculty of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/whoswho.php Churchill College]&lt;/ref&gt; He writes mainly in the areas of metaethics, normative ethics, legal philosophy, and political philosophy. He is a leading proponent of [[legal positivism]]. He has been Director of the [http://www.cflpp.law.cam.ac.uk/ Cambridge Forum for Legal and Political Philosophy] since 2000. He has been teaching at Cambridge University and at Churchill College since 1994.

== Career ==
Kramer was born in Massachusetts and educated at Middleborough High School, [[Cornell University]] (B.A. in Philosophy) where he became a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], [[Harvard University]] (J.D.) and Cambridge University (Ph.D. in Philosophy and LL.D.).

His sixteen books as author and four as editor, as well as his dozens of journal articles, range over many areas of [[Jurisprudence|legal]], [[Political Philosophy|political]] and [[moral philosophy]]. He has received several major research awards including a [http://www.gf.org/history-people Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship] (2001) and a [http://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/MRF/MRF.cfm Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship] (2005). He is a subject editor for the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy and is on the editorial board of the Oxford Studies in Political Philosophy, the American Journal of Jurisprudence, Law &amp; Philosophy, Ratio Juris, and Legal Theory. He is also an Advisory Editor for the University of Bologna Law Review (general student-edited law journal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bolognalawreview.unibo.it/about/displayMembership/123|title=Advisory Board|author=|publisher=Bolognalawreview.unibo.it|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the undergraduate level he lectures and supervises in Jurisprudence, and he also lectures on Topics in Legal &amp; Political Philosophy in the postgraduate LL.M. program. At Cambridge, he is a graduate supervisor both for Ph.D. students in the Law Faculty and for M.Phil. and Ph.D. students in the Philosophy Faculty.

He was a visiting professor at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in April 2009, and at [[Tel Aviv University]] in March 2012.

In 2014 he was elected a [[British Academy#Fellowship|Fellow of the British Academy]], the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref name="BA Fellow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/british-academy-announces-42-new-fellows/2014585.article | title=British Academy announces 42 new fellows | publisher=Times Higher Education | date=18 July 2014 | accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusive legal positivism ==

An inclusive legal positivist, Kramer argues in his book [http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?alumni=A1039&amp;isbn=978-0199274192 Where Law and Morality Meet] that moral principles can enter into the law of any jurisdiction. He contends that legal officials can invoke moral principles as laws for resolving disputes, and that they can also invoke them as threshold tests which ordinary laws must satisfy. In opposition to many other theorists, Kramer argues that these functions of moral principles are consistent with all the essential characteristics of any legal system. He is also a leading proponent of the legal positivist argument that law and morality are separable, arguing against the position of natural-law theory, which portrays legal requirements as a species of moral requirements. According to him, even though the existence of a legal system in any sizeable society is essential for the realization of fundamental moral values, law is not inherently moral either in its effects or in its motivational underpinnings.

== Moral realism as a moral doctrine ==

Influenced by the theories of [[Ronald Dworkin]], Kramer is a moral realist who argues that "moral requirements are strongly objective" and that "the objectivity of ethics is itself an ethical matter that rests primarily on ethical considerations." In his book [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405194022.html Moral Realism as a Moral Doctrine], he thus claims that "[m]oral realism - the doctrine that morality is indeed objective - is a moral doctrine." Unlike Dworkin, he believes that, although there is a determinately correct moral answer to most moral questions, there exists genuine moral indeterminacy in relation to some rare moral questions. He also distances himself from Dworkin's defense of value monism.

The '''Exile of Mawzaʻ''' (the expulsion of Yemenite Jews to [[Mawza District|Mawza']]) {{lang-he-n|גלות מוזע}}, {{IPA-he|''ğalūt mawzaʻ''|pron}};&amp;lrm; 1679–1680, is considered the single most traumatic event experienced collectively by the [[Jews of Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Yuval Tobi, "Attitude of the Muslim Authority in Yemen to the Jewish Messianic Movements", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 135 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Galut Mawzaʻ'', Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 79 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the king, Imām [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]], and sent to a dry and barren region of the country named Mawzaʻ to withstand their fate or to die. Only a few communities, ''viz.'', those Jewish inhabitants who lived in the far eastern quarters of Yemen ([[Nihm District|Nihm]], [[Al Jawf Governorate|al-Jawf]], and [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] of the east&lt;ref&gt;The one exception being Tan'am, which although it lies in the principality of Khawlan, was not spared the fate of exile.&lt;/ref&gt;) were spared this fate by virtue of their Arab patrons who refused to obey the king's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," Sefunot, Volume 2, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Many would die along the route and while confined to the hot and arid conditions of this forbidding terrain. After one year in exile, the exiles were called back to perform their usual tasks and labors for the indigenous Arab populations, who had been deprived of goods and services on account of their exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]] (ed.), "Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (end); [[Amram Qorah]], ''Sa'arat Teiman'', Jerusalem 1987, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the rise to power of the Qāsimīd Imām, [[al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]] (1644–1676), there was a crucial turning point in the condition of Jews living under the Imamate kingdom of Yemen. He endorsed the most hostile policies toward his Jewish subjects, partly due to the claim that the Jews were aiding the Ottoman Turks during the local uprising against them.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Shabbathian]] movement in Yemen in 1666 exacerbated the problems facing the community, calling into question their status as protected wards of the State. One decree led to another.&lt;ref&gt;One Jewish poet bewails their fate at this time, saying: "Since the day that they removed the turbans from our heads (i.e. 1666), we are full of orders which he decrees [against us]. He has placed over our heads [a governor] who is the master of oppression!" See: Ratzaby, ''Sefunot'' (Volume Five), Jerusalem 1961, p. 378 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The king initially demanded their conversion to Islam and when they refused, he made them stand out in the sun without apparel for three days, which was later followed by harsher decrees. It is said that al-Mutawakkil Isma'il consulted with the religious scholars of Islam and sought to determine whether or not the laws concerning Jews in the Arabian Peninsula applied also to Yemen, citing [[Muhammad]] who was reported as saying, "There shall not be two religions in Arabia." When it was determined that these laws did indeed apply to Yemen, since the country was an indivisible part of the Arabian Peninsula, it then became incumbent upon Jews living in Yemen to either convert to Islam or to leave the country. Yet, since the king fell ill and was bedridden, he did not presently perform his ill-designs to expel the Jews from his kingdom, but commanded the heir to his throne, al-Mahdi Ahmad, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537121.2014.889893#.U_Q_qcJ0xjo Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' (''Studies in Their History and Culture''), Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mahdi Ahmad of al-Ghirās, who is also known by the epithet ''Ṣafī al-Din'' (purity of religion), succeeded al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, but perpetuated the same hostilities toward his Jewish subjects as those made by his predecessor. Everything reached its climax between the years 1677 and 1680, when he ordered the destruction of the synagogues in Sana'a and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Tanḥum ben Joseph, of Jerusalem, ''al-Murshid al-kāfi'' (in manuscript form), p. 112 (Yosef Tobi's Private Collection), we read the following marginal note: "The synagogue was destroyed here, [in] Ḥamdah, on Wednesday, the 17th day of the lunar month Teveth, in the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (=1678 CE), by order of al-Mahdi and Muhammad ben Ahmad." Yehudah Ratzaby (1984, p. 149) also brings down a manuscript extracted from the binding of an old book, now at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York (239), in which the author complains: "The razing of the synagogue of Būsān on the fourth day of the week which is the third day of the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (= 1678 CE), and the enemies forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of Law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees." (See: Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' - ''Studies in Their History and Culture'', Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 78 [end] - 79)&lt;/ref&gt;  By early summer of 1679, he gave an ultimatum unto his Jewish subjects, namely, that they had the choice of either converting to Islam, in which they'd be allowed to remain in the country, or of being killed by the sword. He gave to them three months to decide what they would do.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," [https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152755/http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsArticles/sefunotII_OCR.pdf#page=270 ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסב (p. 270 in PDF) (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's words led to no small consternation amongst his Jewish subjects in Yemen, who immediately declared a time of public fasting and prayer, which they did both by night and day. Their plight soon became known to the local Yemeni tribesmen, whose chiefs and principal men pitied their condition and intervened on their behalf. They came before the king and enquired concerning the decree, and insisted that the Jews had been loyal to their king and had not offended the Arab peoples, neither had they done anything worthy of death, but should only be punished a little for their "obduracy" in what concerns the religion of Islam. The king, agreeing to their counsel, chose not to kill his Jewish subjects, but decided to banish them from his kingdom. They were to be sent to [[Zeila|Zeilaʻ]], a place along the African coast of the [[Red Sea]], where they would be confined for life, or else repent and accept the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסג (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Sana'a]] ==
The Jewish community in Sana'a was concentrated in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, within the walled city, as one enters Bab al-Shaʻub (the Shaʻub Gate) on Sana'a's north side. The chief rabbi of the Jewish community at that time was an elder to whom they gave the title of Prince (''nasi''), Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' (''ʻIyunim bi-megilat Teman''), The Magnes Press – Hebrew University, Jerusalem 1986, p. 42, note 68 (Hebrew). According to [[Erich Brauer]], the title of ''nasi'' was conferred upon a man belonging to the community's most noble and richest family. There was no direct election for this post. In general, the ''nasi'' was also a scholar, well-versed in Torah, but this was not a condition for his office. Among his duties, he was a representative of the community in all its affairs before the government. He was also entrusted with the duty of collecting the annual poll-tax (''ğizya''), as also to settle disputes arising between members of the community (E. Brauer, ''Ethnologie der jemenitischen Juden'', Heidelberg 1934, pp. 281–282).&lt;/ref&gt; while the city's chief seat of learning was under the tutelage of Rabbi and Judge, Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (''resh methivta'').&lt;ref&gt;Yiḥya Saleḥ, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Saleh), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. ''Shaḥrith shel Shabbath''. Rabbi Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (1610–1690) is said to have returned to his post after the Mawza Exile, serving as both President of the court at Ṣan'ā' and the city's spiritual instructor. He helped draft a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the Jewish community, by way of merit, and thereby hoping to prevent the recurrence of harsh decrees against the community in the future. See: Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman'': ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, p. 70 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Sana'a were given but short notice about the things that were about to happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Qafih believes that they were given advance warning as early as late-summer of 1678. See: Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713, note 130 (Hebrew). According to Arabic sources, Imām al-Mahdī had ordered the newly appointed governor of [[Sana'a]], Muhammad ibn al-Mutawakkil, to expel the Jews and demolish their synagogues on 1 Shaʻbān 1088 ''anno'' Hijri (= 29 September 1677), nearly two years before the actual expulsion. The matter was delayed only because the governor wished to consult first with the religious scholars of his city. All this may have been done without the foreknowledge of the Jewish community. (See: ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', by P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan and Q. Al-Samarrai, Leiden University 1990, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; They had been advised to sell their houses, fields and vineyards, and that all property which they were unable to sell would automatically be confiscated and accrue to the Public Treasury (Ar. ''al-māl''), without recompense.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1679, when the king saw that they were unrelenting in their fathers' faith, he then decided to follow through with what he had determined for them and issued a decree, banishing all Jews in his kingdom to the Red Sea outpost known as [[Zeila]]'. On the 2nd day of the lunar month [[Rajab]], in the year 1090 of the [[Hijri calendar]] (corresponds with [[Gregorian calendar]], August 10, 1679), his edict was put into effect, and he ordered the Jews of Sana'a to take leave of their places, but gave more space to the provincial governors of Yemen to begin the expulsion of all other Jews in Yemen to Zeila', and which should be accomplished by them in a time period not to exceed twelve months. The Jews of Sana'a had, meanwhile, set out on their journey, leaving behind them their homes and possessions, rather than exchange their religion for another. In doing so, they brought [[Kiddush Hashem|sanctity]] to God's name.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a teaching in Leviticus 22:31–32, and explained in the ''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra|David ibn Zimra]]'',vol. 2 (part 4), ''responsum'' no. 92 [1163], Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), p. 47 (Hebrew pagination כד). Here, the author makes it clear that if Jews are collectively compelled by the [[Ismaelites]] to convert to Islam or else face punishment, they are to prefer punishment rather than exchange their religion for another, and, in so doing, they bring sanctity to God's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh, by his wisdom and care for his community, had preemptively made arrangements for the community's safety and upkeep by sending written notifications to the Jewish communities which lay along the route, requesting that they provide food and assistance to their poor Jewish brethren when they passed through their communities in the coming weeks or days. The king's soldiers were sent to escort the exiles unto their final destination, while the king himself had sent orders to the governors of the outlying districts and places where it was known that the Jewish exiles were to pass through while ''en route'' to Zeila', commanding them not to permit any Jew to remain in those cities when they reached them, but to send them on in their journey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf|Avraham al-Naddaf]], ''Ḥoveret'' (article: ''History of Rabbi Sholem al-Shabazi''), Jerusalem 1928 (Hebrew); Reprinted in ''Zechor le'Avraham'', by Uziel al-Nadaf, (Part II) Jerualem 1992 (Hebrew), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected turn of events==
[[File:Jewish Mother and Daughter, December 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish mother and daughter in Yemen, 1949]]
Meanwhile, while columns of men, women and children were advancing by foot southward with only bare essentials, along the road leading from Sana'a to [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], [[Yarim]], '[[Ibb]] and [[Ta'izz]], the chiefs of the indigenous Sabaean tribes who had been the patrons of the Jews came together once again and petitioned the king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], this time requesting that the king rescind his order to expel all Jews unto the Red Sea outpost of Zeila', but to be content with their banishment to the [[Tihama]] coastal town of Mawza'. The reason being for this urgent request was that, by taking into consideration their troubles in a barren wasteland, those that will remain of them will be more inclined to repent and to choose the way of Islam, in which case it will be easier to hoist them from that place and to bring them back unto their former places. The grandees reminded the king how they had been faithful in implementing his orders. At hearing this, the king agreed and sent orders to the effect that Jewish exiles should be conducted only to Mawza'.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the Jews of Sana'a reached Dhamar, they had already been joined by the Jewish villagers of Siān and Tan'am (located about {{convert|15|km|mi|order=flip}}  eastward of Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, southeast Sana'a), all of which places lie within Sana'a's periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 367, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 16–19 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews had sent fifteen letters to the king in al-Ghirās, asking him to forgive them of whatever offense they may have made and to permit them to remain in their former settlements, yet none of these did he answer.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza' '', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 369, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 4–5 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation of the Jews of Dhurān==
[[File:Yemenite Elder Blowing Shofat, February 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|Yemenite Jew blows the shofar, 1947]]
Around the beginning of September 1679, approximately one month after the Jews of Sana'a had set out for Mawza‛, Jews that hailed from Dhurān – a village situate about three days' walking distance southwest of Sana'a – were also evacuated from their village. In a letter written in 1684 to the Jewish community of [[Hebron]], only four years after the community's return to Dhurān, the author describes the sufferings of the Jews who were forced to leave their homes and to go into Mawza‛.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, pp. 203-207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; One important revelation that emerges from his account of these events is that the Jews of Yemen had tried to pacify the king's wrath by paying large sums of money to him, but which money the king refused to accept:

{{blockquote|….On account of our many iniquities,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew expression of contriteness, signifying the people's acceptance of God's judgments and which expression is based on the Jewish teaching that all of God's ways are just.&lt;/ref&gt; God stirred up the spirit of the king who dwells in this country to banish us; we and our wives and our children, unto a barren desert, a place of serpents and scorpions and scorching fire; wrath pursues [us], so that there has been fulfilled in us [the Scripture that says]: '''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies''' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;. He has destroyed our synagogues, and has darkened the light of our eyes. 'Go away! [You are] unclean!' they cry out unto us, while the taskmasters are in a hurry, saying: 'Go away from here; purify yourselves!' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 52:11)&lt;/small&gt;, and do not take pity upon any of your delectable things, lest the king should be sorely angry with you, [and] will kill you and your children, your aged men and your young men. Now if you should forsake your God whom you trust, and enter into our own religion, it will be well with you, seeing that He is no longer with you, but has already abandoned you in our hands; [we] being able to do with you as we please!' …Now, there is no one who helps us, whether of the deputies or of the ministers, for when they saw that we had given-up our souls unto martyrdom for His name sake, and that we had been obedient to His word and speech, they then conspired against us to eradicate our name with fierce anger. They said [to us], 'this despised and wretched nation, they have rejected our religion (i.e. Islam), whereas neither largess, nor gratis, would have made them come over.' …They banded together against us, they and their kings, their male servants and handmaids, so that small babes spat upon him who is greatest amongst us. …Now, God has hidden His face from us, 'while we have all faded like a leaf' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 64:5)&lt;/small&gt;. We went with shame and with reproach, in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness and in deprivation of all things, unto that place which the king had decreed over us, for he had no wish for money, but rather in seeing our destruction.}}

The author goes on to explain how that, when they reached their destination, they wept bitterly, since many of them had perished as in a plague, and they were unable to bury them because of the excruciating heat. When some of their party had tried to escape at night, approximately seventy men, the next morning when the sun arose they were stricken down by the intense heat, and there they died. The author concludes by saying, "Now, this decree of exile was at the beginning of ''[[anno mundi]]'' 5440 (= 1679 CE), and the blessed God redeemed us at the [year's] end; the sign of which being: 'The punishment of your iniquity has ''ended'' ' &lt;small&gt;(Lam. 4:22)&lt;/small&gt;." Here, the author makes a play on words; the Hebrew word for "ended" (Heb. תם) having the numerical value of 440, the same as the year when abbreviated without the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, p. 207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mawzaʻ==
[[File:Tihama Coastal Plain, Yemen 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The Tihama Coastal Plain - 1931]]

Mawzaʻ is a town situated eleven-days' walking distance from Sana'a, and ca. {{convert|20|km|mi|order=flip}} from the port of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], in the [[Tihama]] coastal plain. During their long trek there, the king's soldiers pressed them on. Many of the sick and elderly and children died along the way. Others would later succumb to the harsh weather conditions of that place. All, however, suffered from hunger and thirst.  Eventually, the community of Sana'a was joined by other Jewish communities from across Yemen. In Mawzaʻ they remained for one full year, until 1680, when the king's non-Jewish subjects began to complain about their lack of farm implements which had been exclusively made by Jewish craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot (Volume Two), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246–286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714–715 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of [[`Amran]] went personally before the king with a petition to bring back his Jewish subjects. The king acquiesced and sent emissaries bearing food and water to call them back to their former cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], ''On the Origins of the Jews in Yemen'' (לקורות היהודים בתימן), Budapest 1931, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some returned only to find their homes taken by usurping occupants. Others decided to move and to settle elsewhere in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush''," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Hayim Hibshush]], speaking somewhat about this time, writes: "For the duration of one year since this decree was first issued, they went as sheep to the slaughter from all the districts of Yemen, while none remained of all those districts who did not go into exile, excepting the district of Nihm towards the east, and the district of al-Jawf, as well as the eastern district of Khawlan."&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical records==
[[File:Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, Yemen, in 1904.jpg|thumb|Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, 1904]]
Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (who is known by the acronym [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]]) gives a most captivating account of these harrowing events borne by the Jews of Sana'a in the years leading up to their expulsion, as also when they left their city, based on a hand-written document preserved and copied down by subsequent generations. Some have judged the sum and bearing of these events as a mere microscopic example of the sufferings experienced by the Jewish inhabitants as a whole, in each and every city throughout Yemen. Thus, he gives the following account:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi (ed.), ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' by Yiḥyah Salaḥ, The Magnes Press: Hebrew University,  Jerusalem 1986, pp. 44-47 (based on MS. #1, Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=...In the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-six [of the [[Seleucid Era]]] (1675{{nbsp}}CE) the king named [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il|Isma'il]] died, and there was a famine and many died. Then [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the son of Ḥasan, reigned in his stead, who was called al-Ḥasni, who expelled the Turks, and ruled by strength of arms, and was a man of exploits, and went up north and captured those districts, and went as far as to [[Yafa|al-Yāfaʻ]] [in the south] and captured it. And in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-seven [of the Seleucid Era] (1676 CE), he destroyed the synagogues of the Jews. Then in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-eight [of the Seleucid Era] (1677 CE) there was a famine, and in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-nine (1678 CE) he expelled Israel unto the desert of Mawzaʻ,&lt;ref&gt;Professor Yosef Tobi says that the date here is in error, and should rather be amended to read 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a horrific place, and one known for its excruciating heat; its air being bad.  No man could proceed upon the ground on account of their over weariness and the blisters which effected their feet.

Now, during that same year, when they departed from Sana'a to go unto Mawzaʻ, there was a certain gentile unto whom they committed for safekeeping several scrolls of the Law and several books of the [[Talmud]], and of Bible codices and of [[Midrashic]] literature [aplenty], as well as several leather-bound books which had been composed by the early scholars in their own hand-writing, for they were not able to carry them because of the encumbrance along the way, since they had been driven out on a sudden, they and their wives and children. Now these books nearly filled up one large room. They were of the opinion that they could appease the king, and that they would return to take their books. And it came to pass when they were gone away, that that [wicked] man arose and set fire to them, and burnt them all. On that very hour, Israel became impoverished in all things, whether on account of their shortage of books, or on account of their own novellæ and commentaries being burnt. Nothing remained except a few things of what little they had, of scrolls of the Law and ''[[Gemara]]''s, and the other books which had been taken by the heads of the people in their own hands for their own needs in study and in reading from the books of the Law.

Now while they ventured out in exile, several wise and pious men perished along the way, and several families were utterly taken away from off the face of the earth. Now, it has been told to us that about eighty souls died in one short period of time during one single journey in the desert, near the village of Mawzaʻ, on account of iniquities. On that upcoming Sabbath when they reached the village of Mawzaʻ it happened to be the Sabbath reading for the biblical lection known as ''Beḥuḳḳothai'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:3-ff.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This reading, based on the sequence of the biblical portions that are read throughout the year, would have been read the following year, in 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; and there stood up the greatest man amongst them to read the [[Tocheichah|Reproofs]], and when they came to the verse that says: ''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies, perhaps then their uncircumcised heart should be brought under submission etc.'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, and when he had then finished his reading, he began to expound [on that portion of the Law], and the spirit of God moved him, and he said that the present decree had been given from the start since ancient times, and is alluded to and is cleverly arranged and has been preserved in the acrostic at the end of each word [in the Hebrew verse], '''oyyaveihe&lt;big&gt;m&lt;/big&gt; '&lt;big&gt;o&lt;/big&gt; 'a&lt;big&gt;z&lt;/big&gt; yikan&lt;big&gt;a&lt;/big&gt;'' = אויביה&lt;big&gt;ם&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ז&lt;/big&gt; יכנ&lt;big&gt;ע&lt;/big&gt;  &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, [and which last letters spell out] '''M'''&lt;small&gt;a&lt;/small&gt;'''wzaʻ'''! By the end of the year, the blessed God took mercy upon them and the king was appeased by agreeing to bring back the Jews, only he did not permit them to return to their former houses, but rather to build for themselves [new] houses outside of the city. And so it was.

After these things, they settled in that place wherein the king had given to them to dwell, and they built houses. Now, in those days they appointed over themselves a Prince ([[Nagid]]), even the teacher and rabbi, Yiḥya Halevi, of blessed memory.}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jewish children in Sana'a, Yemen, circa 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish Children in the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a, 1901]]
Those Jews who survived, who returned either to Sana'a or to the other towns and villages, were mostly ill from being exposed to the changes in climate and from the poor quality of drinking water. In Sana'a, they were required to relinquish their ownership over their houses and fields within the city's wall, in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, and were directed to build humble abodes in a new area outside of the city's walls, in a place then known as the "hyena's field" (Ar. ''Qāʻ al-simaʻ''), or what later became known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud '' (the Jewish Quarter).&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot, Volume 2, 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This place attracted other migrant Jews from the other towns and villages from which they had been expelled and soon grew into a suburb, situate about one kilometer beyond the walls which then existed on the extreme west-side of the city. The first synagogue to be built in this place was the Alsheikh synagogue, in which was housed the returnees most prized possessions: Torah scrolls and old, handwritten manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (Jewish Life in Sana) , Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 81, note 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish houses were made "low, seldom more than two storeys, and built of sun-baked brick dressed with mud."&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"&gt;G. Wyman Bury, ''Arabia Infelix or the Turks in Yamen'', London 1915, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the place is called ''Qāʻ al-ʻUlufi'' (Ar. قاع العلفي).&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 82; R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 112; N.A. Stillman, ''The Jews of Arab Lands.'' Philadelphia 1979, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The lands upon which they built the new Jewish Quarter were lands provided by the king, but the Jews were later required to pay a monthly tenancy fee for the land, and which money accrued to the Muslim ''[[Waqf ]]'' (mortmain land) for the upkeep of their own places of worship. Between the new Jewish Quarter and the city walls was a suburb full of gardens called ''Bi'r alʻAzab'' (the Single's Well), being once the Turkish Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman (Jewish Life in Sana) '', Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 80, note 44&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the Jewish Quarter was also enclosed by a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in `Megillat Teman`'', Jerusalem 1986, p. 77 (Hebrew) {{ISBN|965-223-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the Muslims passed a new edict which forbade Jews from dwelling within Muslim neighborhoods, so as not to "defile their habitations," although they were at liberty to work in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who traversed between the Jewish Quarter and the city would go by foot, while those who were either aged or ill would make use of beasts of burden to carry them into the city, the Jewish Quarter being then at a distance of about one-kilometer from the city's walls. When these who had ridden upon donkeys were spied by the gentiles, they were presently envied by the gentiles, who then went unto the king and pressed upon him to outlaw their riding upon donkeys, saying that this mode of transportation seemed to be too extravagant for the Jews and would lead to a general unrest and eventual hegemony over the indigenous people. The king then passed a series of discriminatory laws (Ar. ''ghiyār'') meant to humiliate the Jews and which not only forbade their riding upon donkeys and horses, but also from walking or passing to the right side of any Muslim. Jews were to pass only on the left side of all Muslims. They also petitioned the king that a Jew would be prohibited by an edict from raising his voice against any Muslim, but to behave in a lowly and contrite spirit, and that offenders would be made punishable by flogging.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706-707 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such were the conditions of the Jews at that time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Exile of Mawzaʻ brought about demographic changes that could be felt all across Yemen. In Sana'a, to distinguish the original inhabitants from incoming migrant Jews, all newcomers who chose to dwell in the newly built Jewish Quarter were given surnames, each one after the place from which he was exiled, so that a man who came from the district of Sharʻab was called so-and-so, al-Sharʻabi, or he that came from the village of Maswar was called so-and-so, al-Maswari.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of the Jewish chronicler who wrote ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), being one of the earliest Jewish accounts of the expulsion (initially compiled by Yaḥyā ben Judah Ṣa'di in 1725) &lt;ref&gt;[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites (History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life)'', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1983, p. 162 (Hebrew). David Solomon Sassoon attributes the writing to [the son of] Sa'īd, based on the author's own remark that he is "the son of ''Ḥazmaq'' the younger" (= Sa'īd, or Se'adyah), the usual rendition for this name given in the reversed order of the Hebrew alphabet. See: David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid'' (vol. 2), Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 969, s.v. דופי הזמן. A microfilm copy of this work is available at the National Library of Israel in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103.&lt;/ref&gt; and which work has since undergone several recensions by later chroniclers, we read the following testimony:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," or what was originally entitled ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), Sefunot (Volume Two), 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|He (i.e. the king) then commanded to give license unto the Jews to return unto the country and to build for themselves tents, although set apart from the houses of the Muslims so that they will not defile them. Those who were banished then came up from the [[Tihama]] [coastal plain], returning from [[Mawza District|Mawzaʻ]]; one man from a city and two from a family, for most of them had been consumed by the land of [[Tihama]] which dispenses of life. Neither had there remained any of them, save ten people for every hundred [who were driven out into exile], while the majority of them did not return to settle in their former place, but were scattered in all the districts of Yemen. That is, aside from the family of the Levites, most of whom returned and settled in their [former] place. Now their dwelling place was from the town of ash-Sharafah, eastward of Wadi al-Sirr, stretching as far as the town of al-'Arus which lies in the region of [[Kawkaban]], a walking distance of about one and a half days; as well as the breadth of the city of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], stretching as far as the extremity of the land of Arḥab, being also a walking distance of one and a half days. These trace their lineage to Sasson the Levite, their ancestor, seeing that there was a law for the early Jews in Yemen for each family to dwell separately; the family of priests ([[Kohen|Cohenim]]) by themselves with their burial grounds, and also the family of Levites and the Israelites, each of them dwelling by themselves in their cities and with their own burial grounds. Now, unto this day, those Levites dwell separately in those said districts, although a few Israelites have newly arrived to dwell in their midst. In every place, the gentiles have given to them a parcel of ground, on a rental basis, in order that they may construct shelters in which to live, set apart from them, seeing that their enemies had already taken [from them] their own towns and houses and vineyards and fields. Thus, they were pleased to dwell with them and to be occupied in the various fields of labour, according to their diverse skills, in order that they might find sustenance thereby for their beings: among which were those who plastered with earth, and of those who crushed limestone, and of those who were potters, and some who were wood craftsmen, and others silversmiths, while still others blacksmiths and some who were merchants; There were yet others who were couriers, some who were weavers, others tailors, and some who were knowledgeable in prophylactic matters; others who were physicians, and others who chiseled away the surface of millstones, and some of whom who were porters. Now their magnanimity did not permit them to just lay back in idleness.}}

Danish explorer, [[Carsten Niebuhr]], who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1763, some eighty-three years following the community's return to Sana'a, estimated their numbers at only two-thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carsten Niebuhr]], ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegenden Ländern'' (''Description of Travel to Arabia and Other Neighboring Countries''), Zürich 1992, pp. 416-418 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; These had built, up until 1761, fourteen synagogues within the new Jewish Quarter. In 1902, before the famine of 1905 decimated more than half of the city's Jewish population, German explorer [[Hermann Burchardt]] estimated the Jewish population of Sana'a at somewhere between six and eight thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Burchardt, ''Die Juden in Yemen'', published in: ''Ost und West'', Berlin 1902, p. 338 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; G. Wyman Bury, who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1905 noted a decrease in the city's population from 1891, estimated at 50,000 people (Jews and Muslims alike), to only about 20,000 people in 1905.&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"/&gt; By 1934, when [[Carl Rathjens]] visited Sana'a, the Jewish population in the city had swollen to about seven thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rathjens &amp; Hermann v. Wissman, ''Landeskundliche Ergebnisse'', vol. 40, Hamburg 1934, pp. 133-134; 141 (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the Old Synagogue==
One of the outcomes of the king's notorious decree was that Jewish property passed into Muslim hands. A Jewish public bath house in Sana'a was relinquished and passed into the proprietorship of the Muslim [[Waqf]]. So, too, the once famous synagogue within Sana'a's walled city and which was known as ''Kenisat al-'Ulamā'' (The Synagogue of the Sages) was turned into a [[mosque]] and called ''Masjid al-Jalā'' – the Mosque of the Expulsion, or "of those banished." On the frieze (Ar. ''ṭiraz'') of the ''Masjid al-Jalā'' were inscribed words with invectives, in gypsum plaster (Ar. ''al-juṣ''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], is the sun of [religious] guidance / even [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the [grand]son of him who rose to power, [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]]. Unto him is ascribed dignities, such as were not accorded / before [to any other], even in part. Had he not done aught but banish / the Jews of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], who are the 'scum' of the world, and turned their venerable place (Ar. ''bi'ah'' = synagogue) into a mosque, / for bowing down unto God or standing [before Him in prayer], by that decree, he would have still been most triumphant. Now the time of this event happened to concur with the date that is [alluded to] in ''ghānim'' [victorious]";  [[Abjad numerals#Letter values|''Ghān&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;m'']] = ({{lang-ar|'''غانم'''}}), the numerical value of which letters adds up to [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 = 1680 CE).&lt;ref&gt;P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan &amp; Q. Al-Samarrai, ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', Leiden University 1990, pp. 156-158. {{ISBN|9071220079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Amram Qorah]] brings down a brief history of the said mosque, taken from a book originally drawn up in Arabic and which was entitled: ''A List of the Mosques of Ṣan'ā'''.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 10-11 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Therein is found a vivid description of the events which transpired in that fateful year and which reads as follows: "Among the mosques built in the vicinity of al-Sā'ilah, northwards from the path which leads from al-Sā'ilah to al-Quzālī, and the mosque [known as] Ben al-Ḥussein built by the Imam of the Qasimid dynasty, the son of Muhammad (i.e. al-Mahdi Ahmad b. al-Ḥasan b. [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]] b. Muhammad), in the year [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 (= 1679 CE) in the synagogue of the Jewish Quarter, who banished them from Sana'a and removed them unto a place befitting them, [a place] now known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud'' on the west side of Sana'a, just as it has been intimated by the scholarly judge, Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Suḥuli, etc." Rabbi Amram Qorah then proceeds to bring down the words or [[panegyric]] inscribed on the frieze of the mosque in rhymed verse (see: ''supra''), and which apparently had been composed by the said judge, in which he describes the exploits of the king who banished the Jews and who converted their synagogue into a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (1st edition), Jerusalem 1954, pp. 10-11 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=23&amp;hilite= pp. 23-24] in PDF) [Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Amram Qorah, in the same work, brings down Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen's account of events, whose testimony he found written in the margin of the first page of a Prayer Book (''Siddur''), written in 1710:&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 9 -10 (Hebrew). Moshe Gavra brings down the same account, mentioning that Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen of Dhamar had first written this account in a ''Siddur'' that he had written for Rabbi Yehudah Ṣa'adi in 1680. See: {{cite book | last=Gavra | first=Moshe | year=2010 | title=Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen, vol. 1, p. 72 | place=Benei Barak | publisher=Mechon le'ḥeqer ḥakhmei tayman | language=Hebrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now I shall inform you, my brethren, about what has happened to us at this time, since the beginning of ''anno'' 1,990 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (1678 CE) and in 1,991 [of the same] (1679 CE), how that the king made a decree and demolished all the synagogues of all the towns of Yemen, and there were some of the books and sacred writings that were desecrated at the hand of the gentiles, on account of our great iniquities, so that we could no longer make our [public] prayers, save only a very few [men] secretly within their houses. Afterwards, the king made a decree against the Jews to expel them into the wilderness of Mawzaʻ, while they, [at this time] demolished also their houses. However, there were some who managed to sell their house; what was worth one-thousand gold pieces they sold for one-hundred, and what was worth one-hundred gold pieces they sold for ten. So that, by these things, we were for a reproach amongst the nations, who continuously sought after ways by which they might cause us to change [our religion], O may God forbid! So, all of the exiles of Israel stood up and laid aside their most beloved and precious possessions as a means by which God's name might be sanctified, blessed be He, including their fields and their vineyards, and delivered themselves up as martyrs for God's name sake, blessed be He. And if one had need of going out into the marketplace, he could not avoid being the object of hatred and spite, while there were those who even attacked him or called him by abusive language, so that there was fulfilled in this, our generation, the scripture that says, ''Who will raise up Jacob, for he is too small'' &lt;small&gt;(Amos 7: 2, 5)&lt;/small&gt; to bear all the afflictions. So, too, was there fulfilled in us by reason of our iniquities the scripture that says, ''And I shall send a faintness into their hearts'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:36)&lt;/small&gt;. Yet, the divine Name, blessed be He, gives us strength to bear all those troubles and travails each day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Testimonies preserved in poetry==
Another man who witnessed these events, Shalem 'Ashri, also wrote a suppliant poem about the events of that year – the Exile of Mawzaʻ, now preserved in the Yemenite [[Diwan (poetry)|''Diwān'']],&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976&gt;''Sefer Hashirim Hagadol – The Large Song Book'', [[Shalom Shabazi]] (ed. Yosef Hasid), Jerusalem 1976, p. 51, s.v. אזיל דמעותי כמטר יזלו (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which same poem is meant to be chanted as a slow dirge by one or, at the most, two individuals, who are then answered by others who sit in attendance. It is sung without the accompaniment of musical instruments, although a tin drum is sometimes used, in accordance with what is customary and proper for the ''[[nashid]]'' (a rejoinder). His own name is spelt out in acrostic form in the first letters of each stanza:&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976 /&gt;
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "I Shall Shed My Tears"}}}}

"I shall shed my tears – like rain they shall pour down / over all the pleasant sons who have gone forth into exile.
They have forgotten what pertains to their happiness, and have also been diminished. / They journeyed in haste; along the parched ground they trod.
On the day when 'Uzal (i.e. [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Based on Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Judeo-Arabic translation of 'Uzal in Genesis 10:27, which is rendered as Sanaa.&lt;/ref&gt; went into exile, they took up his burden.
The sun and the moon were extinguished at their departure!
A multitude of the handmaid's sons&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Ishmael]], the son of Hagar (handmaid of Abraham), and the progenitor of the Arab nation.&lt;/ref&gt; have ruled over them. / Wrath, and also jealousy, they've poured out upon them.
So that they have inherited all of the glory, even their sublime honour!
Whilst the dwelling place of God's glory, they have been given power to destroy!  
Midrash, as also the Talmud and the Torah, they have abolished. / Constable and elder were, both, drawn away by their hands.
Orion and Pleiades, as well as the crescent moon, have become dim! / Even all the luminous lights, their light has turned into darkness!
The beauty of their homes and their money they had entirely looted. / Every oppressor and every governor have prepared their bow for shooting.
Preserve, O Master of the universe, those who are your peculiar friends, / Hadoram (i.e. [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Based on Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Judeo-Arabic translation of Hadoram in Genesis 10:27, which is rendered as Dhamar.&lt;/ref&gt; God's congregation, have been drawn after you!
The heads of their academies have borne patiently the exile, / to do even the will of God, having valued the commandments.
Redeem, O Master of the universe, your friends who have inherited / the Divine Law and sound wisdom, by which they have been blest!
For the honour due to the writing of thine own hand on the day when they were gathered,&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, given to the people of Israel while they were gathered at Mount Sinai.&lt;/ref&gt; / may you call to remembrance and deliver them during the time of their flight.
My name is Shalem; 'tis written in the locked rhyme. / Rejoice in God's Divine Law, and bless His name!"

'''Original: '''

אזיל דמעותי כמטר יזלו / על כל בני חמדה בגלות הלכו.
נשו לטובתם וגם נתדלדלו / נסעו בחפזון בציה דרכו.
יום גלתה אוזל וסבלו סבלו / שמש וירח בצאתם נדעכו.
שפעת בני אמה עליהם משלו / חמה וגם קנאה עליהם שפכו.
לכלל יקר הדרת כבודם נחלו / ומעון כבוד האל להחריב נמלכו.

שלם שמי כתוב בחרוזים ננעלו / שמחו בתורת אל ולשמו ברכו.

In the following poem of the subgenre known as ''qiṣṣa'' (poetic tale), composed mostly in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] with only two stanzas written in Hebrew, the author gives a long testimony about the events which transpired during that year of exile. The poem is entitled, ''Waṣalnā hātif al-alḥān'' – "Tidings have reached us," and is the work of the illustrious poet, [[Shalom Shabazi]], who was an eye-witness to these events and whose name is inscribed in the poem in acrostics. The rhyme, however, has been lost in the translation:&lt;ref&gt;The English translation (in the collapsible thread) is based on the Hebrew translation of the poem made by Yehudah Ratzaby, in his article, ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot, Volume 5, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 353-354 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "Tidings Have Reached Us"}}}}
"Tidings have reached us on the second day of [the lunar month] ''[[Rajab]]'' (i.e. corresponds with the 2nd day of the lunar month Elul), saying, 'My companions, arise and ascribe singularity unto the Merciful One, and read [the decree] that has been inscribed!  Hearken to these matters, and let not your mind be distracted, for the appointed time is at hand. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Al-Mahdi]] the king has decreed over us that we take flight.' The Jews of [[Sana'a]] then took leave, and have wandered unto those select places,&lt;ref&gt;Lit. "...have wandered unto Khabt," perhaps being the Al-Khabt in the Abyan District, in the far south-eastern reaches of Yemen, near the Indian Ocean. Yehudah Ratzaby suggests that the sense here is the two towns, the one being called ''Khabt of Darʻān'' and the other, ''Khabt of al-Baqr''. Initially, the king had agreed that Jews be permitted to resettle in these towns, but later changed his mind. See: Yehudah Ratzaby, article: ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 378-379, note *4 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; even unto the habitation of vipers and brute beasts. Even from al-Mahjam and from Dar'ān it was decreed over us to leave; by authorization of an edict which has overcome us. Now, we shall wait in Mawza'; there we shall dwell in the far reaches of the land belonging to the inhabitants of Arabia.

All of the inhabitants of 'Uzal (i.e. [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; were obedient, and they assembled in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. My companion, tighten the camel's gear and we'll begin moving after the ass. Let us proceed to 'Adinah, then to 'Amirah, and to al-'Ammār, while there we shall make camp. As for the young ones and those who were weak, their tears flowed like riverine brooks. 'Idaynah, receive those who are beloved! Go out to the gate of the city to welcome them! Now is the hour of testing those who are friends. Let them take pleasure in the weary fugitive, so that his fatigue might depart from him. Lo! They are the sons of the tribes and of those who are pious; those who are highborn and of gentility.

''Ṣafī al-Din'' (i.e. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]]) has already given the order that we not remain in our places.  Whether rich man or poor man, or he that is respectable, together they have gone forth; let us proceed according to our ability, under the influences of Saturn's horoscope; its evil portent will bring destruction. If its light flickers, it is about to change. The wisdom of the Blessed God has decreed upon the Sages of Israel, even the chosen sons of Jacob. Our elder, Suleiman [al-Naqqāsh] the Helmsman, will be the judge of those attempting to bypass [his decree]. In his hand there is the Imām's order for all to see, while there is nothing disparaging about the matter.

I am curtailed of my sleep from dismay, while tears run down my cheeks. When our elder, al-Naqqāsh, had arrived, all of the Jews [who had come out to see him] were shaken-up. 'Let us go out into the barren wasteland, a place of monstrous beasts and every kind of lion. Happy is he who returns safely from that place. We have already sold our fields, have forsaken our houses, and have submitted to the decree of our lord, [the king].' The young men wept, as also the pious men, when His anger was turned against us. Consider, O Lord, and reflect upon how many distinguished men, as well as those who were delicately raised, have been humiliated!

Weep, O Rachel, in our city for [your] wandering sons! Stir up our forefathers, let them arise, standing upon their feet, so that they may make mention of our fathers who, with grace, insist upon God's unison.  May God's favour accompany us, in whose shadow we fervently desire. Let him gather those who dwell in Yemen, seeing that He is a Shepherd and the Faithful God. We shall then hear the song of the sons of Heman (i.e. the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah). Let him then take away the poison of the adder, which is most bitter. Let him command Yinnon (i.e. the Messiah) and the Prefect [of the priest] (i.e. Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah), and let him say to him: 'Draw nigh!'

By the merit of our forefathers, by the favour [with which you have favoured] Levi who is of Jacob's seed, make level [the ground] along the route in your wilderness for the son who is, both, comely and good. And by the nut tree garden may you sedate my heart which is in pain. As for Gabriel and the rooster, I have heard them in the street, whilst my pigeon is at rest; she calls out to the poor: 'Release [them] from their bonds!' In Zion there is to be found relief, whilst our portion is in the [[Garden of Eden]], just as a son who is dearly loved. We shall then behold the house of our God, and the houses of [[Gush Halav|Gischala]] (Heb. Gush Ḥalab).

The Mashtaite&lt;ref&gt;Another appellation for Shalom Shabazi&lt;/ref&gt; has said: O God, remove mine affliction. Our strength is brought low in Yemen, in the days of my exile. In both small and great matters, I think about my case. Now, by the abundance [of afflictions] delights have been diminished. O gracious God! He who instructs my tongue to speak, Heaven forbid that you have forgotten me!  Unto Whom belong signs and wonders. Behold, it was upon us that He bestowed His bounty, and He has chosen Moses, the son of Amram, our beloved prophet!

The pampered pigeons are cooing in the tops of the citadels. The householders of al-Sā'ilah who have come to visit [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]] are complaining [before him] about how destruction and evil have come over them. They recall the conversations revolving around the Divine Law spoken [between their walls], and the vines and the flowers [in their gardens]; they recall also the social gatherings where wine was served, and the chalices, and the splendour of their wedding feasts, where [a man] would delight himself in them, become inebriated, but would avoid that which is obscene or mockery; [he'd drink] pure wine, whatever kind at hand, whose colour was as gold!

The Book of the Law (i.e. [[Torah]]) calls out to all wise men, and says: 'Have you neglected the study of the Law? It is the reason for their ignorance. Let them repent before the masters and return unto their Lord. The day of redemption is nigh, and He shall gather together their dispersed. There is a time for drinking wine, together with [eating] dainties, and there is a time for delving in wisdom. He, whose wine makes him heavy laden, let him sleep [and rest] from his weariness and from his burden. Let him wake-up to drink a second cup, such as may be imposed upon him.

In conclusion, [let us pray] that He who is congenial (i.e. God) might conceal us in the covert of His mercy. The Benevolent One shall not forget us, while we shall proclaim the eminence of His bountiful grace. He that will console us, may he be merited with a good life. He that gives to us clothing, may his own wishes be fulfilled. My salutations go out unto those of my companions on this happy, but powerful night; [which shall continue unabated] until Venus comes out [in the sky]. That which my God has decreed shall come to pass, while for every thing there is a reason. The birds will once again trill at the top of the ben [nut] tree (''Moringa peregrina'') in the fruitful orchard."

Another record of these events, composed here in poetic verse (although the rhyme has been lost in the translation), is the poem composed by Sālim ben Sa'īd, in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. The poem is written as a ''nashid'' and is entitled, '''Ibda' birrub al-'arsh'' (I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne).&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 379-380 (Translation of the original Judeo-Arabic), s.v. poem entitled: אבדע ברב אלערש; The original Judeo-Arabic was published in ''Hazofeh – Quartalis Hebraica'' (ed. Dr. L. Blau), vol. 7, Budapest 1923; (''ibid''.) Second edition, Jerusalem 1972, pp. 2–3. The original Judeo-Arabic text can also be had at the Hebrew University National Library (Givat Ram Campus), Jerusalem, Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "I Shall Commence by Addressing Him who is Upon the Throne"}}}}
"I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne [of glory], even He that is an Omniscient God, the Creator of all creatures; He who causes the dumb to speak.

I was curtailed of my sleep this night, while my heart was aching on account the king's decree; he that has made a decree against us by an oath.

He has revealed his ill-intentions on a dark night, one made sullen by the shadow of death; and who has sent against us soldiers and oppressors.

We lifted up our voices unto God of heaven, [saying]: 'Remove from us the evil of this decree. Behold! You are He that governs all!'

They have destroyed all of the cities, and have cast their fear upon the Sages. There is none who takes an interest in our case, nor anyone who will take pity upon us.

He lifted up his right hand and swore, 'They have no choice but to be banished unto Mawza!'

He commanded to destroy the synagogues which were in [[Sana'a]], the habitation of the Divine Law and the seating place of the Sages.

He forced (?) them to go out into a parched land, the [[Tihama]] and al-Mahjam.

They wandered unto Mawza' and walked along the paths, in the fierce blaze of heat and with severe thirst.

On the day in which he took them out of their houses, their eyes rained tears of blood. They had gone out a short distance in the dark of night.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a verse in Ezekiel 12:4, ''And you shall go forth at eventide in their sight, as they that go forth into exile''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several distinguished persons, and several disciples of the Sages [went forth into exile]; they and their little ones, who were without understanding.

'You are obliged to go forth into exile; `tis from the Lord of Heaven, who once delivered us from the hand of wicked Pharaoh.'

My heart moans over my relatives who are missing. I have no pleasure in sleep, nor in bread or water!

A flame burns inside of me, ever since the evil tidings [of the king's decree] reached me; I have become perplexed.

Praised be the Creator of the heavenly circuits, the Ruler of all [things], unto whom none can be compared.

Your covenant and your signs have been forever. You have intoxicated your people with the waters of Abraham, [made during] the covenant between the dissected halves.&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 15:1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

But now, O king of most puissant kings, your people are sadly distressed and are deprived of all things.

They (i.e. the gentiles) cast their fear upon us, while the horsemen inflict us. No one tries to help us, nor is there anyone who takes pity upon us.

They have humiliated our religion, and have called out to us to become Muslims; even to sin and to desecrate your Divine Law.

He (i.e. the Imām) has issued against us frequent declarations; shall we not fear the punishment of God on High?

Our elders have gone forth into exile by an urgent command, whether willingly or unwillingly.

I have concluded my words, my brethren! Take-up my salutations and remain silent! Our hope is in God the Omniscient.

Remember me, O God, on account of the Divine Law's hidden mystery! So, too, remember Jacob, 'the man of pure intentions' [dwelling in tents]!&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 25:27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remember Moses who built for you the Tent of Convocation in the Sinai wilderness, on the day in which your Divine Presence dwelt thereon.

Do not forget Isaac, your bound [servant], on the day in which he spoke to Abraham face to face.

Praise be to you, O Master of the universe! `Tis from me, Sālim ben Sa'īd, who has written rhymed verse."

==Jacob Saphir's Testimony==
In 1859, Lithuanian Jew, [[Jacob Saphir]], visited the Jewish community in Yemen, less than two-hundred years after the Exile of Mawza', but still heard vivid accounts from the people about the things that befell their ancestors during that fateful event. Later, he made a written account of the same in his momentous ethnographic work, ''Iben Safir''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Saphir, ''Iben Safir'' (vol. 1 - ch. 43), Lyck 1866, pp. 100a-100b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The full, unabridged account is given here (translated from the original Hebrew):
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Jacob Saphir's Testimony}}}}
"[The Jews] dwelt securely, beneath the shadow of the kings of that country, until three-hundred ([[sic]]) years ago&lt;ref&gt;Should be amended to read "approximately two-hundred years ago," i.e. 1679&lt;/ref&gt; while they were dwelling in that chief metropolis, when the daughter of the king became pregnant outside of wedlock, and they laid the blame upon a Jewish man, one of the king's courtiers and of those who behold his countenance. However, the king's wrath wasn't assuaged until he had banished all of the Jews from that city and the surrounding regions, expelling them to the region of [[Tihama]], a desolate wilderness (a walking distance of ten days' journey in a south-westerly direction from [[Sana'a]]), between [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] and [[Aden]]; a salty land, and one of very fearsome heat, while they were all tender and accustomed to delicacies. Many of them died along the way, while those who came there could not bear the climate of that place and its infirmities. Two thirds of them succumbed and perished, and they had entertained the notion that all of them would perish either by the plague, by famine or by thirst, may God forbid. &lt;small&gt;'''(Here, J. Saphir brings down a poem written about the event by Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]], and which has already been quoted above)'''&lt;/small&gt; Now during the time of this exile and perdition, they had lost all of their precious belongings, and their handwritten books, as well as their peculiar compositions which they possessed of old. I have also seen their synagogues and places of study used by them of old in the city of the gentiles; eternal desolations 'and where demons will be found making sport' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 13:21)&lt;/small&gt;, on account of our great iniquities. Notwithstanding, it is by the mercies of the Lord that we have not perished. He (i.e. God) did not prolong the days of their exile, but sent great distempers upon the king and upon his household. (They say that this was on account of the virtue of that pious Rabbi, the [[kabbalist]], even our teacher and Rabbi, Mori [[Shalom Shabazi|Sālim al-Shabazi]], may the memory of the righteous be blessed, who brought about multiple forms of distempers upon that cruel king, who then regretted the evil [that he caused them] and sent [messengers] to call out unto them [with] a conciliatory message, [requesting] that they return to their place – with the one exception that they not dwell with them in the royal city built as a fortress. He then gave to them a possession, being a grand inheritance outside of the city, which is ''al-Qaʻa'', ''B'ir al-ʻAzāb'' – the plain wherein is the cistern known as ''ʻAzāb'', and they built there houses for their dwelling quarters and built for themselves an enclosing wall which extended as far as to the wall of the city built like unto a fortress. In only a short time God assisted them, and they built there a large city and one that was spacious. They also acquired wealth and they rose to prominence, while many of the villagers likewise seized [upon land] with them, that they might dwell in the city, until it became [a place] full of people. At that time, Mori Yiḥya Halevi was the ''Nasi'' among them and the Exilarch.)"

== References to [[Sana'a]] before the expulsion==
There are several references to Jewish life in Sana'a before the expulsion of 1679. [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]] (d. 1805) mentions in his Responsa&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b&gt;''Questions &amp; Responsa Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', [[Yihya Saleh]], vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; that before the Exile of Mawza the Jews of Sana'a had an old custom to say the [[Sheva Brachot|seven benedictions]] for the bridegroom and bride on a Friday morning, following the couple's wedding the day before. On Friday (Sabbath eve) they would pitch a large tent within a garden called ''al-Jowzah'', replete with pillows and cushions, and there, on the next day (Sabbath afternoon), the invited guests would repeat the seven benedictions for the bridegroom and bride, followed by prayer inside the tent, before being dismissed to eat of their third Sabbath meal, at which time some accompanied the bridegroom to his own house to eat with him there. The significance of this practice, according to Maharitz, was that they made the seven blessings even when not actually eating in that place, a practice which differs from today's custom.&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b /&gt;

German-Jewish ethnographer, [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], mentions a historical note about the old synagogue in Sana'a, before the expulsion of Jews from the city in 1679, and which is written in the glosses of an old copy of the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Seder Moed]]''), written with Babylonian [[Yemenite Hebrew#History|supralinear punctuation]].&lt;ref name=holon1975&gt;''The Mishnah: Order Mo'ed - A Yemenite Manuscript '', ed. Yehudah Levi Nahum, Introduction, Ḥolon 1975, p. 18 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The marginal note concerns the accurate pronunciation of the word אישות in Mishnah ''Mo'ed Ḳaṭan'' 1:4, and reads as follows: "Now the Jews of Sana'a read it as אִישׁוּת (''ishūth''), with a [vowel] ''[[Kubutz and Shuruk|shuraq]]'' (''shuruk''). I studied with them a long time ago, during the time when the synagogue of Sana'a was still standing ''[[in situ]]''."&lt;ref name=holon1975 /&gt;

==Enactments in wake of exile (1680–1690)==
Upon returning to Sana'a, the Chief Rabbis, led by R. Shelomo Manzeli and Yiḥya Halevi (called ''Alsheikh''), came together in the newly built Alsheikh synagogue and decided to put in place a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the community, and which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such harsh decrees against the Jewish community in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 70 – 71; ibid. vol. 4, pp. 156 – 159 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  These enactments were transcribed in a document entitled ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' (Letter of Tidings), and which was believed to have been disseminated amongst the community at large. Only excerpts of the letter have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Subeiri, ''Siddur Kenesseth Ha-Gedolah'', vol. 3, Tel-Aviv/Jaffa 1976 – 1992, p. 297 (Hebrew); Rabbi Yihya Saleh, Questions &amp; Responsa ''Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The enactments called out for a more strict observance of certain laws which, heretofore, had been observed with leniency. Such strictures were to be incumbent upon the entire community and which, in the Rabbis' estimation, would have given to the community some merit in the face of oppression or persecution.  Not all of these enactments, however, were upheld by the community, since some enactments were seen as breaking-away from tradition.&lt;ref&gt;One of the enactments called out for making one-hundred blasts of the horn on the Jewish New Year ([[Rosh Hashanah]]), based on a teaching found in Rabbi [[Nathan ben Jehiel]]'s [[Sefer Ha-Arukh]], s.v. ערב, instead of the traditional forty blasts which had been observed earlier. Another enactment sought to make it a standard procedure during the [[Mussaf]]-prayer of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to make two prayers: the first, by the congregation praying silently, followed by a repetition of the prayer said aloud by the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'' (Prayer precentor).  Maharitz would later adamantly oppose the enactment, since it sought to cancel the ancient tradition in Yemen in this regard in which it had always been a practice to make only one [[Mussaf]]-prayer. Another enactment concerned the seven benedictions mentioned by Rabbi Yosef Karo in his ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (''Even Haʻezer'' 62:10), where he brings down a certain opinion which states that is not permissible for the groom and bride to be entertained in another person's house other than in his own house during the seven days of wedding festivities, unless he and his bride were to leave their own house or town for an extended period of time, in which case it is then permissible. The enactment is mentioned with regard to ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' in [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]]'s Questions &amp; Responsa, ''Pe'ulath Sadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, although the enactment seemed to have been rejected by Maharitz, in favour of Israel's older practice in Yemen. Rabbi Shalom Yitzhaq Halevi informs us that the Yemenite custom in his day was as that taught by Maharitz, and rectifies the discrepancy between the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' and the Yemenite Jewish custom by writing in the glosses of his 1894 edition of the ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'' that the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (ibid.) refers merely to when the groom and bride are invited to make the "seven benedictions" in another house where, during the seven days of feasting, a supper had been made on behalf of a circumcision, or some other ceremonial meal other than what was specifically made on the groom's behalf, in which it is not permitted to say for them the "seven benedictions." See also Rabbi Ḥayim Kessar's Questions &amp; Responsa ''Haḥayim wehashalom'' (Even Haʻezer, ''responsum'' # 10), who cites from Rabbi Yihya Hacohen's Responsa, ''Ḥayei Shalom'' (''responsum'' # 2), where he says that after the wedding, it was never a custom in Yemen that a man's bride accompanied him when he was invited to eat in the home of others. He reasons that, since she is not with him, they should not say the seven benedictions for the bridegroom alone.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meta-regulation''' is a form of [[regulation]] that encourages self-regulation of firms. In contrast to traditional forms of regulation, where decisions concerning rules are decided by the regulator, meta-regulation has firms create their own rules while observing and monitoring those rules. The advantages of self-regulation are that devolved structures of regulation allow for greater learning in complex and uncertain environments. Firms with the potential for catastrophic failure such as finance, oil drilling, mining, manufacturing, etc. often desire effective regulation to prevent such failures because of cost and damaged public relations. 

Meta-regulation is said to have the advantage of fostering norms of reflexivity among institutions, as they are forced to conscientiously consider optimal levels of regulation and elucidate the reasoning to regulators. In an ideal world of meta-regulation the motivations for both regulators and regulates become the same by diffusing the norms of safety and stability. Meta-regulation in practice has been critiqued as relying too heavily on notions of consensus and rationality (see Simon, 2017)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">The '''North Carolina Identity Theft Protection Act of 2005''' is a series of  broad laws that was passed by the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[U.S. state]] of  [[North Carolina]] to prevent or discourage [[identity theft]] as well as guarding and protecting individual [[privacy]].

==Summary==
[[North Carolina Attorney General]] [[Roy A. Cooper|Roy Cooper]] proposed the Identity Theft Protection Act of 2005 which was introduced by Senator [[Dan Clodfelter]].  The act was designed to strengthen safeguards for personal information, requiring businesses and government to better protect sensitive financial information, and gave consumers more tools to fight theft of their information.  This includes more restriction on the collection, use, and safekeeping of a consumer's [[social security number]] and consumer financial  information. The Act requires businesses, charities and government to notify individuals if a security breach has compromised any personal information and placed them at risk of identity theft.  [[North Carolina]] consumers were given the right to obtain a [[Security Freeze]] on their credit reports. Placing a security freeze on a credit report would prohibit credit reporting agencies from releasing any information about you to new creditors, making it difficult for an identity thief to open an account or obtain credit in your name. Further the Act gave the right to sue for [[Monetary damages|civil damages]] in the event of [[identity fraud]] / theft. The Act covers everything from rights to penalties.   SESSION LAW 2005-414 and SENATE BILL 1048.
The Act applies to any entity (financial institutions, charities, government, businesses, etc.). Companies located in and out of [[North Carolina]] that conduct business in state or keep personal information of state residents are required to comply. Compliance falls under the Attorney General's jurisdiction.  Detailed information is available from the North Carolina Attorney General's office. The requirements cannot be waived by individuals.
[[Skimming (credit card fraud)|"Skimming"]], a process of [[Fraud|defrauding]] consumers by scanning credit card or debit card encoded data, became prohibited under this Act's 2003 predecessor.

==Ratified==
* Approved 10:50 a.m. on the 21st day of September, 2005.
* The [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] ratified the act on 23-August-2005. Portions of the act were effective 01-December-2005, with other sections being effective in October 2006 and July 2007.
*The act was signed by [[Beverly E. Perdue]] ([[Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina|President of the Senate]]), [[James B. Black]] ([[Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]]) and [[Michael F. Easley]] ([[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]).

==Other states that have passed similar laws==
Laws of this nature are being passed by [[legislatures]] all over the [[United States]]. [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] have passed laws relating to [[identity theft]].

'''Philip Hamburger''' is an American legal scholar. Hamburger holds a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale Law School]] (1982) and a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Princeton University]] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Philip_Hamburger "Philip Hamburger" at Columbia Law School directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburger is the Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at the [[Columbia University School of Law]].  He is a legal historian and a scholar of constitutional law.  Before moving to Columbia, Hamburger was John P. Wilson Professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he was also Director of the Bigelow Program and the Legal History Program. He was previously Oswald Symyster Colclough Research Professor at [[George Washington University Law School]] and, before that, he taught at the [[University of Connecticut Law School]].  He has been a visiting professor at the [[University of Virginia]] Law School and was the Jack N. Pritzker Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Northwestern Law School.  Early in his career, he  was an associate at the law firm of [[Schnader, Harrison, Segal &amp; Lewis LLP]] in Philadelphia.

==Scholarship==

Hamburger is a leading scholar of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] who "made a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Jefferson's thinking and actions with respect to matters of church and state".&lt;ref&gt;Francis D. Cogliano, ''Thomas Jefferson: Reputation and Legacy'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p. 150, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is known for arguing that "the First Amendment, originally thought to limit the government, has been increasingly interpreted by the Court to mean limiting religion and confining it to the private sphere."&lt;ref&gt;See "Fundamentalist secularism threatens U.S., warns ambassador to the Holy See," [http://catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14188 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruchtman, reviewing ''Law and Judicial Duty'' (2008), says it, "is by any definition ground-breaking. It is a creative, magisterial contribution to our understanding of judicial review and an independent judiciary."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fruchtman Jr., "'Gibbons v. Ogden,' Law, and Society in the Early Republic, and: Law and Judicial Duty, and: Legislating the Courts: Judicial Dependence in Early National New Hampshire (review)," ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (2011) 31#2 pp. 313-318 doi:10.1353/jer.2011.0030&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Hugo Black]], who served on the Supreme Court 1937 to 1971, came under attack from Hamburger who argues that Black's views on the need for separation of Church and State were deeply tainted by prominent roles in the Ku Klux Klan, a vehemently anti-Catholic organization.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, ''Separation of Church and State'' pp 422-28&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburger relies on Black's biographers who say he was a KKK member and actively campaigned for Senate in 1926 at nearly all of Alabama's 148 KKK Klaverns, where he attacked the Catholic Church. Biographer Newman quotes his campaign manager as saying Black "could make the best anti-Catholic speech you ever heard."&lt;ref&gt;Roger K. Newman, ''Hugo Black: a biography'' (1997) p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Picard v. Barry Pontiac-Buick, Inc.''''', 654 A.2d 690 (R.I. 1995) is a [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]] case often cited in [[tort]] law text books to explain the legal concept of [[battery (tort)|battery]].

Picard was unhappy about her [[mechanic]]'s brake inspection and contacted a local television news "[[Troubleshooting|troubleshooter]]" reporter. When she returned for a reinspection, she took a [[picture]] of the mechanic inspecting the brakes on her car. The mechanic turned around, approached her, pointed his finger at her, and questioned her taking a picture of him. He intentionally touched her camera with his finger. Picard claimed that when she spun around her back was injured.&lt;ref name = "mech"&gt; {{cite web

| accessdate=2008-05-05
}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The trial court awarded Picard $60,366 in compensatory damages and an additional $6,350 in punitive damages.  The Supreme Court held that the mechanic committed battery, because the mechanic caused an offensive or unconsensual touching upon the body of Picard, regardless of the mechanic's intent to injure. Items attached to or identified with the plaintiff's body, such as the camera, also count. The court also found that the mechanic committed [[assault]]. The court vacated the award and remanded for a new trial on damages.

'''Pipher v. Parsell'''&lt;ref&gt;Pipher v. Parsell, 930 A.2d 890 (Del. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; is a case that was decided before the [[Delaware Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Delaware]]. It shows that a minor can be held to an adult standard of care when engaging in inherently dangerous activities such as [[driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torts|last=Casenotes|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
Three 16-year-olds were driving in a [[Pickup truck|truck]], all seated in the front seat: One boy (Parsell) driving and two girls, one in the middle seat and one next to the passenger side door. A passenger, the girl next to the door (Beisel), grabbed the steering wheel as if intending to make a [[car crash]], at which all the occupants of laughed. A few minutes later the same girl grabbed the steering wheel again, this time actually causing an [[Traffic collision|accident]]. The girl in the middle (Pipher), suffered damages and sued the driver.

"As they were traveling at 55 mph, Beisel unexpectedly "grabbed the steering wheel causing the truck to veer off onto the shoulder of the road." Parsell testified that Beisel's conduct caused him both shock and surprise. Although Beisel's conduct prompted him to be on his guard, Parsell further testified that he did not expect Beisel to grab the wheel again. Nevertheless, his recognition of how serious Beisel's conduct was, shows he was aware that he now had someone in his car who had engaged in dangerous behavior."

Parsell testified that he did nothing in response to Beisel's initial action. Approximately thirty seconds later, Beisel again yanked the steering wheel, causing Parsell's truck to leave the roadway, slide down an [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]] and strike a tree. Pipher was injured as a result of the collision."

== Holding ==
In an opinion written by Justice Holland, the court held that the [[plaintiff]]'s evidence should have been submitted to the jury because it was possible that the accident was foreseeable.

"In general, where the actions of a passenger that cause an accident are not foreseeable, there is no [[negligence]] attributable to the driver. But, when actions of a passenger that interfere with the driver's safe operation of the motor vehicle are foreseeable, the failure to prevent such conduct may be a breach of the driver's duty to either other passengers or to the public. Under the circumstances of this case, a reasonable jury could find that Parsell breached his duty to protect Pipher from Beisel by preventing Beisel from grabbing the steering wheel a second time."

The case was reversed and remanded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">'''The Portland Seven''' was a group of [[United States|American]] [[Islam|Muslims]] from the [[Portland, Oregon]] area [[arrest]]ed in October 2002 as part of an [[FBI]] operation attempting to close down a [[terrorism|terrorist]] cell. The seven were attempting to join [[al Qaeda]] forces in their fight against the United States military and [[coalition forces]] in [[Afghanistan]], or aiding in that attempt.

Originally referred to as "The Portland Six", [[Patrice Lumumba Ford]], [[Jeffrey Battle|Jeffrey Leon Battle]], [[October Lewis|October Martinique Lewis]] (Battle's ex-wife), [[Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal]], [[Ahmed Bilal|Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal]],  and [[Habis Abdulla al Saoub]] made up the original six members arrested in October 2002. In April 2003, [[Mike Hawash|Maher "Mike" Hawash]] was arrested, and the name became "The Portland Seven".

The members of the Portland Seven "were all named in the 15-count superseding indictment that included charges of conspiracy to levy war against the United States, conspiracy to [[provide material support and resources to al Qaeda]], conspiracy to contribute services to [[al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]], conspiracy to possess and discharge firearms in furtherance of crimes of violence, possessing firearms in furtherance of crimes of violence and money laundering." 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2003/September/03_crm_532.htm OCTOBER MARTINIQUE LEWIS PLEADS GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES IN ‘PORTLAND CELL’ CASE], DOJ Press Release, September 26, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On September 29, 2001, Battle, Ford and al Saoub were discovered while engaged in shooting practice in a gravel pit in [[Skamania County]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], near [[Washougal, Washington|Washougal]]. Also present was Ali Khalid Steitiye, who did not become an indicted member of the Portland Seven on terrorism charges but was separately charged with other crimes.

The group was discovered by Deputy Sheriff Mark Mercer, who was acting on a tip from a neighbor who had heard gunfire in the pit. Deputy Mercer let the men go after taking their names and reported the incident to the FBI. Battle was taped in a secretly-recorded conversation indicating that they had considered killing Deputy Mercer when confronted: "We was up there blowin it up.... We was lightin' it up... [W]e looked at it as worship because what our intentions were, to learn to shoot for. And a cop came up and he was like hey... you don't understand how close he was gonna get popped... yeah, we was gonna pop him." Battle later indicated they had opted not to kill the officer because he seemed "cool." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=12329 Terrorist Blamed His Failure on Bush], Human Events Online, by Terence P. Jeffrey
Posted Feb 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Battle, Ford, and al Saoub went on to become the core of the "Portland Seven."

According to the indictment, on October 17, 2001, Battle and al Saoub flew out of [[Portland International Airport]] en route to [[Afghanistan]]. On October 20, 2001, Ford and the two Bilals also took the same route out of the United States. Between October 2001 and January 2002, Lewis wired a series of money orders to Battle in [[China]] and [[Bangladesh]], and in November 2001 and January 2002, Ford wired money to al Saoub in China. Ford returned to the US on or about November 19, 2001. M. Bilal returned to the U.S on or about December 24, 2001. In January 2002,Battle was administratively discharged from the military. Battle also returned to the US on or about February 5, 2002.

The six male members of the group traveled to [[China]] in early 2002, with the intent of entering Afghanistan to aid the Taliban. Lacking visas and other documentation, they were turned back, and all but al Saoub then returned again to the United States.

On Thursday, October 3, 2002, a federal grand jury in [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]], at Portland, Oregon, indicted Battle, Ford, the two Bilals, al Saoub and Lewis. On October 4, 2002, and the FBI in Portland, Oregon, announced the arrest of four of those original six on charges of aiding and, in some cases, trying to join al-Qaeda fighters. Battle, Ford, and Lewis were all arrested that morning in Portland. Muhammad Bilal was arrested at the same time by the FBI in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. The remaining two, Ahmed Bilal and al Saoub, were both considered fugitives. Steitiye was also named by the FBI as an unindicted co-conspirator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030124152644/http://portland.fbi.gov/pressrel/2002/itarrest.htm FBI’S Joint Terrorism Task Force Arrests Four on Terrorism Charges, Two Others Who Were Indicted Are Now Fugitives], FBI Press Release, Portland Field Office, Google Cache, October 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Khalid Steitiye was convicted in 2002 on firearms, fraud,and immigration charges and testified against the others in 2004, as part of a plea agreement in a weapons-possession charge.

== Fate of members ==
Habis al Saoub joined an al Qaeda cell and was killed by [[Pakistan]]i forces in October 2003. Ford and Battle are each serving 19-year sentences. Lewis was sentenced to three years in a work camp. Muhammad Bilal received an eight-year sentence, and Ahmed Bilal got ten years. Hawash was sentenced to seven years and left prison in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/former_intel_engineer_to_sympa.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 [[NPR]] report claimed that some of the people associated with the group were imprisoned in a highly-restrictive [[Communication Management Unit]].&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=May 2009}}

The term '''Public eProcurement''' ("[[E-procurement|electronic procurement]]" in the public sector) refers, in [[Singapore]], [[Ukraine]],  [[Europe]] and [[Canada]], to the use of electronic means in conducting a [[public procurement]] procedure for the purchase of [[good (economics)|good]]s, works or [[service (economics)|service]]s.

eProcurement compared to normal procurement allows greater transparency, better competition and easier communication for all parties.

==Phases==
The term of the Electronic Public Procurement can be defined as the usage of [[e-Government]] platform over the electronic resources ([[Internet]] and Web-based applications) to conduct transactions for [[purchasing]] the products and services from suppliers to authority's buyers.

The following sub-phases of the electronic public procurement process could be identified:
* '''[https://www.prm360.com/ eSourcing]''': preparatory activities conducted by the contracting authority/entity to collect and reuse information for the preparation of a call; potential [[bidder]]s may be contacted, if admitted by the legal rules, by electronic means to provide quotations or manifest interest.
* '''eNoticing''': advertisement of calls for tenders through the [[publication]] of appropriate [[contract]] notices in electronic format in the relevant [[Official Journal of the European Union|Official Journal]] (national/EU); electronic access to tender documents and specifications as well as additional related documents are provided in a [[non-discriminatory]] way.
* '''eAccess''': electronic access to tender documents and specifications as well support to [[economic]] operators for the preparation of an offer, e.g. clarifications, questions and answers. 
* '''eSubmission''': submission of offers in electronic format to the contracting authority/entity, which is able to receive, accept and process it in compliance with the [[legal]] requirements.
* '''[https://www.prm360.com/ eTendering]''': is the union of the eAccess and eSubmission phases.
* '''eAwarding''': opening and evaluation of the electronic tenders received, and award of the contract to the best offer in terms of the lowest price or economically most advantageous bid.
* '''[https://www.prm360.com/ eContract]''': conclusion, enactment and monitoring of a contract / agreement through electronic means between the contracting authority/entity and the winning tenderer.
*'''eOrders''': preparation and issuing of an electronic order by the contracting authority/entity and its acceptance by the contractor.
*'''eOrder Status''':  preparation and delivery of status information against the eOrder.
* '''[https://www.prm360.com/ eInvoicing]''': preparation and delivery of an [[invoice]] in electronic format. 
* '''ePayment''': [[electronic payment]] of the ordered goods, services or works.

===eInvoicing===
eInvoicing allows an invoice to be sent and received  by the customer electronically.
eInvoicing is currently defined in multiple ways.   A simple search finds 3 simple variations:  “an invoice issued, received and processed electronically”, “an invoice sent by electronic means to the recipient”, and “an invoice received  by the [[customer]] electronically”.  Driving a single strategy requires a single definition; a common [[language]]. The best definition should be customer-centric.  
The same common language divides the tiers of eInvoicing based on cash management impacts.
*  Tier 3 reduces delivery time (e.g. [[email]] delivery of [[pdf]] versions of invoices)
*  Tier 2 reduces delivery time and digitizes the data for easier management by customers (e.g. [[electronic files]] ([[xml]], edi, flat, etc.) which match the sellers sales invoice)
*  Tier 1 reduces delivery time, digitizes data and reduces reconciliation time (e.g. electronic files (xml, edi, flat, etc.) which match the customers purchase order, or web invoicing solutions).

==Enabling systems==
To successfully conduct electronic procurement across [[borders]], eProcurement systems rely on some “key-enablers”
* '''e[[Signature]]''': [[data]] in electronic form which are attached to or [[logic]]ally associated with other electronic data and which serve as a method of [[authentication]] with regard to this data.
* '''eIdentity''': dynamic collection of all attributes, in electronic format, related to a specific entity ([[citizen]], [[Organization|enterprise]], or object) which serve to ascertain a specific identity.
* '''eAttestations''' (Virtual [[Company]] Dossier): set of [[certificate of authenticity|certificates]] and attestations, in electronic format, to be provided by a supplier to prove compliance with the [[wikt:selection|selection]] and exclusion criteria of a [[procurement]] procedure.   
* '''eCatalogues''': electronic supplier catalogue prospect uses used to prepare and submit offers or parts of them.
* '''e[[Archiving]]''': use of electronic means for long-term preservation of [[document]]s in digitalised format, ensuring that they can be easily retrieved without conversions.

== In Practice ==

=== Portugal ===

Beginning in 2009 Portugal implemented mandatory use of electronic systems for public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/rosax.pdf|title=E-procurement in Portugal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has continued to utilize more pilot programs to continue the implementation of the program in Portugal and to establish the e-procurement process until the contract is awarded in a public procurement deal.

=== Ukraine ===

In Ukraine the government established the [[Prozorro]] system in 2014. It was a major innovation for the government as they switched to a more transparent e-procurement system.

'''''R v Beaulac''''' [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768 is a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on language rights.  Notably, the majority adopted a liberal and [[purposive interpretation]] of language rights in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], overturning conservative case law such as ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'' (1986).  As the majority wrote, "To the extent that ''Société des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick''... stands for a restrictive interpretation of language rights, it is to be rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jean Victor Beaulac was accused of murder and was brought before the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] and convicted.  Beaulac claimed rights under section 530 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which allows for the accused to be heard in court in his or her language, if it is one of the official languages of Canada, [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]].  The Supreme Court noted in its 1999 decision that this was the first time it had ever considered this Criminal Code right.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a lower level, Beaulac had been denied this right to be heard in French, since one judge found Beaulac's skills in English were adequate though not perfect.

==Decision==
The majority of the Court first considered the [[Constitution of Canada]], noting that the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], which set out the rules for [[Canadian federalism]], did not give any level of government exclusive jurisdiction to create language rights, and both levels probably could.  There were language rights in the Constitution as well, and these could provide context for language rights cases.  These include section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and it was noted that in ''[[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]]'' (1975) the Supreme Court found that these can be expanded upon.  The majority noted that in 1986 the Supreme Court found that language rights should be handled conservatively, in ''[[MacDonald v. City of Montreal]]'', ''Société des Acadiens'' and ''[[Bilodeau v. Attorney General of Manitoba]]''.  However, the majority claimed conservative interpretation of language rights has since given way to a more liberal approach, in ''[[Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' (1988), which concerned language and [[freedom of expression]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2 of the Canadian Charter]].  The Court took this as important, since this "re-affirm[s] the importance of language rights as supporting official language communities and their culture."&lt;ref&gt;Para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other noted victories for language rights included ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'' (1990) on [[minority language]] education rights in [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23 of the Canadian Charter]] and ''[[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' (1992) on the [[Manitoba Act]].  While in ''Société des Acadiens'' the Court had played down language rights because they were deemed to be the result of political deals, in this case the Court decided that it does not follow that that means the courts cannot interpret the rights in the same way it interprets other rights.  Hence, the Court saw language rights as [[individual rights]] promoting [[dignity]], and the Criminal Code right represented a growth in language rights encouraged by [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16 of the Canadian Charter]].

Turning to section 530 of the Criminal Code, the Court called it an "absolute right."  Since past interpretation indicated such rights are not just [[due process]], it should be respected beyond what the letter of the law actually demands.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court also found that the accused's language was a personal matter and related to one's identity, and therefore courts should respect the accused's "subjective" feelings towards a language.  In this case, the Court ordered a new trial.

==Concurrence==
Chief Justice [[Antonio Lamer]] and [[Ian Binnie]] wrote a brief concurrence on section 530 of the Criminal Code.  However, they protested the reconsideration of ''Société des Acadiens'' and section 16 of the Charter since the ''Beaulac'' case did not involve constitutional law.  "It is a well-established rule of prudence that courts ought not to pronounce on constitutional issues unless they are squarely raised for decision," they wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Desportes fox.jpg|thumb|300px|right|upright|At [[common law]], the right to hunt was restricted to the landowning elite]]
'''''Ratione soli''''' or '''''rationae soli''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "according to the soil" or "by reason of the ownership of the soil."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Nolon, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1654&amp;context=lawfaculty ''The Law of Sustainable Development: Keeping Pace''], 30 {{smallcaps|Pace L. Rev.}} 1246, 1298 n.93 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[property law]], it is a justification for assigning property rights to landowners over resources found on their own land.&lt;ref Name="CLJ"&gt;W.M. Rockel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fW4tAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA426&amp;dq=%22Ratione+soli%22&amp;client=firefox-a/ ''Game — Hunting Rights — Poaching''], 57 {{smallcaps|Cent. L. R.}} 425, 426 (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the doctrine of ''ratione soli'' provides landowners "constructive possession of natural resources on, over, and under the surface: [[ad coelum|cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum ad infernos]]."&lt;ref&gt;John R. Nolon, [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1654&amp;context=lawfaculty ''The Law of Sustainable Development: Keeping Pace''], 30 {{smallcaps|Pace L. Rev.}} 1246, 1298 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
In ancient [[Roman law]], landowners could only take legal possession of animals by [[Rule of Capture|capturing]] and maintaining physical control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|J. Inst.}} 2.1.12 (North-Holland ed., J A C Thomas trans. (1975); see also J. M. Kelley, ''Implications of A Montana Voter Initiative That Reduces Chronic Wasting Disease Risk, Bans Canned Shooting, &amp; Protects A Public Trust'', 6 {{smallcaps|Great Plains Nat. Resources J.}} 89, 109 n.21 (2001) (discussing the historical evolution of the doctrine of ''ratione soli'').&lt;/ref&gt; English [[common law]] originally restricted the right to hunt animals to those who had permission from [[King of England|the Crown]], but later laws allowed landowners to hunt animals that entered upon their land through the principle of ''ratione soli''.&lt;ref&gt;15 {{smallcaps|Halsbury's Laws of England}}, Game 2d ed. 406-65 (1931); 1 {{smallcaps|Halsbury's Laws of England}}, Animals 2d ed. 529-616 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this developed into a system of laws where the right to hunt was restricted to [[nobles]] and the landowning elite.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Kelley, ''Implications of A Montana Voter Initiative That Reduces Chronic Wasting Disease Risk, Bans Canned Shooting, &amp; Protects A Public Trust'', 6 {{smallcaps|Great Plains Nat. Resources J.}} 89, 109 n.21 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
The doctrine of ''ratione soli'' has survived in many jurisdictions to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Curran v. Jones'', 163 La. 579, 581-82, 112 So. 492, 493 (1927) (recognizing the doctrine of "''rationae soli''"); ''State v. Long'', 98 Wash. App. 669, 675, 991 P.2d 102, 106 (2000) (holding that a landowner "has a limited right in the wild game on his property to exclude all other persons from his . . . property for the purpose of hunting" (internal citations and quotations omitted)); cf. ''Pierson v. Post'', 3 Cai. R. 175, 2 Am. Dec. 264[1] (N.Y. 1805).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many jurisdictions still recognize the correlative ''ad coelum'' doctrine. [[India]], for example, "views groundwater as chattel connected to the land, and allows the landowner ownership rights based on the ''ad coleum'' principle."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Aguilar, [http://www.tilj.org/content/journal/46/num3/Aguilar623.pdf ''Groundwater Reform in India: An Equity &amp; Sustainability Dilemma''], 46 {{smallcaps|Tex. Int'l L.J.}} 623, 630 (2011) (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some commentators note that some American jurisdictions have rejected the application of ''ratione soli'' to the ownership of wild animals because "it smacks of the hunting rights of the English landowning families who used it to make meatless meals for and poachers out of England's yeoman."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, {{smallcaps|Personal Property in a Nutshell}} (2d ed.) at p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] stated in 1981 that "a landowner's property ''ration soli'' is subject to 'lawful regulation.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Collopy v. Wildlife Comm'n, Dept. of Natural Res.'', 625 P.2d 994, 999 (Colo. 1981) (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5914">The word '''stannary''' is historically applied to:
*A [[tin]] [[mining|mine]], especially in [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornwall or Devon]], [[South West England]]
*A region containing tin works (mines and refineries, assay offices, etc.) 
*A chartered entity comprising such a region, its works, and its workers
*The town constituting the administrative centre of such a region (a "stannary town")
*Any of the courts or parliaments established to maintain the rights of such a charter (see [[Stannary Courts and Parliaments]]—often in the plural)
*The [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries]].

The principal role of a stannary town was the collection of [[tin coinage]], the proceeds of which were passed to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] or the Crown.  With the abolition of tin coinage in 1838 (following extensive petitioning by the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] tin industry for simplification of the taxation rules), the principal purpose for coinage town status ceased. However coinage towns still retained certain historic rights to appoint stannators to Cornwall's [[Stannary Parliament]].

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word ‘stannary’ is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''stannarie'', through [[Medieval Latin]] ''stannaria'' (‘tin mine’), ultimately from [[Late Latin]] ''stannum'' (‘[[tin]]’) ([[cf.]] the symbol for the chemical element '''[[tin|Sn]]'''). The native [[Cornish language|Cornish]] word is ''sten'' and tin-workings ''stenegi''.

==Devon stannaries==
Devon stannaries are usually referred to by the names of stannary towns. These towns were the locations where refined tin (or [[white tin]]) was assessed, [[tin coinage|coined]], and sold. They were also the location for some of the institutions associated with the operation of the stannary.

King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s 1305 Stannary Charter established [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], [[Ashburton, England|Ashburton]] and [[Chagford]] as Devon's stannary towns, with a [[monopoly]] on all tin mining in Devon, a right to representation in the Stannary Parliament and a right to the [[jurisdiction]] of the Stannary Courts. [[Plympton]] became the fourth Devon stannary town in 1328 after a powerful lobby persuaded the [[High Sheriff of Devon|Sheriff of Devon]] that it was nearer the sea and therefore had better access for merchants.&lt;ref name=gill&gt;{{cite book
  | last =Gill
  | first =Crispin (editor)
  | title =Dartmoor, A New Study
  | publisher =David &amp; Charles
  | date =1970
  | location =Newton Abbot
  | isbn =0-7153-5041-2
  | page =117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devon stannary towns are all on the fringes of [[Dartmoor]], which is the granite upland which bore the tin. No definition of the boundaries of the Devon stannaries is known, if indeed one ever existed.

==Cornish stannaries==
The four Cornish stannaries were (from west to east):

*Penwith and Kerrier: Most of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall|hundreds]] of Penwith and Kerrier (including the granite outcrops of Land's End and [[Carnmenellis]])
*Tywarnhaile: St Agnes and the Carn Brea area
*Blackmore: the [[Hensbarrow]] granite upland, now better known as the St Austell moors or the china clay country
*Foweymore: the historic name for [[Bodmin Moor]]

The geographical jurisdiction of each Cornish stannary was more clearly demarcated that of the others than was the case in Devon, as each represented a separate tin-bearing area, but the boundaries were not precisely laid down. The relative productivity of the stannaries varied greatly and was in no way related to their size.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, John (1970) ''Rural Economy and Society in the Duchy of Cornwall 1300–1500''. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-08550-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The towns at which [[tin coinage|coinage]] was carried out in Cornwall varied over time. The Cornish coinage towns included at various times: [[Penzance]], [[Truro]], [[Helston]], [[St Austell]], [[Bodmin]] (probably), [[Liskeard]] and [[Lostwithiel]]. Penryn twice attempted to acquire coinage town status, supported by Falmouth, but failed on both occasions due to strong opposition from the established coinage towns.

==Surviving records of stannary matters==
Survival of stannary records has been rather patchy. The [[Cornwall Record Office]] has records from the Vicewarden's Court of the Stannaries of Devon and Cornwall, mostly from the mid nineteenth century onwards, which is rather late in the overall history of the stannary organisations. Earlier survivals in the CRO include the Tin Abstract Books from the Truro Tin office for 1703–10 and 1833–35. These books record the quantities of tin coined in the various coinage towns of Devon and Cornwall, the purchase of tin by the crown and the shipment of this tin by sea to [[London]].

Many stannary-related papers including registration of tin bounds, records of tin production and papers relating to disputes are to be found in the records of families with tin mining interests, although these are frequently intermingled with records on other matters so location of specific information is difficult.

The [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] hold most of the records of central government, which includes records on stannary matters including [[manorial roll]]s for part of the reign of Charles 1. The [[House of Lords]] Record Office also contains relevant material, primarily relating to the special position of the stannary organisations (and tinners) with respect to the law.

There are 3 '''tenancy deposit schemes''' in Scotland: the '''Letting Protection Service Scotland''', '''Safedeposits Scotland''' and '''My|deposits Scotland'''.

The '''Tenancy Deposit Schemes (Scotland) Regulations 2011''' came into force on 7 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/privaterent/government/SGTD1 Safeguarding Tenancy Deposits]&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[landlord]] or [[letting agent]] that receives a deposit in Scotland must register with their [[Scottish local authority|local authority]] and join a tenancy deposit scheme.

== Reasons for introduction ==
[[Scots law]] gives tenants extra protection against losing their deposits. It means landlords and letting agents cannot keep deposits, instead they have to transfer them to a government approved third party.

The regulation has come into force to prevent "unscrupulous" landlords withholding part or all of a deposit when the tenant leaves their accommodation. The Scottish Housing Minister, [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]], estimated that up to 11,000 tenants each year have had their deposit wrongly retained by their landlord or letting agent. 
The tenancy deposit schemes approved by the government means that any deposit dispute between tenant and landlord can be referred to an independent dispute resolution service.

== Regulations ==
Concerns that some private landlords unfairly withhold tenants’ deposits led to provisions in the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/1/contents Housing (Scotland) Act 2006], for Scottish Ministers to bring forward regulations for the approval of tenancy deposit schemes in Scotland.
The Regulations set out the conditions that all schemes must meet before they can be approved by the Scottish Ministers.
Schemes
The three independent third party schemes approved by Scottish Ministers operating in Scotland are:
* The Letting Protection Service Scotland
* SafeDeposits Scotland
* My|deposits Scotland

A '''trick tank''' is a watering device for [[livestock]] or [[wildlife]].  It collects [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], holds the water in a covered tank to minimize [[evaporation]] and maintain adequate [[water quality]], and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink.  Dispensing may be regulated by a mechanical float device similar to a [[ballcock]] in the tank of a [[flush toilet]].

Trick tanks are manufactured in several styles, including inverted umbrella and apron.  They are heavy and often are used in remote wilderness locations, to which they may require delivery via helicopter.

To provide water to wild animals, not livestock, fencing may be built to surround a trick tank.  Fences serve to exclude [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].  Trick tanks are widely used in the [[southwest United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Unfair business practices''' encompass [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and oppressive or [[unconscionability|unconscionable]] acts or practices by [[business]], often against [[consumer]]s and are prohibited by law in many countries. For instance, in the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. Unfair business practices may arise in many areas, including:
*[[leasing|Tenancy]] matters
*Matters involving the advertising and sale of products and services to consumers
*Matters involving [[insurance]] claims and the settlement thereof
*[[Debt collection]] in cases of [[default (finance)|default]]

In addition to providing for the award of compensatory [[damages]], laws may also provide for the award of punitive damages as well as the payment of the plaintiff's legal fees.

At [[common law]], individuals were not entitled to attorneys fees or punitive damages for wrongful acts committed by businesses in most states.  Most often, laws prohibiting unfair business practices require consumers to send a demand letter to the business prior to commencing with a lawsuit.  If the business fails to make a reasonable offer of settlement within a specified period of time, and is subsequently found liable in court, it may be liable for punitive damages and the injured parties reasonable attorney's fees under many statutes.  In some instances, the statutes provide for prevailing plaintiffs to recover double or triple the actual damages against non-settling defendants.  

When statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices provide for the award of punitive damages and [[attorneys fee]]s to injured parties, they provide a powerful incentive for businesses to resolve the claim through the settlement process rather than risk a more costly judgment in court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9418">'''''Voir dire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|w|ɑːr|_|d|ɪər}}) is a legal phrase for a variety of procedures connected with [[jury trial]]s.  It originally referred to an [[oath]] taken by [[juror]]s to tell the [[truth]] ({{lang-la|verum dicere}}),{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} i.e., to say what is true, what is objectively accurate or subjectively honest, or both. According to the ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'', it comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The word ''voir'' (or ''voire''), in this combination, comes from [[Old French]] and derives from Latin {{lang|la|verum}}, "that which is true".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is related to the [[French language|modern French]] word {{wikt-lang|fr|voire}}, "indeed",{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} but not to the more common word ''voir'', "to see", which derives from Latin {{lang|la|vidēre}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[William Blackstone]] referred to it as {{lang|la|veritatem dicere}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|last=Blackstone|first=William|publisher=|isbn=|volume=Book 3, Ch. 23|location=|pages=394|quote=A juror may himself be examined on oath of voir dire, veritatem dicere ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated by [[John Winter Jones]] as "To speak the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Translation of All the Greek, Latin, Italian, and French Quotations which Occur in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, And Also in the Notes of the Editions by Christian, Archbold, and Williams|last=Jones|first=J.|publisher=|year=1823|isbn=|volume=Vol. III|location=|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expression is now often interpreted by [[false etymology]] to mean "to see [them] say". The term is used (as {{lang|fr|le voir-dire}}) in modern Canadian legal French.

==Historic use==

In earlier centuries, a [[Peremptory challenge|challenge]] to a particular juror would be tried by other members of the [[jury panel]], and the challenged juror would take an oath of ''voir dire'', meaning to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. 3 p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure fell into disuse when the function of trying challenges to jurors was transferred to the [[judge]].

==Use in Commonwealth countries, Ireland and Hong Kong==

In the [[United Kingdom]] (except [[Scotland]]), [[Cyprus]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Canada]], it refers to a "trial within a trial".  It is a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] to determine the [[admissible evidence|admissibility of evidence]], or the [[Competence (human resources)|competency]] of a [[witness]] or juror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/V/Voirdire.aspx |title=Voir Dire definition |last1= Duhaime |first1=Lloyd |work=Duhaime's Legal Dictionary |publisher=Duhaime.org |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the subject matter of the ''voir dire'' often relates to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to [[bias]] on behalf of the [[jury]], the jury may be removed from the court for the ''voir dire''.

The term has thus been broadened in Australian jurisdictions to include any hearing during a [[trial]] where the jury is removed. The [[High Court of Australia]] has noted that the ''voir dire'' is an appropriate forum for the trial judge to reprimand [[legal counsel|counsel]] or for counsel to make submissions as to the running of the court to the trial judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netk.net.au/Australia/Jago.asp |title=''Jago v The District Court of NSW and others'' (1989) HCA 46 |last1= Moles |first1=Robert N. |last2=Sangha |first2=Bibi  |date=3 May 2007 |publisher=Networked Knowledge |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Scots law]], jury selection is random, and there are a few well-defined exclusions in [[Criminal procedure|criminal trials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does US jury system make justice a joke?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/does-us-jury-system-make-justice-a-joke-1-736152|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the case of ''Erven v. The Queen'' holds that testimony on a ''voir dire'' cannot influence the trial itself. This remains true even if the judge ruled against the accused in the ''voir dire''. The judge is assumed to ignore what he or she heard during ''voir dire''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freelegalhelp.ca/procedure.html#voirDire "a voir dire cannot influence the trial itself"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury is never present during a ''voir dire''.

In Australia, the rule about ''voir dire'' is in section 189 of the ''Evidence Act 1995'' (Cth): "On a voir dire parties can call witnesses, cross-examine opponent's witnesses and make submissions- as they might in the trial proper."&lt;ref&gt;Jill Hunter et al, ''The Trial'' (The Federal Press, 2015) 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the United States==
[[File:USA v. Mohammed Hashim -- Defense Voir Dire of Military Judge.pdf|thumb|upright|''USA v. Mohammed Hashim'' – defense ''voir dire'' of [[Military justice|military judge]]]]

In the United States, ''voir dire'' is the process by which prospective jurors are questioned about their backgrounds and potential biases before being [[jury selection|chosen to sit on a jury]]. "Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trial Evidence Foundations |last1= Cleary |first1=Gordon P. |last2= Tarantino |first2=John A. |year= 2007 |publisher=James Publishing |location=Santa Ana, Calif. |at=Section 201 |url=http://www.jamespublishing.com/books/tef.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also refers to the process by which [[expert witness]]es are questioned about their backgrounds and qualifications before being allowed to present their opinion testimony in court. As noted above, in the United States (especially in practice under the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]), ''voir dire'' can also refer to examination of the background of a witness to assess their qualification or fitness to give testimony on a given subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Evidence |last1= Mueller |first1=Christopher B. |last2= Kirkpatrick |first2=Laird C. |edition=4th |year= 2009 |series=Aspen Treatise Series |publisher=Aspen Publishers |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-7355-7967-5 |at=§§6.2, 6.59, 7.14 |oclc=300280544}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Voir dire'' is often taught to law students in [[trial advocacy]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy,'' NITA 2004 pp. 240, 541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic examples in fiction==
The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' has an example of the legal process in terms of jury selection where the attorney for the defense, Henry Drummond, struggles to arrange a reasonably unbiased jury in a small town where the public sentiment is blatantly favoring the prosecution. However, the play has Drummond forced to entirely use his limited number of [[peremptory challenge]]s to weed-out prospective jurors, even when they are so obviously prejudiced in the prosecution's favor to the point of bellowing their opinions on the stand that most should be [[strike for cause|struck for cause]].

The [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' has a scene depicting the voir diring of the defense attorney's fiancée who is summoned to the stand as an expert in general knowledge of automobiles. The prosecution is highly skeptical of her qualifications since she states that she is an unemployed hairdresser, but also has extensive work experience as a mechanic in her family's automotive business. With that doubt in mind, the prosecution asks a highly technical automotive question about a specific automobile make, model, year, engine size, and carburetor type, and she refuses to answer what she considers an invalid question.  At the request of the court for a clarification, she explains in exacting detail why the question is deceptive, which is because the prosecution asked about a vehicle that never existed per the specifications.  She then goes on to explain when the vehicle described was actually first manufactured and provided the answer to the prosecutor’s question for that model year, being the closest match.  Surprised at such a detailed and authoritative answer, the prosecutor concludes the ''voir dire'', saying she is acceptable as an expert witness.

In the television series ''[[Bull (2016 TV series) |Bull]]'', a Hollywood version of the process of ''voir dire'' plays a central role in nearly all episodes, with key elements of the psychological makeup of potential jurors meshed with the elements of the forthcoming trial being the factor for the decision whether to accept or "strike" (remove) a potential juror.

Online database article number 8087 (May 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Drummond was born in 1690, a year in which his father was outlawed for adhering to the [[House of Stuart]]. On 26 May 1711 Drummond succeeded as fourth [[Viscount Strathallan|Viscount of Strathallan]] on the death of his cousin, William. In 1712, Strathallan married Margaret Murray (died 28 May 1773), daughter of [[William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne]] and his wife, Margaret Nairne.

Strathallan was amongst the first to join the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], attending [[John Erskine, 22nd Earl of Mar|John Erskine]], [[Earl of Mar|22nd Earl of Mar]]'s hunting party. Serving under Brigadier William [[Mackintosh of Borlum]], he led a battalion from Perthshire in the campaign. He was taken prisoner at Sheriffmuir and was moved to Stirling and under the terms of the Act of Grace of 1717, was neither injured nor prosecuted. Strathallan joined the army of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] on 3 September 1745, commanding the Perthshire Horse, with two troops under him led by [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Laurence Oliphant (Jacobite)|Lawrence Oliphant of Gask]] and Major John Haldane, he is also named as being a member of the Prince's [[Privy council]]. At the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], he commanded the only cavalry unit in the Jacobite force, around thirty-six troopers and their servants. Strathallan was promoted to [[Major General|major-general]] and was appointed [[General Officer Commanding|general officer commanding]] in Scotland, stationed in Perth, while his cavalry under the command of [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], joined Prince Charles in his march south. Strathallan remained in command in Scotland until superseded by Lord John Drummond.

At the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]], the Perthshire Horse were at the back of the field, taking little part in the action. Several weeks later, at the [[Battle of Culloden]], when the government ranks closed round the Jacobites and advanced on their undeployed second and third lines, Strathallan 'resolved to die in the field rather than by the hand of the executioner', his horse was killed beneath him, and according to tradition, he was run through by Colonel George Howard of the 3rd Foot. Whilst awaiting death on the battlefield, it is said he received a [[Anointing of the Sick|last sacrament]] of oatmeal or oatcake and whisky or water, from John Maitland of Careston, the chaplain to the Forfarshire Regiment.

Lady Strathallan, being from a Jacobite family, was held prisoner in [[Edinburgh Castle]] from 11 February—22 November 1746 while proceedings for treason were under consideration. Strathallan's younger brother [[Andrew Drummond (banker)|Andrew Drummond]], founder of the [[Drummonds Bank]] in Charing Cross was to see his business interrupted during the period of the last of the Jacobite rebellions.

There were seven sons and three daughters from the marriage of William Drummond and Margaret Murray (dau. of [[William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne|Lord Nairne]]).&lt;ref&gt;from notes provided from the Drummonds of Cadland family archive in 2006; courtesy of Mr Maldwin Drummond, JP, Hon DSc, DL&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest, James (1715–1766) became ''de jure'' 5th Viscount.

The '''World Index of Moral Freedom'''&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom (WIMF)]'''&lt;/ref&gt; is an international index ranking one hundred and sixty countries on their performance on five categories of indicators: '''religious freedom''' (taking into account both the freedom to practice any religion or none, and the situation of religious control on the state); '''bioethical freedom''' (including the legal status of abortion, euthanasia and other practices pertaining to bioethics, like surrogacy or stem cell research); '''drugs freedom''' (including the legal status of cannabis and the country's general policy on hard drugs); '''sexual freedom''' (including the legal status of pornography and sex services among consenting adults, and the country's age of sexual consent), and '''family and gender freedom''' (including women's freedom of movement, the legal status of cohabitation of unmarried couples, same sex marriage and the situation of transgender people). The index is sponsored and published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The WIMF's first edition was published on April 2, 2016, co-authored by Foundation researchers Andreas Kohl and Juan Pina. A second edition was published by the same foundation in July, 2018, this time authored by Juan Pina and Emma Watson.

== Purpose ==
The World Index of Moral Freedom aims at completing the views presented by other international [[freedom indices]] measuring general freedom or aspects thereof (press freedom, economic freedom, etcetera). To do so, the Index aims at responding a simple question: how free from state-imposed moral constraints are human beings depending on their countries of residence? The research conducted tries to determine the degree of individual freedom to take decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time. The first edition of the WIMF includes a short note on the comparison between its country ranking and those of the other freedom indices.

== Categories studied and classification of countries ==
Each category of indicators is worth twenty points (20% of the total score) and aims at responding the following questions:
* '''''Category A.''''' Religious indicators. How free is the practice of any religion or none, and how religious-controlled is the state.
* '''''Category B.''''' Bioethical indicators. How free is individual decision making on matters posing bioethical questions.
* '''''Category C.''''' Drugs indicators. How free is the production, trade and consumption of substances deemed harmful.
* '''''Category D.''''' Sexuality indicators. How free are sexual intercourse, pornography and sex services among consenting adults.
* '''''Category E.''''' Gender &amp; family indicators. How free are women, LGBT individuals and unmarried couples living together.

Each category is made up of various indicators (normally one or two leading indicators adjusted by one or two lesser wheighted ones), the weight of which is set in view of their inferred relevance towards the category's overall score. Countries have been classified towards each category according to the information available in the sources reviewed. All category results and the general index itself are presented in a 0-100 point scale. Countries are classified according to the following intervals:
* 90-100 points – ''Highest moral freedom''
* 80-90 points – ''Very high moral freedom''
* 60-80 points – ''High moral freedom''
* 50-60 points – ''Acceptable moral freedom''
* 40-50 points – ''Insufficient moral freedom''
* 20-40 points – ''Low moral freedom''
* 10-20 points – ''Very low moral freedom''
* 0-10 points – ''Lowest moral freedom''

== Findings of the WIMF's first edition ==

=== State of moral freedom around the world ===
Only one country, the [[Netherlands]], is classified as having the "highest" level of moral freedom by scoring slightly over the 90 points required for that label. Just four countries make it into the upper twenty points, and only ten pass the 75 point threshold. Out of the 160 countries considered, only 64 "pass the exam" and score 50 points or more. And around 30% of all countries fall in the "low", "very low" or "lowest" moral freedom areas of the index. Technology and the cultural globalization that it produces are deemed by the authors to be the most powerful driving forces towards acceptance of individual moral freedom.

=== Netherlands ===
With a three-point (three per cent) advantage over their closest competitor and eight points over the third, the Netherlands top the 2016 country ranking. The Dutch score is twenty-one points higher than the average of all countries enjoying "high" or "very high" moral freedom. For many decades, whenever moral freedom was discussed, the Netherlands had the least interventionist policies. The first country to fight [[human trafficking]] by legalising sex services performed by [[consenting adults]], or to normalize the use of [[cannabis]], or to acknowledge [[same sex marriage]] already in 2001, performs remarkably high in most indicators considered towards the index.

=== Latin countries ===
A trend may be inferred towards international unification of the legal and political approach to moral issues. And that trend favours the Western world's predominant choice for low moral interference by the state. This is particularly noticeable when looking at the index performance of many Southern European and [[Latin American]] countries, which seem to reveal a fast cultural evolution from traditional, conservative values into a laissez-faire approach to morality. Four of the top ten countries are Latin American or Iberian, while six other Latin countries in Southern Europe and the Americas make it to the "high moral freedom" region of the index. The particular performance of countries like [[Portugal]] or [[Uruguay]] is much higher than their recent history would indicate. These and other Latin countries seem to have discarded their traditional background of religiously influenced governance.

=== Islamic countries and other religious-influenced states ===
The fifteen lowest scoring countries at the World Index of Moral Freedom are [[Islamic]] and located in the [[Persian Gulf]], North-Eastern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This is also true for the region's economically free enclaves in the area. [[Saudi Arabia]] comes last (160th) in the ranking and doesn't even score ten points out of the one hundred potentially available. Only four predominantly Islamic countries obtain more than fifty points: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. A few non Islamic countries also show low levels of moral freedom which the authors consider likely to be due to a strong political leverage held by another [[religion]]. These include [[Belarus]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]), [[Israel]] ([[Jewish]]), [[Nepal]] ([[Hinduist]]), the [[Philippines]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Thailand]] ([[Buddhist]]), [[Tonga]] ([[Methodist]]), or [[Tuvalu]] ([[Calvinist]]).

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], moral [[conservatism]], derived from either the Orthodox faith or traditional culture, seems to have replaced [[marxism]] as the basis for an ongoing, though softer, social engineering by the state. Russia's score is just in the middle of the classification, a position shared by some of her cultural and political allies, like [[Serbia]] or [[Moldova]], while politically unfree [[Belarus]] falls further below. In all of these countries, the freedom of [[LGBT]] individuals is a matter of particular concern.

=== Communist countries ===
The remaining [[communist]] regimes coerce their citizens into abiding by a moral code based on allegedly scientific views. Freedom of conscience and the practice of any religion are repressed. In the case of the [[People's Republic of China]], decades of limited economic liberalization have not resulted in an equally noticeable moral openness. Two other communist regimes, [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], fall further down into the low moral freedom area, while moral freedom is deemed insufficient in [[Laos]] and just slightly over the fifty point threshold in socialist [[Venezuela]] or in outright communist [[Cuba]].

=== Other findings ===
For different reasons, often including abnormally low scores in a particular set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] fail to make it into the "high moral freedom" area, although just for under half a point. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while [[Singapore]], [[Israel]] or [[South Korea]] fall in the "insufficient moral freedom" part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the [[developed world]], some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. [[Cambodia]], scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] and the republics of [[San Marino]] and [[Malta]]− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high [[living standards]] and [[economic freedom]], these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. This similarity between very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.
