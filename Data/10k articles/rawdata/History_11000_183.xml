Born in [[Tokyo]], Nakamura studied [[English literature]] and graduated from [[University of Tokyo]] in March 1959. He worked as a senior high school teacher of English until he clashed with the school principal. From April 1964 onwards he lectured at the newly founded [[Dokkyo University]] on a full-time basis until his retirement in March 2005 to become an [[emeritus professor]]. A representative of [[Showa History Research Institute]], he frequently joined controversies surrounding Japan's wartime past, particularly the denialism or minimization of the [[Nanking Massacre]] of 1937-38. He completely rejected the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s claim of 300,000 death toll as mere [[propaganda]], giving his own estimate of around 10,000 deaths. He was also a supporter of the film, '''[[The Truth about Nanjing]]''', containing apologism for Japan's wartime past, and which denied the existence of the Nanking Massacre. He detested what he viewed as "left leaning" mass media, especially The [[Asahi Shimbun]] newspaper and [[NHK]] public broadcasting organisation.

Wilke (Leipzig, 1914); Bacchylidis carmina cum fragmentis, post B. Snell ed. H. Maehler (Leipzig, 1970); Poetae epici graeci, Pars II, Fasces. 1, ed. A. Burnable (Munich, 2004)]]{{Advert|date=July 2017}}
The '''Bibliotheca Teubneriana''', or '''Teubner editions''' of [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Latin]] texts, comprise the most thorough modern collection published of ancient (and some medieval) Greco-Roman literature.  The series, whose full name is the '''''Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana''''', consists of [[textual criticism|critical editions]] by leading scholars (now always with a full [[critical apparatus]] on each page, although during the nineteenth century there were editiones minores, published either without critical apparatuses or with abbreviated textual appendices, and editiones maiores, published with a full apparatus.

'''Teubneriana''' is an abbreviation used to denote mainly a single volume of the series (fully: ''editio Teubneriana''), rarely the whole collection; correspondingly, ''Oxoniensis'' is used with reference to the ''Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis'', mentioned above as ''Oxford Classical Texts''.

Today, the only comparable publishing ventures, producing authoritative scholarly reference editions of numerous ancient authors, are the [[Oxford Classical Texts]] and the [[Collection Budé]] (whose volumes also include facing-page French translations with notes).  (The [[Loeb Classical Library]], with facing-page English translations and notes, aims at a more general audience.)

== {{anchor|Benedictus Gotthelf Teubner|Company history}}History of the series ==
{{Main article|B. G. Teubner Verlag&lt;!-- article with possibilities for info on "classical" publisher B.G. Teubner --&gt;|Vieweg+Teubner Verlag&lt;!-- latest incarnation, but not suitable for info on classical publisher --&gt;}}
In 1811, [[Benedictus Gotthelf Teubner]] (1784–1856) refounded in his own name a printing operation he had directed since 1806, the ''Weinedelsche Buchdruckerei'', giving rise to the [[Leipzig]] publishing house of B.G. Teubner (its [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], in Latin, ''[[in aedibus]] B.G. Teubneri'').  The volumes of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana began to appear in 1849.  Although today Teubner editions are relatively expensive (as are European-produced scholarly books in general), they were originally introduced to fill the need, then unmet, for low-priced but high-quality editions.

Prior to the introduction of the Teubner series, accurate editions of antique authors could only be purchased by libraries and rich private scholars because of their expense.  Students and other individuals of modest means had to rely on editions which were affordable but also filled with errors.  To satisfy the need for accurate and affordable editions Teubner introduced the Bibliotheca Teubneriana.

In the 19th century, Teubner offered both affordable ''editiones maiores'' (with a full critical apparatus) for scholars, and low-priced ''editiones minores'' (without critical apparatuses or with abbreviated textual appendices) for students.  Eventually, ''editiones minores'' were dropped from the series and Teubner began to offer only scholarly reference editions of ancient authors.

During the period between the end of [[World War II]] and [[German reunification]], the publishing house of B.G. Teubner split into two firms, Teubner KG (with Teubner Buch GmbH and Teubner Redaktions GmbH), later ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Betrieb mit staatlicher Beteiligung|de|3=Betrieb mit staatlicher Beteiligung|lt=BSB}} B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft'', in Leipzig in [[East Germany]], and Verlag B. G. Teubner / BG Teubner GmbH in [[Stuttgart]] in [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]].  Both offered volumes in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana.

After the fall of the [[Berlin wall]] and the [[reunification of Germany]], B.G. Teubner was also reunited (B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft mbH) and subsequently consolidated its headquarters at [[Wiesbaden]].

In late 1999, B.G. Teubner Verlag announced their intention to concentrate on scientific and technical publishing.  All their Classical Studies titles, including the Biblotheca Teubneriana, were sold to [[K.G. Saur]], a publisher based in [[Munich]].  Although new volumes began to appear with the imprint ''in aedibus K.G. Saur'', the name of the series remained unchanged.

In 2006, the publishing firm of [[Walter de Gruyter]] acquired K.G. Saur and their entire publishing range, including the Bibliotheca Teubneriana. Since January 2007, the Bibliotheca Teubneriana is being exclusively published by Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co. KG. As of 1 May 2007, the new North American distributor of titles from the Bibliotheca Teubneriana is Walter de Gruyter, Inc.

== Greek type in Teubner editions ==

While the [[typography]] of the Greek Teubners has been subject to innovations over the years, an overview of the whole series shows a great deal of consistency.  The old-fashioned, [[italic type|cursive]] font used (with small variations) in most of the existing volumes is instantly recognized by classicists and strongly associated with Teubner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Martin. "Book, Printed." ''The Classical Tradition'', eds. Anthony Grafton, Glenn Most, Salvatore Settis. Harvard: 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Original "Teubner" font ===

[[Image:Teubner Gk type original.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Examples of the original Teubner Greek type, in its older (left: Aeschines, ed. F. Blass, Leipzig, 1895) and newer (Pindari carmina cum fragmentis, post B. Snell ed. H. Maehler, Leipzig, 1969) forms]]

This type was in regular use at least from the 1870s to the 1970s, for verse and prose texts.  In older (e.g., nineteenth-century) Teubners, several old-fashioned features of the type (almost crabbed by the [[Porson (typeface)|Porsonian]] standard more familiar in the English-speaking world) are still found which would later be smoothed away, for example, omega with bent-in ends, medial sigma that is not completely closed, and phi with a bent stem.

==== Upright variant ====

[[Image:Teubner Babyloniaca.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Example of the upright variant of the original Teubner Greek type: Iamblichi Babyloniacorum reliquiae, ed. E. Habrich, Leipzig, 1960]]  Teubner used an upright type, designed to match the original cursive type, in some editions.  In the example shown, the cursive type is still used in the critical apparatus.  In other editions (for example, Aristotelis Athenaion politeia, ed. M. Chambers, Leipzig, 1986), this upright font is used throughout.

{{clear}}

==== Digital descendants ====
[[Image:Teubner Gk type original digital age.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Examples of more recent variants of the original Teubner Greek type, both italic (top: Euripides, Electra, ed. G. Basta Donzelli, Stuttgart 1995) and upright (center: Aeschyli tragoediae, ed. M.L. West, Stuttgart, 1990; bottom: Poetae epici graeci, Pars II, Fasc. 1, ed. A. Bernabé, Munich, 2004)]]  Beginning in the 1990s, the [[Typesetting#Digital era|digital production of books]] has been marked by new digital fonts, sometimes based on Teubner's older traditions.  In the 1990s, individual editions of [[Euripides|Euripides']] tragedies were digitally typeset in a font apparently based on the original Teubner cursive.  There have also been recent innovations in upright type.  One of these, which may be seen in Bernabé's edition of the [[Orpheus#Orphic poems and rites|Orphica]], seems likely to be the current standard for new Teubners from K.G. Saur.

{{clear}}

=== Griechische Antiqua ===

[[Image:Teubner Gk type Griechische Antiqua.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Teubner Greek type based on Griechische Antiqua (top: Philodemi De ira liber, ed. C. Wilke, Leipzig, 1914; center: Homeri Odyssea, ed. P. Von der Muehll, Stuttgart, 1962), with a more recent digital descendant (bottom: Homeri Ilias, rec. M.L. West, volumen alterum, Munich, 2000)]]

Some Teubner Greek editions made a bold typographic departure from the tradition outlined above.  E.J. Kenney considered this twentieth-century experiment to be a refreshing break from the Porsonian norm, and emblematic of the best kind of modernist simplicity and directness: &lt;blockquote&gt;More recently there has been a welcome and long overdue return to the older and purer models.  The pleasing modification of M.E. Pinder's "Griechische Antiqua" used by Teubner in some of their editions represents a lost opportunity, having been regrettably abandoned in favour of the "dull and lumpish" fount (Victor Scholderer's words) that is still the uniform of the series.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Kenney, "From script to print," in ''Greek Scripts: An illustrated introduction'', Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, 2001, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Kenney referred to Bruno Snell's Bacchylides edition of 1934; closely comparable is the Philodemus example illustrated here.  A slightly less radical version of this font (notably without [[lunate sigma]]) was used in some later Teubner editions (and in non-Teubner publications such as [[Alfred Rahlfs|Rahlfs']] [[Septuaginta]] of 1935), and [[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West's]] recent edition of the [[Iliad]] uses a digital font that seems closer to this type than to the main Teubner tradition.

'''David Calderwood''' (1575{{snd}}29 October 1650) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|divine]] and [[historian]].

==Early life==

Calderwood was educated at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], where he took the degree of MA in 1593. In about 1604, he became minister of [[Crailing]], near [[Jedburgh]] in [[Roxburghshire]], where he became conspicuous for his resolute opposition to the introduction of [[Episcopacy]]. In 1617, while [[James I of England|James VI]] was in Scotland, a [[Five articles of Remonstrance|Remonstrance]], which had been drawn up by the [[Presbyterian]] clergy, was placed in Calderwood's hands.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Calderwood, David|volume=4|page=986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was summoned to [[St Andrews]] and examined before the king, but neither threats nor promises could make him deliver up the roll of signatures to the Remonstrance. He was deprived of his charge, committed to prison at St Andrews and afterwards removed to [[Edinburgh]]. The privy council ordered him to be banished from the kingdom for refusing to acknowledge the sentence of the [[High Commission]]. He lingered in Scotland, publishing a few tracts, till 27 August 1619, when he sailed for [[Holland]]. During his residence in Holland he published his ''[[Altare Damascenum]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Calderwood appears to have returned to Scotland in 1624-1625. He was appointed minister of [[Pencaitland]], in the county of [[East Lothian]], in about 1640, where he was one of those appointed to draw up [[The Directory for Public Worship in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He continued to take an active part in the affairs of the church, and introduced in 1649 the practice, now confirmed by long usage, of dissenting from the decision of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], and requiring the protest to be entered in the record.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His last years were devoted to the preparation of ''The Historie of the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk of Scotland]]'' which was published in an abridged form in 1646. The complete work was printed (1842–49) for the [[Woodrow Society]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==General Assembly work==
In 1648 the General Assembly urged him to complete the work he had designed, and voted him a yearly pension of £800.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Calderwood died at Jedburgh on 29 October 1650. He left behind him a historical work of great extent and of great value as a storehouse of authentic materials. An abridgment, which appears to have been prepared by Calderwood himself, was published after his death. An excellent edition of the complete work was published by the [[Woodrow Society]], 8 vols, 1842-1849. The manuscript, which belonged to [[General Calderwood Durham]], was presented to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''David Hatcher Childress''' (born June 1, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[author]], and the owner of Adventures Unlimited Press, a publishing house established in 1984 specializing in books on unusual topics such as ancient mysteries, unexplained phenomena, [[secret history|alternative history]], and [[historical revisionism]]. His own works primarily concentrate on [[lost city|lost cities]] such as [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], [[pole shift]]s, the [[hollow earth]], [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]], suppressed technology&lt;ref name="sula" /&gt;, [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Free energy suppression|free energy]], [[UFO]]s and [[ancient astronauts]], [[anti-gravity]], [[vimana]] aircraft, and secret societies&lt;ref name="sula" /&gt; including the [[Knights Templar]]. More recently, he has written on [[time travel]] and [[cryptozoology]] phenomena such as the [[yeti]] and [[sasquatch]].  Childress refers to himself as a "rogue archaeologist".&lt;ref name=sula&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Atlantis, Ho! |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/atlantis-ho/Content?oid=923072 |quote= |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=September 8, 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| name="1st WP:ABOUTSELF" | {{cite web |url=http://davidhatcherchildress.com/books?page=1 |title=DavidHatcherChildress.com official website |accessdate=2014-01-09}} }}

==Biography==
Born in [[France]] to American parents, and raised in [[Colorado]] and Montana, [[United States]], Childress went to [[University of Montana-Missoula]] to study archaeology, but left college in 1976 at 19 to begin travelling in pursuit of his archaeological interests.&lt;ref name="sula" /&gt;{{efn| name="2nd WP:ABOUTSELF" | {{cite web |url=http://www.davidhatcherchildress.com/?q=biography |title=DavidHatcherChildress.com official website |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109150647/http://www.davidhatcherchildress.com/?q=biography |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }} }} After several years in Asia and then Africa, Childress moved in 1983 to [[Stelle, Illinois]], a community founded by [[New Age]] writer Richard Kieninger; Childress had been given one of Kieninger's books while touring Africa.&lt;ref name=sula/&gt; Childress chronicled his explorations in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in his ''Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries'' series of books. 
Childress's first book, ''A Hitchhikers Guide to Africa and Arabia'', was published in 1983 by [[Chicago Review Press]]. In 1984, Childress moved to [[Kempton, Illinois]] and established a publishing company named Adventures Unlimited Press,&lt;ref name=sula/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;World is a stage for David, Adventurer's exploits rival Indiana Jones', anon. staff, ''[[Daily Mirror of Sydney]]'', Australia, December 11, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; which is a sole proprietorship. His company published his own works and then those of other authors, presenting [[fringe science|fringe-scientific]] [[fringe theory|theories]] regarding [[ancient civilizations]], [[cryptozoology]], and little-known technologies.&lt;ref name=sula/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1992, Childress founded the ''World Explorers Club'', which occasionally runs tours to places he writes about, and publishes a magazine called ''World Explorer''.&lt;ref name=sula/&gt;

Childress has  appeared on [[NBC]] (''[[The Mysterious Origins of Man]]''), [[Fox Network]] (''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]]'' and ''[[Encounters (TV series)|Encounters]]''), [[Discovery Channel]], [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] (e.g. ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''), to comment on subjects such as the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[Atlantis]], and [[UFO]]s. Since first entering the industry in 1984, Childress has been involved in two lawsuits regarding publishing; one, concerning the [[Kennedy assassination]], failed after expiry of a [[statute of limitations]] and the other, involving an unpublished master's thesis about UFOs written in 1950, was settled out of court.&lt;ref name=sula/&gt; Childress writes humorously about these suits in his 2000 autobiography ''A Hitchhiker's Guide to Armageddon''. Childress has been interviewed on several radio programs.{{efn| name="RobMcConnell'07" | {{cite web |url=http://www.xzone-radio.com/november2007n.htm |title=Segment One |publisher=TalkStar Network |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2014-01-09}} }}

==Reception==

Patrick D. Nunn a Professor of Geography at the [[University of the Sunshine Coast]] has noted that Childress is a proponent of pseudoscientific claims such as the lost continent [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[megalith]]s on the Pacific islands built by [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]]. Nunn has written that "the disappearance of Mu is very convenient because it means that theorists like Childress can say what they like and appear convincing to people who are comparatively uninformed, as many naturally are, of the huge body of scientific information on Pacific geology and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, Patrick D. (2008). ''Vanished Islands And Hidden Continents Of The Pacific''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 123-124. {{ISBN|978-0824832193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical archaeologist Charles E. Orser (editor of ''[[International Journal of Historical Archaeology]]'') has criticized Childress's writings:

{{quote | 
Pseudo-archaeologists continue to perpetuate the idea that Atlantis was a racialized place. David Hatcher Childress, one of the most flagrant violators of basic archaeological reasoning, has provided perhaps the most outrageous racialized vision of Atlantis. In discussing [[Tiahuanaco]] in Bolivia—as a palace built long before any Native South Americans were present—Childress proposes that the majestic site could only have been constructed by the "Atlantean League." The league was composed of mythic seafarers who "sailed the world spreading a megalithic culture, and wore red turbans ''over their blond hair''" (Childress 1986: 139, emphasis added). Nowhere did [[Plato]], the only actual source on Atlantis, mention the blond hair of the Atlanteans. Plato did mention that the men and women of Atlantis, being semi-divine, were inherently good . . . The correlation between goodness and whiteness is thus obvious in Childress's formulation and in much else that has been written about Atlantis.

==Publications==
Childress's company has published nearly 200 books (many translated into foreign languages) over the course of two dozen years.  Childress himself has authored and co-authored over a dozen books, from his first in 1983 to his most recent in 2013.  Influences&lt;ref name="sula" /&gt; include [[Erich von Däniken]] and [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (as well as [[Charles Berlitz]]).

'''Diego María de Gardoqui y Arriquibar''' (born November 12, 1735, [[Bilbao]], Spain – d. 1798, Madrid, Spain) was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] politician and diplomat.

==Biography==
Diego de Gardoqui, the fourth of eight children, was the financial intermediary between the Spanish Court and the Colonies during the [[American Revolutionary War]], meeting with [[John Jay]] on various occasions. He was a [[Basques|Basque]] and a member of the wealthy [[Gardoqui]] family of Bilbao, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ballesteros-Gaibrois, ''El Vasco Diego de Gardoqui, Primer Embajador de España Ante Los Estados Unidos de América'', 305-18 ''en'' Euskal Herria y El Nuevo Mundo: La Contribución de los Vascos a la Formación de las Américas (Eds. Escobedo, Zaballa, y Álvarez, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  The mercantile business of "José de Gardoqui e Hijos" in Bilbao (of which Diego was one of three sons in a partnership with their father) supplied the patriots with 215 bronze cannon, 30,000 muskets, 30,000 bayonets, 51,314 musket balls, 300,000 pounds of powder, 12,868 grenades, 30,000 uniforms, and 4,000 field tents during the war. After the Revolution he became Spain's envoy to the United States. He arrived in New York in the Spring of 1785. In the summer of 1786, he and Jay, who was Secretary for Foreign Affairs under the Articles of Confederation, worked up a treaty in which the United States would receive a commercial treaty with Spain in exchange for giving up its claims to free navigation of the Mississippi. Although Jay backed the treaty, congress never ratified it.

Gardoqui continued as Spain's Minister to the United States until he returned to Bilbao in October, 1789. He attended [[George Washington|George Washington's]] inaugural address and pronounced it "an eloquent and appropriate address." In honor of the inauguration, Gardoqui decorated the front of his house on Broadway in New York City, near Bowling Green, "with two magnificent transparent gardens, adorned with statues, natural size, imitating marble.... There were also various flower-pots, different arches with foliage and columns of imitation marble, and on the sky of these gardens were placed thirteen stars, representing the United States of America—two of which stars showed opaque, to designate the two States which had not adopted the Constitution."

In the early years after the Revolutionary War when congress and the president resided in New York City, Gardoqui's house was also the meeting place of the first Catholic dignitaries representing their countries. There Mass was said for the congregation composed of such men as representatives of France, Spain, and Portugal, as well as Charles Carroll, his cousin Daniel, and Thomas Fitzsimmons, Catholic members of Congress, officers and soldiers of the foreign contingent, merchants and others. Diego de Gardoqui laid the cornerstone of St. Peter's, the first permanent structure for a Catholic church erected in the State of New York, on October 5, 1785. The church first opened on November 4, 1786.

Because Spain was in control of the [[Louisiana Territory]], Gardoqui worked to protect the King's interests on the Mississippi River. Various factions in Kentucky were frustrated with congress' refusal to allow them statehood. Gardoqui worked with John Brown and General James Wilkinson in 1788 to procure a treaty between Kentucky and Spain concerning navigation on the River. In the end, of course, Kentucky joined the United States and there was no separate treaty. Gardoqui also worked with Colonel George Morgan and Benjamin Harrison in 1788 and 1789. They had been attempting to buy land in Illinois from the United States government with no success. Morgan and Gardoqui worked out an agreement whereby {{convert|15000000|acre|km2}} west of the Mississippi, south from its junction with the Ohio, and north of the St. Francis River would be deeded to American settlers. Morgan was to be the commander of the colony, subject to the king of Spain. Settlers would have religious freedom and some degree of autonomy. The new colony was to be called "New Madrid." However, the Spanish governor at New Orleans, although somewhat in favor of the project, refused to allow self-government and required that all settlers be Catholic, and the settlement never saw fruition as a Spanish colony.

George Washington said of Gardoqui on August 10, 1790, "... no man in his most Catholic Majesty's dominions could be more acceptable to the Inhabitants of these States." Gardoqui gave Washington a four-volume edition in the original Spanish of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' as a present. The set of volumes still exists and is preserved at Washington's personal library, which opened as a museum on September 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tribes.tribe.net/midatlanticbasqueclub/thread/9575ac59-31d5-4c3a-814b-ba658c61f77b |title=Here I am. - Mid-Atlantic Basque Club - tribe.net |publisher=Tribes.tribe.net |date=2005-09-13 |accessdate=2016-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009160603/http://tribes.tribe.net/midatlanticbasqueclub/thread/9575ac59-31d5-4c3a-814b-ba658c61f77b |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/building-george-washingtons-dream/2013/09/27/e5886a20-26ec-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_gallery.html#photo=1 |title=Building George Washington’s dream |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Brígida Josefa de Orueta y Uriarte on December 6, 1765, in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Spain.

Gardoqui served under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings [[Charles III of Spain]] and [[Charles IV of Spain]].  Gardoqui, as a Spanish diplomat, operated under the ministry of [[José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca]]. He became Finance Minister in 1791, when Minister Pedro López de Lerena, Count of Lerena, suffered an important illness. Gardoqui was officially named Finance Minister after the death of Count de Lerena, in 1792.

Gardoqui was the Spanish counterparty to the [[Jay–Gardoqui Treaty]] of 1789, negotiated by John Jay of the United States, relating to the navigational rights of Spain in the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen de la Guardia Herrero, ''Hacia la creación de la Republica Federal.  España y los Estados Unidos: 1783–1789'', 27 ''[[Revista Complutense de Historia de América]]'' 35 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Gardoqui, in 1785–86, had arranged for a Spanish horse to be sent to Jay.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ballesteros-Gaibrois, ''De Un Caballo Para Ultramar'', 1 Correo Erudito 87 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Diego de Gardoqui to John Jay, Feb. 28, 1786, ''in'' United States Department of State, 6 The Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States of America: From the Treaty of Peace to the Adoption of the Present Constitution 141-44 (1833).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, Gardoqui laid the cornerstone of the first Catholic Church in New York City, [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's]] on Barclay Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.nps.gov/applications/tuma/Detail.cfm?Personal_ID=18848|title=Mission 2000 Database|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gardoqui returned to Spain in 1788, he was later succeeded in the United States by two diplomats, José de Jaudenes y Nebot and José Igancio de Viar (serving as chargés d'affaires to the U.S.), both of whom had served on Gardoqui's own staff during his 1785–1788 tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu:8090/xslt/servlet/ramanujan.XSLTServlet?xml=/vcdh/xml_docs/Dolley/Glossary.xml&amp;xsl=/vcdh/xml_docs/Dolley/glossary.xsl&amp;area=glossary Notes to Dolley Madison biography, University of Virginia.]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tributes to Gardoqui ==
[[Image:GardoquiPhilly.jpg|thumb|right|Philadelphia statue of Gardoqui by Luis Antonio Sanguino]]
There is a ''Calle Gardoqui'' in Bilbao, Spain, but this has been named after his brother, Cardinal Francisco Gardoqui (1747–1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/search/calle+gardoqui,+bilbao/@43.261816,-2.931869,16z?hl=en&amp;dg=dbrw&amp;newdg=1|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Constitución, Chile]] was originally named ''Nueva Bilbao de Gardoqui'' in his honor.

There was a World War II-era ship in the United States Navy, the {{USS|Guardoqui|IX-218}} that honored the [[Gardoqui]] family of Bilbao, Spain.  It, in turn, had been named for a U.S. ship, the USS ''Gardoqui'' (1898), that had seen action in the [[Spanish–American War]].

In 1977, the [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Spanish Crown]], in commemoration of the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] of the United States, presented a statue of Don Diego de Gardoqui, crafted by Spanish artist Luis Antonio Sanguino (b. 1934, Barcelona, Spain), to the City of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/1976.html King Juan Carlos I visited the United States between June 1–4, 1976.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The statue currently stands in [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Square]].

'''Edward VII''' (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841&amp;nbsp;– 6 May 1910) was [[King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]  and [[Emperor of India]] from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910.

The eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was [[heir apparent]] to the British throne and held the title of [[Prince of Wales]] for longer than any of his predecessors. He was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until before his marriage he renounced his right to the duchy, which then devolved to his younger brother [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]]. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.

As king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called "Peacemaker", but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Edward VII (1841 – 1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]
Edward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. He was christened ''Albert Edward'' at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 25 January 1842.{{efn|His godparents were [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|the King of Prussia]], his paternal step-grandmother [[Duchess Marie of Württemberg|the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (for whom [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]], his maternal grandmother, stood proxy), his great-uncle [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|the Duke of Cambridge]], his step-great-grandmother [[Princess Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel|the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]], his great-aunt, stood proxy), his great-aunt [[Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Sophia]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge]], his first cousin once-removed, stood proxy) and his great-uncle [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20065|date=28 January 1842|page=224}})&lt;/ref&gt;}} He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]. He was known as ''Bertie'' to the royal family throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bentley-Cranch|first=Dana|title=Edward VII: Image of an Era 1841–1910|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|year=1992|isbn=978-0-11-290508-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the eldest son of the British sovereign, he was automatically [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of [[Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Ernestine duchies|Duke of Saxony]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] on 8 December 1841, [[Earl of Dublin]] on 10 September 1849&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21018|pages=2783|date=11 September 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 17 January 1850,&lt;ref name=weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; a [[Knight of the Garter]] on 9 November 1858, and a [[Knight of the Thistle]] on 24 May 1867.&lt;ref name=weir&gt;{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised Edition|publisher=Random House|location=London|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7126-7448-5|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in favour of his younger brother, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste|Van der Kiste, John]] (September 2004; online edition May 2007) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/346 "Alfred, Prince, duke of Edinburgh (1844–1900)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/346}}, retrieved 24 June 2009 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model [[constitutional monarch]]. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], Edward did not excel in his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ridley|first=Jane|year=2012|title=Bertie: A Life of Edward VII|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|isbn=978-0-7011-7614-3|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—[[Benjamin Disraeli]] described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, [[Robert Bruce (1813–1862)|Robert Bruce]].

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, he spent the summer of that year studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]] under, among others, the chemist [[Lyon Playfair]]. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H.

==Early adulthood==
[[File:H.R.H. Prince of Wales and Suite at Point View, Niagara.jpg|thumb|right|Edward at [[Niagara Falls]], 1860]]
In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident ''[[wiktionary:bonhomie|bonhomie]]'' made the tour a great success.&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 20–34&lt;/ref&gt; He inaugurated the [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal]], across the [[St Lawrence River]], and laid the cornerstone of [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]. He watched [[Charles Blondin]] traverse [[Niagara Falls]] by highwire, and stayed for three days with President [[James Buchanan]] at the [[White House]]. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to [[Mount Vernon]], to pay his respects at the tomb of [[George Washington]]. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]. Prayers for the royal family were said in [[Trinity Church, New York]], for the first time since 1776.&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, pp. 39–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward had hoped to pursue a career in the [[British Army]], but his mother vetoed an active military career.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22198|page=4745|date=9 November 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], the eldest daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|Prince Christian of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Prussia]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt;

From this time, Edward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, [[Nellie Clifden]], who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at [[Cambridge]] to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed Edward for his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 59–63&lt;/ref&gt; At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, "I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Middlemas|first=Keith|editor=[[Antonia Fraser]]|title=The Life and Times of Edward VII|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1972|page=31|isbn=978-0-297-83189-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Once widowed, Queen Victoria effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert's death, the queen arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting [[Egypt]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Beirut]] and [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Government]] wanted Edward to secure the friendship of Egypt's ruler, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said Pasha]], to prevent French control of the [[Suez Canal]] if the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed. It was the first [[royal tour]] on which an official photographer, [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]], was in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2279609/Banished-Holy-Land-notorious-sex-scandal-future-Edvard-VII-spent-days-smoking-shooting-crocodiles-drinking-coffee--returning-home-tattoo.html|title=The first EVER photographs of a Royal tour|author=Ridley, Jane|publisher=Mail Online|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at [[Laeken]] in Belgium on 9 September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 44; Ridley, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Edward married [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 10 March 1863. He was 21; she was 18.
[[File:Wedding of Albert Edward Prince of Wales and Alexandra of Denmark 1863.jpg|thumb|left|Edward and Alexandra on their wedding day, 1863]]
The couple established [[Marlborough House]] as their London residence and [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 35; Ridley, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 85, 87, 93, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward had mistresses throughout his married life. He socialised with actress [[Lillie Langtry]]; [[Lady Randolph Churchill]];{{efn|Letters written by Edward to Lady Randolph may have "signified no more than a flirtation" but were "[w]ritten in a strain of undue familiarity".&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]; actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]]; noblewoman [[Lady Susan Vane-Tempest]]; singer [[Hortense Schneider]]; prostitute Giulia Beneni (known as "La Barucci"); wealthy humanitarian [[Agnes Keyser]]; and [[Alice Keppel]]. At least fifty-five liaisons are conjectured.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Camp|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony J. Camp|title=Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction, 1714–1936|year=2007}}. They are listed at http://anthonyjcamp.com/page9.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; How far these relationships went is not always clear. Edward always strove to be discreet, but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 74–80&lt;/ref&gt; Keppel's great-granddaughter, [[Camilla Parker Bowles]], became the mistress and subsequent wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], Edward's great-great-grandson. It was rumoured that Camilla's grandmother, Sonia Keppel, was fathered by Edward, but she was "almost certainly" the daughter of [[George Keppel (British Army officer, born 1865)|George Keppel]], whom she resembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Diana|last=Souhami|title=Mrs Keppel and Her Daughter|location=London|publisher=HarpurCollins|year=1996|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Mike|last=Ashley|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|publisher=Robinson|location=London|year=1998|pages=694–695|isbn=978-1-84119-096-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra was aware of his affairs, even befriending several of his lady friends.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, [[Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th Baronet|Sir Charles Mordaunt]], a British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]], threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heir apparent==
During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as we understand them today—for example, opening the [[Thames Embankment]] in 1871, the [[Mersey Railway|Mersey Tunnel]] in 1886, and [[Tower Bridge]] in 1894&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;—but his mother did not allow Edward an active role in the running of the country until 1898.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.royal.uk/edward-vii-r1901-1910|title=Edward VII|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=18 April 2016|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] sent him papers secretly.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; From 1886, [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] papers were opened to him.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain was given a boost when the French Emperor, [[Napoleon III]], was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[French Third Republic]] was declared.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 66; Ridley, pp. 137, 142&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the winter of 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Public celebrations included the composition of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[Festival Te Deum]]. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 67 and Middlemas, pp. 48–52&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edward, Prince of Wales, with elephant, Terai cph.3b08927.jpg|thumb|right|Edward (front centre) in India, 1876]]

On 26 September 1875, Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour; on the way, he visited Malta, [[Brindisi]] and Greece. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of the treatment of the native Indians by the British officials: "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute."&lt;ref&gt;Edward to [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]], 30 November 1875, quoted in Bentley-Cranch, pp. 101–102 and Ridley, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the [[Secretary of State for India]], issued new guidance and at least one [[Resident (title)|resident]] was removed from office.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He returned to England on 11 May 1876, after stopping off at Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Itinerary of the Imperial Tour 1875–1876|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/386134.html|website=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour's success.&lt;ref name=bc104&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bergner Hurlock|first=Elizabeth|title=The psychology of dress: an analysis of fashion and its motive|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1976|isbn=978-0-405-08644-1|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mansel|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Mansel|title=Dressed to Rule|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=138|year=2005|isbn=978-0-300-10697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made wearing [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], [[Homburg hat]]s and [[Norfolk jacket]]s fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of [[white tie]] and tails.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases,&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by [[Charvet Place Vendôme#International recognition|Charvet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=OW18981103.2.164|title=Try our "98' Curzons!"

He got them originally about eight years ago from a manufacturer called [[Charvet Place Vendôme|Charvet]], in Paris.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of [[Trinity House]] with a [[Privy Council]]lor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; His waist measured 48&amp;nbsp;inches (122&amp;nbsp;cm) shortly before his coronation.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 200 and Hattersley, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and [[yorkshire pudding]] on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for [[Sunday lunch]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the [[Royal College of Music]]. He opened the college in 1883 with the words, "Class can no longer stand apart from class&amp;nbsp;... I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote."&lt;ref name=bc104/&gt; At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting. This so-called tradition of [[Sandringham Time]] continued until 1936, when it was abolished by [[Edward VIII]].&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{citation|last=Windsor|first=HRH The Duke of|authorlink=Edward VIII|title=A King's Story|publisher=Cassell and Co|location=London|year=1951|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also laid out a golf course at Windsor. By the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse [[Persimmon (horse)|Persimmon]] won both the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] and the [[St Leger Stakes]]. In 1900, Persimmon's brother, [[Diamond Jubilee (horse)|Diamond Jubilee]], won five races (Derby, St Leger, [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]], [[Newmarket Stakes]] and [[Eclipse Stakes]])&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and another of Edward's horses, Ambush II, won the [[Grand National]].&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 Edward was embroiled in the [[royal baccarat scandal]], when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year. The Prince was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the participants unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, pp. 23–25; Ridley, pp. 280–290&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Edward was involved in a personal conflict, when [[Lord Charles Beresford]] threatened to reveal details of Edward's private life to the press, as a protest against Edward interfering with Beresford's affair with [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]. The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged, and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 86; Ridley, pp. 265–268&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and "after he had let himself go&amp;nbsp;... [he would] smooth matters by being especially nice".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby]], quoted in Middlemas, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1891, Edward's eldest son, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Albert Victor]], was engaged to [[Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]]. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, "[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine".&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with "the tears rolling down his cheeks".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Mrs Elise Stonor to Queen Victoria, 11 April 1871, quoted in Battiscombe, p. 112 and Ridley, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900, Edward was the victim of an attempted assassination when fifteen-year-old [[Jean-Baptiste Sipido]] shot at him in protest over the [[Second Boer War]]. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the [[Congo Free State|Congo]], worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accession==
When Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India and, in an innovation, King of the [[British Dominions]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, p. 7; Middlemas, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to reign under the name Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward—the name his mother had intended for him to use{{efn|No English or British sovereign has ever reigned under a double name.}}—declaring that he did not wish to "undervalue the name of Albert" and diminish the status of his father with whom the "name should stand alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27270|date=23 January 1901|page=547|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numeral VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the [[Church of Scotland|national church]], in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had "been excluded from Scotland by battle".&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; [[J. B. Priestley]] recalled, "I was only a child when he succeeded Victoria in 1901, but I can testify to his extraordinary popularity. He was in fact the most popular king England had known since the earlier 1660s."&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edward VII (Puck magazine).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, 1901]]
He donated his parents' house, [[Osborne House|Osborne]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], to the state and continued to live at Sandringham.&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Francis Knollys]], claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir [[Dighton Probyn]], [[Comptroller of the Household]], and had benefited from advice from Edward's Jewish financier friends, such as [[Ernest Cassel]], [[Maurice de Hirsch]] and the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 38, 84, 96; Priestley, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; At a time of widespread [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Allfrey|first=Anthony|title=King Edward VII and His Jewish Court|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=1991|isbn=978-0-297-81125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 63–64; Ridley, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra|Edward's coronation]] had originally been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, he was diagnosed with [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref name=Lee102&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 102–109&lt;/ref&gt; Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in [[anaesthesia]] and [[antisepsis]] in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible.&lt;ref name="app"&gt;{{citation|author1=Mirilas, P. |author2=Skandalakis, J.E. |year=2003|title=Not just an appendix: Sir Frederick Treves|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=88|pages=549–552|doi=10.1136/adc.88.6.549|pmid=12765932|issue=6|pmc=1763108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], with the support of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lord Lister]], performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected [[abscess]] through a small incision (through {{frac|4|1|2}}-inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar.&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which the King had arranged before the operation)&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream.&lt;ref name="app"/&gt; Edward was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Frederick Temple]], who died only four months later.&lt;ref name=Lee102/&gt;

Edward refurbished the royal palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]], that his mother had forgone, and founded new [[Order (honour)|honours]], such as the [[Order of Merit]], to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 122–139; Ridley, pp. 351–352, 361, 372&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the Shah of Persia, [[Mozzafar-al-Din]], visited England expecting to receive the [[Order of the Garter]]. Edward refused to bestow the honour on the Shah because the order was meant to be in his personal gift and the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], had promised it without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian [[order of chivalry]]. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, p. 157; Middlemas, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Uncle of Europe"==
[[File:EdwardVII at Balmoral.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward VII relaxing at [[Balmoral Castle]], photographed by his wife, Alexandra]]
As king, Edward's main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Matthew|last=Glencross|title=The State Visits of Edward VII: Reinventing Royal Diplomacy for the Twentieth Century|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-54898-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took annual holidays in [[Biarritz]] and [[Mariánské Lázně|Marienbad]].&lt;ref name="duke" /&gt; One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President [[Émile Loubet]]. Following a visit to [[Pope Leo XIII]] in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French [[Entente Cordiale]], an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated in 1904 between the French foreign minister, [[Théophile Delcassé]], and the British foreign secretary, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. It marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's [[splendid isolation]] from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the [[German Empire]] and its ally, [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nicolson, Harold|authorlink=Harold Nicolson|date=October 1954|title=The Origins and Development of the Anglo-French Entente|journal=International Affairs |volume=30|issue=4|pages=407–416|doi=10.2307/2608720|jstor=2608720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was related to nearly every other European monarch, and came to be known as the "uncle of Europe".&lt;ref name="royal" /&gt; [[German Emperor Wilhelm II]] and [[Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]] were his nephews; [[Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain]], [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], [[Crown Princess Marie of Romania]], [[Crown Princess Sophia of Greece]], and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra of Russia]] were his nieces; [[King Haakon VII of Norway]] was both his nephew and his son-in-law; kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]] were his brothers-in-law; kings [[Albert I of Belgium]], [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], and [[Charles I of Portugal|Charles I]] and [[Manuel II of Portugal]] were his second cousins. Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses.&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II. Edward's difficult relationship with his nephew exacerbated the tensions between Germany and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 60–61, 172–175; Hattersley, pp. 460–464; Ridley, pp. 382–384, 433&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1908, during Edward's annual stay at Biarritz, he accepted the resignation of British Prime Minister Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, [[H. H. Asquith]], to travel to Biarritz to [[kiss hands]]. Asquith complied, but the press criticised the action of the King in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 581–582; Ridley, pp. 417–418&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1908, Edward became the first reigning British monarch to visit the [[Russian Empire]], despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the [[Dogger Bank incident]], and the Tsar's dissolution of the [[Duma]].&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The previous month, Edward visited the Scandinavian countries, becoming the first British monarch to visit Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opinions==
[[File:King Edward VII Vanity Fair 19 June 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Edward depicted in naval uniform by ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine, 1902]]
While Prince of Wales, Edward had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for [[W. E. Gladstone]]'s [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Representation of the People Bill (1884)]] in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; On other matters he was less progressive: he did not, for example, favour giving [[Women's suffrage|votes to women]],&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, pp. 215–216; Lee, vol. II, p. 468; Ridley, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; although he did suggest that the social reformer [[Octavia Hill]] serve on the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885#Background|Commission for Working Class Housing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; He was also opposed to [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], instead preferring a form of [[dual monarchy]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

As Prince of Wales, he had come to enjoy warm and mutually respectful relations with Gladstone, whom his mother detested.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; But the statesman's son, [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Gladstone]], angered the King by planning to permit Roman Catholic priests in vestments to carry the Host through the streets of London, and by appointing two ladies, [[Lady Frances Balfour]] and Mrs [[Harold Tennant|H. J. Tennant]], to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law – Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with "delicacy or even decency" before ladies. Edward's biographer [[Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|Philip Magnus]] suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him [[Governor-General of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 91–93; Ridley, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Force]], and the decision to provide an [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]] supporting France in the event of war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 130–134&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57003-492-3}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=978-0-333-72126-1|pages=88–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, pp. 134–139&lt;/ref&gt; The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word "[[nigger]]" was "disgraceful", despite it then being in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, during an Anglo-German summit in [[Kiel]] between Wilhelm II and Edward, Wilhelm with the Russo-Japanese War in mind started to go on about the "[[Yellow Peril]]", which he called "the greatest peril menacing&amp;nbsp;... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in [[Moscow]] and [[Poznan|Posen]]".&lt;ref name=macdonogh&gt;{{citation|last=MacDonogh|first=Giles|title=The Last Kaiser|location=New York|publisher=St Martin's Press|year=2003|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm went on to attack his British guests for supporting Japan against Russia, suggesting that the British were committing "race treason". In response, Edward stated that he "could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin".&lt;ref name=macdonogh/&gt;

Edward lived a life of luxury that was often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects. However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Constitutional crisis==

[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], 1902]]
In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the "[[People's Budget]]" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]. The crisis eventually led—after Edward's death—to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.

The King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 276–277; Ridley, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt; Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare—although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886—that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as "the last King of England".&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; After the King's horse [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]] won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: "Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!"&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 526&lt;/ref&gt;

In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish Church Act 1869|Irish disestablishment in 1869]] and the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act in 1884]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440–441&lt;/ref&gt; On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 281–282&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered "outrageous" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of "guarantees" and Asquith of "safeguards" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.&lt;ref name="Heffer, pp. 286–288"&gt;Heffer, pp. 286–288&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.&lt;ref name="Magnus, p. 547"&gt;Magnus, p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

The election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.&lt;ref name="Magnus, p. 547"/&gt; Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no "guarantees" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 290–293&lt;/ref&gt;

The King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase "in the opinion of my advisers" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the 1911 [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four&lt;ref name="Heffer, pp. 286–288"/&gt;). But in that debate Asquith hinted – to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs – that he would ask the King to break the deadlock "in that Parliament" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

By April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal "simply disgusting" and that the government was "in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] &amp; Co". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal "ministerial advice" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their "advice".&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, pp. 294–296&lt;/ref&gt; Esher's view has been called "obsolete and unhelpful".&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, pp. 555–556&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:King Edward VII on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace in 1910 Wellcome V0042567.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Edward on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace by Sir Luke Fildes, 1910]]
[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of King Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]
Edward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a [[rodent ulcer]], a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with [[radium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, p. 676; Ridley, p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1910, he was staying at [[Biarritz]] when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], in [[Corfu]] a week later on 5 May.

The following day, the King suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed, saying, "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end."&lt;ref name="p151"&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be [[King George V]]) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]] that afternoon. The King replied, "Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad": his [[final words]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.&lt;ref name="p151" /&gt;

Alexandra refused to allow the King's body to be moved for eight days afterwards, though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May, the late King was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin, which was moved on 14 May to the throne room, where it was sealed and lay in state, with four guardsmen standing at each corner of the bier. Despite the time that had elapsed since his death, Alexandra noted the King's body remained "wonderfully preserved".&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 560–561&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 17 May, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to [[Westminster Hall]], with the new King and his family walking behind. Following a brief service, the royal family left, and the hall was opened to the public; over 400,000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 563–565&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Barbara Tuchman]] noted in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Funeral of King Edward VII|his funeral]], held on 20 May 1910, marked "the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last." A royal train conveyed the King's coffin from London to Windsor Castle, where Edward VII was buried at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was surpassed by his great-great-grandson [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] on 20 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13133587|title=Prince Charles becomes longest-serving heir apparent|publisher=BBC News|date=20 April 2011|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title Prince of Wales is not automatically held by the heir apparent; it is bestowed by the reigning monarch at a time of his or her choosing.&lt;ref name=clarence&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/previous-princes-of-wales|title=Previous Princes of Wales|publisher=Clarence House|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was the longest-serving holder of that title until surpassed by Charles on 9 September 2017; Edward was Prince of Wales between 8 December 1841 and 22 January 1901 (59 years, 45 days). Charles was created Prince of Wales on 26 July 1958 ({{Age in years and days|1958|07|26}} ago).&lt;ref name=clarence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Richardson, Matt|year=2001|title=The Royal Book of Lists|page=56|location=Toronto|publisher=Dundurn Press|isbn=978-0-88882-238-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Bryan|first1=Nicola|title=Prince Charles is longest-serving Prince of Wales|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41179772|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As king, Edward VII proved a greater success than anyone had expected,&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 349, 473, 476&lt;/ref&gt; but he was already past the average life expectancy and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his "best friend and the best of fathers&amp;nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".&lt;ref&gt;King George V's diary, 6 May 1910. Royal Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional British sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; Though lauded as "Peacemaker",&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 157; Lee, vol. II, p. 738&lt;/ref&gt; he had been afraid his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, would tip Europe into war.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, vol. II, pp. 358, 650, 664; Middlemas, pp. 176, 179; Ridley, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 482–483&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 494–495&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[R. C. K. Ensor]], writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:
:he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted important influence on British foreign policy. Ensor believed Edward gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts, but surviving documents paint a different picture of "how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what naïve indiscretions he was capable."&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, pp. 567–569&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson [[Edward VIII]] wrote, "his lighter side&amp;nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence."&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty", wrote J. B. Priestley.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Esher wrote that Edward was "kind and debonair and not undignified – but too human".&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Emma Bartoniek was born in [[Budapest]] as the daughter of physician and educator Géza Bartoniek and Ilona Szumrák. Her brother Emil Bartoniek became a physician and instructor. He died fighting in [[World War I]].

Bartoniek got a Master of Arts degree at [[Budapest University]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nevpont.hu/view/2489|title=Bartoniek Emma|last=|first=|date=|website=Névpont|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Between 1916-1934 Emma Bartoniek was an apprentice and libararian at the [[National Széchényi Library]], meanwhile she was also the guest researcher of the Hungarian Historical Institute at [[Vienna]] between 1925-1926.

After her apprenticeship, she was the manager of the Library's manuscripts collection from 1934. She was dismissed from her job in 1945. Bartoniek was the committee member of the [[Hungarian Historical Society]] from 1933 and the Hungarian Armorial and Genealogical Association from 1935.

Emma Bartoniek worked on the history of royal coronations between 895 and 907, examined the problems of the 10-13th century Hungarian succession. Her ascertainments about the first Hungarian laws and legends from the age of Árpád are particularly valuable. Bartoniek published the catalogue of the National Széchényi Library's Latin codices. Her work about the Hungarian historiography remained in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcanum.hu/en/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-magyar-eletrajzi-lexikon-7428D/b-74700/bartoniek-emma-74990/|title=Bartoniek Emma|last=|first=|date=|website=Arcanum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5457">'''Flavius Eutropius''' was an [[Ancient Roman]] historian who [[floruit|flourished]] in the latter half of the 4th century AD. 

Eutropius held the office of secretary (''magister memoriae'') at [[Constantinople]], accompanied the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (361–363) on his [[Julian's Persian expedition|expedition]] against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] (363), and was alive during the reign of [[Valens]] (364–378), to whom he dedicates his ''Breviarium historiae Romanae'' and where his history ends.{{sfn|Lieu|1998|page=77}} Possibly he held higher state offices in later years, becoming [[Praetorian prefect]] for Illyria in 380 and - together with emperor [[Valentinian II]] - consul in 387. However, it is a question of academic discussion whether the Eutropius holding these offices is really to be identified with the historian.&lt;ref&gt;For Eutropius's career, cf. Bird, p. VII et sqq.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lieu|1998|page=77}}

Eutropius reportedly hailed from [[Bordeaux]], and was almost certainly a [[Roman paganism|pagan]], which he remained even under emperor Julian's successors.{{sfn|Lieu|1998|page=77}}

The ''Breviarium historiae Romanae'' is a complete compendium, in ten chapters, of [[Roman history]] from the [[Foundation of Rome|foundation of the city]] to the accession of Valens. It was compiled with considerable care from the best accessible authorities, and is written generally with impartiality, and in a clear and simple style. It was much used by other Roman chroniclers.{{sfn|Lieu|1998|page=77}} Although the Latin in some instances differs from that of the purest models, the work was for a long time a favorite elementary school-book. Its independent value is small, but it sometimes fills a gap left by the more authoritative records. For the Republican period, Eutropius depended upon an [[epitome of Livy|epitome]] of [[Livy]]; for the later parts, he appears to have used [[Suetonius]] and the now lost ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]''. For the end he could also make use of  his own personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;For Eutropius's sources, cf. Bird, p. XLIV et sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Breviarium'' was enlarged and continued down to the time of Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian the Great]] by [[Paulus Diaconus]]; the work of the latter was in turn enlarged by [[Landolfus Sagax]] (c. 1000), and taken down to the time of the emperor [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo the Armenian]] (813–820) in the ''Historia Miscella''.

Of the Greek translations by [[Paeanius]] (around 380){{sfn|Lieu|1998|page=77}} and [[Capito Lycius]] (6th century), the version of the former is extant in an almost complete state. The best edition of Eutropius is by H. Droysen (1879), containing the Greek version and the enlarged editions of Paulus Diaconus and Landolfus. There are also numerous English editions and translations.

'''Sir Geoffrey Rudolph Elton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born '''Gottfried Rudolf Otto Ehrenberg'''; 17 August 1921 – 4 December 1994) was a German-born British political and constitutional historian, specialising in the [[Tudor period]]. He taught at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and was the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] there from 1983 to 1988.

== Early life ==
Ehrenberg (Elton) was born in [[Tübingen]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. His parents were the Jewish scholars [[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Victor Ehrenberg]] and Eva Dorothea Sommer.&lt;ref name="H-W"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes-Warrington |first=Marine |title=Fifty Key Thinkers on History |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} In 1929, the Ehrenbergs moved to [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. In February 1939, the Ehrenbergs fled to Britain. Ehrenberg continued his education at [[Rydal Penrhos|Rydal School]], a Methodist school in Wales, starting in 1939.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}} After only two years, Ehrenberg was working as a teacher at Rydal and achieved the position of assistant master in mathematics, history and German.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

There, he took courses via correspondence at the [[University of London]] and graduated with a degree in Ancient History in 1943.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}} Ehrenberg enlisted in the [[British Army]] in 1943. He spent his time in the Army in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and the [[East Surrey Regiment]], serving with the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] in Italy from 1944 to 1946 and reaching the rank of [[sergeant]].&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}} During this period, Ehrenberg anglicised his name to Geoffrey Rudolph Elton.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}} After his discharge from the army, Elton studied early modern history at [[University College London]], graduating with a PhD in 1949.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Under the supervision of [[J. E. Neale]], Elton was awarded a PhD for his thesis "Thomas Cromwell, Aspects of his Administrative Work", in which Elton first developed the ideas that he was to pursue for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79}} Elton naturalised as a British subject in September 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38100 |date=17 October 1947 |page=4890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Elton taught at the [[University of Glasgow]] and from 1949 onwards at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and was the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] there from 1983 to 1988. Pupils included [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], [[Susan Brigden]] and [[David Starkey]]. He worked as publication secretary of the [[British Academy]] from 1981 to 1990 and served as the president of the [[Royal Historical Society]] from 1972 to 1976. Elton was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1986 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50361 |date=30 December 1985 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'' ===
Elton focused primarily on the life of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] but also made significant contributions to the study of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Elton was most famous for arguing in his 1953 book ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'' that [[Thomas Cromwell]] was the author of modern, bureaucratic government which replaced medieval, household-based government.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|79–80}} Until the 1950s, historians had downplayed Cromwell's role by calling him a doctrinaire hack who was little more than the agent of the despotic Henry VIII. Elton, however, made Cromwell the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government. Elton portrayed Cromwell as the presiding genius, much more so than the King, in handling the break with Rome and the laws and administrative procedures that made the English Reformation so important. Elton says that Cromwell was responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms by creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of church lands and thoroughly removing the medieval features of the central government.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kenyon |first=John |title=The History Men |year=1983 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That change took place in the 1530s and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. In essence, Elton was arguing that before Cromwell, the realm could be viewed as the King's private estate writ large and that most administration was done by the King's household servants rather than by separate state offices. Cromwell, Henry's chief minister from 1532 to 1540, introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King's household from the state and created a modern bureaucratic government.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|80}} Elton shone Tudor light into the darker corners of the Realm and radically altered the role of Parliament and the competence of Statute. Elton argued that by masterminding such reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England's future stability and success.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J. Slavin, "G.R. Elton and His Era: Thirty Years On." ''Albion'' 15#3 (1983): 207-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Elton elborated on his ideas in his 1955 work, the bestselling ''England under the Tudors'', which went through three editions, and his Wiles Lectures, which he published in 1973 as ''Reform and Renewal: Thomas Cromwell and the Common Weal''.&lt;ref name="H-W"/&gt;{{rp|80}}

His thesis has been widely challenged by younger Tudor historians and can no longer be regarded as an orthodoxy, but his contribution to the debate has profoundly influenced subsequent discussion of Tudor government, particularly on the role of Cromwell.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"/&gt;

=== Historical perspective ===

Elton was a staunch admirer of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. He was also a fierce critic of [[Marxist historiography|Marxist]] historians, who he argued were presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.&lt;ref&gt;See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Elton was also famous for his role in the [[Edward Hallett Carr|Carr]]–Elton debate when he defended the nineteenth century interpretation of empirical, 'scientific' history most famously associated with [[Leopold von Ranke]] against [[E. H. Carr]]'s views. Elton wrote his 1967 book ''[[The Practice of History]]'' largely in response to Carr's 1961 book ''[[What is History?]].''

Elton was a strong defender of the traditional methods of history and was appalled by [[postmodernism]], saying, for example,: '...&amp;nbsp;we are fighting for the lives of innocent young people beset by devilish tempters who claim to offer higher forms of thought and deeper truths and insights – the intellectual equivalent of crack, in fact. Any acceptance of these theories – even the most gentle or modest bow in their direction – can prove fatal.'&lt;ref&gt;Ó Tuathaigh, M. A. G., ‘Irish Historical “Revisionism”: State of the Art of Ideological Project?’ in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-pupils of his such as [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] claim he did embody a "revisionist streak," reflected both in his work on Cromwell, his attack on John Neale's traditionalist account of Elizabeth I's parliaments, and in his support for a more contingent and political set of causes for the English Civil War of the mid-seventeenth century.

Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. For instance, his 1963 book ''Reformation Europe'' is in large part concerned with the duel between [[Martin Luther]] and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Elton objected to cross-disciplinary efforts such as efforts to combine history with [[anthropology]] or sociology. He saw political history as the best and most important kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].

== Family ==
Elton was the brother of the education researcher [[Lewis Elton]] and the uncle of Lewis's son, the comedian and writer [[Ben Elton]]. He married a fellow historian, Sheila Lambert, in 1952. Elton died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge on 4 December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |date=17 December 1994 |title=Sir Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, 73, Tudor Historian at Cambridge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/obituaries/sir-geoffrey-rudolph-elton-73-tudor-historian-at-cambridge.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in 1717 and received his education at [[Catharine Hall, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1736 and M.A. in 1740, by the latter date having become a member of [[King's College, Cambridge]]. In 1740 he was presented to the rectory of [[Elveden]], and in 1751 to that of [[Herringswell]], both in [[Suffolk]], holding both livings for the rest of his life. Burton took pupils, and generally had three or four boarding in his house for instruction.

In London on 9 July 1743 he married Anna Reeve,&lt;ref&gt;London Metropolitan Archives, St George the Martyr, Queen Square, Holborn, Composite register: baptisms Sep 1723 - Dec 1796, marriages Dec 1706 - Feb 1754, P82/GEO2/001 at https://ancestry.co.uk/ (subscription required) Retrieved 10 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of the steward of the Burton Lazars estate, John Reeve of [[Melton Mowbray]], and his wife Joanna Hawley. No children are known. Anne's brother William Reeve, a lawyer in Melton Mowbray, acquired by marriage [[Leadenham House]] and its estate.

He died at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on 3 November 1791, and was buried in the church of [[Walcot, Bath|Walcot]].

==Works==
He published:
* 'An Essay towards reconciling the Numbers of Daniel and St. John, determining the Birth of our Saviour, and fixing a precise time for the continuance of the present Desolation of the Jews; with some conjectures and calculations pointing out the year 1764 to have been one of the most remarkable epochas in history,' Norwich, 1766.

==Reputation==
The Reverend [[George Ashby (antiquary)|George Ashby]] considered him a person of great industry in  chronology, but added: 'I could never perceive what his principles or foundations were, though I have attended in hopes of learning them.' He was, however, a friend of the Reverend [[William Stukeley]], the famous antiquarian, who made him a present of [[The Description of Britain]], the ingenious forgery by [[Charles Bertram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4817">Fray '''Gerónimo de Mendieta''' (1525–1604), alternatively '''Jerónimo de Mendieta''', was a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] missionary and historian, who spent most of his life in the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Empire's]] new possessions in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].

His main work is the ''Historia eclesiástica indiana'', written in the late sixteenth century, but not published until 1870 by [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]], which recounts the history of Franciscan evangelization in the colony of [[New Spain]] in [[the Americas]] and abuses of the indigenous by Spanish civil society.

== Biography==
Gerónimo de Mendieta was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[Álava]], in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]] of ([[Spain]]), in 1525. When he was twenty years old he entered the [[Franciscan order]] in [[Bilbao]]. In 1554 he traveled to [[New Spain]] to live in [[Tochimilco (municipality)|Tochimilco]] where he was taught the local [[Nahuatl]] language. He was later moved to [[Tlaxcala]] where he became a friend of fellow Franciscan [[Toribio de Benavente|Toribio de Benavente "Motolinia"]].&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 1980:131-33&lt;/ref&gt; "Mendieta learned Nahuatl from Motolinia," and Motolina's optimism about indigenous conversion influenced Mendieta.&lt;ref&gt;Viviana Díaz Balsera, ''The Pyramid under the Cross'', Tucson: University of Arizona Press 2005, p. 241, fn. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the [[Iberian peninsula]] in 1570, bringing with him the first copies of the works of [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] to the Spanish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 1980:133&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to [[Mexico]] again in 1573, this time never to return to Europe. He returned under order to compose a history of the work of evangelizing the Americas. From his return to Mexico until 1597 he lived in the monastery of [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]], working on the history that would make him famous,&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 1980:135&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Historia eclesiástica indiana'', a chronicle of the early evangelization history of the New World. The publication of the work was prohibited, as it was deemed to contain "unsound," [[millenarian]], [[Joachimite]] ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 1980:189-191&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only published for the first time in 1870, when it was brought to light by [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].

{{History of England}}
The '''Glorious Revolution''', also called the '''Revolution of 1688''', was the overthrow of King [[James II of England]] (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English [[Parliamentarianism|Parliamentarians]] with the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[stadtholder]] William III, [[Prince of Orange]], who was James's nephew and son-in-law.  William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension to the throne as [[William III of England]] jointly with his wife, [[Mary II]], James's daughter, after the [[Declaration of Right]], leading to the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].

King James's policies of [[religious tolerance]] after 1685 met with increasing opposition from members of leading political circles, who were troubled by the King's [[Catholicism]] and his close ties with France. The crisis facing the King came to a head in 1688, with the birth of his son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], on 10 June (Julian calendar).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; This changed the existing [[line of succession]] by displacing the [[heir presumptive]] (his 26-year-old daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange) with young James as [[heir apparent]]. The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely. Some [[Tory]] members of parliament worked with members of the opposition [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] in an attempt to resolve the crisis by secretly initiating dialogue with William of Orange to come to England, outside the jurisdiction of the English Parliament.{{sfn|Coward|1980|pp=298–302}} Stadtholder William, the de facto head of state of the [[Dutch United Provinces]], feared a Catholic Anglo–French alliance and had already been planning a military intervention in England.

After consolidating political and financial support, William crossed the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] with a large invasion fleet in November 1688, landing at [[Torbay]]. After only two minor clashes between the two opposing armies in England, and [[anti-Catholic riots]] in several towns, James's regime collapsed, largely because of a lack of resolve shown by the king. This was followed, however, by the protracted [[Williamite War in Ireland]] and [[Dundee's rising]] in Scotland.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;England, Scotland, and Ireland at the time shared a king but were still theoretically separate realms with their own parliaments. In practice, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] had been completely under the control of Westminster since [[Poynings' Law]] of 1494, but Scotland still had a degree of independence.&lt;/ref&gt; In England's distant American colonies, the revolution led to the collapse of the [[Dominion of New England]] and the overthrow of the [[Province of Maryland]]'s government. Following a defeat of his forces at the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]] on 9 December, James and his wife [[Mary of Modena|Mary]] fled England; James, however, returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops, William in February 1689 ([[New Style]] Julian calendar)&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; convinced a newly chosen [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to make him and his wife [[joint monarchs]].

The Revolution permanently ended any chance of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: For over a century Catholics were denied the right to vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament; they were also denied [[Officer (armed forces)|commissions]] in the [[History of the British Army#Origins|army]], and the monarch was [[Act of Settlement 1701|forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic]], this latter prohibition remaining in force [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|until 2015]]. The Revolution led to limited tolerance for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some time before they had full [[political rights]]. It has been argued, mainly by [[Whig historians]], that James's overthrow began modern English [[parliamentary democracy]]: the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] has become one of the most important documents in the [[political history]] of Britain and never since has the monarch held [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] power.

Internationally, the Revolution was related to the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] on [[mainland Europe]]. It has been seen as the last successful invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvnb|Israel|199its preejdj1|p=105}}; see also {{harvnb|Israel|Parker|1991|pp=335–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended all attempts by England in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century to subdue the [[Dutch Republic]] by military force.  The resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies, however, shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England and later to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].

The expression "Glorious Revolution" was first used by [[John Hampden (1653–1696)|John Hampden]] in late 1689,&lt;ref&gt;In testimony before a House of Lords committee in the autumn of 1689 ({{harvnb|Schwoerer|2004|p=3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and is an expression that is still used by the [[British Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/guides/factsheets/general/g04/ |title=The Glorious Revolution |publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glorious Revolution is also occasionally termed the ''Bloodless Revolution'', albeit inaccurately.  The [[English Civil War]] (also known as the Great Rebellion) was still within living memory for most of the major English participants in the events of 1688, and for them, in comparison to that war (or even the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685) the deaths in the conflict of 1688 were few.

[[File:James II &amp; VII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James II of England|James II &amp; VII]], King of England, Scotland and Ireland, by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]]. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]

During his three-year reign, [[King James II]] became directly involved in the political battles in England between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], and between the concept of the [[divine right of kings]] and the political rights of the [[Parliament of England]]. James's greatest political problem was his Catholicism, which left him alienated from both parties in England. The [[low church]] [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] had failed in their attempt to pass the [[Exclusion Bill]] to exclude James from the throne between 1679 and 1681, and James's supporters were the [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Tories (political faction)|Tories]]. In [[Scotland]], his supporters in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] stepped up attempts to force the [[Covenanter]]s to renounce their faith and accept [[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] rule of the church by the monarch.

When James inherited the English throne in 1685, he had much support in the 'Loyal Parliament', which was composed mostly of Tories. His Catholicism was of concern to many, but the fact that he had no son, and his daughters, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], were Protestants, was a "saving grace". James's attempt to relax the [[penal law (Britain)#English statutes on religious nonconformity|Penal Laws]] alienated his natural supporters, however, because the Tories viewed this as tantamount to [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]]. Abandoning the Tories, James looked to form a 'King's party' as a counterweight to the Anglican Tories, so in 1687 James supported the policy of [[religious toleration]] and issued the [[Declaration of Indulgence]]. The majority of Irish people backed James II for this reason and also because of his promise to the Irish Parliament of a greater future autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685–1720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/30064327|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6–111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allying himself with the Catholics, [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]], and [[Nonconformists]], James hoped to build a coalition that would advance Catholic emancipation.

In May 1686, James decided to obtain from the English courts of the [[common law]] a ruling that affirmed his power to dispense with Acts of Parliament. He dismissed judges who disagreed with him on this matter as well as the Solicitor General [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford|Heneage Finch]]. Eleven out of the twelve judges ruled in favour of dispensing power.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|pp=368–69}} When [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], the [[Bishop of London]], did not ban [[John Sharp (Archbishop of York)|John Sharp]] from preaching after he gave an anti-Catholic sermon, James ordered his removal.{{sfn|Carpenter|1956|pp=96–98}}

In April 1687, James ordered the fellows of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] to elect a Catholic, [[Anthony Farmer]], as their president. The fellows believed Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so could not wait for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told the fellows to elect the [[Bishop of Oxford]]. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. The fellows then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford as their president but James required that they admit they had been in the wrong and ask for his pardon. When they refused most of the fellows were ejected and replaced by Catholics.{{sfn|Western|1972|p=201}}

In 1687, James prepared to pack Parliament with his supporters so that it would repeal the [[Test Act]] and the penal laws. James was convinced by addresses from Dissenters that he had their support and so could dispense with relying on Tories and Anglicans. James instituted a wholesale purge of those in offices under the crown opposed to James's plan.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=132}} In August the [[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenancy]] was remodelled and in September over one thousand members of the city [[livery company|livery companies]] were ejected. In October James gave orders for the lords lieutenants in the provinces to provide three standard questions to all members of the [[Justice of the Peace|Commission of the peace]]: would they consent to the repeal of the Test Act and the penal laws; would they assist candidates who would do so; and they were requested to accept the Declaration of Indulgence. In December it was announced that all the offices of deputy lieutenants and Justices of the Peace would be revised. Therefore, during the first three months of 1688, hundreds of those who gave hostile replies to the three questions asked were dismissed. More far-reaching purges were applied to the towns: in November a regulating committee was founded to operate the purges.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=132–33}} Corporations were purged by agents given wide discretionary powers in an attempt to create a permanent royal electoral machine.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=146}} Finally, on 24 August 1688,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; James ordered writs to be issued for a general election.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=150}}

[[File:The Seven Bishops committed to the Tower in 1688 from NPG.jpg|thumb|Group portrait of the [[Seven Bishops]] whom James ordered imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1688, but who were acquitted of charges of [[seditious libel]].]]

James also created a large [[standing army]] and employed Catholics in positions of power within it. To his opponents in Parliament this seemed like a prelude to arbitrary rule, so James [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] Parliament without gaining their consent. At this time, the English regiments of the army were encamped at [[Hounslow]], near the capital. It was feared that the location was intended to overawe the City.{{sfn|Childs|1980|pp=96–97}} The army in Ireland was purged of Protestants, who were replaced with Catholics, and by 1688 James had more than 34,000 men under arms.

In April 1688, James re-issued the [[Declaration of Indulgence]] and ordered all clergymen to read it in their churches. When the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Sancroft]], and six other bishops (the [[Seven Bishops]]) wrote to James asking him to reconsider his policies, they were arrested on charges of [[seditious libel]], but at trial they were acquitted to the cheers of the London crowd.

Matters came to a head in June 1688, when the King had a son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]]; until then, the throne would have passed to his Protestant daughter, Mary. The prospect of a Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] was now likely.

==Conspiracy==
Mary had a husband, her cousin [[William III of England|William Henry of Orange]]. Both were Protestants and grandchildren of [[Charles I of England]]. Before the birth of James's son on 10 June,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; William had been third in the line of succession.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;After Mary's sister Anne. This line of succession was overturned by the Bill of Rights; see [[Succession to the British throne]]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong faction, however, at the English court, headed by [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland]], proposing that Mary and William, because of their anti-Catholic position, should be replaced by some Catholic French heir.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=182–83}}

William was also [[stadtholder]] of the main provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]], then in the preliminary stages of joining the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] against France, in a context of international tensions caused by the revocation by [[Louis XIV]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the disputed succession of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. William had already acquired the reputation of being the main champion in Europe of the Protestant cause against Catholicism and French absolutism; in the developing English crisis he saw an opportunity to prevent an Anglo-French alliance and bring England to the anti-French side, by carrying out a military intervention directed against James. This suited the desires of several English politicians who intended to depose James. It is still a matter of debate whether the initiative for the conspiracy was taken by the English or by the stadtholder and his wife. William had been trying to influence English politics for well over a year, letting [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Gaspar Fagel]] publish an [[open letter]] to the English people in November 1687 deploring the religious policy of James, which action had generally been interpreted as a covert bid for kingship.

School of [[Willem Wissing]], after [[Sir Peter Lely]].]]

Since he had become king the relationship between James and his nephew and son-in-law had gradually deteriorated. Initially William welcomed the promise of a less pro-French policy. In 1685 he sent the Scottish and English mercenary regiments of his army to England to assist in putting down the [[Monmouth Rebellion]].{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=176}} Soon James's policy of religious tolerance caused tensions to rise between them. William assumed it was but the first step towards a total re-Catholicisation of England and was unable to explain how James could hope to achieve this goal unless he had concluded a secret alliance with France. James's refusal to enter any anti-French coalition and his efforts to reorganise the Royal Navy increased William's suspicions. In the previous years the French navy had grown significantly in strength and the Dutch Republic would no longer be able to resist a combined Anglo-French attack.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=182}} William feared that even English neutrality would not suffice and that control over the Royal Navy was a prerequisite for a successful naval campaign against France.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=187}}

In November 1686 James had wished to gain William's support for the repeal of the [[Test Acts]], as this would have delivered a blow to the English opposition. The Quaker [[William Penn]] was sent to The Hague but William opposed repeal.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=218–19}} William's envoy [[Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt]] visited England between February and May 1687 (N.S.), instructed to persuade James to help contain French aggression. William also instructed Dijkvelt to let it be known that he would support the Church of England; that he was not a Presbyterian; to persuade the Dissenters not to support James and to reassure moderate Catholics.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=219–20}} After having been assured by James that all rumours about a French alliance were malevolent fabrications, Dijkvelt returned to the Republic, with letters of varying importance from leading English statesmen. James tried again to gain William's support but William responded by advising James to keep to the law and not try to extend his prerogative powers.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=221–22}} In August 1687 Count [[William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford|William Nassau de Zuylestein]] was sent to England, ostensibly to send condolences due to the death of the queen's mother. Zuylestein was sent in part to see how successful, or amenable, James's packed Parliament would be, and have discussions with English statesmen, with Zuylestein sending letters from them back to William.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=222}}

The correspondence between William and the English politicians was, at first, sent by ordinary post to genuine addresses in either country and then distributed. Devices were used such as ending a postscript with "etc.", which meant spaces were actually written in white or invisible ink. As the conspiracy neared completion in 1688, the English government sometimes disrupted this correspondence by holding up the whole mail delivery system. In another method to keep this clandestine correspondence flowing, letters were sent in merchant ships between London and Amsterdam or Rotterdam, with outward bound letters often put on board below Gravesend, after the final customs clearance. Also, couriers for the purpose were sometimes used, and all Dutch diplomats travelling to and from either country carried the correspondence. Shortly before the invasion, when rapid delivery and secrecy were essential, fast yachts and small vessels were used for special courier services. The English government intercepted very few of these means of communication.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=223–24}}

It has been suggested that the crisis caused by the prospect of a new Catholic heir made William decide to invade the next summer as early as November 1687,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoak|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is disputed{{citation needed|reason=By who?|date=October 2018}}. It is certain however that in April 1688, when France and England concluded a naval agreement stipulating that the French would finance an English squadron in The Channel, which seemed to be the beginning of a formal alliance, he seriously began to prepare for a military intervention and seek political and financial support for such an undertaking.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=191}}

===William seeks English commitment to an invasion===
William laid careful plans over a number of months for an invasion, which he hoped to execute in September 1688. William would not invade England without assurances of English support, and so in April, he asked for a formal invitation to be issued by a group of leading English statesmen. [[Gilbert Burnet]] recorded a conversation at the end of April between William and Admiral [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Edward Russell]]:

{{quote|So Russell put the Prince to explain himself what he intended to do. The Prince answered, that, if he was invited by some men of the best interest, and the most valued in the nation, who should both in their own name, and in the name of others who trusted them, invite him to come and rescue the nation and the religion, he believed he could be ready by the end of September to come over.|Gilbert Burnet.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|p=225}} }}

[[File:Earl of Romney.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney|Henry Sydney]], author of the [[Invitation to William]], which was signed by six noblemen (both Whigs and Tories) and one bishop. He has been described as "the great wheel on which the Revolution rolled".{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=222}}]]

In May, Russell told William that the English opposition to James would not wait any longer for help and they would rise against James in any event. William feared that if he did not now head the conspiracy the English would set up a republic, even more inimical to the Dutch state.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|p=231}} In June, William sent Count Zuylestein to England, ostensibly to congratulate James on the birth of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince of Wales]] but in reality to communicate with William's associates.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=238–39}}

Only after the Prince of Wales had been born in June, however, and many suspected he was [[Supposititious children|supposititious]],&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;It was rumoured that he was a baby who had been smuggled into the royal bedchamber in a warming pan, but this is not now taken seriously.&lt;/ref&gt; did the Immortal Seven (who consisted of one bishop and six nobles) decide to comply, with the [[Invitation to William|letter to William]] dated 18 June (Julian calendar),&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; reaching him in [[The Hague]] on 30 June,&lt;!--Needs clarification if Julian of Gregorian calendar--&gt; and dispatched by [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Rear Admiral Herbert]], disguised as a common sailor. The Seven consisted of [[Charles Talbot, Duke of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Lord Devonshire]], [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Lord Danby]], [[Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough|Lord Lumley]], Henry Compton, Edward Russell, and [[Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney|Henry Sydney]]. The invitation declared:

{{quote|We have great reason to believe, we shall be every day in a worse condition than we are, and less able to defend ourselves, and therefore we do earnestly wish we might be so happy as to find a remedy before it be too late for us to contribute to our own deliverance&amp;nbsp;... the people are so generally dissatisfied with the present conduct of the government, in relation to their religion, liberties and properties (all which have been greatly invaded), and they are in such expectation of their prospects being daily worse, that your Highness may be assured, there are nineteen parts of twenty of the people throughout the kingdom, who are desirous of a change; and who, we believe, would willingly contribute to it, if they had such a protection to countenance their rising, as would secure them from being destroyed.|invitation by The Seven.{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book&amp;nbsp;v, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–10}} }}

The Seven went on to claim that "much the greatest part of the nobility and gentry" were dissatisfied and would rally to William, and that James's army "would be very much divided among themselves; many of the officers being so discontented that they continue in their service only for a subsistence&amp;nbsp;... and very many of the common soldiers do daily shew such an aversion to the Popish religion, that there is the greatest probability imaginable of great numbers of deserters&amp;nbsp;... and amongst the seamen, it is almost certain, there is not one in ten who would do them any service in such a war".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, p. 108}} The Seven believed that the situation would be much worse before another year due to James's plans to remodel the army by the means of a packed Parliament or, should the parliamentary route fail, through violent means which would "prevent all possible means of relieving ourselves".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, pp. 108–09}} The Seven also promised to rally to William upon his landing in England and would "do all that lies in our power to prepare others to be in as much readiness as such an action is capable of".{{sfn|Dalrymple|1790|loc=appendix to book v, p. 109}}

Meanwhile, William's confidante [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Willem Bentinck]] launched a propaganda campaign in England. In the numerous [[pamphlet]]s distributed, William was presented in the best possible light; as a true Stuart yet blessedly free from the usual Stuart vices of crypto-Catholicism, absolutism, and debauchery. Much of the later "spontaneous" support for William had been carefully organised by Bentinck and his agents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Louis XIV Outside In: Images of the Sun King Beyond France, 1661-1715|last=Tony Claydon, Charles-Édouard Levillain|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317103240|location=|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In August, it became clear that William had surprisingly strong support within the English army, a situation brought about by James himself. In January 1688 he had forbidden any of his subjects to serve the Dutch and had demanded that the Republic dissolve its six mercenary Scottish and English regiments. When this was refused, he asked that at least those willing would be released from their martial oath to be free to return to Britain. To this William consented as it would purify his army of Jacobite elements. In total 104&amp;nbsp;officers and 44&amp;nbsp;soldiers returned. The officers were enlisted within the British armies and so favoured that the established officer corps began to fear for its position. On 14 August&lt;!--Julian or Georgian calendar? Needs checking--&gt; [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill]] wrote to William: "I owe it to God and my country to put my honour into the hands of Your Highness". Nothing comparable happened within the Royal Navy, however; claims after the event by certain captains that they had somehow prevented the English fleet from engaging seem to have been little more than attempts at self-aggrandisement.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}}

===Military and financial support===
For William the English problem was inextricably intertwined with the situation in Germany. Only if the attention of Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV was directed to the east could William hope to intervene in England without French interference. For this it was essential that Austria continued opposing the French demands regarding Cologne and the Palatinate. In May, William sent an envoy, Johann von Görtz, [[privy councillor]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Cassel]], to [[Vienna]] to ensure secretly the support of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]]. Learning that William promised not to persecute the Catholics in England, the emperor approved of the expedition, promising in turn to try making peace with the [[Ottoman Empire]] to free his forces for a campaign in the West; on 4 September 1688&lt;!--Julian or Gregorian as it is on the continent?--&gt; he would join an alliance with the Republic against France. The Duke of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]], and the Elector of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[John George III, Elector of Saxony|John George III]], assured William that they would remain neutral, though it had been feared they would take the French side.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=198}}

[[File:Francisco Lopes Suasso.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Lopes Suasso]], who partly financed the invasion]]

The next concern was to assemble a powerful invasion force – contrary to the wishes of the English conspirators, who predicted that a token force would be sufficient. For this William needed funding by the city of [[Amsterdam]], then the world's main [[financial centre]]. In earlier years Amsterdam had been strongly pro-French, often forcing William to moderate his policies, but a [[tariff war]] waged by Louis from 1687 against the Republic and French import limitations on [[herring]], a major Dutch export, had outraged the wealthy merchants. Nevertheless, only after secret and difficult negotiations by Bentinck with the hesitant Amsterdam [[burgomaster]]s during June could 260 transports be hired. Additionally, the burghers were uneasy about the prospect of denuding their homeland of its defences by sending the field army – roughly half of the total peace-time strength of the [[Dutch States Army]] of about 30,000 – overseas. Bentinck, who had already been sent in May to [[Brandenburg]] to recruit, but without much result, therefore negotiated contracts from 20 July (Gregorian calendar) for 13,616 German mercenaries from Brandenburg, [[Württemberg]], Hesse-Cassel, and [[Celle]] to man Dutch border fortresses in order to free an equal number of Dutch elite mercenary troops for use against England.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=38}} As the Dutch would typically double or triple their total army strength in wartime, the numbers were low enough to be explained as a limited precaution against French aggression. Shortly afterwards, Marshal [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Frederick Schomberg]] was instructed by William to prepare for a Western campaign.{{sfn|Baxter|1966|pp=232–33}}

Further financial support was obtained from the most disparate sources: the Jewish banker [[Francisco Lopes Suasso]] lent two million guilders;{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=52}} when asked what security he desired, Suasso answered: "If you are victorious, you will surely repay me; if not, the loss is mine."{{sfn|Swetschinsky|Schönduve|1988|p=53}} Even [[Pope Innocent XI]], an inveterate enemy of Louis XIV of France, provided a loan to William, though a relation with the invasion has been denied.&lt;ref name=kelly288&gt;Kelly, 288 {{Verify source|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total costs were seven million guilders, four million of which would ultimately be paid for by a state loan. In the summer the Dutch navy was expanded to 9000&amp;nbsp;sailors on the pretext of fighting the [[Dunkirkers]]. The standard summer equipment of twenty warships was secretly doubled. On 13 July 1688 (Gregorian calendar) it was decided to build 21 new warships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=287}}

===The final decision to invade is taken===
Despite all the preparations, William had great trouble convincing the Dutch class of city and provincial rulers, the [[regenten|regents]], that such an expensive expedition was really necessary. Also, he personally feared that the French might attack the Republic through [[Flanders]] when its army was tied up in England. One of the "Seven", Lord Danby, suggested postponing the invasion until the following year. By early September, William was on the brink of cancelling the entire expedition when French policy played into his hand.

In Germany, matters had come to a head. The Pope had refused to confirm Louis's favourite candidate for the [[bishopric of Cologne]], [[William Egon of Fürstenberg]]. Enraged, the French king decided to execute a lightning campaign into Germany before the emperor could shift his troops to the West. Louis also hoped to keep his Turkish ally in the war this way. For the immediate future James had to hold his own, something Louis expected him to be quite capable of, especially if the Dutch were intimidated. On 9 September (Gregorian calendar) the French envoy [[Jean Antoine de Mesmes]], the Comte d'Avaux, handed two letters from the French king, who had known of the invasion plans since May, to the [[States General of the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=41}} In the first they were warned not to attack James. In the second they were advised not to interfere with the French policy in Germany. James hurriedly distanced himself from the first message, trying to convince the States General that there was no secret Anglo-French alliance against them.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;As there had been in 1672 with the concerted attack by France and England on the Republic on the basis of the [[Secret treaty of Dover]].&lt;/ref&gt; This had precisely the opposite effect: many members became extremely suspicious. The second message proved that the main French effort was directed to the east, not the north, so there was no immediate danger of a French invasion for the Republic itself.

From 22 September,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; Louis XIV seized all Dutch ships present in French ports,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=39}} totalling about a hundred vessels, apparently proving that real war with France was imminent, though Louis had meant it to be a mere warning. On 26 September the powerful city council of Amsterdam decided to officially support the invasion. On 27 September Louis crossed the Rhine into Germany to attack [[Philippsburg]] and William began to move the Dutch field army from the eastern borders, where it had trained on the [[Mookerheide]], to the coast, even though most of the new mercenaries had not yet arrived.

On 29 September the [[States of Holland]], the government of the most important Dutch province, fearing a French-English alliance, gathered in secret session and approved the operation, agreeing to make the English "King and Nation live in a good relation, and useful to their friends and allies, and especially to this State". They accepted William's argument that a [[pre-emptive war|preventive strike]] was necessary to avoid a repeat of the events of 1672,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=37}} when England and France had [[Third Anglo-Dutch War|jointly attacked the Republic]], "an attempt to bring this state to its ultimate ruin and subjugation, as soon as they find the occasion". William denied any intention "to remove the King from the throne or become master of England". The States ordered a Dutch fleet of 53 warships to escort the troop transports. This fleet was in fact commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] on the ''Cortgene'' and Vice-Admiral [[Philips van Almonde]] on the ''Provincie Utrecht'' but in consideration of English sensitivities placed, on 6 October, under the nominal command of Rear-Admiral Herbert, who for the occasion was appointed Lieutenant-Admiral-General, i.e. acting supreme commander, of the Dutch navy.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=288}} He sailed on the ''Leyden'', accompanied by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Willem Bastiaensz Schepers]], the Rotterdam shipping magnate who had organised the transport fleet. Though William was himself Admiral-General of the Republic, he, as was usual, abstained from operational command, sailing conspicuously on the new frigate ''Den Briel''. The States General allowed the core regiments of the Dutch field army to participate under command of Marshall Schomberg. Despite being assisted in it by the regular Dutch fleet and field army, his attempt to change the situation in England was, as the States General made explicit, officially a private family affair of William, merely acting in his capacity of concerned nephew and son-in-law to James, not an undertaking of the Dutch Republic as such.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=198}}

[[File:William III Landing at Brixham, Torbay, 5 November 1688.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of William III by [[Jan Wyck]], commemorating the landing at Brixham, Torbay, 5 November 1688]]

The Dutch preparations, though carried out with great speed, could not remain secret. The English envoy [[Ignatius White]], the Marquess d'Albeville, warned his country: "an absolute conquest is intended under the specious and ordinary pretences of religion, liberty, property and a free Parliament&amp;nbsp;...". Louis XIV threatened the Dutch with an immediate declaration of war, should they carry out their plans. Embarkations, started on 22 September ([[Gregorian calendar]]), had been completed on 8 October, and the expedition was that day openly approved by the States of Holland; the same day James issued a proclamation to the English nation that it should prepare for a Dutch invasion to ward off conquest. On 30 September/10 October ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]/[[Gregorian calendar]]s) William issued the ''Declaration of The Hague'' (actually written by Fagel), of which 60,000&amp;nbsp;copies of the English translation by Gilbert Burnet were distributed after the landing in England,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=10–16}} in which he assured that his only aim was to maintain the Protestant religion, install a free parliament and investigate the legitimacy of the Prince of Wales. He would respect the position of James. William declared:

{{quote|It is both certain and evident to all men, that the public peace and happiness of any state or kingdom cannot be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Customs, established by the lawful authority in it, are openly transgressed and annulled; more especially where the alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a religion, which is contrary to law, is endeavoured to be introduced; upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it are indispensably bound to endeavour to preserve and maintain the established Laws, Liberties and customs, and, above all, the Religion and Worship of God, that is established among them; and to take such an effectual care, that the inhabitants of the said state or kingdom may neither be deprived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights.|[[William III of England|William of Orange]].{{sfn|Speck|1989|p=74}}}}

William went on to condemn James's advisers for overturning the religion, laws, and liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland by the use of the suspending and dispensing power; the establishment of the "manifestly illegal" commission for ecclesiastical causes and its use to suspend the [[Bishop of London]] and to remove the Fellows of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. William also condemned James's attempt to repeal the [[Test Act]]s and the penal laws through pressuring individuals and waging an assault on parliamentary boroughs, as well as his purging of the judiciary. James's attempt to pack Parliament was in danger of removing "the last and great remedy for all those evils". "Therefore", William continued, "we have thought fit to go over to England, and to carry over with us a force sufficient, by the blessing of God, to defend us from the violence of those evil Counsellors&amp;nbsp;... this our Expedition is intended for no other design, but to have, a free and lawful Parliament assembled as soon as is possible".{{sfn|Speck|1989|pp= 74–75}}

On [[Old Style and New Style dates|4/14]] October William responded to the allegations by James in a second declaration, denying any intention to become king or conquer England. Whether he had any at that moment is still controversial.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=199}}

The swiftness of the embarkations surprised all foreign observers. Louis had in fact delayed his threats against the Dutch until early September because he assumed it then would be too late in the season to set the expedition in motion anyway, if their reaction proved negative; typically such an enterprise would take at least some months.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} Being ready after the last week of September / first week of October would normally have meant that the Dutch could have profited from the last spell of good weather, as the autumn storms tend to begin in the third week of that month. This year they came early however. For three weeks the invasion fleet was prevented by adverse south-westerly gales from departing from the naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]] and Catholics all over the Netherlands and the British kingdoms held prayer sessions that this "popish wind" might endure. However, on [[Old Style and New Style dates|14/24]]&amp;nbsp;October it became the famous "[[Protestant Wind]]" by turning to the east.{{sfn|Jones|1973|pp=201–21}}

===English naval strategy===
James only in late August seriously began to consider the possibility of a Dutch invasion and then overestimated the size of the naval force the Dutch would bring against him. He assumed they would equip their full battle fleet, which he himself would be unable to match for financial reasons: in October about thirty English ships-of-the-line had been assembled, all [[third rate]]s or [[fourth rate]]s, while heavier vessels remained laid up. Fearing a surprise attack, he declined to position this fleet at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], for striking into the southern [[North Sea]] or the Channel the most convenient location, but also a very vulnerable one. When Admiral [[George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth]] decided to place his fleet at the [[Gunfleet]] near the [[Medway]], in a rather withdrawn location, James therefore merely suggested to bring the fleet farther out, though he well understood it otherwise risked becoming locked up in the [[Thames]] estuary by the same easterly wind that would allow the Dutch to cross. This was influenced by his belief the Dutch might well attack France instead and his expectation that they would first seek a naval victory before daring to invade – and that it thus would be advantageous to refuse battle.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=138}} Indeed, it had originally been the Dutch intention to defeat the English first to free the way for the transport fleet – though they too, to lower the cost of the invasion, had not activated any heavier ships – but because it was now so late in the season and conditions on board deteriorated rapidly, they decided to sail in convoy and, if possible, avoid battle.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=291}}

===Crossing and landing===
[[File:Het oorlogsschip 'Brielle' op de Maas voor Rotterdam - The warship 'Brielle' on the Maas before Rotterdam (Ludolf Backhuysen, 1689).jpg|thumb|William boarding the ''Brill'']]

On [[Old Style and New Style dates|16/26]] October William boarded his ship, the ''Den Briel'' (''Brill'' in English). His standard was hoisted, displaying the arms of Nassau quartered with those of England. The words ''{{lang|la|Pro Religione et Libertate}}'' ("For Liberty and [the Protestant] Religion"), the [[slogan]] of William's ancestor [[William the Silent]] while leading the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Catholic Spain, were shown next to the [[House of Orange]]'s [[motto]], ''{{lang|fr|Je&amp;nbsp;maintiendrai}}'' ("I&amp;nbsp;will maintain").{{sfn|Jardine|2008|pp=10–11}} William's fleet, which with about 40,000&amp;nbsp;men aboard was roughly twice the size of the [[Spanish Armada]] – and assembled in a tenth of the time – consisted of 463&amp;nbsp;ships.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} Among these were 49&amp;nbsp;warships of more than twenty cannon (eight could count as third rates of 60–68&amp;nbsp;cannon, nine were frigates), 28&amp;nbsp;[[galliot]]s, nine&amp;nbsp;[[fireships]], 76&amp;nbsp;[[fluyt]]s to carry the soldiers, 120 small transports to carry five&amp;nbsp;thousand horses, about seventy supply vessels and sixty fishing vessels serving as [[landing craft]].{{sfn|Western|1972|p=260}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=289}} Most of the warships had been provided by the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]]. On 19/29 October William's fleet departed from [[Hellevoetsluis]]. The fleet was approximately halfway between the Republic and England when the wind changed to the northwest and a gale scattered the fleet, with the ''Brill'' returning to Hellevoetsluis on 21/31 October. Despite suffering from sea-sickness William refused to go ashore and the fleet reassembled, having lost only one ship that grounded,{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=561}} though about a thousand crippled horses had been thrown into the sea.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|p=290}} Press reports were released that deliberately exaggerated the damage and claimed the expedition would be postponed till the spring.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|pp=290–91}} English naval command now considered to try blockading Hellevoetsluis but decided against it because it was feared that the English fleet would founder on the Dutch coast, a dangerous [[lee shore]] for a blocking force, by the stormy weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1989|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking advantage of a wind again turned to the east, resupplied and re-equipped with new horses, the invasion fleet departed again on 1/11&amp;nbsp;November and sailed north in the direction of [[Harwich]] where Bentinck had a landing site prepared. The fleet changed course to the south however when the wind turned more to the north; it has been suggested that the initial move to the north was a feint and indeed James diverted some of his forces in that direction.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2009|pp=290–91}} Thus they passed twice in sight of the English fleet, which was unable to intercept because of the adverse wind and an unfavourable tide.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}} On 3/13 November the invasion fleet entered the [[English Channel]] through the [[Strait of Dover]] in an enormous square formation, 25&amp;nbsp;ships deep, the right and left of the fleet saluting Dover and Calais simultaneously, to show off its size. The troops were lined up on deck, firing musket volleys, with full colours flying and the [[military band]]s playing. [[Rapin de Thoyras]], who was on board one of the ships, described it as the most magnificent and affecting spectacle that was ever seen by human eyes. William intended to land at [[Torbay]] but due to fog the fleet sailed past it by mistake. The wind made a return impossible and Plymouth was unsuitable as it had a garrison. At this point, with the English fleet in pursuit, Russell told Burnet: "You may go to prayers, Doctor. All is over". At that moment however the wind changed and the fog lifted, enabling the fleet to sail into Torbay, near [[Brixham]], Devon. William came ashore on 5/15&amp;nbsp;November.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|pp=563–64}} When Burnet was ashore he hastened to William and eagerly enquired what William now intended to do. William regarded the interference in military matters by non-military personnel with disgust but he was in good humour at this moment and responded with a delicate reproof: "Well, Doctor, what do you think of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] now?"{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=565}} The English squadron under [[George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]] was forced by the same change in wind to shelter in Portsmouth harbour.{{sfn|Macaulay|1889|p=565}} During the next two days William's army disembarked in calm weather.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}}

William brought over 11,212 horse and foot. William's [[cavalry]] and [[dragoons]] amounted to 3,660.{{sfn|Childs|1980|pp=175}} His [[artillery train]] contained 21&amp;nbsp;24-pounder cannon. Including the supply train, his force consisted of about 15,000&amp;nbsp;men,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2006|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Sowerby|2013|pp=347–48}}; {{harvnb|Speck|2002|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to James's total forces of about 30,000.{{sfn|Marquess of Cambridge|1966|pp=152–53}}{{sfn|Childs|1980|p=4}} He also brought 20,000&amp;nbsp;stand of arms to equip his English supporters.{{sfn|Western|1972|p=260}} The Dutch army was composed mostly of foreign mercenaries; there were Dutch, Scots, English, German, Swiss, and Swedish regiments, even [[Laplanders]]{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} as well as "200&amp;nbsp;Blacks brought from the Plantations of the Netherlands in America",{{sfn|Beddard|1988|p=19}} thus from the colony of [[Surinam]]. Many of the mercenaries were Catholic.{{sfn|Schuchard|2002|p=762}} William had his personal guard regiment with him, the [[Dutch Blue Guards]]. In response to the threat James had raised five new regiments of foot and five of horse, as well as bringing in Scottish and Irish soldiers. Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV also sent James 300,000&amp;nbsp;livres.{{sfn|Western|1972|p=259}}

The French fleet remained at the time concentrated in the Mediterranean, to assist a possible attack on the [[Papal State]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=137}} Louis delayed his declaration of war until 16/26 November hoping at first that their involvement in a protracted English civil war would keep the Dutch from interfering with his German campaign. The same day a second attempt by Legge to attack the landing site again failed by an adverse southwestern gale.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=139}} The Dutch call their fleet action the ''Glorieuze Overtocht'', the "Glorious Crossing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Kuijl|1988|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William consolidates his position===
William considered his veteran army to be sufficient in size to defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James could throw against him, but it had been decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive attitude in the hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.

On 9 November (Julian calendar) William took [[Exeter]] after the magistrates had fled the city, entering on a white [[palfrey]], with the two hundred [[Black people|black]] men forming a guard of honour, dressed in white, with turbans and feathers.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=16}} In the South support from the local gentry was disappointingly limited,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=15}} but from 12 November, in the North, many nobles began to declare for William, as they had promised, often by a public reading of the ''Declaration''.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=32}} In [[Yorkshire]], printer John White started to print the same document for a more widespread distribution.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=31}} However, in the first weeks most people carefully avoided taking sides; as a whole the nation neither rallied behind its king, nor welcomed William, but passively awaited the outcome of events. In general, the mood was one of confusion, mutual distrust and depression.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=15}}

==The collapse of James's rule==
James refused a French offer to send an expeditionary force, fearing that it would cost him domestic support. He tried to bring the Tories to his side by making concessions but failed because he still refused to endorse the Test Act. His forward forces had gathered at [[Salisbury]], and James went to join them on 19 November with his main force, having a total strength of about 19,000. Amid anti-Catholic rioting in London, it rapidly became apparent that the troops were not eager to fight, and the loyalty of many of James' commanders was doubtful; he had been informed of the conspiracy within the army as early as September, but for unknown reasons had refused to arrest the officers involved. Some have argued, however, that if James had been more resolute, the army would have fought and fought well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childs|1980|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blood was shed at about this time in a [[Wincanton Skirmish|skirmish at Wincanton]], Somerset, where Royalist troops under [[Patrick Sarsfield]] retreated after defeating a small party of scouts; the total body count on both sides came to about fifteen. In Salisbury, after hearing that some officers had deserted, among them [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Lord Cornbury]], a worried James was overcome by a serious nose-bleed that he interpreted as an evil [[omen]] indicating that he should order his army to retreat, which the supreme army commander, the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Earl of Feversham]], also advised on 23 November. The next day, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill]], one of James' chief commanders, deserted to William.{{efn|[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]], later the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|1st Duke of Marlborough]], was the pre-eminent British general of his generation. {{quote|I once heard the [[Duke of Wellington]] asked whether he thought Napoleon or Marlborough the greater general. "It is difficult to answer that", he replied. "I used always to say that the presence of Napoleon at a battle was equal to a reinforcement of 40,000 men. But I can conceive nothing greater than Marlborough at the head of an English army".|[[Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope]].{{sfn|Stanhope|2011|loc=footnote 90}}&lt;!--quote--&gt;}}&lt;!--efn--&gt;}} On 26 November, James's younger daughter, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], who doubted the authenticity of her new brother,{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=56}} and who was greatly influenced by Churchill's wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]], did the same. Both were serious losses. James returned to London that same day. On 27 November he met with all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal who were then in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/historyenglandf08unkngoog|title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|first=Hannah More Macaulay Trevelyan|last=Thomas Babington Macaulay Macaulay|date=21 September 1872|publisher=Longmans, Green, and co.|accessdate=21 September 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on 18 November [[Plymouth]] had surrendered to William, and on 21 November he began to advance.{{sfn|Information Services}} By 24 November, William's forces were at [[Sherborne]] and on 1 December at [[Hindon, Wiltshire|Hindon]]. On 4 December he was at [[Amesbury]], and was received by the mayor of [[Salisbury]];{{sfn|Information Services}} three days later they had reached [[Hungerford]], where the following day they met with the King's Commissioners to negotiate. James offered free elections and a general amnesty for the rebels. In reality, by that point James was simply playing for time, having already decided to flee the country. He feared that his English enemies would insist on his execution and that William would give in to their demands. Convinced that his army was unreliable, he sent orders to disband it. On 9 December, the two sides fought a second engagement with the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]], a defeat for the King's men.

In December, there was anti-Catholic rioting in Bristol, Bury St. Edmunds, Hereford, York, Cambridge, and Shropshire. On 9 December a Protestant mob stormed [[Dover Castle]], where the Catholic Sir Edward Hales was governor, and seized it. On 8 December William met at last with James's representatives; he agreed to James's proposals but also demanded that all Catholics be immediately dismissed from state functions and that England pay for the Dutch military expenses. He received no reply, however.

===Departure of King and Queen===
In the night of 9/10 December, the Queen and the Prince of Wales fled for France. The next day saw James's attempt to escape, the King dropping the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] in the [[Thames]] along the way, as no lawful Parliament could be summoned without it.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=17}} However, he was captured on 11 December by fishermen in [[Faversham]] opposite [[Sheerness]], the town on the [[Isle of Sheppey]]. On the same day, 27&amp;nbsp;[[Lords Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]], forming a [[provisional government]], decided to ask William to restore order but at the same time asked the king to return to London to reach an agreement with his son-in-law. It was presided over initially by [[William Sancroft]], Archbishop of Canterbury and, after it was learned that James was still in England, by [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=2409|page=1 |date=13 December 1688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/historyenglandf08unkngoog|title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|first=Hannah More Macaulay Trevelyan|last=Thomas Babington Macaulay Macaulay|date=21 September 1872|publisher=Longmans, Green, and co.|accessdate=21 September 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 11 December there were riots and lootings of the houses of Catholics and several foreign embassies of Catholic countries in London. The following night a mass panic gripped London during what was later termed the [[Irish night]]. False rumours of an impending Irish army attack on London circulated in the capital, and a mob of over 100,000 assembled ready to defend the city.

Upon returning to London on 16 December, James was welcomed by cheering crowds. He took heart at this and attempted to recommence government, even presiding over a meeting of the [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=2410|page=2 |date=17 December 1688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Those in attendance were [[William Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton]], [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608–1697)|William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven]], [[George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley]], [[Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton]] ([[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), [[Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston]] ([[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]]), [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] (Chamberlain to the Queen and [[Lords Commissioners of the Treasury|Treasury Commissioner]]), [[John Trevor (speaker)|John Trevor]], Master of the Rolls and [[Silius Titus]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He sent the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Earl of Feversham]] to William to arrange for a personal meeting to continue negotiations. Now it became evident that William had no longer any desire to keep James in power in England. He was extremely dismayed by the arrival of Lord Feversham. He refused the suggestion that he simply arrest James because this would violate his own declarations and burden his relationship with his wife. In the end it was decided that he should exploit James's fears; the three original commissioners were sent back to James with the message that William felt he could no longer guarantee the king's well-being and that James for his own safety had better leave London for [[Ham, London|Ham]].

William at the same time ordered all English troops to depart from the capital, while his forces entered on 17 December; no local forces were allowed within a twenty-mile radius until the spring of 1690. Already the English navy had declared for William. James, by his own choice, went under Dutch protective guard to [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent on 18 December, just as William entered London, cheered by crowds dressed in orange ribbons or waving, lavishly distributed, oranges.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=19}} The Dutch officers had been ordered that "if he [James] wanted to leave, they should not prevent him, but allow him to gently slip through".&lt;ref&gt;''Journaal van Constantijn Huygens'', i, 62&lt;/ref&gt; James then left for France on 23 December after having received a request from his wife to join her, even though his followers urged him to stay. The lax guard on James and the decision to allow him so near the coast indicate that William may have hoped that a successful flight would avoid the difficulty of deciding what to do with him, especially with the memory of the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] still strong. By fleeing, James ultimately helped resolve the awkward question of whether he was still the legal king or not, having created according to many a situation of [[interregnum]].{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=17}}

==William and Mary made joint monarchs==
[[File:William and Mary.jpg|thumb|[[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] reigned together for five years. William reigned on his own following Mary's death in 1694.]]

On 28 December, William took over the provisional government by appointment of the peers of the realm, as was the legal right of the latter in circumstances when the king was incapacitated, and, on the advice of his Whig allies, summoned an assembly of all the surviving members of parliament of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s reign, thus sidelining the Tories of the [[Loyal Parliament]] of 1685. This assembly called for a chosen [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Convention Parliament]], elected on 5 January 1689 [[New Style|NS]],&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=cal/&gt; which convened on 22 January. William did not intervene in the election that followed. This elected body consisted of 513&amp;nbsp;members, 341 of whom had been elected before, 238 having been members of at least one [[Exclusion Bill Parliament]], but only 193 having been elected in 1685.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=9}} The name "Convention" was chosen because only the king could call a Parliament, although as William had been appointed ''de facto'' regent by the peers the Convention could be argued to be, strictly speaking, a lawful Parliament.

Although James had fled the country, he still had many followers, and William feared that the king might return, relegating William to the role of a mere regent, an outcome which was unacceptable to him. On 30 December, William, speaking to the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], threatened to leave England "if King James came again" and determined to go back to the Netherlands "if they went about to make him Regent".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beddard|1988|p=65}} cites: {{citation|last=Foxcroft |first=H. C.  |year=1898 |title=The Life and Letters of Sir George Savile, Marquis of Halifax| volume=II |location=London |pages=203–04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Convention Parliament was very divided on the issue. The radical Whigs in the Lower House proposed to elect William as a king (meaning that his power would be derived from the people); the moderates wanted an [[acclamation]] of William and Mary together; the Tories wanted to make him regent or only acclaim Mary as queen. On 28 January a committee of the whole [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] promptly decided by acclamation that James had broken "the original contract"; had "abdicated the government"; and had left the throne "vacant".{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|pp=9–10}} The House of Lords wished to amend this, however, as many were still loyal to James and believed in the Anglican doctrine of non-resistance. The Lords rejected the proposal for a regency in James's name by 51 to 48 on 2 February. The Lords also substituted the word "abdicated" for "deserted" and removed the "vacancy" clause. The Lords voted against proclaiming William and Mary monarchs by 52 to 47. On 4 February the Lords reaffirmed their amendments to the Commons's resolution by 55 to 51 and 54 to 53.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=10}} On 5 February the Commons voted 282 to 151 for maintaining the original wording of the resolution. The next day, the two Houses entered into a conference but failed to resolve the matter. William in private conversation (with Halifax, Danby, Shrewsbury, Lord Winchester and Lord Mordaunt) made it clear that they could either accept him as king or deal with the Whigs without his military presence, for then he would leave for the Republic. But he let it be known that he was happy for Mary to be nominal monarch and preference in the succession given to Anne's children over his by a subsequent marriage. Anne declared that she would temporarily waive her right to the crown should Mary die before William, and Mary refused to be made queen without William as king. The Lords on 6 February now accepted the words "abdication" and "vacancy" and Lord Winchester's motion to appoint William and Mary monarchs.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=11}} Generally there was a great fear that the situation might deteriorate into a civil war.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=26}}

===The Bill of Rights===
{{Main article|Bill of Rights 1689}}
The proposal to draw up a statement of rights and liberties and James's invasion of them was first made on 29 January in the Commons, with members arguing that the House "can not answer it to the nation or Prince of Orange till we declare what are the rights invaded" and that William "cannot take it ill if we make conditions to secure ourselves for the future" to "do justice to those who sent us hither". On 2 February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23&amp;nbsp;Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4 February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between "such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights". On 7 February the Commons approved this revised Declaration of Right, and on 8 February instructed the committee to put into a single text the Declaration (with the heads which were "introductory of new laws" removed), the resolution of 28 January and the Lords' proposal for a revised oath of allegiance. It passed the Commons without division.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=12}}

The Declaration of Right was in December 1689 enacted in an Act of Parliament, the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. It listed twelve of James's policies by which James designed to "endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=26}} These were:
* by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws;
* by prosecuting the Seven Bishops;
* by establishing of the court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes;
* by levying money for the crown by pretence of prerogative than the same was granted by Parliament;
* by raising and maintaining a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament;
* by disarming Protestants and arming Catholics contrary to law;
* by violating the election of members to serve in Parliament;
* by prosecuting in the King's Bench for matters cognisable only in Parliament and "divers other arbitrary and illegal courses";
* by employing unqualified persons to serve on juries;
* by requiring an excessive bail for persons committed in criminal cases;
* by imposing excessive fines and "illegal and cruel punishments inflicted";
* by making "several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the person, upon whom the same were to be levied".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=27}}

The Bill of Rights also vindicated and asserted the nation's "ancient rights and liberties" by declaring:
* the pretended power to dispense with or suspend Acts of Parliament is illegal;
* the commission for ecclesiastical causes is illegal;
* levying money without the consent of Parliament is illegal;
* it is the right of the subject to petition the king and prosecutions for petitioning are illegal;
* maintaining a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament is illegal;
* Protestant subjects "may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions, and allowed by law";
* the election of members of Parliament ought to be free;
* that freedom of speech and debates in Parliament "ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament";
* [[excessive bail]] and fines not required and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]s" not to be inflicted;
* jurors in high treason trials ought to be freeholders;
* that promises of fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal;
* that Parliament ought to be held frequently.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=28–29}}

On 13 February the clerk of the House of Lords read the Declaration of Right, and Halifax, in the name of all the estates of the realm, asked William and Mary to accept the throne. William replied for his wife and himself: "We thankfully accept what you have offered us". They then went in procession to the great gate at Whitehall. The [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King at Arms]] proclaimed them King and Queen of England, [[English claims to the French throne|France]] and Ireland, whereupon they adjourned to the Chapel Royal, with Compton preaching the sermon.{{sfn|Carpenter|1956|pp=145–46}} They were crowned on 11 April, swearing an oath to uphold the laws made by Parliament. The [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]] had provided a new coronation oath, whereby the monarchs were to "solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same". They were also to maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed faith established by law.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=37–39}}

===The other kingdoms===
{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}
Although their succession to the English throne was relatively peaceful, much blood would be shed before William's authority was accepted in Ireland and Scotland. In Scotland there had been no serious support for the rebellion; but, when James fled for France, most members of the [[Scottish Privy Council]] went to London to offer their services to William. On 7 January they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government. On 14 March a [[Convention of Estates (1689)|Scottish Convention]] convened in [[Edinburgh]], dominated by the [[Presbyterians]] because the Episcopalians continued to support James. There was nevertheless a Jacobite faction, but a letter by James received on 16 March, in which he threatened to punish all who rebelled against him, resulted in his followers leaving the Convention, which then on 4 April decided that the throne of Scotland was vacant. The Convention formulated the ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' and the ''Articles of Grievances''. On 11 May William and Mary accepted the Crown of Scotland; after their acceptance, the ''Claim'' and the '' Articles '' were read aloud, leading to an immediate debate over whether or not an endorsement of these documents was implicit in that acceptance.

In Ireland there was no equivalent of the English or Scottish Convention and William had to conquer Ireland by [[Williamite War in Ireland|force]]. The English Convention presumed to legislate for Ireland as well, and the Declaration of Right deemed William to be King of Ireland as well as of England.

==Jacobite uprisings==
{{Main article|Williamite War in Ireland|Jacobite rising of 1689}}
James had cultivated support on the fringes of his Three Kingdoms – in Catholic Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. Supporters of James, known as ''Jacobites'', were prepared to resist what they saw as an illegal coup by force of arms. The [[Jacobite rising of 1689|first Jacobite rebellion]], an uprising in support of James in Scotland, took place in 1689. It was led by [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee]], also known as Graham of Claverhouse or Bonnie Dundee, who raised an army from Highland [[clan]]s. In Ireland, [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] led local Catholics, who had been discriminated against by previous English monarchs, in the conquest of all the fortified places in the kingdom except [[Derry]], and so held the Kingdom for James. James himself landed in Ireland with 6,000&amp;nbsp;French troops to try to regain the throne in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. The war raged from 1689 to 1691. James fled Ireland following his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, but Jacobite resistance was not ended until after the [[battle of Aughrim]] in 1691, when over half of their army was killed or taken prisoner. The Irish Jacobites surrendered under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] on 3 October 1691. England stayed relatively calm throughout, although some English Jacobites fought on James's side in Ireland. Despite the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]], the uprising in the [[Scottish Highlands]] was quelled due to the death of its leader, Dundee, and Williamite victories at [[Battle of Dunkeld|Dunkeld]] and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]], as well as the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe massacre]] in early 1692. Many, particularly in Ireland and Scotland, continued to see the [[Stuarts]] as the legitimate monarchs of the Three Kingdoms, and there were further Jacobite rebellions in Scotland during the years 1715, 1719 and 1745.

==Anglo-Dutch alliance==
Though he had carefully avoided making it public, William's main motive in organising the expedition had been the opportunity to bring England into an [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|alliance]] against France. On 9&amp;nbsp;December 1688 he had already asked the States General to send a delegation of three to negotiate the conditions. On 18 February (Julian calendar) he asked the Convention to support the Republic in its war against France; but it refused, only consenting to pay £600,000 for the continued presence of the Dutch army in England. On 9 March (Gregorian calendar) the States General responded to Louis's earlier [[Nine Years' War|declaration of war]] by declaring war on France in return. On 19&amp;nbsp;April (Julian calendar) the Dutch delegation signed a naval treaty with England. It stipulated that the combined Anglo-Dutch fleet would always be commanded by an Englishman, even when of lower rank; also it specified that the two parties would contribute in the ratio of five English vessels against three Dutch vessels, meaning in practice that the Dutch navy in the future would be smaller than the English. The [[Navigation Acts]] were not repealed. On 18 May the new Parliament allowed William to declare war on France. On 9 September 1689 (Gregorian calendar), William as King of England joined the [[League of Augsburg]] against France.

===The decline of the Dutch Republic===
Having England as an ally meant that the military situation of the Republic was strongly improved, but this very fact induced William to be uncompromising in his position towards France. This policy led to a large number of very expensive campaigns which were largely paid for with Dutch funds. In 1712 the Republic was financially exhausted; it withdrew from international politics and was forced to let its fleet deteriorate, making what was by then the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] the dominant maritime power of the world. The Dutch economy, already burdened by the high national debt and concomitant high taxation, suffered from the other European states' [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies, which its weakened fleet was no longer able to resist. To make matters worse, the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London after 1688. Between 1688 and 1720, world trade dominance shifted from the Republic to Britain.{{sfn|Vries|Woude|1997|pp=673–87}}

=="Dutch invasion" hypothesis==
After being revisited by historians in 1988—the third centennial of the event—several researchers have argued that the "revolution" was actually a successful Dutch invasion of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vallance|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were unusual because the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]] (a de&amp;nbsp;facto republic, see [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]]) and [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] meant that the apparently invading monarchs, legitimate heirs to the throne, were prepared to govern with the English Parliament. It is difficult to classify the entire proceedings of 1687–89 but it can be seen that the events occurred in three phases: conspiracy, invasion by Dutch forces and "Glorious Revolution". It has been argued that the invasion aspect had been downplayed as a result of a combination of British pride and successful Dutch propaganda, trying to depict the course of events as a largely internal English affair.{{sfn|Jardine|2008|p=27}}

As the invitation was initiated by figures who had little influence themselves, the legacy of the Glorious Revolution has been described as a successful propaganda act by William to cover up and justify his successful invasion.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schwoerer, "Propaganda in the Revolution of 1688-89" ''The American Historical Review'', vol 82 no 4, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  The claim that William was fighting for the Protestant cause in England was used to great effect to disguise the military, cultural and political impact that the Dutch regime had on England at the time.

==Impact==
The overthrow of James was hailed at the time and ever since as the "Glorious Revolution". [[Edmund Burke]] set the tone for over two centuries of historiographical analysis when he proclaimed that:
:The Revolution was made to preserve our ancient indisputable laws and liberties, and that ancient constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty.{{sfn|Goodlad|2007}}{{sfn|Dekrey|2008|pp=738–73}}

Many historians have endorsed Burke's view, including Macaulay (1848) and more recently John Morrill, who captured the consensus of contemporary historiography well when he declared that "the Sensible Revolution of 1688–89 was a conservative Revolution". On the other hand, [[Steven Pincus]] (2009) argues that it was momentous especially when looking at the alternative that James was trying to enact – a powerful centralised autocratic state, using French-style "state-building". England's role in Europe and the country's political economy in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century refutes the view of many late-20th-century historians that nothing revolutionary occurred during the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89. Pincus says it was not a placid turn of events. In diplomacy and economics William III transformed the English state's ideology and policies. This occurred not because William III was an outsider who inflicted foreign notions on England but because foreign affairs and political economy were at the core of the English revolutionaries' agenda. The revolution of 1688–89 cannot be fathomed in isolation. It would have been inconceivable without the changes resulting from the events of the 1640s and 1650s. Indeed, the ideas accompanying the Glorious Revolution were rooted in the mid-century upheavals. Thus, the 17th&amp;nbsp;century was a century of revolution in England, deserving of the same scholarly attention that 'modern' revolutions attract.&lt;ref name="Pincus 2009 loc"&gt;{{harvnb|Pincus|2009|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James II tried building a powerful militarised state on the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] assumption that the world's wealth was necessarily finite and empires were created by taking land from other states. The [[East India Company]] was thus an ideal tool to create a vast new English imperial dominion by warring with the Dutch and the Mogul Empire in India. After 1689 came an alternative understanding of economics, which saw Britain as a commercial rather than an agrarian society. The proponents of this view, most famously [[Adam Smith]] in 1776, argued that wealth was created by human endeavour and was thus potentially infinite.&lt;ref name="Pincus 2009 loc"/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Monarchism |expanded=history}}

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is considered by some as being one of the most important events in the long evolution of the respective powers of Parliament and the Crown in England. With the passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], it stamped out once and for all any possibility of a Catholic monarchy, and ended moves towards [[absolute monarchy]] in the British kingdoms by circumscribing the monarch's powers. These powers were greatly restricted; he or she could no longer suspend laws, levy taxes, make royal appointments, or maintain a standing army during peacetime without Parliament's permission – to this day the Army is known as the "British Army" not the "Royal Army" as it is, in some sense, Parliament's Army and not that of the King. (This is, however, a complex issue, as the Crown remains the source of all executive authority in the British army, with legal implications for unlawful orders etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Windeyer|1938|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1689, government under a system of [[constitutional monarchy]] in England, and later the United Kingdom, has been uninterrupted. Since then, Parliament's power has steadily increased while the Crown's has steadily declined. Unlike in the [[English civil war]] of the mid-seventeenth century, the "Glorious Revolution" did not involve the masses of ordinary people in England (the majority of the bloodshed occurred in Ireland). This fact has led many historians, including Stephen Webb,{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=166}} to suggest that, in England at least, the events more closely resemble a coup d'état than a social revolution.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The importance of the event has divided historians ever since Friedrich Engels judged it "a relatively puny event" ({{harvnb|Engels|1997|p=269}}).&lt;/ref&gt; This view of events does not contradict what was originally meant by "revolution": the coming round of an old system of values in a circular motion, back to its original position, as Britain's constitution was reasserted, rather than formed anew.{{sfn|Mitchell|2009|loc=xvi, xviii, xix}}{{sfn|Black|MacRaid|2000|pp=7, 8}}

Prior to his arrival in England, the new king [[William III of England]] was not [[Church of England|Anglican]], but rather was a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. Consequently, as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] he was now in the unenviable position of being the head of the Church of England, while technically being a [[Nonconformist]]. This was, however, not his main motive for promoting religious toleration. More important in that respect was the need to keep happy his Catholic allies&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;i.e. Spain and the German Emperor&lt;/ref&gt; in the coming struggle with Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV.{{sfn|Israel|2003|pp=137–38}} Though he had promised legal toleration for Catholics in his ''Declaration'' of October 1688, he was ultimately unsuccessful in this respect, due to opposition by the Tories in the new Parliament.{{sfn|Israel|2003|pp=20}} The Revolution led to the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration of 1689]], which granted toleration to [[Nonconformist|Nonconformist Protestants]], but not to Catholics. [[Catholic emancipation]] would be delayed for 140 years.

The [[Williamite War in Ireland]] can be seen as the source of later conflict, including [[The Troubles]] of recent times. The [[Williamite]] victory in Ireland is still commemorated by the [[Orange Order]] for preserving British and Protestant dominance in the country.

In North America, the Glorious Revolution precipitated the [[1689 Boston revolt]] in which a well-organised "mob" of provincial militia and citizens successfully deposed the hated governor [[Edmund Andros]], which has been seen as a precedent for the [[American War of Independence]] a century later.  In New York, [[Leisler's Rebellion]] caused the colonial administrator, [[Francis Nicholson]], to flee to England.  A third event, Maryland's [[Protestant Revolution (Maryland)|Protestant Rebellion]] was directed against the proprietary government, seen as Catholic-dominated.

[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]'s account of the Revolution in ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'' exemplifies its semi-mystical significance to later generations.

'''Guglielmo Ferrero''' ({{IPA-it|ɡuʎˈʎelmo ferˈreːro}}; July 21, 1871 — August 3, 1942) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] historian, journalist and novelist, author of the ''Greatness and Decline of Rome'' (5 volumes, published after English translation 1907–1909). Ferrero devoted his writings to [[classical liberalism]] and he opposed any kind of dictatorship and Big Government. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] twenty times in six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=2964|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Portici]], near [[Naples]], Ferrero studied law in [[Pisa]], [[Bologna]] and [[Turin]]. Soon afterward he married Gina Lombroso,&lt;ref&gt;They had a son, [[Leo Ferrero]] (1903-1933), who was a playwright.&lt;/ref&gt; a daughter of [[Cesare Lombroso]], the criminologist and psychiatrist with whom he wrote [https://archive.org/details/femaleoffender00ferrgoog ''The Female Offender''], ''The Prostitute'' and ''The Normal Woman''. In 1891-1894 Ferrero traveled extensively in Europe and in 1897 wrote ''The Young Europe'', a book which had a strong influence over [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Susan L. (1979). "James Joyce's Debt to Guglielmo Ferrero," ''James Joyce Quarterly,'' Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 239–251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappalardo, Salvatore (2011). [https://rutgers.academia.edu/SalvatorePappalardo/Papers/538084/Waking_Europa_Joyce_Ferrero_and_the_Metamorphosis_of_Irish_History "Waking Europe: Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724182741/http://rutgers.academia.edu/SalvatorePappalardo/Papers/538084/Waking_Europa_Joyce_Ferrero_and_the_Metamorphosis_of_Irish_History |date=2012-07-24 }}, ''Journal of Modern Literature'', Vol. 34, No. 2, pp. 154–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying the history of [[Rome]] Ferrero turned to political essays and novels (''Between Two Worlds'' in 1913, ''Speeches to the Deaf'' in 1925 and ''The Two Truths'' in 1933-1939). When the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] reign of [[Black Shirts]] forced liberal intellectuals to leave Italy in 1925, Ferrero refused and was placed under house arrest. In 1929 Ferrero accepted a [[professorship]] at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva. His last works (''Adventure'', ''Bonaparte in Italy'', ''The Reconstruction of Europe'', ''The Principles of Power'' and ''The Two French Revolutions'') were dedicated to the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleon]]. In 1935 his daughter Nina Ferrero married the [[Yugoslavia]]n diplomat [[Bogdan Raditsa]].

Ferrero was invited to the White House by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. He gave lectures in the northeast of the USA which were collected and published in 1909 as ''Characters and Events of Roman History''. Additionally, Theodore Roosevelt read "The Greatness and Decline of Rome".

He died in 1942 at the [[Mont Pèlerin]], [[Switzerland]].

'''Harald Berntsen''' (born 25 January 1945 in [[Eidanger]]) is a national historian who is active in the radical left in Norway. 

== Background, upbringing and work ==
Berntsen was born and brought up in [[Eidanger]], an area with a strong industrial working class, in which Berntsen first entered politics. Berntsen was himself the son of a [[Norsk Hydro|Hydro]] worker. The working environment at Norsk Hydro was very [[socialism|socialist]] and Berntsen later became politically engaged. 

Berntsen later became a leader in the extreme left environment at [[Blindern]]. He joined [[Kjell Hovden]] in the [[Communist Workers League (Norway)|Kommunistisk Arbeiderforbund]] in 1971, and was named to the central council of the [[Kommunistisk Universitetslag]] (KUL) during the 1970s, when KUL grew to become the student branch of the [[Communist Workers League (Norway)|Kommunistisk Arbeiderforbund]]. Berntsen was one of the leading lights in the KUL, together with [[Jørgen Sandemose]]. On the radical left, Harald Berntsen was one of the [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|AKP's]] bitterest critics. Berntsen was formerly married to [[Gerd-Liv Valla]].

Berntsen has written two historical autobiographies: ''{{lang-no|label=none|Det lange friminuttet}}'' from 1998 which documents the growth of the radical student movement in Norway in the 1960s, and the autobiographical novel ''Ut'' from 2001, which describes his childhood and youth in [[Eidanger]] and [[Herøya]] until he moved to Oslo to be a student.

'''Harold Adams Innis''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a Canadian professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on media, [[communication theory]], and Canadian [[Economy of Canada|economic]] history.  Despite his dense and difficult prose, Innis was one of Canada's most original thinkers. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's [[Culture of Canada|culture]], [[Politics of Canada|political]] history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as [[fur trade|fur]], fishing, lumber, wheat, [[mining|mined metals]], and coal.  The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada 1930s-1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian [[political economy]] tradition.&lt;ref name = "Staples"&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach". In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History''. Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis". In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He warned, however, that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, [[advertising]]-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity".&lt;ref name="Innis"&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual bond with [[Eric A. Havelock]] formed the foundations of the [[Toronto School of communication theory|Toronto School]] of communication theory, which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school: [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1000-e.html|title=Harold Adams Innis|work=Library Archives Canada|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006) ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 14–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. "We are indeed fighting for our lives," he warned, pointing especially to the "pernicious influence of American advertising.... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold A. Innis|title=Changing Concepts of Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuO00eQGdXUC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2004|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views influenced some younger scholars, including [[Donald Creighton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Wright|title=Donald Creighton: A Life in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CSSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239|year=2015|pages=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential to the survival of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) "A Plea for Time". In ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 83–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual disciple and university colleague, [[Marshall McLuhan]], lamented Innis's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press v. 8, p. 8. This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural roots==

===Early life===
&lt;!--Optional image:[[File:Stamp_Canada_1899_2c.jpg|thumb|right|An 1899 postage stamp. Harold Innis was born near the end of the Victorian era when the "Dominion of Canada" was still a self-governing British colony.]]--&gt;
[[File:Harold-Innis-school.gif|thumb|right|The one-room schoolhouse in Otterville, officially known as S.S.#1 South Norwich. The photo was taken around 1906. Innis is the boy with the cap, fifth from the right, back row. Innis would later teach for a few months at the school.]]

Harold Adams Innis was born in 1894 on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of [[Otterville, Ontario|Otterville]] in southwestern Ontario's [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]]. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, Donald. ''Harold Adams Innis: Portrait of a Scholar''. [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him 'Herald', hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical [[Baptist]] faith that she and her husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist Church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis became an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] in later life, but never lost his interest in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert. ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers'', [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friend and biographer [[Donald Creighton]], Innis's character was moulded by the Church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The strict sense of values and the feeling of devotion to a cause, which became so characteristic of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis attended the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community's high school. He travelled {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} by train to [[Woodstock, Ontario]], to complete his secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers' college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University studies===
[[File:RoyalConservatoryofMusic.JPG|thumb|right|The original home of McMaster University at 273 [[Bloor Street]] West, Toronto]]

In October 1913, Innis started classes at [[McMaster University]] (then in Toronto). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was especially influenced by James Ten Broeke, the university's one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life: "Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?"&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 326. Innis refers to this question in the preface to ''The Bias of Communication,'' his book of essays on consciousness and communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near [[Vermilion, Alberta]]. The experience gave him a sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War service===
[[File:Harold Adams Innis.jpg|right|thumb|Harold Innis in uniform]]

After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. He was sent to [[France]] in the fall of 1916 to fight in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 31. Creighton wrote that Innis believed if German aggression went unpunished, it would be fatal to Christian hope for the world. Innis wrote to his sister: "If I had no faith in Christianity, I don't think I would go."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trench warfare]] with its "mud and lice and rats" had a devastating effect on him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from a later Innis letter by Creighton, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Signallers, or spotters, watched where each [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shell]] landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service.

Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis's intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian [[nationalism]]; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to "sell" the war; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate studies==

===McMaster and Chicago===
Harold Innis completed a [[Master of Arts]] at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called ''The Returned Soldier'', "was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 93. Watson notes that 240,000 young Canadians died in the war, while 600,000 were wounded. The war was a devastating blow to Innis's generation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Herbert Mead.jpg|thumb|left|George Herbert Mead]]

Innis did his postgraduate work at the [[University of Chicago]] and was awarded his PhD, with a dissertation on the history of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harold A. |last=Innis |title=A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |origyear=1923 |year=1971 |edition=Reprint |isbn=0-8020-1704-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical theories]], then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was influenced by the university's two eminent communications scholars, [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Robert E. Park]]. Although he did not attend any of these famous professors' classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. [[James W. Carey]] writes that Mead and Park "characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Carey, J. W. (1992). "Space, Time and Communications: A Tribute to Harold Innis". In ''Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society''. New York: Routledge, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of [[Thorstein Veblen]], the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veblen, Innis praised him for waging war against "standardized static economics".&lt;ref&gt;In this 1929 essay, Innis concluded: "Veblen has waged a constructive warfare of emancipation against the tendency toward standardized static economics which becomes so dangerous on a continent with ever increasing numbers of students clamouring for textbooks on final economic theory." (This essay was republished in Innis, ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', pp. 17–26.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis got his first taste of university teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, Md: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc.. p. 5 &amp; pp. 113–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and [[Anne Innis Dagg|Anne]] (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Quayle Innis]] was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, ''An Economic History of Canada'', was published in 1935.&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"&gt;Watson, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Her novel, ''Stand on a Rainbow'' appeared in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Clara. (1946) ''Canadian Novelists: 1920 – 1945'', Toronto: Longmans, Green and Company, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Her other books include ''Mrs. Simcoe's Diary'' (1965), ''The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times'' (1966) and ''Unfold the Years'' (1949), a history of the Young Women's Christian Association.&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"/&gt; She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'' (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his ''Empire and Communications.''&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"/&gt;

[[Donald Quayle Innis]] became a geography professor at the [[State University of New York]], Mary married a surgeon and did graduate work in French literature, Hugh Innis became a professor at [[Ryerson University]] where he taught communications and economics, [[Anne Innis Dagg]] did doctoral work in biology and became an advisor for the Independent Studies program at the [[University of Waterloo]] and published books on zoology, feminism, and Canadian women's history.&lt;ref&gt;http://cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/1391/1472&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the CPR===
[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Donald Alexander Smith drives the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Craigellachie, BC—November 7, 1885]]

Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis argues that "the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1971) ''A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway.'' Revised ed. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment "comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications scholar [[Arthur Kroker]] argues that Innis's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence".&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant.'' Montreal: New World Perspectives, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this [[National Policy]] funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. "Western Canada", Innis wrote, "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp. 290–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staples thesis==
Harold Innis is considered the leading founder of a Canadian school of economic thought known as the staples theory. It holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref name = "Staples" /&gt; Innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce; and, as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others.&lt;ref name = "Neill" /&gt; Innis pointed out, for example, that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined, it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat, [[potash]] and especially lumber. The export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals, and later, railways.&lt;ref name = "Fur Trade" /&gt;

==="Dirt" research===
In 1920, Innis joined the department of political economy at the [[University of Toronto]]. He was assigned to teach courses in commerce, economic history and economic theory. He decided to focus his scholarly research on Canadian economic history, a hugely neglected subject, and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study. Furs had brought French and English traders to Canada, motivating them to travel west along the continent's interlocking lake and river systems to the Pacific coast. Innis realized that he would not only need to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade, but would also have to travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called "dirt" experience.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 49–60. The reference to "dirt" experience appears in Watson, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] to [[Lake Athabasca]]; then down the [[Slave River]] to [[Great Slave Lake]]. They completed their journey down the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]], Canada's longest river, to the [[Arctic Ocean]] on a small [[Hudson's Bay Company]] tug.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the [[Western Arctic]] and the east side of [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Carl. (1976). ''The Writing of Canadian History: Aspects of English-Canadian Historical Writing: 1900–1970.'' Toronto: Oxford University Press. pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everywhere Innis went his methods were the same: he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fur trade in Canada===
{{details|Harold Innis and the fur trade}}
[[File:Beaver-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|North American Beaver, ''Castor canadensis''. Innis argued that it is impossible to understand Canadian history without some knowledge of the beaver's life and habits.]]

Harold Innis's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, ''The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History'' (1930). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the "heroic" European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada's political and economic destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Carl. (1976) ''The Writing of Canadian History''. Toronto: Oxford University Press, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the fur trade largely determined Canada's boundaries, coming to the conclusion that the country "emerged not in spite of geography but because of it".&lt;ref name = "Fur Trade"&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History''. Revised Edition. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 383–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this observation, Innis notably proposes that European settlement of the Saint Lawrence river valley followed the economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples, making for a Canadian historical and cultural continuity that pre-dates and post-dates European settlement. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Dickason, Olive; McNab, David. (2009) ''Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from Earliest Times''. Fourth Edition. Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt; "We have not yet realized," he writes, "that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; This Innisian perspective on the development of Canadian political, economic and social institutions was an early form of neo-institutionalism which became an accepted part of the Canadian political science tradition well before American and European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lecours|first1=Andre|title=New Institutionalism: Theory and Analysis|date=2005|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|jstor=10.3138/9781442677630}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another—furs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance on staples made Canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the "cyclonic" shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country's economic life.&lt;ref name = "Neill"&gt;[[Robin Neill|Neill, Robin]]. (1972) ''A New Theory of Value: The Canadian Economics of H.A. Innis''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fur Trade in Canada'' also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 10-15&lt;/ref&gt; However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. "The new technology with its radical innovations", Innis writes, "brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis "was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;Berger, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cod fishery===
{{details|Harold Innis and the cod fishery}}

After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the [[cod]] fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The result was ''The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy'' published in 1940, 10&amp;nbsp;years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500&amp;nbsp;years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, ''The Cod Fisheries'' looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New England]].

==Communications theories==
{{details|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

Harold Innis's study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007 edition) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, pp. 23–24. Also see, Patterson, Graeme. (1990) ''History and Communications: Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, the Interpretation of History''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, Innis also began studying pulp and paper, an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy. This research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis "followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, from looking at a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it."&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|A Greek copy of Plato's ''Symposium'' from a papyrus roll. Innis argued that Plato's dialogues combined the vitality of the spoken word with the power of writing, a perfect balance between time and space.]]

One of Innis's primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into [[Time- and space-bias|time-binding and space-binding types]]. Time-binding media are durable. They include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p. 104. See also, Heyer, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of powerful communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as "mechanized" communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances. These media had contributed to an obsession with "present-mindedness" wiping out concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine, has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.&lt;ref name="Innis"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp. 61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', September 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'' has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Stamps, J. (1991) ''Negative Dialogues: a study of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan in the light of the negative dialects of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.'' Ottawa: Canada National Library, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of Innis' illness late in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (1988) ''Communications and History: Theories of Media, Knowledge and Civilization''. Westport: Greenwood Press, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and public career==

===Influence in the 1930s===
Aside from his work on ''The Cod Fisheries'', Innis wrote extensively in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada's immense economic problems in the [[Great Depression]]. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see the effects of the Depression for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, in an essay entitled, ''The Canadian Economy and the Depression'', Innis outlined the plight of "a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance", yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a Prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat, yet afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada's growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal–provincial relations. "We lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation", Innis warned, because of "the weak position of the social sciences in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]]. pp. 123–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:old radio.jpg|left|thumb|Radio, a new medium, drew a scathing rebuke from Harold Innis for promoting "small talk" and "bores". Innis believed that both radio and mass circulation newspapers encouraged stereotypical thinking.]]

Innis's reputation as a "public intellectual" was growing steadily and, in 1934, Premier [[Angus Lewis Macdonald|Angus L. Macdonald]] invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine [[Nova Scotia]]'s economic problems. The next year, he helped establish ''The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science''. In 1936, he was appointed a full [[University of Toronto]] professor and a year later, became the head of the university's Department of Political Economy.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was appointed president of the Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, entitled ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which "threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication". Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, ''Essays'', pp. 252–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945. It was a series called ''The Relations of Canada and the United States'' overseen by [[James T. Shotwell]], director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by Canadian scholars. His own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series. His work with Shotwell enabled Innis to gain access to Carnegie money to further Canadian academic research. As John Watson points out, "the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and The Great Depression===
[[File:Richard Bedford Bennett.jpg|thumb|right|[[R.B. Bennett]] was the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Prime Minister of Canada from 1930–35, during the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. Although Innis advocated staying out of politics, he did correspond with Bennett urging him to strengthen the law against business monopolies.]]

The era of the [[Dust Bowl|"Dirty Thirties"]] with its mass unemployment, poverty and despair gave rise to new Canadian political movements. In Alberta, for example, the radio evangelist [[William Aberhart|William "Bible Bill" Aberhart]] led his populist [[Social Credit]] party to victory in 1935. Three years earlier in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], social reformers had founded a new political party, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] or CCF. It advocated democratic socialism and a [[mixed economy]] with [[public ownership]] of key industries. [[Frank Underhill]], one of Innis's colleagues at the University of Toronto was a founding member of the CCF. Innis and Underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself "dissatisfied with the policies of the two major [political] parties in Canada" and that aimed at "forming a definite body of progressive opinion". In 1931, Innis presented a paper to the group on "Economic Conditions in Canada", but he later recoiled from participating in party politics, denouncing partisans like Underhill as "hot gospellers".&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, Eric. (1982) ''Harold Innis: A Memoir''. Toronto: Harold Innis Foundation, pp. 14–15. The reference to "hot gospellers" can be found in the Creighton biography, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead, they should devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. "The university could provide an environment", he wrote, "as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in "The Public Role of the Intellectual", by Liora Salter and Cheryl Dahl. In ''Harold Innis in the New Century.'' (1999) Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban, unemployed workers, Innis did not embrace socialism. [[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]], a left-leaning colleague explained many years later that Innis distrusted political "solutions" imported from elsewhere, especially those based on [[Marxist]] analysis with its emphasis on [[class conflict]]. He worried, too, that as Canada's ties with Britain weakened, the country would fall under the spell of American ideas instead of developing its own based on Canada's unique circumstances. Havelock added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He has been called the radical conservative of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Late career and death===
In the 1940s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based [[Economic History Association]] and its ''[[Journal of Economic History]]''. He later became the association's second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the [[University of New Brunswick]] awarded Innis an honorary degree, as did his alma mater, [[McMaster University]]. [[Université Laval]], the [[University of Manitoba]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] would also confer honorary degrees in 1947–48.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Innis spent nearly a month in the [[Soviet Union]] where he had been invited to attend the 220th anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country's [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his essay ''Reflections on Russia'', he mused about the differences between the Soviet "producer" economy and the West's "consumer" ethos:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n economy which emphasizes consumer's goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners; an economy emphasizing producer's goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support. As a result of this contrast, a common public opinion in Russia and the West is hard to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heyer, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis's trip to Moscow and Leningrad came shortly before U.S.–Soviet rivalry led to the hostility of the [[Cold War]]. Innis lamented this rise in international tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the Soviet Empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American Empire's emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the [[nuclear arms race]], seeing it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval [[Inquisition]]. "The Middle Ages burned its heretics", he wrote, "and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Innis was elected president of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], the country's senior body of scientists and scholars. That same year, he served on the Manitoba Royal Commission on Adult Education and published ''Political Economy in the Modern State'', a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications. In 1947, Innis was appointed the University of Toronto's dean of graduate studies. In 1948, he delivered lectures at the [[University of London]] and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University]]. He also gave the prestigious Beit lectures at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], later published in his book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. In 1949, Innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government's [[List of Canadian Royal Commissions|Royal Commission]] on Transportation, a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 224–25. See also Creighton, pp. 136–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade of his career during which he worked on his communications studies was an unhappy time for Innis. He was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how this new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory. Biographer John Watson writes that "the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works, contributed to his sense of overwork and depression".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 250–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis died of [[prostate cancer]] in 1952 a few days after his 58th birthday. In commemoration, [[Innis College]] at the University of Toronto and Innis Library at [[McMaster University]] were named in his honour.

Following his premature death, Innis' significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings. [[Marshall Poe]]'s general media theory that proposes two sub-theories were inspired by Innis. [[Douglas C. North]] expanded on of Innis' "vent for surplus" theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the United States and underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/harold-adams-innis/|title=Harold Adams Innis|work=EH.Net Encyclopedia|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[James W. Carey]] adopted Innis as a "reference point in his conception of two models of communication".

==Innis and McLuhan==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] was a colleague of Innis's at the University of Toronto. As a young English professor, McLuhan was flattered when he learned that Innis had put his book ''[[Marshall McLuhan#The Mechanical Bride .281951.29|The Mechanical Bride]]'' on the reading list of the fourth-year economics course.&lt;ref&gt;Preface by H. Marshall McLuhan in Havelock, p. 10. Also see Watson, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan built on Innis's idea that in studying the effects of communications media, technological form mattered more than content. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis's concept of the "bias" of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a "less flamboyant precursor to McLuhan's legendary phrase '[[the medium is the message]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis, for example, tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were "biased" toward control over space and secular power, while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were "biased" in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan focused on what may be called a medium's "sensory bias" arguing, for example, that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye, while radio played to the irrationality of the ear.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2003) ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. Corte Madera, California: Gingko Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences in the Innisian and McLuhanesque approaches were summarized by the late James W. Carey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both McLuhan and Innis assume the centrality of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has much to say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. "Harold Adams Innis and Marshall McLuhan" in ''McLuhan Pro and Con'' (1969) Baltimore: Pelican Books, p. 281. Graeme Patterson strongly disagrees with this view arguing that Innis paid an extraordinary amount of attention to perception and thought, while McLuhan examined institutions. Both Innis and McLuhan, Patterson argues, were preoccupied with language, one of humanity's basic institutions. See Patterson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biographer John Watson notes that Innis's work was profoundly political while McLuhan's was not. He writes that "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, is the key to Innis's work. This also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. "For Innis, the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the "[[dialectic]] of power and knowledge" in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 410–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As scholars and teachers, Innis and McLuhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought; yet both produced many books. In his introduction to the 1964 reprint of ''The Bias of Communication'', McLuhan marvelled at Innis's technique of juxtaposing "his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms". McLuhan argued that although this made reading Innis's dense prose difficult—"a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate"—Innis's method approximated "the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse". Best of all, it yielded "insight" and "pattern recognition" rather than the "classified knowledge" so overvalued by print-trained scholars. "How exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration", McLuhan added.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, v.8, pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan's own books with their reliance on aphorisms, puns, quips, "probes" and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ this mosaic technique.

Innis's theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he had a profound influence on [[Media studies|critical media theory]] and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, (McLuhan Pro and Con), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical Medieval Battles''' (HMB) is a rather young modern sport, full contact fighting with the use of offensive and defensive weapons characteristic of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://middleagestoday.com/en/node/818 |title=Historical Medieval Battles. What is it? |publisher=Middle Ages Today |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204065806/http://middleagestoday.com/en/node/818 |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the armour and weapons must be of the style from the dates 1200 to 1699, with location irrelevant. HMB is a full contact fighting on steel blunt weapons. Fighters are dressed in full armor, which, like the weapons, is made according to historical standards. One person's full set of armour must originate from the same place and within a fifty-year time span. Blows may be aimed at any parts of the body (with the limitations set in the regulations); both wrestling and percussive techniques are permitted.

Unlike staged battles, that can be seen at festivals of historical reenactment of the [[Middle Ages]], the battles are held in full contact, are refereed by the referees who have special training and combat experience.

Historical medieval battle is a sporting component of [[historical reenactment]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Battles of the athletes usually take place at festivals of historical reenactment. The main competition for the fighters practitising them, has recently become [[Battle of the Nations (Medieval Tournament)|"Battle of the Nations"]], an international championship on historical medieval battle.

The main idea of this element of reenactment is, on the one hand, the maximum competitive component for the participants, on the other - an opportunity to test the historical equipment in conditions close to a real combat. Therefore, to participate in battles one needs equipment that once really existed.

In order to reduce injuries the equipment is thoroughly checked before battles, all the weapons are blunt.

Unlike historical fencing, historical medieval battle takes a lot from modern martial arts, with wrestling technique as an important component, which is not forbidden, and even mandatory.

==History==
Historical medieval battle dates back to the first large-scale battles with the use of steel arms, which were held in Russia in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, at times when in the rest of the CIS countries reenactors used wooden or textolite weapons. An example is the festival "Zhelezny Grad" (Iron Town) held in Izborsk, where buhurts involving hundreds of fighters took place.

Tournaments on historical medieval battle gradually began to take place in neighboring states, namely Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, but they reached European countries not immediately.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

==Competitive categories==
Historical medieval battle, like any other sport, has several categories. All its categories can be divided into mass and single ones.&lt;ref name="battleofthenations1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sash Kernel |url=http://battleofthenations.ua/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=9&amp;lang=en |title=Battle of the Nations - Unified International Rules |publisher=Battleofthenations.ua |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single categories===
Single categories, namely "one vs one" are divided into tournaments and professional fights in their turn.

====Tournaments====
Points / hits are counted in tournaments (duels); a fighter has to deliver a certain number of blows (usually 10) to his opponent, or gain the maximum number of points within a certain period of time (2–3 minutes). The tournaments in turn are divided into:

* '''"Shield-sword"''' (fighters compete with each other, using a shield and sword)
* '''"Sword-sword"''' (each fighter has a one-handed [[sword]] and no [[shield]])
* '''"Longsword"''' (men use [[longsword]]s)
* '''"Nonstandard"''' (weapons that do not fit the first two categories: halberd, two-handed ax, two-handed swords, etc. are used for fighting).

There is also a category called "Triathlon": three rounds with different weapons, the first one - "longsword", the second one - "sword-[[buckler]]", the third one - "shield-sword."

====Professional fights====
The second "single" HMB category is professional fights. A fight is held in the format of "three rounds of three minutes." According to the rules, any techniques aimed at delivering blows to any part of the body, except for the neck, back of the knee, groin, eyes, feet, and back of the head, if an opponent is bent, are allowed (except for thrusts, which are prohibited in all HMB categories). All other things, including 3-second ground fighting with no active movements of the opponents are allowed.

===Mass categories===
* '''"5 vs 5"'''
* '''"12 vs 12"'''
* '''"30 vs 30"'''
* '''Buhurts'''

The rules of mass battles are slightly different. The “kill zones” are the same, but the winner is the one who remains standing on his feet, hits are not counted.&lt;ref name="battleofthenations1"/&gt;

In addition to these categories, there are some others, such as the "2 vs 2" (which is held in the “deathmatch” mode: several two-member units meet on the lists, the battle is "all against all" and the winner is the two-member unit, of which at least one fighter is on his feet); "10 vs 10" and others. HMB categories often can be created for a specific festival, depending on its objectives and specific requirements of historicity.

==Training and preparation of fighters==
Workouts are held in accordance with the most effective modern methods of training available in the martial arts. HMB fighters practise weight lifting (because to fight in armor, weighing thirty kg, one must be relatively strong, and have good coordination of movements), related martial arts (wrestling, sambo, Muay Thai, MMA etc.), run. etc. Fighters often use groundwork of other contact martial arts in their training practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://middleagestoday.com/en/node/813 |title=HMB, HEMA and sport fencing: practical comparison |publisher=Middle Ages Today |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
There are unified international rules for the battles. They prohibit a number of very traumatic techniques, as well as regulate the admission of fighters and their weapons in order to observe the historical reliability of equipment, and also to eliminate serious injuries. Due to the fact that different countries used to have different fighting rules, the first unified rules were developed specifically for the world championship on historical medieval battle, "Battle of the Nations." However, the rules used at a local tournament may still differ (for example it may be prohibited to deliver blows to certain areas, e.g. below the knee, elbow, etc.), but the international rating events are conducted in accordance with the accepted international rules for historical medieval battles.&lt;ref name="battleofthenations1"/&gt;

'''Ignatius Loyola Donnelly''' (November 3, 1831 – January 1, 1901) was a [[U.S. Congressman]], [[populism|populist]] writer, and [[fringe science|amateur scientist]]. He is known primarily now for his theories concerning [[Atlantis]], [[Catastrophism]] (especially the idea of an ancient [[impact event]] affecting ancient civilizations), and [[Shakespearean authorship]], which many modern historians consider to be [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]].  Donnelly's work corresponds to the writings of late 19th and early 20th century figures such as [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], and [[James Churchward]].

==Life and career==
Donnelly was the son of Philip Carrol Donnelly, an Irish Catholic immigrant who had settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His sister was the writer [[Eleanor C. Donnelly]]. On June 29, 1826, Philip had married Catherine Gavin, a second generation American of Irish ancestry.

After starting as a peddler, Philip studied medicine at the [[Philadelphia College of Medicine]]. He later contracted [[typhus]] from a patient and died at age 31, leaving his wife with five children.

Catherine provided for her children by operating a pawn shop. Ignatius, her youngest son, was admitted to the prestigious [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], the second oldest public high school in the United States. There he studied under the presidency of John S. Hart, excelling primarily in literature.

Donnelly decided to become a lawyer, and became a clerk for [[Benjamin H. Brewster|Benjamin Brewster]], who later became Attorney-General of the United States. Donnelly was admitted to the bar in 1852. In 1855, he married Katherine McCaffrey, with whom he had three children. In 1855, he resigned his clerkship, entered politics, and participated in communal home building schemes. He quit the Catholic Church some time in the 1850s, and thereafter was never active in any religious group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter H. Conser|author2=Sumner B. Twiss|title=Religious Diversity and American Religious History: Studies in Traditions and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8A1nN66yRYC&amp;pg=PA185|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donnelly moved to the [[Minnesota]] Territory in 1857 amidst rumors of financial scandal, and there he settled in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]]. He initiated a [[utopian]] community called [[Nininger, Minnesota|Nininger City]], together with several partners. However, the [[Panic of 1857]] doomed the attempt at a [[Cooperative farming|cooperative farm]] and community, and left Donnelly deeply in debt.

His wife Katherine died in 1894. In 1898, he married his secretary, Marian Hanson.

Donnelly died on January 1, 1901, in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, age 69 years. He is buried at [[Calvary Cemetery, St. Paul, Minnesota|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. His personal papers are archived at the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnpals.net/F?RN=248036921&amp;func=file&amp;file_name=basic MnPALS Union Catalog – Basic Search&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.mnpals.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and literary career==
Donnelly entered politics and was lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 1860–1863. He was a [[Radical Republican]] Congressman from Minnesota in the [[38th United States Congress|38th]], [[39th United States Congress|39th]], and [[40th United States Congress|40th congresses]], (1863–1869), a state senator from 1874–1878 and 1891-1894 and a state representative from 1887-1888 and 1897-1898.&lt;ref name=mnlrl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail?ID=12571|title=Donnelly, Ignatius|work=Legislators, Past and Present|publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[legislator]], he advocated extending the powers of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] to provide education for freedmen so that they could protect themselves once the bureau was withdrawn. Donnelly was also an early supporter of [[women's suffrage]]. After leaving the Minnesota State Senate in 1878, he returned to his law practice and writing.

In 1877, Donnelly spoke at a meeting of 10,000 people where he read his preamble to the conference platform. The document of twelve short paragraphs, as altered slightly for the party’s first nominating convention in Omaha that July, was the pithiest—and soon became the most widely circulated—statement of the Populist credo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Populist Persuasion|last=Kazin|first=Michael|publisher=eReader|year=1995|isbn=978-0801485589|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Donnelly talked about the corruption of politics and voting, newspapers giving out false and bias material, and how the Populists needed to take back the country that was their own.

In 1882, he published ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'', his best known work.  It details theories concerning the mythical [[lost continent]] of [[Atlantis]]. The book sold well, and is widely credited with initiating the theme of Atlantis as an [[antediluvian]] civilization that became such a feature of popular literature during the 20th century, and contributed to the emergence of [[Mayanism]]. Donnelly suggested that Atlantis, whose story was told by [[Plato]] in the dialogues of [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Critias]], had been destroyed during the same event remembered in the Bible as the [[Great Flood]].  He cited research on the ancient [[Maya civilization]] by [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], claiming that it had been the place of a common origin of ancient civilizations in Africa (especially [[ancient Egypt]]), Europe, and the Americas).  He also thought that it had been the original home of an [[Aryan]] race whose red-haired, blue-eyed descendants could be found in Ireland.

A year after ''Atlantis'', he published ''[[Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel]]'', in which he expounded his belief that the Flood (as well as the destruction of Atlantis and the extinction of the mammoth) had been brought about by the near-collision of the earth with a massive comet. This book also sold well, and both books seem to have had an important influence on the development of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s controversial ideas half a century later.

[[File:IgnatiusDonnelly1898.jpg|thumb|right|Donnelly circa 1898 by [[Frederick Gutekunst]]]]

In 1888, he published ''The Great Cryptogram'' in which he proposed that [[Shakespeare]]'s plays had been [[Baconian theory|written by Francis Bacon]], an idea that was popular during the late 19th and early 20th century. He then travelled to England to arrange the English publication of his book by Sampson Low, speaking at the Oxford (and Cambridge) Union, where his thesis "Resolved, that the works of William Shakespeare were composed by Francis Bacon" was put to an unsuccessful vote.  The book was a complete failure and Donnelly was discredited.

Donnelly also made several other campaigns for public office during the 1880s. He made a losing campaign for Congress (this time as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]) in 1884. In 1887, he successfully campaigned for a seat in the Minnesota State Legislature as an Independent. During this period, he was also an organizer of the [[Farmers' Alliance|Minnesota Farmers' Alliance]].

In 1892, Donnelly wrote the preamble of the [[People's Party (US)|People's Party]]'s [[Omaha Platform]] for the presidential campaign of that year. He was nominated for Vice President of the United States in 1900 by the People's Party, also known as the Populist Party. The People's Party was a development of the national Farmers' Alliance, and had a platform that demanded abandonment of the [[gold standard]] (and later for [[free silver]]), abolition of [[national bank]]s, a [[graduated income tax]], [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|direct election of senators]], civil service reform, and an [[eight-hour day]]. That year, Donnelly also campaigned for governor of Minnesota, but was defeated.

The People's Party protested the railroad companies corrupting government, and advocated government regulation of the railroads. Donnelly had a key leadership role in this party, yet he received $10,000 from the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company.&lt;ref&gt;Lens, Sidney. The Labor Wars: From the Molly Maguires to the Sitdowns. Doubleday &amp; Co.: NY, 1973. 365 pp., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State park==
During the 1930s, an organization was formed to lobby for the creation of a state park at Donnelly's home at [[Nininger, Minnesota|Nininger]] near [[Hastings, Minnesota|Hastings]], Minnesota. The house was still standing in 1939, but the effort failed and the house has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;A personal reminiscence of a visit to Nininger during the 1930s is available at the [http://www.sacred-texts.com/atl/ataw/wolcott.htm Internet Sacred Text Archive|Sacred-Texts website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Donnelly's writings on Atlantis have been rejected by scholars and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Linse, Pat. (2002). ''Atlantis: The Search for a Lost Continent''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 297-307. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a [[Crank (person)|crank]] and [[pseudoscience]] promoter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 35-37. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, E. Randall. (2005). ''The Good, the Bad and the Mad: Some Weird People in American History''. Fall River Press. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-0760766002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Stein]] has noted that "most of what Donnelly said was highly questionable or downright wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. p. 52. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic studies''' refers to the study of [[Islam]]. Islamic studies can be seen under at least two perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pHweBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA2 The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies], 2013, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

* From a secular perspective, Islamic studies is a field of academic research whose subject is Islam as religion and civilization. 

* From a traditional Islamic perspective, Islamic studies is an [[umbrella term]] for religious sciences ('''Ulum al-din'') pursued by the [[ulama]].

==Overview==
In a [[Muslim]] context, '''Islamic studies''' is the [[umbrella term]] for the Islamic sciences ('''Ulum al-din''). It includes all the traditional forms of religious thought, such as ''[[kalam]]'' (Islamic theology) and ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), but also incorporates fields generally considered [[secular]] in the West, such as [[Islamic science]] and [[Islamic economics]].

In a non-Muslim context, Islamic studies generally refers to the [[History of Islam|historical study of Islam]]: [[Islamic civilization (disambiguation)|Islamic civilization]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, [[Islamic history]] and [[historiography]], [[Islamic law]], [[Islamic theology]] and [[Islamic philosophy]]. Academics from diverse disciplines participate and exchange ideas about Islamic societies, past and present, although Western, academic Islamic studies itself is in many respects a self-conscious and self-contained field. Specialists in the discipline apply methods adapted from several ancillary fields, ranging from [[Biblical studies]] and [[classical philology]] to [[modern history]], [[legal history]] and [[sociology]]. A recent trend, particularly since [[9/11]], has been the study of contemporary [[Islamist]] groups and movements by academics from the [[social sciences]] or in many cases by journalists, although since such works tend to be written by non-[[Arabists]] they belong outside the field of Islamic studies proper.

Scholars in the field of academic Islamic studies are often referred to as "Islamicists" and the discipline traditionally made up the bulk of what used to be called [[Oriental studies]].  In fact, some of the more traditional Western universities still confer degrees in Arabic and Islamic studies under the primary title of "Oriental studies".  This is the case, for example, at the [[University of Oxford]], where Classical Arabic and Islamic studies have been taught since as early as the 16th century, originally as a sub-division of [[Divinity]]. This latter context gave early academic Islamic studies its Biblical studies character and was also a consequence of the fact that throughout early-Modern Western Europe the discipline was developed by churchmen whose primary aim had actually been to refute the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Irwin, 'For Lust of Knowing: the Orientalists and their Enemies'.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their now generally secular, academic approach, many non-Muslim Islamic studies scholars have written works which are widely read by Muslims, while in recent decades an increasing number of Muslim-born scholars have trained and taught as academic Islamicists in Western universities. Many leading universities in Europe and the US offer [[academic degrees]] at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in Islamic studies, in which students can also study Arabic and therefore begin to read Islamic texts in the original language. Because Arabic and Islamic studies are generally seen as inseparable in academia, named undergraduate degrees that combine the two are usually still categorized as single-subject degrees rather than as 'joint' or 'combined' degrees like, for example, those in Arabic and Politics. This rationale explains why, because of their heavy emphasis on the detailed study of Islamic texts in [[Classical Arabic]], some institutions{{spaced ndash}}such as the School of Oriental and African Studies ([[SOAS]]) in London and [[Georgetown University]] in Washington DC{{spaced ndash}}only accept graduates who already have degree-level Arabic and a strong background in the academic study of Islam onto their Masters programmes in Islamic studies. Such institutions will generally direct students new to the field and with little or no Arabic to broader master's degrees in [[Middle Eastern studies]] or [[Middle East politics]], in which Arabic can be studied ''[[ab initio]]''.

A recent HEFCE report emphasises the increasing, strategic importance for Western governments since [[9/11]] of Islamic studies in [[higher education]] and also provides an international overview of the state of the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2008/re0708/rd07_08.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Islamic studies is often argued by Muslims, to begin with, the founding of the Islamic religion by [[Abraham]], continue throughout the history of Judaism with Islamic Prophets such as David and Solomon, then early Christianity with Jesus in particular, and then up to modern times with the final revelation of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|163|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to understand [[Islam]] as a topic of modern scholarship (as opposed to a Christological heresy) was within the context of 19th-century Christian European [[Oriental studies]].

In the years 1821 to 1850, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in England, the [[Société Asiatique]] in France, the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] in Germany, and the [[American Oriental Society]] in the United States were founded.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World: [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0395 ''Islamic Studies''] - History of the field, Methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd half of the 19th century, philological and historical approaches were predominant. Leading in the field were German researchers like [[Theodore Nöldeke]] 's study on the history of the Quran, or [[Ignaz Goldziher]] 's work on the prophetic tradition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Western orientalists and Muslim scholars alike preferred to interpret the history of Islam in a conservative way. They did not question the traditional account of the early time of Islam, of Muhammad and how the Quran was written.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies]] questioned the uncritical adherence to traditional Islamic sources and started to develop a new picture of the earliest times of Islam by applying the [[historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

===History of Islam===
{{main|History of Islam}}
To understand the history of Islam provides the indispensable basis to understand all aspects of Islam and its culture. Themes of special interest are:

* [[Historicity of Muhammad]]
* [[Early Muslim conquests]]

===Theology===
{{Main|Islamic theology|Kalam}}
''Kalam'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|علم الكلام}}}}) is one of the "religious sciences" of Islam. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word means "discussion" and refers to the Islamic tradition of seeking theological principles through [[dialectic]]. A scholar of ''kalam'' is referred to as a ''mutakallim''.

* [[Islamic eschatology]]

===Mysticism===
{{main|Sufism}}

Sufism ({{lang|ar|{{big|تصوف}}}} ''taṣawwuf'') is a [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[tradition]] of Islam based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as it is gradually revealed to the heart and mind of the Sufi (one who practices Sufism).

It might also be referred to as Islamic mysticism. While other branches of Islam generally focus on [[exoteric]] aspects of religion, Sufism is mainly focused on the direct perception of [[truth]] or [[God]] through mystic practices based on divine love. Sufism embodies a number of [[culture]]s, philosophies, central teachings and bodies of [[esoteric knowledge]].

===Law===
{{main|Sharia|Fiqh}}
Islamic jurisprudence relates to everyday and social issues in the life of Muslims. It is divided in fields like:
* the study of [[sharia]] law
* [[Islamic economics]]
* [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] studies  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11796624/Knowledge_of_Shariah_and_Knowledge_to_Manage_Self_and_System_Integration_of_Islamic_Epistemology_with_the_Knowledge_and_Education|title=Knowledge of Shariah and Knowledge to Manage ‘Self’ and ‘System’: Integration of Islamic Epistemology with the Knowledge and Education|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key distinctions include those between ''[[fiqh]]'', ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[ijtihad]]''.

===Philosophy===
{{main|Islamic philosophy}}
Islamic philosophy is a part of Islamic studies. It is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between [[faith]], reason or [[philosophy]], and the religious teachings of [[Islam]]. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[List of Muslim philosophers|Muslim philosopher]].

It is divided in fields like:
* [[Early Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Avicennism]]
** [[Averroism]]
* [[Islamic philosophy]]
* [[Modern Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Sufi philosophy]]
** [[Transcendent theosophy]]
* [[List of Muslim philosophers]]
* [[Illuminationist philosophy]]
* [[Islamic ethics]]
* [[Sufi metaphysics]]

===Sciences===
{{main|Islam and science|Science in medieval Islam}}
[[Islam and science]] is [[science]] in the context of traditional religious ideas of [[Islam]], including its [[ethics]] and prohibitions. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[Muslim scientist]]

This is not the same as science as conducted by any [[Muslim]] in a secular context. Certain [[liberal movements in Islam]] eschew the practice of Islamic science, arguing that science should be considered separate from religion as it is today in the West. As in [[Catholicism]] however, believers argue that the guiding role of religion in forming ethics of science cannot be ignored and must impose absolute constraints on inquiry.
* [[Qur'an and science]]
* [[Islamic creationism]]

[[Science in medieval Islam]] examines the full range of scientific investigation in the [[Muslim world]], whether performed within a religious or secular context. Significant progress in science was made in the Muslim world during the [[Middle Ages]], especially during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], which is considered a major period in the [[history of science]].
* [[Timeline of Islamic science and engineering]]
* [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam]]
* [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]]
** [[Islamic astrology]]
* [[Inventions in medieval Islam]]
* [[Mathematics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Medicine in medieval Islam]]
** [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Physics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]

===Literature===
{{main|Islamic literature}}
* [[Arabic literature]]
** [[Arabic epic literature]]
* [[Islamic poetry]]
** [[Arabic poetry]]
* [[Persian literature]]

This field includes the study of [[Arabic Language|modern]] and [[classical Arabic]] and the literature written in those languages. It also often includes other modern, classic or ancient languages of the [[Middle East]] and other areas that are or have been part of, or influenced by, Islamic culture, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Azeri|Azerbaijanian]] and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].

===Architecture===
{{main|Islamic architecture}}
Islamic architecture is the entire range of architecture that has evolved within [[Muslim culture]] in the course of the [[history of Islam]]. Hence the term encompasses religious buildings as well as secular ones, historic as well as modern expressions and the production of all places that have come under the varying levels of Islamic influence.

It is very common to mistake [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] for Islamic architecture.

===Art===
{{main|Islamic art}}
* [[Islamic calligraphy]]
* [[Islamic pottery]]
* [[Muslim music]]

[[Islam]]ic visual [[art]] has, throughout history, been mainly abstract and decorative, portraying geometric, floral, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] designs. Unlike the strong tradition of portraying the human figure in [[Christian art]], Islamic art is typically distinguished as not including depictions of human beings. The lack of [[portrait]]ure is due to the fact that early Islam forbade the painting of human beings, especially [[Muhammad|the Prophet]], as Muslims believe this tempts followers of the Prophet to [[idolatry]]. This prohibition against human beings or icons is called [[aniconism]]. Despite such a prohibition, depictions of human beings do occur Islamic art, such as that of the [[Mughals]], demonstrating a strong diversity in popular interpretation over the pre-modern period. Increased contact with the [[western world|Western civilization]] may also have contributed to human depictions in Islamic art in modern times.

===Comparative religion===
{{main|Islam and other religions}}
Islamic [[comparative religion]] is the study of religions in the view of Islam. This study may be undertaken from a conservative [[Muslim]] perspective, which often sees [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] as having been originally similar to Islam, and later developing away from the root monotheist religion. However, some [[liberal movements within Islam]] dispute the conservative view as being ahistorical; they claim that Islam is the end-result rather than the origin point of monotheist thought.

* [[Islam and Christianity]]
* [[Islam and Jainism]]
* [[Islam and Judaism]]
** [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)]]

===Economics===
{{main|Islamic economic jurisprudence}}
Islamic economics is [[economics]] in accordance with [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Because the [[Qur'an]] spoke against [[usury]] in the context of early Muslim society, it generally entails trying to remove or redefine [[interest rates]] from financial institutions. In doing so, Islamic economists hope to produce a more "Islamic society". However, [[liberal movements within Islam]] may deny the need for this field, since they generally see Islam as compatible with modern secular institutions and law.

===Psychology===

* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Sufi psychology]]

===Islam and Modernity===
An interesting field of study is how Islam reacts on the contact with Western modernity, and how Islam can catch up with modernity without betraying itself. These studies comprise Islamic history, Islamic theology, Islamic Mysticism, and Islamic philosophy, as well as the study of Western philosophy, sociology and politology.

'''Rev. Fr. Jesús María Cavanna y Manso''', C.M., was a [[Catholic]] [[priest]] from the order of the [[Congregation of the Mission]], more commonly known as the Vincentian Fathers. He was the author of ''Rizal's Unfading Glory'' published in 1956,  a documentary of [[Jose Rizal]]'s conversion to Catholicism. Another book Fr. Cavanna wrote is the ''Basic Christian Doctrine ''(1982).

Fr. Cavanna was of Filipino-Spanish heritage. He often spoke in [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] but he was also very [[Fluency|fluent]] in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (Philippines' national language), and Latin. He spent his last years as a formator, spiritual advisor and teacher to Vincentian Seminarians in [[Quezon City]].

Fr. Cavanna died in San Juan De Dios Hospital in 1994. He was a well loved and respected member of the Vincentian family.

'''Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury''' (1715-1810) was a member of the distinguished Joly de Fleury family, originally from [[Burgundy]], from which came a number of leading French magistrates and officials under the [[Ancien Régime|ancien regime]]. He is notable for four principal things: his strong opposition to the [[philosophes]] and the publication of the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'' in 1759; his role in the expulsion of the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]; his involvement in the [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Lally Tollendal Affair]]; and his ban on inoculation against smallpox in June 1763. In a pun on his name, [[Voltaire]] described him as ‘ni Homère, ni joli, ni fleuri' ( = neither [[Homer]], nor pretty, nor flowery, a sarcastic comment on his apparently dreary oratory). In one of his private letters, Voltaire described him as a ‘little black balloon puffed up with stinking vapours’ &lt;ref&gt;Guiragossian Diana, Voltaire’s Faceties,Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1963 p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He was the son of {{ill|Guillaume-François Joly de Fleury|fr}}, {{ill|Procurator General of the Parlement of Paris|lt=Procurator General|fr|Procureur général au Parlement de Paris}} of the [[Parlement of Paris]] and of [[Marie Francoise Le Maistre]]. His brothers were [[Guillaume-François-Louis Joly de Fleury]] (1710-1787) who succeeded their father in his post as Procurator General, and [[Jean-François Joly de Fleury]] (1718-1802), [[intendant]] of [[Dijon]] and [[Administrator-General|Administrator General]] of Finances. Joseph-Omer himself was [[Advocate General]] to the [[Grand Conseil]] (1737-1746), from 1746, to the Parlement of Paris, and ultimately became [[président à mortier]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?iz=263013&amp;n=joly+de+fleury&amp;oc=0&amp;p=omer accessed 17/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bisson de Barthélemy, ''Les Joly de Fleury, procureurs généraux au Parlement de Paris au XVIIIe siècle'', Sedes, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the ''Encyclopédie''==
On 7 February 1752, after the second volume of the ''Encyclopédie'' was published, Joly de Fleury charged in a decree presented to the Grand Conseil that "these two volumes...insert several maxims tending to destroy Royal Authority, to institute the spirit of independence and revolt, and, in obscure and ambiguous words, to erect the foundations of error, of the corruption of morals, of irreligion and unbelief".&lt;ref&gt;Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, Anna-Teresa (ed.)Analecta Husserliana vol LIV, Ontopoietic Expansion in Human Self-Interpretation-in-Existence, Kluwer Academic Publishers p.219&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting controversy was only settled when the editors agreed that all future volumes were to be reviewed by censors personally appointed by [[Jean-François Boyer|Bishop Boyer]], the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s [[preceptor]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom Philipp, Encyclopedie: The Triumph of Reason in an Unreasonable Age, Fourth Estate London 2004 p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1759, following the publication of the seventh volume of the ''Encyclopedie'', with its controversial article on [[Geneva]], Joly de Fleury condemned it again, together with [[Claude Adrien Helvétius|Helvetius']] ''[[De l’esprit|De l’Esprit]]'' and six other books to the Paris Parlement. His opening statement was ‘Society, the State and Religion present themselves today at the tribunal of justice… their rights have been violated, their laws disregarded. Impiety walks with head held high…. Humanity shudders, the citizenry is alarmed.’&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Garland E &amp; MacLeod Roy M (eds), Science, History and Social Activism Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht 2001 p.49&lt;/ref&gt; These evils he blamed on ‘a sect of so-called Philosophers (the [[Philosophes]])… who imagined a project… to destroy the basic truths engraved in our hearts by the hand of the Creator, to abolish his cult and his ministers, and to establish instead Materialism and Deism.’  As a result of his speech the Parlement banned the publishers of the Encyclopedie from selling any more copies, and established a commission of enquiry to look in detail at the content of the seven published volumes. In March 1759 Parlement revoked the Encyclopedie’s permission to publish altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Garland E &amp; MacLeod Roy M (eds), Science, History and Social Activism Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht 2001 p.53&lt;/ref&gt;  After this ban, work on the remaining volumes of the Encyclopedie had to continue underground. ''De L’Esprit'' and seven other publications were ordered to be lacerated and burned in front of the Palais de Justice on 10 February.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Jonathan, Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights 1750-1790 Oxford University Press 2011 p.79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765 Joly de Fleury further demanded, and secured, a condemnation by Parlement of Voltaire’s ''Dictionnaire Philosophique''.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson,Ian, Voltaire, A Life, Profile Books, London 2010 p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the Jesuits==
The Parlement of Paris and the Jesuit Order were often at odds in eighteenth-century France. In 1759 the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal &lt;ref&gt;Lacouture, Jean, Jesuits, The Harvill Press, London 1995 p.270&lt;/ref&gt;  and tensions in France escalated around a [[Suppression of the Jesuits#France|complex fraud]] which involved a number of court cases in the 1750s and early 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture, Jean, Jesuits, The Harvill Press, London 1995 p.275&lt;/ref&gt;
On 6 August 1762, on the initiative of Joly de Fleury, the Parlement of Paris issued a decree depriving the Jesuits of all of their property. It required them to cease to live in their communities and to disperse. It forbade them to correspond with each other or to exercise any function.&lt;ref&gt;Daurignac JMS, History of the Society of Jesus from its Foundation to the Present Time  J.Murphy, Baltimore  1878 p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Later Joly de Fleury regretted the part he had played in the suppression of the order, whose equal, he then said, could not be found in science and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Daurignac JMS, History of the Society of Jesus from its Foundation to the Present Time  J.Murphy, Baltimore  1878 p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to inoculation==
The practice of [[inoculation]] against smallpox was introduced to Paris by an Italian doctor named [[Gatti]] and by 1763 he had inoculated ninety-seven people. However, there was public consternation when some of those he had inoculated did not remain in quarantine as prescribed, and went freely around the city, potentially risking the health of others.  It was said that this was the origin of the epidemic that struck Paris in late 1762 and early 1763. 
Joly de Fleury responded to this emergency by asking the Paris Parlement to vote to refer the question of inoculation to the Faculties of Medicine and Theology at the [[Sorbonne]]. In June 1763 the Parlement ordered that no further inoculations take place in Paris until the Faculties had rendered their judgement on the matter. Inoculations were allowed to continue outside the city, and those already inoculated were required to maintain quarantine for six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bazin, H, Vaccination: A History from Lady Montagu to Genetic Engineering Editions Lohn Libby Eurotext 2011 p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

This apparently pragmatic approach quickly foundered as the physicians could not agree and published rival reports. This started a war of polemics between proponents and opponents of the practice, which effectively became a proxy for the continued struggle between the philosophes and the clerical conservatives. Joly de Fleury was  the object of much mockery and abuse during these exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, HN, Later Queens of the French Stage, Harper &amp; Brothers London 1906&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Joly de Fleury’s efforts made him the target of one of Voltaire’s satirical pamphlets, or facéties. Not only did Voltaire hate him for his opposition to the philosophes, but he was also in favour of inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire’s Faceties Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1963 p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lally Tollendal Affair==
Joly de Fleury was also involved in one of the longest-running and most acrimonious legal disputes in late eighteenth century France, the Lally-Tollendal case. [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Lally Tollendal]] was a French commander in India. Defeated by the British, he was taken as a prisoner of war to England. He was falsely accused of treason, and returned to France to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson,Ian, Voltaire, A Life, Profile Books, London 2010 p.359&lt;/ref&gt;  Joly de Fleury brought formal charges against him, but when his trial began in 1764, Lally Tollendal had not received any documentation of the charges, and was not allowed a defence lawyer. Throughout the trial, which lasted for two years, Lally Tollendal fought against Joly de Fleury’s charges but on 6 May 1766 he was convicted and sentenced to death. On learning of his execution Voltaire began to campaign for his posthumous rehabilitation, which was obtained from [[Louis XVI]] in 1778. The case was considered to be one of the great miscarriages of justice in [[Ancien Régime|ancien regime]] France.

==Biography==
José Mancisidor Ortiz was born on April 20, 1894, in [[Veracruz (Veracruz)|Veracruz]], [[Veracruz]], Mexico, the fifth of eleven children to Jorge Tomás Mancisidor Oyarzábal (1860–1921) and Catalina Ortiz Alpuche: Jorge, Rodolfo, Catalina, Esperanza, José, Anselmo, Carmela, Raimundo, María, Emilio and Francisco.&lt;ref name = "Marín"&gt;Marín Marín, Alvaro. [http://www.geomundos.com/sociedad/universidades/el-profesor-jose-mancisidor-ortiz_doc_5467.html "El profesor José Mancisidor Ortiz: biografía de un notable profesor veracruzano,"] ''Sociedad mexicana, universidades y cultura'', March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bustos Cerecedo, Miguel. "José Mancisidor, el hombre," ''Obras Completas de José Mancisidor'', Vol. I, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his primary education from the "Francisco Javier Clavijero" School, and later went to learn a trade at the [[vocational school]] of the [[Mexican Navy|Secretariat of the Navy]], located at the [[San Juan de Ulúa]] Fortress, until his third year reaching the rank of sergeant.  In April 1914 he got engaged in the defense of the port of Veracruz against the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupation]] by [[United States Marine Corps]].  He escaped to join the Constitutionalist Army of General [[Cándido Aguilar]] who incorporated him to the First Regiment of Artillery of the First Eastern Division with the rank of lieutenant.  His military career continued till 1920, and participated in the [[Mexican Revolution]] within the Constitutionalist Army of [[Venustiano Carranza]], reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of Artillery and getting appointed Military Commander and Governor of the [[Quintana Roo]] territory.&lt;ref name = "Marín" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lizt Arzubide, Germán. "La vida militar de José Mancisidor," ''Obras Completas de José Mancisidor'', Vol. I, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; He got married to Dolores Varela in 1917 with whom he had five children: Orlando, Arnaldo, Kolda, Elvia and Yolanda.&lt;ref name = "Marín" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bustos Cerecedo, Miguel. "José Mancisidor, el hombre," ''Obras Completas de José Mancisidor'', Vol. I, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1920 and 1922 he was municipal [[syndic]] of [[Xalapa]].  On December 8, 1923, he got engaged in organizing the civil defense of the city against the [[Adolfo de la Huerta|de la Huerta]] uprising. From 1926 to 1929, he was local deputy for the Xalapa district.  He supported the uprising of General [[Arnulfo R. Gómez]] in the state under the orders of General [[Miguel Alemán González]]; however, after the execution of Gómez in 1927 he accepted to amnesty offered by the government.  One more time, in 1929, he joined the failed Escobar uprising led by General [[Jesús M. Aguirre]], who adhered to General [[José Gonzalo Escobar]], who previously fought against, defeated and executed General Arnulfo R. Gómez.&lt;ref name = "Marín" /&gt;

Left without political or military possibilities, José Mancisidor was appointed director of the Veracruz state government press by Governor [[Adalberto Tejeda]], who had already distanced himself from the ''Jefe Máximo'', the political chieftain, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]].  In 1932, Mancisidor became History Professor at the Veracruzan Normal School "Enrique C. Rébsamen", counting only with his primary education.  In those years he collaborated with ''Simiente'' journal, he edited a journal titled ''Ruta'', created his own publishing house called "Integrales", and published his first novels: ''La asonada'' (''The Riot'') and ''La ciudad roja'' (''The Red City'').&lt;ref&gt;Edith Negrín, “''La ciudad roja'' de José Mancisidor: Una novela proletaria mexicana,” Associación Internacional de Hispanistas (AIH) Actas XI (1992), 314–322. Reproducido en Centro Virtual Cervantes:
[http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aih/pdf/11/aih_11_5_037.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1935 he traveled to New York City as the Mexican Delegate to the First American Writers Congress which eventually founded the [[League of American Writers]]. Fomented by Communists who hoped to nurture [[Proletarian literature]] the First Congress was presided over by [[Waldo Frank]] and was attended by important novelists, such as [[John Steinbeck]], [[John Dos Passos]] and many others, who eventually abandoned the push for Marxist literature. Mancisidor remained faithful to the cause and published numerous works.

In June 1935, the governor of the state of Veracruz, [[Gonzalo Vázquez Vela]], was appointed as Secretary of Public Education by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], and included José Mancisidor within his team of associates that also included [[Luis Chávez Orozco]], [[Rafael Ramos Pedrueza]] and [[Germán Lizt Arzubide]], among others.&lt;ref name = "Marín" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Victoria. "La educación socialista," ''Historia de la Revolución Mexicana 1934-1940'', El Colegio de México, México: 1982, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] where he met President [[Mikhail Kalinin]], the Azerbaijani President [[Sultan Majid Afandiyev|Majid Afandiyev]], among other politicians, and attended [[Maxim Gorky]]'s funerals.  When [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] became president, changes were made within the [[Secretariat of Public Education]], thus Mancisidor left his position and continued to teach history classes at the National Professors School, the National Normal School, the Secondary School for Young Women No. 8 and the Worker's University of Mexico.  He died on August 22, 1956, after fainting while giving a conference at the [[Autonomous University of Nuevo León]], in [[Monterrey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dávila Dávila, Jesús Gerardo.

{{Computer security}}
A '''logic bomb''' is a piece of [[source code|code]] intentionally inserted into a [[software]] system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting [[computer file|files]] (such as a [[salary]] [[database trigger]]), should they ever be terminated from the company.

Software that is inherently malicious, such as [[computer virus|viruses]] and [[computer worm|worms]], often contain logic bombs that execute a certain [[Payload (software)|payload]] at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as [[Friday the 13th]] or [[April Fools' Day]]. [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] that activate on certain dates are often called "[[time bomb (software)|time bombs]]".

To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.

==Supposed logic bombing of the Trans-Siberian Pipeline==
It has been reported that in 1982, the [[Siberian pipeline sabotage|Trans-Siberian Pipeline incident]] occurred because of a logic bomb. (It was later reported that this story may be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Mackeown, Patrick (10 August 2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20101113072603/http://www.bookscape.co.uk/short_stories/computer_hoaxes.php "Bookscape: Short Story - Famous Computer Hoaxes"]. Bookscape. Archived on 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) A [[KGB]] operative was reported to have stolen the plans for a sophisticated control system and its software from a Canadian firm, for use on their Siberian pipeline. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was supposedly tipped off by documents in the [[Farewell Dossier]] and had the company insert a logic bomb in the program for [[sabotage]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tech sabotage during the Cold War|website=Federal Computer Week|publisher=1105 Media|first=Matthew|last=French|date=26 April 2004|url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2004/04/26/Tech-sabotage-during-the-Cold-War.aspx?Page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successful logic bombs==
*In October 2005, [[Mark Russinovich]] discovered that [[Sony BMG]] had [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal|embedded a logic bomb]] in their music CDs which silently and without consent installed insecure software on their customers' computers. This software monitored and reported the listening habits of the customer. It also altered the operating system's access to their hardware. The remote access paths opened by the trojan were insecure, and could be exploited by other malicious software. They distributed roughly 22 million of these CDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/article/2998251/malware-cybercrime/sony-bmg-rootkit-scandal-10-years-later.html Retrospective on Sony's rootkit distribution on NetworkWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2006 Roger Duronio, a [[system administrator]] for [[UBS AG|UBS]], was charged with using a logic bomb to damage the company's computer network, and with securities fraud for his failed plan to drive down the company's stock with activation of the logic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/08/ubs_hack_attack Man accused of crashing UBS servers | The Register]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=188702216  Nightmare On Wall Street: Prosecution Witness Describes 'Chaos' In UBS PaineWebber Attack - News byy InformationWeek]&lt;/ref&gt; Duronio was later convicted and sentenced to 8 years and 1 month in prison, as well as a $3.1 million restitution to UBS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/duro1213rel.pdf Former UBS Computer Systems Manager Gets 97 Months for Unleashing "Logic Bomb" on Company Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930064933/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/duro1213rel.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 March 2013, in an attack launched against [[South Korea]], a logic bomb struck machines and "wiped the hard drives and master boot records of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Government waging 'war' against people: Kim Zetter | url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/logic-bomb-south-korea-attack/ | publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=South Korea raises alert after hackers attack broadcasters, banks: Se Young Lee | url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/20/net-us-korea-cyber-outage-idUSBRE92J06F20130320 | publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symantec]] reported that the malware also contained a component that was capable of wiping Linux machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Remote Linux Wiper Found in South Korean Cyber Attack | url= http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/remote-linux-wiper-found-south-korean-cyber-attack | publisher=[[Symantec]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=South Korean Banks and Broadcasting Organizations Suffer Major Damage from Cyber Attack | url= http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/south-korean-banks-and-broadcasting-organizations-suffer-major-damage-cyber-attack | publisher=[[Symantec]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted logic bombs==
*In February 2000, Tony Xiaotong, indicted before a [[grand jury]], was accused of planting a logic bomb during his employment as a programmer and securities trader at [[Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co.|Deutsche Morgan Grenfell]]. The bomb, planted in 1996, had a trigger date of 20 July 2000, but was discovered by other programmers in the company. Removing and cleaning up after the bomb allegedly took several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 2 October 2003 Yung-Hsun Lin, also known as Andy Lin, changed code on a server at [[Medco Health Solutions]] Inc.'s [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]] headquarters, where he was employed as a Unix administrator, creating a logic bomb set to go off on his birthday in 2004. It failed to work due to a programming error, so Lin corrected the error and reset it to go off on his next birthday, but it was discovered and disabled by a Medco computer systems administrator a few months before the trigger date. Lin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in jail in a federal prison in addition to $81,200 in [[restitution]]. The charges held a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of US$250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137479/article.html | title = Unix Admin Pleads Guilty to Planting Logic Bomb | accessdate = 22 September 2007 | work =PC World |author=Vijayan, Jaikumar }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/09/1328251&amp;from=rss | title = 2.5 Years in Jail for Planting 'Logic Bomb' | work = Slashdot }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 29 October 2008 a logic bomb was discovered at American mortgage giant [[Fannie Mae]].  The bomb was planted by Rajendrasinh Babubhai Makwana, an IT contractor who worked in Fannie Mae's [[Urbana, Maryland]] facility.  The bomb was set to activate on 31 January 2009 and could have wiped all of Fannie Mae's 4000 servers. Makwana had been terminated around 1:00pm on 24 October 2008 and managed to plant the bomb before his network access was revoked. Makwana was indicted in a Maryland court on 27 January 2009 for unauthorized computer access,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212903521  Fannie Mae Contractor Indicted For Logic Bomb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://baltimore.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ba100410a.htm Former Employee of Fannie Mae Contractor Convicted of Attempting to Destroy Fannie Mae Computer Data] 4 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; convicted on 4 October 2010, and sentenced to 41 months in prison on 17 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Programmer jailed three years over plot to wipe out all of Fannie Mae's financial data |author=Stephen C.

*In October 2009, Douglas Duchak was terminated from his job as data analyst at the Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC) of the U.S. [[Transportation Security Administration]].

According to tradition, the [[Jewish]] community of Peki'in has maintained a presence there since the [[Second Temple period]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/researchers-race-to-document-vanishing-jewish-heritage-of-galilee-druze-village-1.453433 Researchers race to document vanishing Jewish heritage of Galilee Druze village], Eli Ashkenaz, 25 July 2012, [[Haaretz]], "Zinati, who was born in 1931, is the last link in the chain of a Jewish community that apparently maintained a continuous presence in Peki'in since the time of the Second Temple, when three families from the ranks of the [[kohen]]im, the priestly caste that served in the Temple, moved there. Since then, the only known break in the Jewish presence was during two years in the late 1930s, when the town's Jews fled the Arab riots of 1936–39. Most of them went to what they called the Hadera diaspora. But one family, Zinati's, returned home in 1940."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NYNCUXGoFWMC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;f=false Jews and Muslims in the Arab World: Haunted by Pasts Real and Imagined], Jacob Lassner, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007, p.314, "...the small community of Peki'in in the mountains of the Galilee, not far from Safed, whose present-day residents could demonstrate that they were direct descendants of inhabitants of the village who had never gone into exile."&lt;/ref&gt; The only interruption in their presence was during the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–1939 Arab riots]]. Most Jews in Peki'in did not return to the village after the violence, which they called the Hadera diaspora. It is believed that the Zinatis are the only family who returned, and this family has dwindled to one member.

A bundle of Jewish traditions is associated with a certain Peki'in often, appearing in writing under the names ''Baka'', ''Paka'' and ''Peki'in'', which gave rise to the theory that a Jewish community lived there continuously from the [[Second Temple period]]. According to the [[Talmud]], Rabbi [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] run a [[Beth Midrash]], Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]] and his son Rabbi [[Eleazar b. Simeon|Elazar ben Shimon]], hid in a cave from the Romans for 13 years,&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat, 33b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Visitors in the village are still shown a small cave by an old [[Carob tree]], as according to legend, one has nourished the rabbis when they stayed there.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shimon bar Yochai went on to teach at the city. However, there is evidence that the identification of Rabbinic Peki'in with Peki'in-Buqei'a is of Ottoman time,&lt;ref name=yediot1959&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 2312-007X | volume = 23 | issue = 1–2 | at = ,צמיחת המסורות של מירון ופקיעין [Development of the traditions of Meiron and Peki'in], pp. 92–94 | last = ברסלבי | first = י. | title = Summary of the Fourteenth Archaeological Convention, Safed, Sept.—Oct., 1958 / הכינוס הארצי הי"ד לידיעת הארץ: צפת והגליל העליון סוכות, תשי"ט | journal = Bulletin of the Israel Exploration Society / ידיעות החברה לחקירת ארץ-ישראל ועתיקותיה |year = 1959 | jstor = 23730960 | language = Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sites in the vicinity of [[Rehovot]] have also been suggested. The first writing where the name ''Peki'in'' undoubtedly refers to this village is from a 1765 Hebrew [[Travel literature|travel book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1xFAAAAYAAJ|year=1918|publisher=British Palestine Committee|page=165|quote=Its current Hebrew name, Peki'in, appears for the first time in 1765, in an account in Rabbi Simcha ben Joshua's book Ahavat Zion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader era===
In the [[Crusader states|Crusader era]], Peki'in was known under the name of  ''Bokehel.''&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, 1988, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Together with several other villages in the area, it was part of the lordship of St. George, one of the largest in the Acre area. In the 12th century it was held by Henry de Milly, after his death it was inherited by his three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1993, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BgQ6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80     80]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellenblum, 2003, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=riHMZiH_Te4C&amp;pg=PA167 167]&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry de Milly's third and youngest daughter, Agnes of Milly, married [[Joscelin III, Count of Edessa|Joscelin III]]. In 1220 their daughter [[Beatrix de Courtenay]] and her husband [[Otto von Botenlauben]], [[House of Henneberg|Count of Henneberg]], sold their land, including  "one third of the [[fief]] of St. George", and  "one third of the village of ''Bokehel''", to the [[Teutonic Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;Strehlke, 1869, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/tabulaeordinist00stregoog#page/n59/mode/1up 43]- 44, No. 53; cited in Röhricht, 1893, RHH, p.

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Jews of Peki'in, c. 1930.jpg|thumb|220px|Jews of Peki'in, c. 1930]]
Incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, Peki'in appeared in the 1596 [[daftar|tax register]]s as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of [[Acre, Israel|Akka]] of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Safad]]. It had a population of 77 households and 7 bachelors who were all Muslims, in addition to 79 Jewish households. The villagers paid taxes on occasional revenues, goats and/or beehives, a press for olives or grapes, and [[jizya]].&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; A tax on silk spinning (''dulab harir''), which was levied in 1555 on six villages surrounding [[Mount Meron]], rated highest in Peki'in.&lt;ref name=rhodediss&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = PhD dissertation, Columbia University | last = Rhode | first = Harold| authorlink = Harold Rhode | title = The Administration and Population of the Sancak of Safed in the Sixteenth Century| accessdate = 10 October 2014|year = 1979 | url = https://www.academia.edu/2026845/The_Administration_and_Population_of_the_Sancak_of_Safed_in_the_Sixteenth_Century }} See p. 145 for the silk tax, and p. 5 for the date.&lt;/ref&gt; A silk industry is also attested by an account from 1602,&lt;ref name=judaica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution= Peki'in | contribution-url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15533.html |via= [[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate= 10 October 2014 |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] |year= 2008 |first1= Michael |last1= Avi-Yonah |first2= Joseph |last2= Braslavi (Braslavski)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several old [[mulberry]] trees in the village.

Jewish population was recorded at 33 households in 1525, and experienced a rise, drop, stabilization and another rise before 1596.&lt;ref name="David2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham David|title=To Come to the Land: Immigration and Settlement in 16th-Century Eretz-Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqy4wqVbSUkC&amp;pg=PA27|date=24 May 2010|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5643-9|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said some [[Kohen|Kohanitic]] families emigrated from [[Kafr 'Inan]], possibly in the late 16th century.&lt;ref name=yediot33&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 2312-0096 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | last = Braslavski | title = Kefar Hanania / כפר חנניה: על יסוד פרטים שנאספו בשעת סיור | journal = Bulletin of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society / ידיעות החברה העברית לחקירת ארץ-ישראל ועתיקותיה| date = 1 July 1933 | jstor = 23718865 |at= p. 20 |language= Hebrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Almani family probably came from the village [[Alma, Safad|Alma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Y. |last= Ben-Zvi |editor-first= Joel |editor-last= Rappel |script-title=he:תולדות ארץ ישראל |date= 1979 |oclc= 37604188 |at= p. 489 |language= Hebrew}} Alma's Jewish population had dwindled during the 16th century, and was gone by the mid 18th.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, French explorer [[Victor Guérin]] visited the village and described it as: "The population at present number 600—Druzes, [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|United Greeks]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Schismatic Greeks]], and a few Jewish families, who pretend to descend from the ancient inhabitants of the country. Every year in the summer several hundreds of Jews come here from Tiberias to pass the hot season. Most of these Jews came originally from Europe, and are happy in finding here the last indigenous scions of the ancient national stock. ... At Bukeiah, thanks to the two springs which issue from the hill-side, they cultivate on the slopes and almost to the bottom of the valley delicious gardens, watered by numerous streams. Here grow, on different terraces, kept up by great walls, probably ancient, fruit-trees of all kinds, such as citrons, oranges, pomegranates, figs, quinces, and mulberries. The vine flourishes marvelously, as is shown by the enormous trunks. The United Greeks have a little church, which I found shut; the Schismatic Greeks also have one which has replaced a much more ancient Christian sanctuary. Only a few cut stones and the trunk of a column remain of it.The Jews worship in a synagogue of modern date."&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr00gugoog#page/n94/mode/2up 78–79], as translated in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/197/mode/1up 197]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described it as "A good village, built of stone, containing a chapel and a synagogue. There are about 100 Moslems, 100 Christians, 100 Druzes, and 100 Jews. It is situated on the slope of tine hill, with gardens, figs, olives, pomegranates, and arable land.

There is a good spring in the village, and two springs near. This is the only place where Jews cultivate the ground. They say it has descended to them from their fathers from time immemorial."&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/196/mode/1up 196]-197&lt;/ref&gt;

A population list from about 1887 showed  ''el Bukei’a'' to have about 950 inhabitants; Druse, Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, 1888, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme19pale#page/n216/mode/1up  191]&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate era===
In a [[1922 census of Palestine|census]] conducted in 1922 by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate authorities]], Al Buqai'a had a population of 652 residents; 70 Muslims, 63 Jews, 215 Christians and 304 Druse.&lt;ref name="Census1922"&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p.[https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n38/mode/1up   36]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Christians, 167 were Orthodox and 48 were Greek Catholic ([[Melkite|Melchite]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n52/mode/1up  50]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]], El Buqei'a had a total population of 799; 71 Muslims, 52 Jews, 264 Christians and 412 Druse, in a total of 190 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab riots]] forced the Jews of Peki'in to leave their homes for safer parts of the country; only a few of them later returned.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]], the population was 990; 100 Muslims, 370 Christians, and 520 "others", that is Druse,&lt;ref name=1945p4&gt;Department of Statistics, 1945, p.

In October 2007, riots broke out after the installation of a cellular antenna due to concerns that such antennas have been linked to an increase in cancer. Riot police fired bullets and gas grenades, which further angered the residents, who burned down the house of a Jewish family living in the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3465602,00.html Dozens injured in Galilee clashes], 10.30.07, Ynet&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the last Jewish family left the town after their car was torched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3478336,00.html Last Jewish Family Leaves Peki'in], Ynetnews, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Only Margalit Zinati, a descendant of a [[Mustarabim]] family, has remained there to keep alive the memory of the town's vanishing Jewish heritage.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

The Druze Youth Movement in Israel, a movement with 19 branches around the country and a membership of 12,000, has its headquarters in Peki'in. The founder of the movement is [[Hamad Amar]], an Israeli Druze member of the [[Knesset]] from [[Shfaram]], who established it to pass on Druze heritage to the younger generation while developing a sense of national Israeli pride.&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Setting-the-example-313339 |title= Setting the Example |newspaper= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |date= 16 May 2013 |last= Hasten |first= Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Andreas Munch''' (15 December 1810 – 25 May 1863), usually known as '''P. A. Munch''', was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] historian, known for his work on the [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] of Norway. Munch’s scholarship included Norwegian [[archaeology]], [[geography]], [[ethnography]], [[linguistics]], and [[jurisprudence]]. He was also noted for his [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[legendary saga]] translations.

==Background==
Peter Andreas Munch was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo). He was the son of Edvard Storm Munch and Johanne Sophie Hofgaard. Munch was the uncle of the famous painter [[Edvard Munch]].

Munch  grew up at [[Gjerpen]] parsonage, where his father was parish priest of the [[Church of Norway]]. He was schooled in the city of [[Skien]]. He attended the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]]. Munch first studied law and took his state examination in 1834, but then turned to historical and philological studies.

==Career==
Munch's first great achievement, with Rudolph Keyser, was their three volumes of ''Norges Gamle Love'' (Norway's old laws), edited after a two-year research visit to Copenhagen. In 1837, he became lecturer in history at the University of Oslo and in 1841 became a professor of history. In 1857, after producing numerous publications, he received a large grant for archives research in Rome and lived there from 1859 to 1861. Munch served as Norway's [[National archivist of Norway|national archivist]] from 1861 to 1863. He was one of the first non-[[Catholic]]s to be allowed into the archives of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]]. He took extensive notes from the volumes of papal letters, and sometimes drew accurate facsimiles of the texts. His research there was useful in his main work, ''Det norske Folks Historie'' (''History of the Norwegian People''), in eight volumes, and he sent his notes home to the Royal Archives in Christiania. Among the theories he is remembered for is the [[theory on immigration to Norway]], in which he developed work done by [[Rudolf Keyser]]. On a trip back to Rome to fetch his family, who had remained there for a while, he died from a stroke, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rome.

==The chronicle of Man and The Sudreys==

In this work,&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Munch. [http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/237432c116254dee6c33e4afa05f8310?index=12#3 '''The Chronicle of Man and The Sudreys'''], Christiana (1860)&lt;/ref&gt; Munch translated the 3rd Chronicle from a Codex transferred to the British Museum (formerly owned in 1620 by one Sir Robert Cotton).  The manuscript is the only known copy of this Codex (and thought to be the only one).  In any event, Munch translated runic characters and added historical notes to lend light upon the writings, and using previous works on the history of Scottish and Icelandic Isles to aid in the presentation of the translated material.

==Controversial views about the Finno-Ugric peoples==

Peter Munch had racial thoughts on certain peoples, e.g. Finns and Hungarians. He despised Finns and claimed that they cannot have an independent country because of their low state of civilization, as he claimed. Peter Munch claimed in his article on Finnish nationality (''Om Finlands Nationalitet og dens Forhold til den svenske'') in 1855, that Finns and Hungarians must have a human race of their own.&lt;ref&gt;L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24713">The '''problem of mental causation''' is a conceptual issue in the [[philosophy of mind]]. That problem, in short, is how to account for the common-sense idea that intentional thoughts or [[intentional mental states]] are causes of intentional actions. The problem divides into several distinct sub-problems, including the problem of causal exclusion, the problem of anomalism, and the problem of externalism. However, the sub-problem which has attracted most attention in the philosophical literature is arguably the exclusion problem.

== Description ==

The basic problem of mental causation is an intuitive one: on the face of it, it seems that mental events cause physical events (and vice versa), but how can mental events have any causal effect on physical events? Suppose, for example, some person, John, orders dessert after dinner. It seems that at least one cause for such a physical, behavioral event is that John desired to have dessert and believed that by ordering dessert he would be able to soon have dessert. But, how can such mental events as beliefs and desires cause John's mouth to move in such a way that he orders dessert?

== Sub-problems of mental causation ==

=== Exclusion problem ===
What follows is a summary of the causal exclusion problem in its simplest form, and it is merely one of several possible formulations.

To the extent that we do ''not'' have to go outside human physiology in order to trace the causal antecedents of any bodily movement, intentional action can be fully causally explained by the existence of these physiological antecedents ''alone''. No mention of mental states need enter into the explanation. This troubles philosophers because intuitively it seems that mental states are crucial in causing a person to act (for example, their beliefs and desires). But, given that physiological facts are sufficient to account for action, mental states appear to be superfluous; they are at risk of being causally and explanatorily irrelevant with respect to human action {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.iii}}.

Many philosophers consider this apparent irrelevance to be a highly counter-intuitive and undesirable position to take. It ultimately leads to [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that mental events or states are causally irrelevant, they are merely after effects that play no role in any causal chains whatsoever. Thomas Huxley famously noted that epiphenomenalism treats mental states like the steam coming off a train: it plays no causal role in the train's moving forward, it is merely an "emergent property" of the actual causation occurring in the engine {{harv|Walter|2003|p= §2}}.

=== Problem of anomalism ===
Another problem with mental causation is that mental events seem anomalous in the sense that there are no scientific laws that mental states can figure into without having exceptions. There are no "strict" laws, and mental events must factor into strict laws in order to fit respectably into the causal order described by current science [see {{harv|Davidson| 1970}}].

In short, one response has been to deny that psychological laws involving mental states require strict, exceptionless laws. Jerry Fodor argues that non-basic (or "special") sciences do not in fact require strict laws {{harv|Fodor|1980}}. In current practice, special sciences (for example, biology and chemistry) have ''ceteris paribus'' laws (or laws with "all else being equal" clauses), according to which there are exceptions. However, only in the basic sciences (physics) are there strict, exceptionless laws. Thus, although mental states are anomalous, they can still figure into scientifically respectable laws of psychology.

=== Problem of externalism ===
In the latter half of the twentieth century externalism about meaning became espoused by many philosophers. Externalism is roughly the view that certain parts of an individual's environment play a crucial role in the meaning of at least some of an individual's words [see {{harv|Putnam| 1975}} and {{harv|Burge|1979}}]. A thesis about meaning affects the mind insofar as our thoughts are ''about'' things in the world. A common view in the philosophy of mind is that at least certain mental states have intentional content in this sense. For example, one's belief that water is wet has the semantic content of ''water is wet''. The thought is about water and the fact that it is wet. But, if externalism is true—if some of the contents of one's thoughts are constituted at least in part by factors external to one's mind—then there is yet another difficulty in explaining how mental states can cause physical states {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.ii}}].

== Commonsensical Solutions ==


===Causal Exclusion Counter-Argument=== 

Causal exclusion is only a problem for mental causation if you are an advocate for physicalism.  I will begin with Jaegwon Kim’s causal exclusion argument which states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, and no physical effects are caused twice over by distinct physical and mental causes, there cannot be any irreducible mental causes (Kallestrup 2006).  First of all, the antecedent of the causal exclusion argument is the definition of physicalism.  Kim states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. This statement alone negates dualism, idealism and mental causation.  Whereas, it is redundant to state the remaining of the causal exclusion argument because if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then no physical effects would be caused twice over by any substance other than physical.  Also, if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then there clearly would not be any reducible or irreducible mental causes.  Secondly, if a person does not support physicalism, then they are not going to support the view that all physical effects have sufficient physical causes.  Lastly, physicalism is the hypothesis that the mind is the same as the brain and/or the mental supervenes on the physical, yet it is not fact.  Therefore, to use the hypothesis of causal exclusion as evidence to counter mental causation is no different than using "the popper's three world formulation" or "psychological nativism" (as shown in this section) to support mental causation.

===The Advent of Crying===

It is an arduous task to prove mental causation within the realms of a physical body.  Yet, every human has witnessed mental causation within the human body.  Let us view the advent of crying.  Crying is a physical effect coupled with either a physical cause or a mental (emotional) cause.  There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflex tears, and emotional tears (Hoyt 2008).  Basal tears keep our eyes from drying out, reflex tears are in response to eye irritants (physical causation), and emotional tears are a result of mental causation such as sadness, joy, etc (Hoyt 2008).  I am going to focus on the latter, emotional tears.  Once sadness is registered in the cerebrum, the endocrine system releases hormones to the ocular area, and tears are formed (Hoyt 2008).  Crying due to one's mental state is an event that is common across all cultures and demographics.  Whether we cry due to sadness or joy, these are all events that have their origination in mental causation.  It would be inhuman to claim otherwise.

How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by Lisa Feldman Barrett for a rigorous discussion. One’s crying is not planned, unless one is an actor, then we are able to tap into the mechanism that causes tears to flow. Otherwise it just happens outside of out awareness of causing it by thinking. The brain has patterns of neurons that once activated generate physiologic responses that happens up to 10 seconds before we are aware. (Koch, Christof. 2012. “How Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your “Free” Will”.  Scientific American:  April 12.) and many others.

==Traditional Solutions==

=== Dualist solutions ===
{{Main article|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)}}

Some have claimed that while the mental and the physical are quite different things, they can nonetheless causally interact with one another, a view going back to Descartes [{{harv|Descartes| 1642/1986}}, especially meditations II &amp; VI]. This view is known as ''[[interactionist dualism]]''. The major problem that interactionist dualism faces is that of explicating a satisfactory notion of causation according to which non-spatial events, such as mental events, can causally interact with physical events. According to the current mainstream scientific world-view, the physical realm is [[Causal closure|''causally closed'']], in that causal relationships only hold among physical events in the physical realm. Given these types of considerations, some argue that it is appropriate to say that the main assumptions in interactionist dualism generate the problem of mental causation rather than solve it (see {{harv|Yoo| 2006|p=§1a}}.

=== Physicalist solutions ===
{{Main article|Physicalism}}
{{See also|Monism}}

The other major option is to assert that mental events are either (at least contingently) identical to physical events, or [[Supervenience|supervene]] on physical events. Views that fall under this general heading are called [[physicalism]] or [[materialism]]. But, such views require a particular theory to explain how mental events are physical in nature. One such theory is [[behaviorism]]. Behaviorists, in general, argue that mental events are merely dispositions to behave in certain ways. Another theory is the [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]], according to which mental events are (either type- or token-) identical to physical events. A more recent view, known as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], claims that mental events are individuated (or constituted by) the causal role they play. As such, mental events would fit directly into the causal realm, as they are simply certain causal (or functional) roles. Finally, there is [[eliminative materialism]], which simply denies that there are any such mental events; thus, there is really no problem of mental causation at all.

=== Idealism-Related solutions ===


==== Popper's three-world formulation ====
Related to [[#Dualist solutions|dualism]] above, a more general and somewhat differently posed approach to mental causation is provided by [[Popper's three worlds|Karl Popper's three worlds]]. [[Karl Popper|Popper]] split the world into three categories:&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;
# The world of physical [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[event (philosophy)|event]]s, including [[biology|biological]] entities
# The mental or psychological world, the world of our feelings of pain and of pleasure, of our thoughts, of our decisions, of our perceptions and our observations; in other words, the world of mental or psychological states or processes, or of subjective experiences.
# The world of products of the human mind, including art, science, and religion.

World 3 includes physical theory as a particular case. But World 3 is a creation of the human imagination, and such acts of imagination are a part of World 2. Accordingly, one could argue that the physical notion of causality is a child of the imagination, and although causation has its successes in describing World 1, it may not apply to World 2 or World 3. The subjective aspects of theories contained in World 3 are not readily framed within the third-person perspective of science used to explain World 1.

From this perspective, it is hubris to suppose that the methods successful in describing World 1, in particular to suppose the notions of ''cause'' and ''effect'', invented by World 2 in its creation of the theory of World 3 used to explain World 1, have direct application to Worlds 2 and 3 themselves, and control mental agency.

==== Psychological nativism ====
A still different approach to mental causation is based upon the philosophies of Kant, Chomsky and Pinker. These philosophers stress the impact of built-in aspects of mind, studied in the field of [[psychological nativism]].&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) pointed out that we all shape our experience of things through the filter of our mind, a view sometimes called [[epistemological solipsism]]. The mind shapes that experience, and among other things, Kant believed the concepts of ''space'' and ''time'' were programmed into the human brain, as was the notion of ''cause'' and ''effect''.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; We never have ''direct'' experience of things, the ''noumenal'' world, and what we do experience is the ''phenomenal'' world as conveyed by our senses, this conveyance processed by the machinery of the mind and nervous system. Kant focused upon this processing. Kant believed in [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge arrived at independent of experience, so-called ''synthetic'' ''a priori'' knowledge. In particular, he thought that by introspection some aspects of the filtering mechanisms of the mind/brain/nervous system could be discovered.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; The following observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject-object problem, called [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)#The .22Copernican Revolution in philosophy.22|Kant's Copernican revolution]]: 
{{quote|"It has hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to ascertain anything about these objects ''a priori'', by means of conceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events, to accord better with the possibility of our gaining the end we have in view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects ''a priori'', of determining something with respect to these objects, before they are given to us. We here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars remained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects."&lt;ref name=Critique/&gt;|Immanuel Kant|English translation by [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]] of ''The Critique of Pure Reason'' (1781)}}
Although Kant has posed the issue of built-in aspects of mind, the particulars that depend upon the science of his day have become outmoded. A more recent approach to these limitations is proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. Like Kant, [[Noam Chomsky]] raised the issue of the mind's inherent programming. Chomsky selected as a particular example the acquiring of language by children.&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt; Of course, language is indispensable in the formulation and communication of our perceptions of the objective world:
{{quote|"People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought. This language of thought probably looks a bit like all these languages;...But compared with any given language, mentalese must be richer in some ways and simpler in others."&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;|Steven Pinker|The Language Instinct,  p. 72}} 
Chomsky marshaled evidence that a child's rapid mastery of the complexity of language indicated an innate ability programmed into the development of the human mind from birth that could not be explained by the [[Tabula rasa|"blank slate"]] view of the infant mind. Rather, the mind has a built-in propensity to process symbolic representations. The origins of this ability were sought by [[Steven Pinker]] in a [[Survival of the fittest|Darwinian struggle]] that established the survival value of the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;  According to Pinker, [[Charles Darwin]] himself "concluded that language ability is 'an instinctive tendency to acquire an art', a design that is not peculiar to humans but seen in other species such as song-learning birds." This observation is strongly supported by [[Crow#Behavior|research on crows]].&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

This work can be taken to suggest that although a physical theory is an intermediary between our observations and our notions of connections between them, it is an elaborate mental construction that is a meld of the way the mind works and objective observations. Although a physical theory is used to determine connections about objective events,  the specific form of the theoretical construct is a product of subjective activities, and this particular form may well involve the workings of the brain. Perhaps some aspects of the universe's operation can be expressed in terms of mental constructs, but this process is analogous with the expression of a [[computer algorithm]] in terms of [[assembly language]] instructions peculiar to a particular computer, a translation by a [[compiler]] of the general statement of an algorithm into specific tiny steps that particular computer can handle.&lt;ref name=Edelman/&gt;

From this standpoint, as with the philosophy of Kant, the first-person active actions of mental causation may involve innate workings of the brain itself.

'''Radoslav Lopašić''' (1830—1893) was a [[Austrian Empire|Croatian]] historian and member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Lopašić was born on 20 May 1830 in [[Karlovac]], [[Austrian Empire]] (modern-day [[Croatia]]). His father was Mirko Lopašić, at that time a mayor and a city judge, while his mother was Magdalena nee Dobrilović.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lopašić|1989|p=69}}: "Radoslav Lopašić rodio se u Karlovcu 20. siječnja 1830. godine od oca Mirka Lopašića, tada načelnika i namjesnog suca grada Karlovca, i od majke Magdalene, rođene Dobrilović.

'''Spontaneous generation''' refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms. The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. For instance, it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that [[maggot]]s could arise from dead flesh.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Man Made: A History of Synthetic Life|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/man-made-a-history-of-synthetic-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant idea was that of '''equivocal generation''', in which species such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] arose from unrelated living organisms, now understood to be their [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. The idea of '''univocal generation''', by contrast, refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent(s), generally of the same [[species]].

The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brack, André |editor=Brack, André |title=The Molecular Origins of Life |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-56475-5 |page=1 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/64755/excerpt/9780521564755_excerpt.pdf | quote=Aristotle gathered the different claims into a real theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled and expanded the work of [[Pre-Socratic_philosophy|earlier natural philosophers]] and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms, and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of [[Francesco Redi]] and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[John Tyndall]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"&gt;Tyndall, John; Fragments of Science, Vol 2, chapters IV, XII (1876), XIII(1878); Pub.

After sterilizing a nutrient broth in these flasks, he removed the swan necks of the controls. Microorganisms grew only in the controls, refuting spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;]]

Rejection of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists. By the middle of the 19th century, experiments of Louis Pasteur and others refuted the traditional theory of spontaneous generation and supported [[biogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zubay, Geoffrey.

==Description and terms==

Spontaneous generation refers both to the supposed processes by which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than seeds, eggs, or parents, and also to theoretical principles presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine are the ideas that life comes from non-life and that no causal agent, such as a parent, is needed. The hypothetical processes by which life routinely emerges from nonliving matter on a time scale of minutes, weeks, or years (e.g. in the supposed seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the [[Nile]]) are sometimes referred to as ''abiogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;Stillingfleet, Edward. ''Origines Sacrae''. Cambridge University Press 1697. May be downloaded from [https://archive.org/details/originessacraeor00stil]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas have no operative principles in common with the modern hypothesis of [[abiogenesis]], which asserts that life emerged in the early ages of the planet, over a time span of at least millions of years, and subsequently diversified, and that there is no evidence of any subsequent repetition of the event.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernal |first=J. D. |year=1967 |origyear=Reprinted work by [[Alexander Oparin|A. I. Oparin]] originally published 1924; Moscow: [[Publishing houses in the Soviet Union|The Moscow Worker]] |title=The Origin of Life |series=The Weidenfeld and Nicolson Natural History |others=Translation of Oparin by Ann Synge |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |lccn=67098482 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''equivocal generation'', sometimes known as ''heterogenesis'' or ''xenogenesis'', describes the supposed process by which one form of life arises from a different, unrelated form, such as tapeworms from the bodies of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Wiener, Philip P. | title=Dictionary of the History of Ideas | accessdate=2009-01-22 | year=1973 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | chapter=Spontaneous Generation | chapterurl=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv4-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment, the term "spontaneous generation" fell increasingly out of favor. Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. ''Heterogenesis'' was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] proposed the term ''archebiosis'' for life originating from inorganic materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term "'spontaneous' generation," in 1870 Bastian coined the term ''biogenesis'' to refer to the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] proposed the term ''[[abiogenesis]]'' to refer to this same process and adopted ''[[biogenesis]]'' for the process by which life arises from existing life; it is this latter set of definitions that became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strick |first=James |title=Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |date=April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Presocratic philosophers===
Active in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, early Greek philosophers, called ''physiologoi'' in antiquity (Greek: φυσιολόγοι; in English, physical or [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]]), attempted to give natural explanations of [[phenomena]] that had previously been ascribed to the agency of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie|Guthrie, William Keith Chambers]], ''The Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', p. 13, {{ISBN|0-317-66577-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''physiologoi'' sought the material principle or ''[[arche]]'' (Greek: ἀρχή) of things, emphasizing the rational unity of the external world and rejecting theological or mythological explanations.&lt;ref name="seyffert480"&gt;Seyffert, Oskar (1894), ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', page 480&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anaximander]], who believed that all things arose from the elemental nature of the universe, the ''[[Apeiron_(cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (ἄπειρον) or the "unbounded" or "infinite," was likely the first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from nonliving matter. The [[substance theory|primal chaos]] of the ''apeiron,'' eternally in motion, served as a substratum in which elemental opposites (e.g., wet and dry, hot and cold) generated and shaped the many and varied things in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author=Curd, Patricia |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press| page=77 |isbn=0-691-01182-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the "wet" when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Charles H. |title=Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology |date=1994 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=0872202550 |pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reports:

{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], a pupil of Anaximander, thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun's heat. [[Anaxagoras]], too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, he held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. [[Xenophanes]] traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |title=From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea|date=1894 |publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what has occasionally been seen as a prefiguration of a concept of [[natural selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |title=Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species" |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |date=1941 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] accepted the spontaneous generation of life but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the species we now see, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|[[Aristotle]] proposed that in sexual reproduction, the child inherits [[Hylomorphism|form]] (eidos) from the father and matter from the mother, as well as heat (pneuma) either from the father or from the environment.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spontaneous generation, the environment could effectively replace the parents' contributions of form, matter, and heat.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22/&gt;]]

In his biological works, the natural philosopher Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by [[sexual reproduction|sexual]], [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], or spontaneous generation. In accordance with his fundamental theory of [[hylomorphism]], which held that every physical entity was a compound of matter and form, Aristotle's basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the [[semen|male's seed]] imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the "matter" (menstrual blood) supplied by the female. Thus female matter is the [[Four_causes#Matter|material cause]] of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the [[Four_causes#Agent|efficient cause]], the factor that instigates and delineates the thing's existence.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014/&gt; Yet, as proposed in the ''[[History of Animals]]'', many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:

{{quote|Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants ... So with animals, some spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several organs.&lt;ref name="HistAnimV"&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson | title=History of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/ | accessdate=2008-12-20 | volume=| origyear=c. 343 BCE | year=1910 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book V | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/book5.html | isbn=90-6186-973-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Part 1}}

According to this theory, living things may come forth from nonliving things in a manner roughly analogous to the "enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed" seen in sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonliving materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain ''[[pneuma]]'' (πνεῦμα, "breath"), or "[[vital heat]]". According to Aristotle, pneuma had more "heat" than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:
{{quote|The power of every soul seems to have shared in a different and more divine body than the so called [four] elements ... For every [animal], what makes the seed generative inheres in the seed and is called its "heat." But this is not fire or some such power, but instead the pneuma that is enclosed in the seed and in foamy matter, this being analogous to the element of the stars. This is why fire does not generate any animal ... but the heat of the sun and the heat of animals does, not only the heat that fills the seed, but also any other residue of [the animal's] nature that may exist similarly possesses this vital principle.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', 736b29ff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle drew an analogy between the "foamy matter" (τὸ ἀφρῶδες) found in nature and the "seed" of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it was, from a mixture of water and pneuma). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual blood) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a byproduct of the elements earth and water. Thus any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of pneuma and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things.&lt;ref name="Lehoux2017p26"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the byproduct of the action of the "sweet" element of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by Arthur Platt | title=On the Generation of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/ | accessdate=2009-01-09 | origyear=c. 350 BCE | year=1912 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book III | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book3.html | isbn=90-04-09603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Animals and plants come into being in earth and in liquid because there is water in earth, and air in water, and in all air is vital heat so that in a sense all things are full of soul. Therefore living things form quickly whenever this air and vital heat are enclosed in anything. When they are so enclosed, the corporeal liquids being heated, there arises as it were a frothy bubble.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', Book III, Part 11}}

[[File:Argopecten irradians.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle stated that [[scallop]]s form spontaneously in sand.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;]]

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The [[testacea]]ns (a genus which for Aristotle included [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, [[clam]]s and [[scallop]]s in sand, [[oyster]]s in slime, and the [[barnacle]] and the [[limpet]] in the hollows of rocks.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;

On the other hand, Athenaeus also dissented towards spontaneous generation, claiming that a variety of [[anchovy]] did not generate from [[roe]], as Aristotle stated, but rather, from [[sea foam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Athenaeus of Naucratis | authorlink=Athenaeus | editor=Yonge, C.D. | title=The deipnosophists, or, Banquet of the learned of Athenæus | url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=browse&amp;scope=Literature.DeipnoSub | accessdate=2009-02-03 | series=University of Wisconsin Digital Collection | volume= I | publisher=Henry G.

As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. [[Augustine of Hippo]] discussed spontaneous generation in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'', citing Biblical passages such as "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:20|KJV|}}) as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.&lt;ref name ="irisfry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry | first=Iris | title=The Emergence of Life on Earth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA17,M1| chapter=Chapter 2: Spontaneous Generation — Ups and Downs | accessdate=2009-01-21 | year=2000 | publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in 5th century to the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, the influence of Greek science declined, although spontaneous generation generally went unchallenged. New descriptions were made. Of the numerous beliefs, some had doctrinal implications outside of the [[Book of Genesis]]. For example, the idea that a variety of bird known as the ''[[barnacle goose#Folklore|barnacle goose]]'' emerged from a crustacean known as the ''[[goose barnacle]]'', had implications on the practice of fasting during [[Lent]].  In 1188, [[Gerald of Wales]], after having traveled in Ireland, argued that the "unnatural" generation of barnacle geese was evidence for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Giraldus Cambrensis | authorlink=Gerald of Wales | title=Topographia Hiberniae | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1188geraldwales-barnacle.html | accessdate=2009-02-01 | year=1188 | isbn=0-85105-386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the practice of fasting during Lent allowed fish, but prohibited fowl, the idea that the goose was in fact a fish suggested that its consumption be permitted during Lent. The practice was eventually prohibited by decree of [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lankester | first=Sir Edwin Ray | authorlink=Edwin Lankester | title=Diversions of a Naturalist | url=https://books.google.com/?id=d1GnwwmfvC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate= 2009-02-01 | edition=illustrated | origyear=1915 | year=1970 | publisher=Ayer Publishing | isbn=978-0-8369-1471-9 |pages=117–128 | chapter=XIV.

Aristotle, in Arabic translation, was reintroduced to Western Europe.  During the 13th century, Aristotle reached his greatest acceptance. With the availability of Latin translations Saint [[Albertus Magnus]] and his student, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], raised Aristotelianism to its greatest prominence. Albert wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle, ''De causis et processu universitatis'', in which he removed some and incorporated other commentaries by Arabic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | date=March 20, 2006 | contribution=Albert the Great | contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/albert-great/ | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

Spontaneous generation is discussed as a fact in literature well into the [[Renaissance]].  Where, in passing, [[Shakespeare]] discusses snakes and crocodiles forming from the mud of the [[Nile]] ({{Shakecite|Ant|F1|2|7}}), [[Izaak Walton]] again raises the question of the origin of eels "as rats and mice, and many other living creatures, are bred in Egypt, by the sun's heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river...". While the ancient question of the origin of eels remained unanswered and the additional idea that eels reproduced from corruption of age was mentioned, the spontaneous generation of rats and mice engendered no debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walton | first=Izaak | authorlink=Izaak Walton | others=transcribed by Risa Bear | title=The Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man's Recreation | url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~rbear/walton/index.html | accessdate=2009-02-05 | origyear=1653 | year=1903  | publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons  | chapter=XIII.

The Dutch biologist and microscopist [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637 - 1680) rejected the concept that one animal could arise from another or from putrification by chance because it was impious and like others found the concept of spontaneous generation irreligious, and he associated it with atheism and Godless opinion.&lt;ref name="OslerFarber2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Osler, Margaret J. |author2=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S.

==Modern tests==

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1580–1644) used experimental techniques, such as growing a willow for five years and showing it increased mass while the soil showed a trivial decrease in comparison.  As the process of [[photosynthesis]] was not understood, he attributed the increase of mass to the absorption of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Ducheyne | first=Steffen | year=2006 | title=Joan Baptista van Helmont and the Question of Experimental Modernism | pages=305–332 | url=http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/Physis%20-%20Van%20Helmont.pdf | accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notes also describe a recipe for mice (a piece of soiled cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight).  His notes suggest he may even have done these things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pasteur |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Pasteur |editor-last=Latour |editor-first=Bruno |date=April 23, 1864 |publication-date=1993 (English translation) |title=Des générations spontanées |volume=1 |location=Conférences faite aux "soirées scientifiques de la Sorbonne" |pages=257–265 |url=http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~alevine/pasteur.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326183109/http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~alevine/pasteur.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Aristotle held that the embryo was formed by a coagulation in the uterus, [[William Harvey]] (1578 – 1657) by way of [[dissection]] of [[deer]], showed that there was no visible embryo during the first month.&lt;ref name=embryology&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2451/Embryology-History-embryology-science.html | title=Embryology - History Of Embryology As A Science | accessdate=2009-01-09 | author1=Magner, Lois |author2=Lerner, K. Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his work predated the microscope, this led him to suggest that life came from invisible eggs.  In the frontispiece of his book ''Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium'' (''Essays on the Generation of Animals''), he made an expression of [[biogenesis]]: "omnia ex ovo" (everything from eggs).&lt;ref name ="irisfry" /&gt;

[[File:Esperimento abiogenesi.jpg|thumb|A modern rendering of [[Francesco Redi]]'s 1668 experiment on abiogenesis. Flies form on the meat in the open jar (left) but not in the closed jar (right).]]

The ancient beliefs were subjected to testing.  In 1668, [[Francesco Redi]] challenged the idea that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.  In the first major [[experiment]] to challenge spontaneous generation, he placed meat in a variety of sealed, open, and partially covered containers.&lt;ref name="slowdeath"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/cellintro/cellintro_reading/Spontaneous_Generation.html | title=The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859) | accessdate=2008-12-19 | author=Levine, Russell |author2=Evers, Chris | year=1999 | publisher=National Health Museum | location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Realizing that the sealed containers were deprived of air, he used "fine Naples veil", and observed no worm on the meat, but they appeared on the cloth.&lt;ref name="fredi"&gt;{{cite book | author=Redi, Francesco | authorlink=Francesco Redi |editor=Mab Bigelow (translator) | title=Experiments on the Generation of Insects | url=https://books.google.com/?id=w7ZRAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Francesco+Redi+experiment&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate=2008-12-19 | origyear=1669 | year=1909 | publisher=Open Court | location=Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redi used his experiments to support the preexistence theory put forth by the Church at that time, which maintained that living things originated from parents.&lt;ref name="Fry2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fry, Iris |title=Emergence of Life on Earth: A Historical and Scientific Overview |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;pg=PA27 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |date=1 February 2000 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6 |pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific circles Redi's work very soon had great influence, as evidenced in a letter from [[John Ray]] in 1671 to members of the [[Royal Society]] of London:

{{quote|Whether there be any spontaneous or anomalous generation of animals, as has been the constant opinion of naturalists heretofore, I think there is good reason to question. It seems to me at present most probable, that there is no such thing; but that even all insects are the natural issue of parents of the same species with themselves. F. Redi has gone a good way in proving this, having cleared the point concerning generation ''ex materia putrida''. But still there remain two great difficulties. The first is, to give an account of the production of insects bred in the by-fruits and excrescencies of vegetables, which the said Redi doubts not to ascribe to the vegetative soul of the plant that yields those excrescencies. But for this I refer you to Mr. Lister. The second, to render an account of insects bred in the bodies of other animals. I hope shortly to be able to give you an account of the generation of some of those insects which have been thought to be spontaneous, and which seem as unlikely as any to be after the ordinary and usual way.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Society (Great Britain); Hutton, Charles, 1737-1823; Shaw, George, 1751-1813; Pearson, Richard, 1765-1836.

[[Pier Antonio Micheli]], around 1729, observed that when fungal spores were placed on slices of melon the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Agrios2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnzbgZgby60C&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-044565-3 |pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, [[John Needham]] performed a series of experiments on boiled broths.  Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, the broths would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist.  His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers and many of them agreed.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt;

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] modified the Needham experiment in 1768, attempting to exclude the possibility of introducing a contaminating factor between boiling and sealing. His technique involved boiling the broth in a sealed container with the air partially evacuated to prevent explosions.  Although he did not see growth, the exclusion of air left the question of whether air was an essential factor in spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, by that time there was already widespread scepticism among major scientists, to the principle of spontaneous generation. Observation was increasingly demonstrating that whenever there was sufficiently careful investigation of mechanisms of biological reproduction, it was plain that processes involved basing of new structures on existing complex structures, rather from chaotic muds or dead materials. [[Joseph Priestley]], after he had fled to America and not long before his death, wrote a letter that was read to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1803. It said in part:

{{quote|There is nothing in modern philosophy that appears to me so extraordinary, as the revival of what has long been considered as the exploded doctrine of equivocal, or, as Dr. Darwin calls it, spontaneous generation; by which is meant the production of organized bodies from substances that have no organization, as plants and animals from no pre-existing germs of the same kinds, plants without seeds, and animals without sexual intercourse.

The germ of an organized body, the seed of a plant, or the embrio of an animal, in its first discoverable state, is now found to be the future plant or animal in miniature, containing every thing essential to it when full grown, only requiring to have the several organs enlarged, and the interstices filled with extraneous nutritious matter. When the external form undergoes the greatest change, as from an aquatic insect to a flying gnat, a caterpillar to a crysalis, a crysalis to a butterfly, or a tadpole to a frog, there is nothing new in the organization; all the parts of the gnat, the butterfly, and the frog, having really existed, though not appearing to the common observer in the forms in which they are first seen. In like manner, every thing essential to the oak is found in the acorn.&lt;ref name="PriestleySG" &gt;Priestley, Joseph.

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], a physicist, and [[Theodor Schwann]], one of the founders of cell theory, published their independent discovery of [[yeast]] in [[alcoholic fermentation]].  They used the [[microscope]] to examine foam left over from the process of brewing [[beer]].  Where [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] described "small spheroid globules", they observed yeast cells undergo [[cell division]].  Fermentation would not occur when sterile air or pure oxygen was introduced if yeast were not present.  This suggested that airborne [[microorganisms]], not spontaneous generation, was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Springer | first=Alfred | date=October 13, 1892 | title=The Micro-organisms of the Soil | journal=Nature | volume=46 | issue=1198 | pages=576–579 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | issn=0028-0836| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT138&amp;lpg=PT138 | doi=10.1038/046576b0|bibcode=1892Natur..46R.576. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the idea of spontaneous generation had been in decline for nearly a century, its supporters did not abandon it all at once. As [[James Rennie]] wrote:

{{quote|...inability to trace the origin of minute plants and insects led to the doctrine of what is called spontaneous or equivocal generation, of which the fancies above-mentioned are some 'of the prominent branches. The experiments of Redi on the hatching of insects from eggs, which were published at Florence in 1668, first brought discredit upon this doctrine, though it had always a few eminent disciples. At present it is maintained by a considerable number -of distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, &amp;c. "The notion or spontaneous generation," says Bory, " is at first revolting to a rational mind, but it is, notwithstanding, demonstrable by the microscope. The fact is averred : Willer has seen it, I have seen it, and twenty other observers have seen it: the pandorinia exhibit it every instant. "These pandorinia he elsewhere describes as probably nothing more than " animated scions of Zoocarpae".  It would be unprofitable to go into any lengthened discussion upon this mysterious subject; and we have great doubts whether the ocular demonstration by the microscope would succeed except in the hands of a disciple of the school. Even with naturalists, whose business it is to deal with facts, the reason is often wonderfully influenced by the imagination...&lt;ref name=JRIT&gt;Rennie, James. Insect Transformations. Page 10.

===Pasteur and Tyndall===

[[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment is widely seen as having settled the question of spontaneous generation.  He boiled a meat broth in a flask that had a long neck that curved downward, like that of a goose or swan.  The idea was that the bend in the neck prevented falling particles from reaching the broth, while still allowing the free flow of air.  The flask remained free of growth for an extended period.  When the flask was turned so that particles could fall down the bends, the broth quickly became clouded.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, minority objections were persistent and not always unreasonable, given that the experimental difficulties were far more challenging than the popular accounts suggest. The investigations of [[John Tyndall]], a correspondent of Pasteur and a great admirer of Pasteur's work, were decisive in disproving spontaneous generation and dealing with lingering issues. Still, even Tyndall encountered difficulties in dealing with the effects of [[Endospore |microbial spores]], which were not well understood in his day. Like Pasteur, he boiled his cultures to sterilize them, and some types of bacterial spores can survive boiling. The [[autoclave]], which eventually came into universal application in medical practice and microbiology to sterilise equipment, was not an instrument that had come into use at the time of Tyndall's experiments, let alone those of Pasteur.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"/&gt;

In 1862, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] paid a special attention to the issue and established a prize "to him who by well-conducted experiments throws new light on the question of the so-called spontaneous generation" and appointed a commission to judge the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engelhardt |first1=Hugo Tristram |last2=Caplan |first2=Arthur L. |title=Scientific Controversies: Case Studies in the Resolution and Closure of Disputes in Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nkSX63VsLkC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-27560-6 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Jay Gould''' ({{IPAc-en|g|uː|l|d}}; September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]], and [[History of science|historian of science]]. He was also one of the most influential and widely read authors of [[popular science]] of his generation.&lt;ref name=Shermer2002&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Shermer|first1 = Michael|year = 2002|title = This View of Science|url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/shermer_sjgould.pdf|journal = Social Studies of Science|volume = 32|issue = 4|pages = 489–525|postscript = . |doi=10.1177/0306312702032004001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould spent most of his career teaching at [[Harvard University]] and working at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the [[Vincent Astor]] Visiting Research Professor of Biology at [[New York University]], where he divided his time teaching there and at Harvard.

Gould's most significant contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which he developed with [[Niles Eldredge]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=punc1972&gt;Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82–115.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of [[Cladogenesis|branching speciation]]. The theory was contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;Sepkoski, David (2012).

Most of Gould's empirical research was based on the [[land snail]] genera ''[[Poecilozonites]]'' and ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. He also made important contributions to [[evolutionary developmental biology]], receiving broad professional recognition for his book ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Müller G.B.

He campaigned against [[creationism]] and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]") whose authorities do not overlap.&lt;ref name=noma&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html "Nonoverlapping magisteria."] ''Natural History'' 106 (March): 16–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould was known by the general public mainly for his 300 popular essays in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=tatt&gt;{{cite web| author= Tattersall I |title=Remembering Stephen Jay Gould |url= http://naturalhistorymag.com/perspectives/302413/remembering-stephen-jay-gould|work = | accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his numerous books written for both the specialist and non-specialist.
In April 2000, the [[US Library of Congress]] named him a "[[Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legend]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Library of Congress |title=Living Legend: Stephen Jay Gould |url= https://www.loc.gov/about/awardshonors/livinglegends/bio/goulds.html | accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jay Gould was born in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on September 10, 1941. His father Leonard was a [[Court reporter|court stenographer]] and a [[World War II]] veteran in the [[United States Navy]]. His mother Eleanor was an artist, whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the city's [[Garment District, New York City|Garment District]].&lt;ref name="nhessay300"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gould | first1 = S.

Gould, 50, Broadway Designer."] October 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[List of public elementary schools in New York City#Region 3: Queens|P.S. 26]] elementary school and graduated from [[Jamaica High School]].&lt;ref name=Yoon&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk (2002). [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/us/stephen-jay-gould-60-is-dead-enlivened-evolutionary-theory.html "Stephen Jay Gould, 60, Is Dead; Enlivened Evolutionary Theory,"] ''New York Times'' May 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gould was five years old his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he first encountered ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. "I had no idea there were such things—I was awestruck," Gould once recalled.&lt;ref name=Green86&gt;Green, Michelle (1986). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/green_sjgould.html "Stephen Jay Gould: driven by a hunger to learn and to write".] ''People'' '''25''' (June 2): 109–114.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in that moment that he decided to become a paleontologist.

Raised in a [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jewish]] home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;In a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p005479y January 25, 2001 interview] for [[BBC Radio 4]] Gould stated, "Atheists can be highly moral people, I trust. I am myself." (27m:37s); Biologist [[Jerry Coyne]]—who had Gould on his thesis committee—described him as a "diehard atheist if there ever was one." (Sam Harris 2015. [http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/faith-vs.-fact/ "Faith vs. Fact: An Interview with Jerry Coyne."] May 19. [12m:22s] www.samharris.org.) Gould's close friend [[Oliver Sacks]] labeled Gould a "Jewish atheist". (Oliver Sacks 2006. "Introduction." ''The Richness of Life''. W. W. Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&amp;pg=PA8 p. 8.])&lt;/ref&gt; When asked directly if he was an agnostic in [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'']] magazine, he responded:

{{quote|If you absolutely forced me to bet on the existence of a conventional anthropomorphic deity, of course I'd bet no. But, basically, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] was right when he said that agnosticism is the only honorable position because we really cannot know. And that's right. I'd be real surprised if there turned out to be a conventional God.}}

Though he "had been brought up by a [[Marxism|Marxist]] father"&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1995). [https://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/i-Ch.2.html "The Pattern of Life's History."] In John Brockman (ed.) [https://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/d-Contents.html ''The Third Culture'']. New York: Simon &amp; Shuster, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; he stated that his father's politics were "very different" from his own.&lt;ref name=SET&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]], p. 1018. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing his own political views, he has said they "tend to the left of center."&lt;ref name="Gould_dep"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/depos/pf_gould_dep.htm "Official Transcript for Gould’s deposition in McLean v. Arkansas."] (Nov. 27). Under oath Gould stated: "My political views tend to the left of center. Q. Could you be more specific about your political views? A. I don't know how to be. I am not a joiner, so I am not a member of any organization. So I have always resisted labeling. But if you read my other book, ''The Mismeasure of Man'', which is not included because it is not about evolution, you will get a sense of my political views." p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gould the most influential political books he read were [[C. Wright Mills]]' ''[[The Power Elite]]'' and the political writings of [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref name="Gould_dep" /&gt;

While attending [[Antioch College]] in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the [[civil rights movement]] and often campaigned for [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perez | first1 = Myrna | year = 2013 | title = Evolutionary Activism: Stephen Jay Gould, the New Left and Sociobiology | url = https://www.docdroid.net/XjZM7Gv/stephen-gould-and-new-left-145q.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Endeavour | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 104–11 | doi = 10.1016/j.endeavour.2012.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he attended the [[University of Leeds]] as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a [[Bradford]] dance hall which refused to admit [[black people]]. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Gasper, Phil (2002). [http://www.isreview.org/issues/24/gould.shtml "Stephen Jay Gould:] [[Dialectical Biologist]]". ''International Socialist Review'' '''24''' (July–August).&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against [[Oppression|cultural oppression]] in all its forms, especially what he saw as the [[pseudoscience]] used in the service of racism and [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]] and [[Richard Levins]] (2002). [http://www.monthlyreview.org/1102lewontin.htm "Stephen Jay Gould—what does it mean to be a radical?"] ''Monthly Review'' 54 (Nov. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspersed throughout his scientific essays for ''Natural History'' magazine, Gould frequently referred to his nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected [[baseball card]]s and remained an avid [[New York Yankees]] fan throughout his life.&lt;ref name="mudville"&gt;Gould, S. J. (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XIJ-ay4GJ_kC&amp;pg=PA Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co. See his essays: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4337 "The Streak of Streaks."]&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult he was fond of [[science fiction film|science fiction]] movies, but often lamented their poor [[storytelling]] and presentation of science.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1993). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2483 "Dinomania".] ''New York Review of Books'' 40 (August 12): 51–56.&lt;/ref&gt; His other interests included singing [[baritone]] in the [[Boston Cecilia]], and he was a great aficionado of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gould | first1 = S.

He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1983).

===Marriage and family===
Gould married artist Deborah Lee on October 3, 1965.&lt;ref name="Yoon"/&gt; Gould met Lee while they were students together at [[Antioch College]].&lt;ref name=Green86 /&gt; They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan, and were married for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Frederic (1996) [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-08/news/ls-51756_1_stephen-jay-gould/2 "A Kinder, Gentler Stephen Jay Gould"] ''Los Angeles Times'' Oct 8.&lt;/ref&gt; His second marriage in 1995 was to artist and sculptor [[Rhonda Roland Shearer]].&lt;ref name=Yoon/&gt;

===First bout of cancer===
In July 1982 Gould was diagnosed with [[peritoneal mesothelioma]], a deadly form of cancer affecting the [[Human abdomen|abdominal lining]] (the [[peritoneum]]). This cancer is frequently found in people who have ingested or inhaled [[asbestos]] fibers, a mineral which was used in the construction of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Steve (2002). [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/may/22/medicalscience.internationaleducationnews Obituary: Stephen Jay Gould.] ''The Guardian'' May 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titus, Janet (1983). [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1983/1/24/safety-precautions-for-asbestos-taken-at/ "Safety Precautions for Asbestos Taken at MCZ."] ''The Harvard Crimson'' January 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine titled "The Median Isn't the Message", which discusses his reaction to discovering that, "mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1985). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_median-isn't-the-message.html "The Median Isn't the Message".] ''Discover'' 6 (June): 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay he describes the actual significance behind this fact, and his relief upon recognizing that [[statistics|statistical averages]] are useful abstractions, and by themselves do not encompass "our actual world of variation, shadings, and continua."

The [[median]] is the halfway point, which means that 50% of people will die before eight months. However the other half may live significantly longer depending on the nature of the distribution. Gould needed to determine where his individual characteristics placed him within this range. Given that his cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, he reasoned that he likely fell within the favorable tail of a [[Skewness|right skewed distribution]]. After an experimental treatment of [[Radiation therapy|radiation]], [[chemotherapy]], and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.

Gould was also an advocate of [[medical cannabis]]. When undergoing his cancer treatments he smoked marijuana to help alleviate the long periods of intense and uncontrollable nausea. According to Gould, the [[Cannabis (drug)|drug]] had a "most important effect" on his eventual recovery. He later complained that he could not understand how "any humane person would withhold such a beneficial substance from people in such great need simply because others use it for different purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Bakalar, James and Lester Grinspoon (1997). ''Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_marijuana.html pp. 39–41.]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 1998, Gould's testimony assisted in the successful lawsuit of [[HIV]] activist [[Jim Wakeford]], who sued the [[Government of Canada]] for the right to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Chwialkowska, Luiza (1995).

===Final illness and death===
In February 2002, a {{convert|3|cm|in|adj=on}} lesion was found on Gould's [[chest radiograph]], and oncologists diagnosed him with [[Cancer staging|stage IV]] cancer. Gould died 10 weeks later on May 20, 2002 from a [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[adenocarcinoma]] of the [[human lung|lung]], an aggressive form of cancer which had already spread to his brain, liver, and spleen.&lt;ref name=HGdies&gt;Harvard News Office (2002).

==Scientific career==

Gould began his higher education at [[Antioch College]], graduating with a double major in geology and philosophy in 1963.&lt;ref name="Allen2008"&gt;Allen, Warren (2008). [http://www.thedivineconspiracy.org/Z5218X.pdf "The Structure of Gould".] In Warren Allen et al. ''Stephen Jay Gould: Reflections on His View of Life''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 24, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he also studied at the [[University of Leeds]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve (2002). [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/may/22/medicalscience.internationaleducationnews "Stephen Jay Gould."] ''The Guardian'' (May 22).&lt;/ref&gt; After completing graduate work at [[Columbia University]] in 1967 under the guidance of [[Norman D.

In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and [[curator]] of [[invertebrate paleontology]] at the institution's [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].

In 1982 Harvard awarded him the title of [[Alexander Agassiz]] Professor of Zoology. The following year, 1983, he was awarded a fellowship at the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], where he later served as president (1999–2001). The AAAS news release cited his "numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, E. and D. Amber (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/19980130074957/http://aaas.org/communications/gould.htm "Stephen Jay Gould Voted President-Elect of AAAS."] ''AAAS News''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as president of the [[Paleontological Society]] (1985–1986) and of the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] (1990–1991).

In 1989 Gould was elected into the body of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Through 1996–2002 Gould was [[Vincent Astor]] Visiting Research Professor of Biology at [[New York University]]. In 2001, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the Humanist of the Year for his lifetime of work. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]], along with 12 other recipients. (Until 2008, this medal had been awarded every 50 years by the [[Linnean Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Linnean Society of London (2008).

===Punctuated equilibrium===
[[Image:PunctuatedEquilibrium.png|thumb|The punctuated equilibrium model (above) consists of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] stability followed by episodic bursts of evolutionary change via rapid cladogenesis. It is contrasted (below) to [[phyletic gradualism]], a more gradual, continuous model of evolution.]]{{main|Punctuated equilibrium}}

Early in his career, Gould and his colleague [[Niles Eldredge]] developed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which describes the rate of speciation in the fossil record as occurring relatively rapidly, which then alternates to a longer period of evolutionary stability.&lt;ref name=punc1972/&gt; It was Gould who coined the term "punctuated equilibria" though the theory was originally presented by Eldredge in his doctoral dissertation on [[Devonian]] [[trilobite]]s and his article published the previous year on [[allopatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, Niles (1971). [http://www.digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/6568/10.5531sd.paleo.8.pdf "The Allopatric Model and Phylogeny in Paleozoic Invertebrates."] ''Evolution'' Vol. 25, No. 1 (Mar. 1971), pp. 156–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar "in the central logic of [[Evolution|Darwinian theory]]."&lt;ref name=SET/&gt; Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was "of great interest to biology generally,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, Richard]] (1999). ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'', Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press, [https://web.natur.cuni.cz/filosof/markos/Publikace/Dawkins%20extended.pdf#page=111 p. 101.], {{ISBN|0-19-288051-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it merely modified [[neo-Darwinism]] in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before.&lt;ref name=PHT&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1038/309401a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | authorlink = John Maynard Smith | year = 1984 | title = Paleontology at the high table | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/maynard-smith_high-table.html | journal = Nature | volume = 309 | issue = 5967 | pages = 401–402 | bibcode = 1984Natur.309..401S | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name="Dynamics"&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1992). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/mayr_punctuated.html "Speciational Evolution or Punctuated Equilibria".] In Steven Peterson and Albert Somit. ''The Dynamics of Evolution''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp. 21–48. {{ISBN|0-8014-9763-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons were made to [[George Gaylord Simpson]]'s work in ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]'' (1941). However Simpson describes the paleontological record as being characterized by predominantly gradual change (which he termed horotely), though he also documented examples of slow (bradytely), and rapid (tachytely) rates of evolution. Punctuated equilibrium and phyletic gradualism are not mutually exclusive, and examples of each have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to [[Richard Dawkins]] has been oversold by the media.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986) ''The Blind Watchmaker''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;pg=PA225 p. 225.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as "evolution by jerks",&lt;ref&gt;Turner, John (1984). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6idhDboGmZoC&amp;pg=PA34 "Why we need evolution by jerks."] ''New Scientist'' 101 (Feb. 9): 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
which prompted Gould to describe [[phyletic gradualism]] as "evolution by creeps."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. and Steven Rose, ed. (2007). ''The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental biology===
&lt;!-- [[File:Neoteny.svg|thumb|right|175px|In one of his popular science essays, Gould (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1979).

Gould made significant contributions to [[evolutionary developmental biology]],&lt;ref name="Evolution1st4billionyrs"&gt;
Thomas, R.D.K. (2009). "Gould, Stephen Jay (1941–2002)". in M. Ruse and J. Travis (eds). ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Cambridge MA: Belknap Press. pp. 611–615.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in his work ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.&lt;ref name="Allen2008" /&gt; In this book he emphasized the process of [[heterochrony]], which encompasses two distinct processes: [[neoteny]] and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where [[ontogeny]] is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the [[Feather#Evolution|evolution of feathers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prum | first1 = R.O. | last2 = Brush | first2 = A.H. | year = 2003 | title = Which Came First, the Feather or the Bird? | url = http://docdro.id/Q6DBh2u | journal = Scientific American | volume = 288 | issue = 3| pages = 84–93 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0303-84 | pmid=12616863| bibcode = 2003SciAm.288c..84P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selectionism and sociobiology===
Gould was a champion of [[biological constraints]], internal limitations upon developmental pathways, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct [[adaptation]]s, he considered many higher functions of the [[human brain]] to be the unintended [[Unintended consequence|side consequence]] of [[natural selection]]. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term [[exaptation]] with paleontologist [[Elisabeth Vrba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gould | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Vrba | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Exaptation—a missing term in the science of form | url = http://www2.hawaii.edu/~khayes/Journal_Club/fall2006/Gould_&amp;_Vrb_1982_Paleobio.pdf | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 4–15 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an [[Genetic determinism|essential premise]] of human [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

====Against ''Sociobiology''====
In 1975, Gould's Harvard colleague [[E. O. Wilson]] introduced his analysis of animal behavior (including human behavior) based on a sociobiological framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary basis.&lt;ref&gt;
Wilson, E. O. (1975). ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Gould, [[Richard Lewontin]], and [[Sociobiology Study Group|others]] from the Boston area wrote the subsequently well-referenced letter to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled, "Against 'Sociobiology'". This [[open letter]] criticized Wilson's notion of a "deterministic view of human society and human action."&lt;ref&gt;

But Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior, and later wrote: "Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of [[altruism]]—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior... Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J.

which introduced the architectural term "[[spandrel]]" into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a triangular space which exists over the haunches of an arch.&lt;ref&gt;ITC (1908) ''International Library of Technology'' 38 (3): [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yp9IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA7-PA22 22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarkSpandrel"&gt;Mark, Robert (1996). [https://www.uv.mx/personal/tcarmona/files/2010/08/Mark-1996.pdf "Architecture and Evolution"] ''American Scientist'' (July–August): 383-389.&lt;/ref&gt; Spandrels—more often called [[pendentives]] in this context—are found particularly in classical architecture, especially Byzantine and Renaissance churches.

When visiting [[Venice]] in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels of the [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]] cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as "necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches." Gould and Lewontin thus defined "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]]" in the evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed examples include the "masculinized genitalia in female [[Hyenas#Appearance and biology|hyenas]], exaptive use of an [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant [[Irish Elk|Irish deer]], and several key features of human mentality."&lt;ref&gt;
Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.pnas.org/content/94/20/10750.full "The exaptive excellence of spandrels as a term and prototype".] ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 94 (20): 10750–5. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.94.20.10750 DOI] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11038582 PMID]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'', [[Candide#Synopsis|Dr. Pangloss]] is portrayed as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that "all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds". Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is [[Panglossian]] for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental [[Biological constraints|constraints]]. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1995). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1703 "Genes, Memes, &amp; Minds".] ''The New York Review of Books'' 42 (Nov. 30): 46–48. "By and large, I think their [Spandrels] paper had a healthy effect. . . . Their critique forced us to clean up our act and to provide evidence for our stories. But adaptationism remains the core of biological thinking." A similar appraisal is reflected by [[Ernst Mayr]] in his 1983 paper [http://academic.reed.edu/biology/courses/bio342/2010_syllabus/2010_readings/Mayr_1983.pdf "How to Carry Out the Adaptationist Program?"] ''The American Naturalist'' 121 (3): 324–334; and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], ''Natural Selection: Domains, Levels, and Challenges''. New York: Oxford University Press. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in [[Elisabeth Lloyd]]'s case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways.&lt;ref name="caseofthefemaleorgasm"&gt;Lloyd, E.A. (2005). ''The Case of The Female Orgasm: Bias in the science of evolution''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples"&lt;ref name="bullyforbrontosaurus"&gt;Gould, S.J. (1992). [https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/08/11/sjgould-male-nipples-and-clitoral-ripples/sjgould-male-nipples-and-clitoral-ripples.pdf "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819083705/https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/08/11/sjgould-male-nipples-and-clitoral-ripples/sjgould-male-nipples-and-clitoral-ripples.pdf |date=August 19, 2016 }} In ''[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]: Further Reflections in Natural History''. New York: W. W. Norton. pp. 124–138.&lt;/ref&gt; prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.

Gould was criticized by philosopher [[Dan Dennett]] for using the term spandrel instead of pendentive,&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Dan (1995) ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea''. New York: Penguin Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA274 p. 272.]&lt;/ref&gt; a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of ''[[American Scientist]]'', noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in [[architectural theory]]. Mark concluded, "Gould and Lewontin's misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett's critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question."&lt;ref name="MarkSpandrel"/&gt;

===Evolutionary progress===
Gould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term "[[Largest-scale trends in evolution|progress]]". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a [[March of Progress (illustration)|ladder of progress]], leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards [[complexity]], but towards [[biodiversity|diversification]]. Because life is constrained to begin with a [[abiogenesis|simple starting point]] (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with [[parasitism|parasites]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1996). ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]. New York: Harmony Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a "tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.2307/2411179 |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |year=1997 |title=Human chauvinism |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=1015–1020 |postscript=. |jstor=2411179 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601215949/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |archivedate=June 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cladistics===
Gould never embraced [[cladistics]] as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with [[Derek Briggs]], who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the [[Burgess Shale]] fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1991). [http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/gould1991.pdf "The disparity of the Burgess Shale arthropod fauna and the limits of cladistic analysis".] ''Paleobiology'' 17 (October): 411–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Christian and J. T. Høeg (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LalmQ4346O0C&amp;pg=PA3 "Gould, Scharm and the Paleontologocal Perspective in Evolutionary Biology".] In S. Koenemann and R.A. Jenner, ''Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships''. CRC Press. pp. 3–14. {{ISBN|0-8493-3498-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical work on land snails===
[[File:Cerion_watlingense_land_snail_shells_(modern%3B_northeastern_San_Salvador_Island,_eastern_Bahamas)_(15043406837).jpg|thumb|right|305px|''Cerion'' shells from [[San Salvador Island]], [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].]]
Most of Gould's empirical research pertained to [[land snails]]. He focused his early work on the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] genus [[Bermuda Land Snail|''Poecilozonites'']], while his later work concentrated on the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] genus ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. According to Gould "''Cerion'' is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form."&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, Lewis and Alison Richards (1998). ''A Passion For Science''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/wolpert_sjg-interview.html pp. 139–152.] {{ISBN|0-19-854212-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given ''Cerion's'' extensive geographic diversity, Gould later lamented that if [[Christopher Columbus]] had only catalogued a single ''Cerion'' it would have ended the scholarly debate about which island Columbus had first set foot on in America.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1996). "A Cerion for Christopher". ''Natural History'' 105 (Oct.): 22–29, 78—79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
Gould is one of the most frequently cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His 1979 "spandrels" paper has been cited more than 5,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar. [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8886524888381702203 https://scholar.google.com]. Retrieved on June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]]''—the flagship journal of his own speciality—only [[Charles Darwin]] and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] have been cited more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prothero|first1=Donald|title=Skeptic Festschrift lecture for Stephen Jay Gould|url=http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=av093&amp;Category_Code|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Society|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science. Historian [[Ronald Numbers]] has been quoted as saying: "I can't say much about Gould's strengths as a scientist, but for a long time I've regarded him as the second most influential historian of science (next to [[Thomas Kuhn]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Shermer | first1 = Michael | year = 2002 | title = This View of Science | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/shermer_sjgould.pdf | journal = Social Studies of Science | volume = 32 | issue = 4| page = 518 | postscript = . | doi=10.1177/0306312702032004001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''===
Shortly before his death, Gould published ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]'' (2002), a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory. In an interview for the Dutch TV series ''Of Beauty and Consolation'' Gould remarked, "In a couple of years I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life."&lt;ref&gt;de Mythe, Johannes (2000). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzchANB76jA&amp;t=46m07s&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL267ZaxyqR0ueMV5oBgIPzMd9MZFoSvxf ''Van de Schoonheid en de Troost'']. Episode 13. Hilversum, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a public figure===
Gould became widely known through his popular essays on [[evolution]] in the ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled ''This View of Life'' (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'') from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays.&lt;ref name=tatt/&gt; Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became [[bestseller|bestselling books]] such as ''[[Ever Since Darwin]]'' and ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'', ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', and ''[[The Flamingo's Smile]]''.

A passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]]. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and [[sabermetrician]] (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book ''Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville'' (2003).&lt;ref name="mudville"/&gt;

Although a self-described Darwinist, Gould's emphasis was less [[gradualism|gradualist]] and [[reductionism|reductionist]] than most [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinists]]. He fiercely opposed many aspects of [[sociobiology]] and its intellectual descendant [[evolutionary psychology]]. He devoted considerable time to fighting against [[creationism]], [[creation science]], and [[intelligent design]]. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''. Gould later developed the term "non-overlapping magisteria" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books ''Rocks of Ages'' (1999) and ''The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox'' (2003). In a 1982 essay for ''Natural History'' Gould wrote:

{{quote|Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science. The factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1982). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_nonmoral.html "Nonmoral Nature".] ''Natural History'' 91 (Feb.): 19–26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|anti-evolution petition]]'' drafted by the [[Discovery Institute]] inspired the [[National Center for Science Education]] to create a pro-evolution counterpart called "[[Project Steve]]," which is named in Gould's honor.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Science Education]] (2003). [http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves "Project Steve."] www.ncse.com. Retrieved August 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting of the executive council of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]] in 2011 selected Gould for inclusion in CSI's "Pantheon of Skeptics" created to remember the legacy of deceased CSI fellows and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=April 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=January 31, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on television. In 1984 Gould received his own ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' special on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS (1984). "Stephen Jay Gould: This View of Life". NOVA. December 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other appearances included interviews on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' and ''[[Talkback Live]]'',&lt;ref&gt;CNN.

Gould was also a guest in all seven episodes of the Dutch talk series ''[[A Glorious Accident]]'', in which he appeared with his close friend [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Kayzer, Wim (1993) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnpoLqNklL8&amp;index=5&amp;list=PL267ZaxyqR0ueMV5oBgIPzMd9MZFoSvxf ''Een schitterend ongeluk''.].

Gould was featured prominently as a guest in [[Ken Burns]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]'', as well as [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''[[Evolution (TV series)|Evolution]]'' series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential [[Children's Television Workshop]] television show ''[[3-2-1 Contact]]'', where he made frequent guest appearances.

Since 2013, Gould has been listed on the Advisory Council of the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |title=Advisory Council |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810112828/https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |archivedate=2013-08-10 |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode "[[Lisa the Skeptic]]", Lisa finds a skeleton that many people believe is an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] angel. Lisa contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton's [[DNA]]. The fossil is discovered to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Lisa the Skeptic]]", November 23, 1997. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/audio/gould_simpsons-lisa-the-skeptic.mp3 Audio clip.]&lt;/ref&gt; During production the only phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as the "world's most brilliant paleontologist".&lt;ref name="Scully"&gt;Scully, Mike (2006).

Gould had died two days before the episode aired.

== The "Darwin Wars" ==
Gould received many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural history,&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (2002). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/shermer_sjgould.pdf "This View of Science"]. ''Social Studies of Science'' 32 (4): 518.
:"Awards include a National Book Award for ''The Panda's Thumb'', a National Book Critics Circle Award for ''The Mismeasure of Man'', the Phi Beta Kappa Book Award for ''Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes'', and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] Finalist for ''Wonderful Life'', on which Gould commented "close but, as they say, no cigar." Forty-four honorary degrees and 66 major fellowships, medals, and awards bear witness to the depth and scope of his accomplishments in both the sciences and humanities: Member of the National Academy of Sciences, President and Fellow of AAAS, MacArthur Foundation 'genius' Fellowship (in the first group of awardees), Humanist Laureate from the Academy of Humanism, Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow of the European Union of Geosciences, Associate of the Muséum National D'Histoire Naturelle Paris, the Schuchert Award for excellence in paleontological research, Scientist of the Year from ''Discover'' magazine, the Silver Medal from the Zoological Society of London, the Gold Medal for Service to Zoology from the Linnean Society of London, the Edinburgh Medal from the City of Edinburgh, the Britannica Award and Gold Medal for dissemination of public knowledge, Public Service Award from the Geological Society of America, Anthropology in Media Award from the American Anthropological Association, Distinguished Service Award from the National Association of Biology Teachers, Distinguished Scientist Award from UCLA, the Randi Award for Skeptic of the Year from the Skeptics Society, and a ''Festschrift'' in his honour at Caltech."&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of biologists felt his public presentations were out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref&gt;
These are the first two paragraphs, with notes, from an unpublished [http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html "Letter to the Editor of ''The New York Review of Books''"] by [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] (July 7, 1997). They wrote in comment on two NYRB articles by Gould (June 12 and 26).

:John Maynard Smith, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists, recently summarized in the NYRB the sharply conflicting assessments of Stephen Jay Gould: "Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the pre-eminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists." (NYRB, November 30, 1995, p. 46). No one can take any pleasure in the evident pain Gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within the community of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely known. If what was a stake was solely one man's self-regard, common decency would preclude comment.

:But as Maynard Smith points out, more is at stake. Gould "is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory"—or as Ernst Mayr says of Gould and his small group of allies—they "quite conspicuously misrepresent the views of [biology's] leading spokesmen."{{ref|a}} Indeed, although Gould characterizes his critics as "anonymous" and "a tiny coterie," nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has weighed in a vain attempt to correct the tangle of confusions that the higher profile Gould has inundated the intellectual world with.{{ref|b}} The point is not that Gould is the object of some criticism—so properly are we all—it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority about evolutionary biology is non-existent among those who are in a professional position to know.

Note: Where Tooby and Cosmides quote Ernst Mayr, Mayr does not mention Gould by name, but is speaking generally of the critics of the [[Neo-Darwinism|Neo-Darwinian]] Synthesis. Also, the list of major biologists provided by Tooby and Cosmides may not be fairly represented. E.g., Mayr, Williams, Dawkins, and Coyne have expressed public admiration for Gould as a scientist.

&lt;br /&gt;In the first of his two articles that provoked Tooby and Cosmides, Gould had commented on the November 1995 review of his work by Maynard Smith: Gould, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jun/12/darwinian-fundamentalism/?page=2 "Darwinian Fundamentalism"], ''New York Review of Books'' 44 (June 12, 1997): 34–37.

:A false fact can be refuted, a false argument exposed; but how can one respond to a purely ad hominem attack? This harder, and altogether more discouraging, task may best be achieved by exposing internal inconsistency and unfairness of rhetoric.

:It seems futile to reply to an attack so empty of content, and based only on comments by anonymous critics; [...] Instead of responding to Maynard Smith's attack against my integrity and scholarship, citing people unknown and with arguments unmentioned, let me, instead, merely remind him of the blatant inconsistency between his admirable past and lamentable present. Some sixteen years ago he wrote a highly critical but wonderfully [https://books.google.com/books?id=YrbfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 supportive review] of my early book of essays, ''The Panda's Thumb'', stating: "I hope it will be obvious that my wish to argue with Gould is a compliment, not a criticism." He then attended my series of Tanner Lectures at Cambridge in 1984 and wrote in a report for ''Nature'', and under the remarkable title "[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/maynard-smith_high-table.html Paleontology at the High Table]," the kindest and most supportive critical commentary I have ever received. He argued that the work of a small group of American paleobiologists had brought the entire subject back to theoretical centrality within the evolutionary sciences. [...]
:So we face the enigma of a man who has written numerous articles, amounting to tens of thousands of words, about my work—always strongly and incisively critical, always richly informed (and always, I might add, enormously appreciated by me). But now Maynard Smith needs to canvass unnamed colleagues to find out that my ideas are "hardly worth bothering with". He really ought to be asking himself why he has been bothering about my work so intensely, and for so many years.&lt;/ref&gt; The public debates between Gould's supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed "The Darwin Wars" by several commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Andrew (1999).

[[John Maynard Smith]], the eminent British evolutionary biologist, was among Gould's strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould's acceptance of [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] as a major component of biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1981). [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n11/john-maynardsmith/did-darwin-get-it-right "Did Darwin get it right?"] ''The London Review of Books'' '''3''' (11): 10–11; Also reprinted in ''Did Darwin Get it Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989, pp. 148–156.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of [[Daniel Dennett]]'s book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Maynard Smith wrote that Gould "is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1995). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1703 "Genes, Memes, &amp; Minds".] ''The New York Review of Books'' 42 (Nov. 30): 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; But Maynard Smith was not consistently negative, writing in a review of ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'' that "Stephen Gould is the best writer of popular science now active... Often he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1981). "Review of ''The Panda's Thumb''" ''The London Review of Books'' pp. 17–30; Reprinted as [http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MaynardSmith/DarwinRight/Right.htm#11 "Tinkering"] in his ''Did Darwin Get It Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall. 1989, pp. 94, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould's reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.&lt;ref name = PHT/&gt;

One reason for criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than [[natural selection]], mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by [[Creationism|creationists]] as "proof" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved.&lt;ref name=Wright1999&gt;Wright, Robert (1999). [http://www.nonzero.org/newyorker.htm "The Accidental Creationist: Why Stephen J. Gould is bad for evolution".] ''[[The New Yorker]]'' 75 (Dec. 13): 56–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as fact and theory".] ''Discover'' '''2''' (May): 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflicts between Richard Dawkins and Gould were popularized by philosopher [[Kim Sterelny]] in his 2001 book ''[[Dawkins vs. Gould]]''. Sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues, including the prominence of [[gene selection]] in evolution. Dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated [[Group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multi-level selection]], which includes selection amongst [[gene]]s, [[Transposon|nucleic acid sequences]], [[cell lineage]]s, [[organism]]s, [[deme (biology)|demes]], [[species]], and [[clade]]s.&lt;ref name="Sterelny" /&gt;

Dawkins accused Gould of deliberately underplaying the differences between rapid [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]] and [[macromutation]] in his published accounts of [[punctuated equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1998). ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZudTchiioUoC&amp;pg=PA202 pp. 196–197]. "It is when we ask what happens during the sudden bursts of species formation that the confusion... arises... Gould is aware of the difference between rapid gradualism and macromutation, but he treats the matter as though it were a minor detail, to be cleared up after we have taken on board the overarching question of whether evolution is episodic rather than gradual."&lt;/ref&gt; He also devoted entire chapters to critiquing Gould's account of evolution in his books ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'', as did Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''.

===Cambrian fauna===
In his book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' (1989) Gould famously described the [[Cambrian]] fauna of the [[Burgess Shale]], emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs, their sudden appearance, and the role chance played in determining which members survived. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role contingency has in shaping the broader pattern of evolution.

His view of contingency was criticized by [[Simon Conway Morris]] in his 1998 book ''The Crucible of Creation''.&lt;ref name=Conway1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conway Morris |first1=S. |last2=Gould |first2=S. J. |year=1998 |title=Showdown on the Burgess Shale |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/naturalhistory_cambrian.html |journal=Natural History |volume=107 |pages=48–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway Morris stressed members of the Cambrian fauna that resemble modern taxa. He also argued that [[convergent evolution]] has a tendency to produce "similarities of organization" and that the forms of life are restricted and channelled. In his book ''Life's Solution'' (2003) Conway Morris argued that the appearance of human-like animals is also likely.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, Simon (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdQLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7 ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe.''] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paleontologist [[Richard Fortey]] noted that prior to the release of ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', Conway Morris shared a similar thesis to Gould's, but after ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more [[Evolutionary progress|deterministic]] position on the history of life.&lt;ref&gt;Fortey, Richard (1998). [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n19/fort01_.html "Shock Lobsters".] ''London Review of Books'' 20 (Oct. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologists [[Derek Briggs]] and [[Richard Fortey]] have also argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as [[stem group]]s of living taxa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0094:WSSSGA]2.0.CO;2 |last1=Briggs |first1=Derek |authorlink=Derek Briggs |authorlink2=Richard Fortey |last2=Fortey |first2=Richard |year=2005 |title=Wonderful Strife: systematics, stem groups, and the phylogenetic signal of the Cambrian radiation |url=http://systematicbiology.co.nf/BriggsFortey05_CambrianRadiation.pdf |journal=Paleobiology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=94–112 }} [https://archive.is/20130415152549/http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031%5B0094:WSSSGA%5D2.0.CO;2 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; though this is still a subject of intense research and debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists.

Richard Dawkins disagrees with the view that new phyla suddenly appeared in the Cambrian, arguing that for a new [[phylum]] "to spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported any such notion."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1998). ''Unweaving the Rainbow'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZudTchiioUoC&amp;pg=PA202 p. 202.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Structure of Evolutionary Theory'' Gould stresses the difference between phyletic splitting and large anatomical transitions, noting that the two events may be separated by millions of years. Gould argues that no paleontologist regards the Cambrian explosion "as a genealogical event—that is as the actual time of initial splitting", but rather it "marks an anatomical transition in the overt phenotypes of bilaterian organisms."&lt;ref name=SETp1156&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]], p. 1156. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to sociobiology and evolutionary psychology ===
Gould also had a long-running public feud with [[E. O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists concerning the disciplines of [[sociobiology|human sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], both of which Gould and Lewontin opposed, but which [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]], and [[Steven Pinker]] advocated.&lt;ref name=Gould1997&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_pluralism.html "Evolution: The pleasures of pluralism".] ''The New York Review of Books'' 44 (June 26): 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt; These debates reached their climax in the 1970s, and included strong opposition from groups such as the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] and [[Science for the People]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. O. (2006). ''Naturalist'' New York: Island Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZH2nHEPSjYC&amp;pg=PA337 p.337] {{ISBN|1-59726-088-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker accuses Gould, Lewontin, and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Pinker, Steven |title=[[The Blank Slate]]: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-14-200334-4 |oclc= |doi= | authorlink = Steven Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould stated that he made "no attribution of motive in Wilson's or anyone else's case" but cautioned that all human beings are influenced, especially unconsciously, by our personal expectations and biases. He wrote:

{{quote|I grew up in a family with a tradition of participation in campaigns for [[social justice]], and I was active, as a student, in the civil rights movement at a time of great excitement and success in the early 1960s. Scholars are often wary of citing such commitments. … [but] it is dangerous for a scholar even to imagine that he might attain complete neutrality, for then one stops being vigilant about personal preferences and their influences—and then one truly falls victim to the dictates of prejudice. [[Objectivity (science)|Objectivity]] must be operationally defined as fair treatment of data, not absence of preference.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J. (1996). [http://selfdefinition.org/science/25-greatest-science-books-of-all-time/17.%20Stephen%20Jay%20Gould%20-%20The%20Mismeasure%20of%20Man%20(1981)%20-%20Revised%20edition%20-%20missing%20last%20page.pdf ''The Mismeasure of Man: Revised and Expanded Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129135810/http://selfdefinition.org/science/25-greatest-science-books-of-all-time/17.%20Stephen%20Jay%20Gould%20-%20The%20Mismeasure%20of%20Man%20(1981)%20-%20Revised%20edition%20-%20missing%20last%20page.pdf |date=November 29, 2015 }}'' New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., p. 36. {{ISBN|0-14-025824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through [[Sociocultural evolution|culture]] as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible.&lt;ref name="BioPotent"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1992). [https://cbs.asu.edu/sites/default/files/PDFS/Gould%20Potentiality%20v%20Determinism.pdf "Biological potentiality vs. biological determinism".] In ''Ever Since Darwin''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., pp. 251–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as "biological potentiality vs. biological determinism." Gould stated that the [[human brain]] allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility "permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous… Violence, sexism, and general nastiness ''are'' biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biological—and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish."&lt;ref name="BioPotent" /&gt;

=== ''The Mismeasure of Man'' ===
{{Main|The Mismeasure of Man}}

Gould was the author of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), a [[History of science|history]] and inquiry of [[psychometrics]] and [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence testing]], generating perhaps the greatest controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread praise&lt;ref&gt;In 1981 ''The Mismeasure of Man'' won the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction. It was voted as the 17th greatest science book of all time by ''Discover'' magazine vol. 27 (December 8, 2006); 9th best skeptic book by [[The Skeptics Society]] (Frank Diller, "Scientists' Nightstand" ''American Scientist''); and ranked 24th place for the best non-fiction book by the [[Modern Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; and extensive criticism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Blinkhorn|Blinkhorn, Steve]] (1982). [http://www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/mismeasr.htm "What Skulduggery?"] ''Nature'' '''296''' (April 8): 506.&lt;/ref&gt; including claims of misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=Jensen1982&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jensen |first1=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Jensen |year=1982 |title=The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons |url=http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html |journal=Contemporary Education |volume=1 |issue=2|pages=121–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould investigated the methods of nineteenth century [[craniometry]], as well as the history of [[Intelligence quotient|psychological testing]]. Gould claimed that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in [[biological determinism]], the view that "social and economic differences between human groups—primarily [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1981). ''The Mismeasure of Man''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reprinted in 1996 with the addition of a new foreword and a critical review of ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

In 2011, a study conducted by six [[anthropology|anthropologists]] criticized Gould's claim that [[Samuel George Morton|Samuel Morton]] unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements, arguing that his analysis of Morton was influenced by his opposition to racism.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1978).

==Non-overlapping magisteria==
{{Main|Non-overlapping magisteria}}
In his book ''[[Rocks of Ages (book)|Rocks of Ages]]'' (1999), Gould put forward what he described as "a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion."&lt;ref name=RoA&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. New York: Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt; He defines the term ''magisterium'' as "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution."&lt;ref name=RoA/&gt; The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover "the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry."&lt;ref name=RoA /&gt; He suggests that "NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism" and that NOMA is "a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria."&lt;ref name=RoA/&gt;

This view has not been without criticism, however. For example, in his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argues that the division between religion and science is not so simple as Gould claims, as few religions exist without claiming the existence of [[miracle]]s, which "by definition, violate the principles of science."&lt;ref name="DawkinsTGD"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2006). ''[[The God Delusion]]''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins also opposes the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values, and therefore has no authority to claim a [[magisterium]] of its own.&lt;ref name="DawkinsTGD"/&gt; He goes on to say that he believes Gould is disingenuous in much of what he says in ''[[Rocks of Ages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2006). ''[[The God Delusion]]''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 81.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[secular humanism|humanist]] philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] argues that Gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about questions of ethics. In fact, Kurtz claims that science is a much better method than religion for determining moral principles.&lt;ref name="Kurtz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_kurtz_science_and_religion_are_they_compatible/ |title=Paul Kurtz - Science and Religion: Are They Compatible? |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |work=[[Point of Inquiry]] Podcast |date=December 11, 2005 |accessdate=January 18, 2014 |author=Grothe, DJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theories of Forgetting''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by [[Fiction Collective Two]] in 2014.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''Theories of Forgetting'' is a novel made up of three intersecting narratives. The first involves the story of a middle-aged video artist, Alana, working on a short experimental video about [[Robert Smithson]]'s [[land art]] [[Spiral Jetty]]. The second involves the story of Alana’s husband, Hugh, and his slow disappearance throughout Europe and across Jordan on a trip there both to remember and to forget in the aftermath of Alana’s unexpected death. His vanishing is linked to the Sleeping Beauties, a rising global religious cult that worships barbiturates. The third narrative involves the story of their daughter, Aila, an art critic and conceptual artist living in Berlin, and the marginalia she writes in her father's manuscript she discovers after his disappearance.

Each of these narratives has its own unique form and texture. Alana’s takes the shape of a diary containing photographs, drawings, newspaper clippings, and meditations on Smithson’s oeuvre, with which she becomes increasingly obsessed. Hugh’s is a more conventional third-person narrative, its voice numbed, disoriented, in the wake of his wife's unexpected death. Aila's notes exist only in the margins of Hugh's text.

Each page of the novel is divided in half. One narrative runs across the “top” from “front” to “back,” while the other runs “upside down” across the “bottom” of the page from “back” to “front.” In a sense, then, the novel’s physical structure suggests a spiral. ''Theories of Forgetting'' doesn't possess a front cover. Rather, it possesses two back ones. Opening it, the reader must choose what constitutes the privileged narrative, the one with which to begin, and that choice will exert pressure on the meaning she or he will make, since there are contradictory elements in the competing plots.

''Theories of Forgetting,'' then, is interested in the materiality of page as well as in such thematic questions as death and the problem of memory and history.

==Reception==
''The Collagist'' commented that with ''Theories of Forgetting'' "Olsen delivers what could be called a 'destructuralized' novel that successfully resists the temptation of a conventional narrative strategy, yet for a novel that so self-consciously flashes its experimental bona fides, ''Theories'' remains eminently readable. Innovation and accessibility need not be in opposition to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theories of Forgetting|url=http://thecollagist.com/the-collagist/2014/11/3/theories-of-forgetting-by-lance-olsen.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|journal=The Collagist|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Quarterly conversation'' called Olsen's novel "a masterful work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theories of Forgetting|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/theories-of-forgetting-by-lance-olsen|accessdate=26 July 2016|journal=The Quarterly Conversation|date=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats win 62% of the votes and achieve an overall majority with 92 of the 140 seats in the parliament. The Socialists, with 26% of the vote, win 38 seats. Turnout is 90%. (to March 29)
|-
| April 3 || Alia resigns as president and is succeeded on April 9 by [[Sali Berisha]], the first democratic leader of Albania since Bishop Noli. The first non-Communist government, headed by [[Aleksandër Meksi]], is elected on April 13. Its stated priority is to establish law and order to transform the paralyzed economy through a reform program emphasizing a free-market economy and privatization.
|-

|-
| July 26 || Four months after its March defeat, the Socialist Party makes impressive gains in the country's first democratic local elections. The Democratic Party wins 43.2% of the vote, compared to 41.3% cast for the Socialists. Continued economic hardships, general apathy, and a split within the Democratic Party contributed to its poor showing. It holds local administrative control in most large cities, while the Socialists control much of the countryside.
|-
| September || Former President Alia is detained, joining eighteen other former communist officials, including [[Nexhmije Hoxha]], who are charged with corruption and other offenses.
|-

|-
| October || Greece recalls its ambassador for consultations after a series of border incidents and alleged [[human rights abuses]] in Albania.
|-
| rowspan="6" valign="top" | 1994 || || Albania's postcommunist transformation continues, with more progress in some areas than others. [[Greek-Albanian relations]] deteriorate, and [[Athens]] blocks European Union loans to [[Tirana]], impeding Albania's much-needed integration into Europe. Gross domestic product grows by 8%, and inflation continues its downward spiral. Unemployment, however, remains the country's Achilles' heel; more than 300,000 workers are unemployed. Some $400 million sent home by [[Albanian emigrants]] play a vital role in boosting the domestic economy by increasing the volume of disposable income. For most, economic hardship and widespread poverty are the norm. Albania's foreign debt continues to soar. The [[Politics of Albania|political climate]] is relatively stable, but hostility between ruling and opposition forces continues to surface. The Socialist Party and other political groups accuse President [[Sali Berisha]] of becoming increasingly authoritarian. Albania makes considerable progress in foreign affairs, although relations with some of its neighbours continue to be fraught with problems. The impasse in relations between Belgrade and Tirana persists, but ties with [[Bulgaria]], Turkey, the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Italy]] further improve. Relations with Greece raise worries about a new Balkan flash point.
|-
| April || Following a raid on an army training camp in which two Albanian conscripts were killed, Tirana arrests five ethnic Greeks, finds them guilty of espionage and illegal possession of weapons, and sentences them to between six and eight years in prison. Angered by the verdict, (the court was being held behind closed doors, no international observers were allowed) Athens reportedly expels as many as 70,000 of the 300,000 illegal Albanian immigrants living in Greece.
|-
| April || [[Fatos Nano]] is convicted of state funds during his premiership in 1991 and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment; the ruling is upheld by an appeals court in the following month.
|-
| July || [[Ramiz Alia]] is tried on a number of charges, including forced deportation of political prisoners, summary executions, and the upholding of the 1967 ban on religious activity. The charges are later changed to abuse of power and violation of citizens' rights. Alia pleads "not guilty" and protests that the allegations made against him are unclear; he is convicted, however, and sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment.
|-
| October 4 || A draft constitution is presented to Berisha. Failing to obtain the requisite two-thirds majority approval for it in the People's Assembly, Berisha calls for a national referendum, the first of its kind. Surprisingly, the November 6 vote goes against Berisha (53.9% of voters reject the draft constitution), perpetuating the deadlock with the Socialists.
|-
| November || Alia's prison sentence is reduced to 5 years.
|-
| rowspan="10" valign="top" | 1995 || || Berisha still faces formidable political, economic, and social problems. The leading opposition Socialist Party threatens the Democratic Party's hold on power, while the latter cites notable successes in economic and foreign affairs and predicts victory in the parliamentary elections scheduled for March 1996. Among the 49 new legislative decisions approved by the People's Assembly in 1995 are land and property laws that positively affect the flow of domestic and foreign investments, especially in the field of agriculture. The process of privatization continues, with some 1,400 small-sized enterprises privatized. Albania's $700 million foreign debt is substantially reduced. Gross domestic product grows by an estimated 6%, and inflation drops to about 10%. The agricultural, construction, and private-service sectors register high rates of growth – 15%, 90%, and 25%, respectively. The industrial sector remains the weakest economic link, with continued production losses. Exports also lag. Continued progress is made in foreign affairs, with the exception of an impasse between Tirana and Belgrade. A slight improvement in Greek-Albanian relations is evidenced. U.S.-Albanian military cooperation develops quickly. Joint projects in 1995 include U.S. intelligence-gathering flights to Bosnia and Herzegovina from bases in Albania, exchanges of high-level military delegations, medical and military exercises, and the construction of Albania's only military hospital.
|-
| March || The chairman of the Democratic Party, [[Eduard Selami]], is dismissed at an extraordinary party congress for opposing Berisha's efforts to organize a further referendum for the draft constitution. Selami is replaced by [[Tritan Shehu]].

|-
| July || Albania is admitted to the [[Council of Europe]].
|-
| July 7 || The Supreme Court orders the immediate release of Alia, owing to the provisions of a new penal code, which took effect at the beginning of June. Also in July the case against [[Vilson Ahmeti]] is abandoned, owing to a lack of evidence.
|-
| September || A first-ever meeting between U.S. and Albanian heads of state occurs. See also: [[Albania–United States relations]]
|-
| September 1 || As a result of an agreement between Albania and 41 Western banks, the country's debt owed to those institutions drops from $500 million to $100 million.
|-
| November 27 || Nano's prison sentence is reduced to 4 years. On December 30 Berisha reduces his sentence by a further 8 months.
|-
| December 15 || 14 prominent Communist politicians are arrested, including former defense minister [[Prokop Murra]] and former president [[Haxhi Lleshi]]. (to December 16)
|-
| rowspan="8" valign="top" | 1996 || || Gross domestic product grows by an estimated 8%, while inflation rises by about 4–5%, mainly owing to the introduction of a value-added tax. Unemployment drops to a total of 170,000, or about 13%. The agricultural and especially the construction and private-service sectors continue to register robust two-digit growth. Remittances from Albanian émigrés in Greece, Italy, Germany, and the U.S. still account for an estimated 20% of GDP. The nation's relationship with Greece is improved when a high-ranking Greek official visits Albania, and a number of important cooperation agreements are signed. The impasse between Tirana and Belgrade continues, although ethnic Albanians from Kosovo are allowed to travel to Albania. Tirana dispatches a 33-man peacekeeping force to the German contingent of [[IFOR]] (the NATO-led Implementation Force) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the first time in the country's history that Albanian troops have been stationed abroad.
|-
| || Albania receives an aid package from the U.S. worth $100 million.
|-

|-
| March 6 || The former chief of the [[Sigurimi]] is arrested following bomb attacks in [[Tirana]] on February 26 and in [[Durrës]] on March 6.
|-
| 26 May || The third post-Communist parliamentary elections plunge Albania into its deepest political crisis since the demise of communist rule. Hours before the polls close, all major opposition parties pull out their candidates, accusing the ruling Democratic Party of engineering widespread [[election irregularities]]. Riot police violently break up a protest rally. On June 2 a second round is held, again boycotted by most of the opposition. The chairman of the Central Electoral Commission puts turnout at 59% compared to 89% in the first round. Final results give the ruling Democratic Party 122 seats in the 140-seat parliament (87% of the vote). The Socialists refuse to recognize the results and do not take their nine seats.
|-
| July 11 || Berisha forms a new enlarged (25-member) cabinet. Among the new ministers are [[Tritan Shehu]] as foreign minister and deputy premier, [[Ridvan Bode]] as finance minister, and [[Halit Shamata]] as interior minister. The government includes four female members, the widest female representation in the history of the country.
|-
| November 5 || The appeals court upholds prison sentences of up to 20 years on nine high-ranking officials of the communist era. They were sentenced on September 28 for putting thousands of dissidents into internal exile. Those charged included party leaders from Tirana, [[Lushnjë]] and other towns, as well as secret police and officials of the Interior Ministry.
|-
| November 6 || Shortly after midnight, in downtown Tirana an explosion takes place in the apartment of Prel Martini, chief judge of the appeals court. The bomb leaves his five-year-old daughter with a broken leg and injures Martini, his seven-year-old son and two women in neighbouring  apartments. Prime Minister [[Aleksandër Meksi]] says the explosion is a politically motivated terrorist act.
|-
| rowspan="24" valign="top" | 1997 || || In the [[1997 unrest in Albania]] the general elections of June 1997 brought the Socialists and their allies to power. President Berisha resigned from his post, and Socialists elected [[Rexhep Meidani]] as [[president of Albania]]. [[Albanian Socialist Party]] Chairman [[Fatos Nano]] was elected Prime Minister, a post which he held until October 1998, when he resigned as a result of the tense situation created in the country after the assassination of [[Azem Hajdari]], a prominent leader of the Democratic Party. [[Pandeli Majko]] was then elected Prime Minister, and he served in this post until November 1999, when he was replaced by [[Ilir Meta]]. Albania approved its constitution through a popular referendum which was held in November 1998, but which was boycotted by the opposition. The general local elections of October 2000 marked the loss of control of the Democrats over the local governments and a victory for the Socialists.
|-
| January 24 || Following the collapse of several "[[get-rich-quick]]" [[pyramid schemes]], in which hundreds of thousands of Albanians lost their life savings, enraged investors go on the rampage in the southern town of [[Lushnjë]]. Foreign Minister Shehu is attacked by demonstrators there on January 25. On January 26, thousands of people converge on central Tirana and clash with riot police. Government buildings are set ablaze in towns and cities across the country. In February unrest engulfs [[Vlorë]], causing several deaths. (to January 26)
|-
| March || The [[UN Security Council]] approves dispatching a multinational military force to Albania to oversee the distribution of international humanitarian aid and maintain order.
|-
| March 1 || Prime Minister [[Aleksandër Meksi]] resigns.
|-
| March 2 || A national [[state of emergency]] is declared. Rioters take control of the town of [[Sarandë]], seizing weapons from police headquarters and army barracks. With astonishing speed the entire military establishment melts away, the security service dissolves, and the people arm themselves with every type of weapon, including Kalashnikovs and even tanks – an estimated 650,000 weapons are seized. Most of the southern half of the country falls into the hands of ragtag rebels and criminal gangs. More than 10,000 persons flee to Italy, which in turn causes a governmental crisis in Rome. Several high government officials, including Defense Minister [[Safet Zhulali]], flee abroad.
|-
| March 3 || Despite widespread demands for his resignation, on President Berisha is reelected unopposed by Parliament (113-1 with 4 abstentions).
|-
| March 6 || Insurgents take control of [[Tepelenë]], and on March 8 they seize [[Gjirokastër]], the last southern government stronghold. (to March 8)
|-
| March 11 || [[Bashkim Fino]] of the opposition Socialist Party is appointed as prime minister. [[Arjan Starova]] becomes foreign minister; [[Shaqir Vukaj]], defense minister; [[Arben Malaj]], finance minister; [[Belul Celo]], interior minister. Unrest spreads to northern Albania, and by March 13 engulfs all major population centres, including Tirana. Alia flees jail during the insurrection. Nano is pardoned by Berisha on March 16. Foreign countries begin to evacuate their nationals from the country, which is now in a state of anarchy. More than 360 people have been killed and 3,500 wounded in three months. The tragic events also cause the economy to suffer. Unemployment soars over the 25% mark, inflation rises, and gross domestic product, which registered 8–11% increases in the previous few years, drops by 7%. The currency is devalued from 108 to more than 150 leks to the US dollar. (to March 16)
|-
| March 28 || More than 80 people die when an Albanian refugee ship collides with an Italian ship in the [[Adriatic Sea]].

|-
| June 2 || A bomb attack injures 27 people in Tirana.
|-
| June 4 || A grenade is thrown at Berisha during a campaign rally outside Tirana but it is deactivated.
|-
| June 29 || The Socialist Party wins parliamentary elections, with 100 seats out of 155. Their coalition allies win 17 seats, and Berisha's Democratic Party 27. Turnout in the first round is about 65%. In a referendum held at the same time, about one-third of voters support the restoration of the monarchy. The Socialists say Albania will be a parliamentary republic, with executive power concentrated in the hands of the prime minister rather than the president. (to July 6)
|-
| July 3 || Interior Minister [[Belul Celo]] resigns.
|-
| July 7 || Tritan Shehu resigns as Democratic Party chairman.
|-
| July 23 || '''President Berisha resigns'''.
|-
| July 24 || Parliament elects secretary of the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] and former physics professor [[Rexhep Meidani]] as [[President of Albania]] (110-3 with 2 abstentions). Meidani then accepts the resignation of Prime Minister Fino, and names Socialist Party leader Nano as new [[Prime minister of Albania]].
|-
| July 25 || A new 20-member multiparty cabinet (excluding the Democratic Party) is presented by Nano, including [[Paskal Milo]] as foreign minister, [[Sabit Brokaj]] as defense minister, [[Neritan Ceka]] as interior minister, and [[Arben Malaj]] retaining his post of finance minister.
|-
| September 18 || The Democrats leave parliament when one of their deputies, Azem Hajdari, is shot and wounded by a Socialist inside the chamber.
|-
| October 21 || Berisha is elected chairman of the Democratic Party.
|-
| December 23 || Alia, who escaped from jail in March and left the country, returns from abroad. He, two ex-interior ministers – [[Hekuran Isai]] (1982–89, 1990–91) and [[Simon Stefani]] (1989–90) – and the ex-chief prosecutor were acquitted on October 20 of killing 58 people who attempted to flee the country illegally between 1990 and 1992. Prosecutors dropped the charges following a supreme court ruling that 32 other senior ex-Communists could not be held liable for alleged offenses which had not been a crime at the time.
|-
| rowspan="10" valign="top" | 1998 || April || Following widespread allegations of government inefficiency and corruption in his administration, Nano reshuffles his cabinet, reducing the number of ministers.
|-
| May || More than 13,000 refugees flee into Albania after the eruption in February of civil war between the Serbian police and army and the ethnic Albanian separatist [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) in the neighbouring province of [[Kosovo]]. The Albanian Foreign Ministry repeatedly charges Yugoslavia with border violations that include shelling and sniping and with conducting massacres of Kosovo's civilian population. It also calls for [[NATO]] military intervention to stop the fighting.
|-
| June 21 || Local by-elections confirm continuing popular support for Nano's coalition, which wins in five municipalities and six smaller communities. The opposition wins in two municipalities and three communities. (to June 28)
|-
| August || Police arrest former defense minister [[Safet Zhulali]], former interior minister [[Halit Shamata]], former chairman of state control [[Blerim Cela]], and three other former officials of Berisha's government on charges of crimes against humanity in conjunction with their alleged roles in the suppression of unrest in 1997. General Prosecutor Arben Rakipi charges the six with having ordered the use of chemical weapons, airplanes, and helicopters against civilians. Subsequently, Berisha calls on his supporters to bring down the government "with all means," saying that the arrests were politically motivated.
|-
| September 12 || Azem Hajdari, a senior leader of the Democratic Party, is shot dead by a gunman as he steps out of the party's office in Tirana; on September 13 Democratic Party supporters storm and set fire to the prime minister's office in a protest against the killing. Government forces counterattack and reoccupy the buildings, and on September 15 Berisha surrenders two tanks posted outside his headquarters after the government threatened to use force if his followers did not give up their weapons.
|-
| September 18 || Albania's parliament lifts the immunity from prosecution of opposition leader Berisha, clearing the way for prosecutors to charge him with attempting a coup.
|-
| September 21 || [[Ahmet Krasniqi]], leading member of the self-styled ethnic Albanian government in Kosovo, is shot dead in Albania.
|-
| September 28 || Prime Minister Nano resigns after failing to get the backing of his coalition for a cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the outbreak of political violence two weeks ago. [[Pandeli Majko]] is named to succeed him.
|-
| October 2 || [[Pandeli Majko]], 30, becomes Europe's youngest head of government after being sworn in as Albanian prime minister. Petro Koçi becomes interior minister and Anastas Angjeli finance minister. On October 8 the new government wins a parliamentary confidence vote (104–0; the opposition Democratic Party is boycotting Parliament).
|-
| October 21 || Albania's parliament votes in favour of a draft constitution and agrees to put it to a referendum. This is held on November 22, and 93.5% of the voters support the new constitution. Turnout is 50.6%. President Meidani signs the constitution into law on November 28, Albania's independence day. The new constitution, which replaces a package of laws introduced after the collapse of communism, provides for the separation of powers, rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary. It also guarantees human rights and the protection of minorities. The opposition Democratic Party, which (ignoring calls by the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] and the [[Council of Europe]]) boycotted the referendum and the parliamentary commission which drafted the constitution, says the results were fixed and that it can not recognize the new constitution.
|-
| rowspan="7" valign="top" | 1999 || March || During the 78 days of [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], about 450,000 of a total 750,000 Kosovar refugees flee into Albania. That figure is equal to almost 15% of Albania's total population. The hostilities turn Albania into a key operational theatre for international relief agencies and NATO forces in Albania, called [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), which launch a humanitarian relief operation. In addition, within the framework of the NATO air campaign, U.S. forces deploy 24 Apache antitank helicopters and long-range artillery pieces in northern Albania. The northern Albanian border regions of [[Kukës]] and [[Tropojë]] bear the brunt of the refugee influx and military operations. Supplying the refugees and transporting them to other parts of the country creates immense logistic difficulties for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and other relief agencies. The region also sees ongoing border clashes between Yugoslav forces, who continually shell Albanian border villages, and [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) fighters operating in part from support bases inside Albania. The border area remains heavily mined after the fighting subsides. With the end of the fighting, Albania's relations improve with its neighbours – Montenegro, Macedonia, Greece, and the new UN administration in Kosovo, with whom the Albanian Foreign Ministry plans a series of joint regional development projects within the framework of the European Union-funded [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]]. Early accomplishments include the installation of a powerful microwave-telephone connection between Albania and Kosovo and the signing of infrastructure development projects with Montenegro. (to June)
|-
| rowspan="2" valign="top" | 20 May || NATO says it will supply long-term military aid to Albania and Macedonia and draw up plans to help the two Balkan countries meet the alliance's entry requirements.
|-
| [[Spartak Poçi]] is appointed interior minister, replacing [[Petro Koçi]]. Poçi subsequently manages to break up 12 criminal gangs throughout the country, most notably those in [[Tropojë]], where special police units restore order in September. Because of frequent armed robberies, Tropojë earlier had been a "no-go" area for international aid agencies. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe closed its office there on June 16 after gunmen killed two of its local staff.
|-
| July 17 || At an extraordinary party congress in Tirana, PDS leader Sali Berisha declares that the party ends its boycott of parliament as a gesture of gratitude to the U.S. for its engagement on behalf of the Kosovars. So far the PDS has been strongly under the control of Berisha, but late in the year the reformists in the PDS openly clash with Berisha's supporters over party strategy. The reformers argue that the parliamentary boycott was leading to political isolation of the party.
|-
| September 15 || Nano accuses Majko of having allowed Kosovar guerrillas to smuggle arms through Albanian territory.
|-
| October 25 || Prime Minister Majko resigns after losing the leadership of the ruling Socialist Party earlier in the month to Fatos Nano. On October 27 President Meidani asks [[Ilir Meta]] to form the next government. He is sworn in October 29.
|-
| November 11 || The most significant success in administrative reform comes with the passage of a new law on the civil service, designed to stop the practice of political appointments and to increase the independence and integrity of career civil servants. Implementation of the law and the creation of a workable institutional framework occupy much of the following year.
|-
| rowspan="9" valign="top" | 2000 || February || It is reported that the government has shifted its attention away from the construction of the east-west trunk road "Corridor 8," designed to link the South Balkans to the Adriatic, and is instead focusing on an internal north-south highway.
|-
| March || A "quick start" package is launched within the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]], the 28-nation agreement signed in 1999 to restore peace, stability, and prosperity to the region. Albania receives about €112 million (about $109 million) for the rehabilitation of roads, railroads, harbours, power and water lines, and the airport in Tirana. The Stability Pact earmarks an additional €320 million (about $311 million) for near-term infrastructure projects to be implemented subsequently. The Stability Pact also dominates Albania's foreign-policy agenda. Numerous projects designed to enhance cooperation between Albania and other southeastern European countries in the fields of human rights, democracy, and security are launched.
|-
| 14 May || Opposition leader [[Sali Berisha]] leads 4,000 protestors in the southern port of [[Vlorë]] in the first anti-government rally led by the controversial former president.
|-
| 24 May || President Meidani travels to [[Kosovo]], the first visit ever by an Albanian head of state to that heavily ethnic Albanian-populated province in Yugoslavia. Meidani emphasizes Albania's commitment to the creation of "a Europe of the regions" (that is, rather than a continent based on traditional nation-states) and speaks against the desirability of creating a "Greater Albania" that would include ethnic Albanians in neighbouring countries, while stressing the need for closer regional and European integration.
|-
| June 14 || Berisha is barred from entering the Albanian-dominated Yugoslav province of Kosovo by the UN peacekeeping force, which deems him a threat to public order.
|-
| July 7 || In a cabinet reshuffle, Ilir Gjoni replaces Luan Hajdaraga as defense minister.
|-
| September 18 || EU foreign ministers include Albania in a list of Balkan countries offered [[duty-free]] access for 95% of their exports. The list does not include neighbouring Serbia and comes as part of a package of measures designed to encourage voters there to embrace reform and oust their federal president, [[Slobodan Milošević]].
|-
| October || Following the election of [[Vojislav Koštunica]] as president of [[Yugoslavia]], Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo makes the resumption of regular bilateral relations dependent on Serbia freeing Kosovo Albanian prisoners and recognizing its responsibility for [[crimes against humanity]] in the [[Kosovo war]].
|-
| October 1 || The ruling [[Socialist Party of Albania]] emerges as the clear winner of municipal elections, taking 50 municipalities and 218 communities – including the mayoralty of Tirana for the first time since 1992 – although the Democratic Party throughout the year focused attention on rallying support for its candidates, accusing the governing Alliance for the State coalition of corruption and smuggling, charges that the coalition dismissed. The Democrats win only in 11 municipalities and 80 communities after calling for a partial boycott of the vote in the runoff. Two municipalities and 17 communities go to smaller parties and independent candidates. (to October 15)

| rowspan="10" valign="top" | 2001 || || Growth in gross domestic product is 7.3%, just slightly less than the 7.8% registered in 2000. Unemployment drops from 17.1% in 1999 to 13.3% in 2001, thanks to a government-supported [[job creation program]] that includes infrastructure-development projects within the framework of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.
|-
| || Although Albania has made strides toward democratic reform and maintaining the [[rule of law]], serious deficiencies in the electoral code remain to be addressed, as demonstrated in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2001|June 2001 parliamentary elections]]. International observers judged the 2001 elections to be acceptable, but the [[Union for Victory Coalition]], the second-largest vote recipient, disputed the results and boycotted parliament until January 31, 2002. The Socialists re-elected [[Ilir Meta]] as Prime Minister in August 2001, a post which he held till February 2002, when he resigned due to party infighting. [[Pandeli Majko]] was re-elected Prime Minister in February 2002.
|-
| March || The large [[ethnic Albanian]] minority in neighbouring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] stages an armed rebellion. Although Albania's prime minister [[Ilir Meta]] supports international peace negotiations (which lead to a truce and a peace settlement in late August), there is evidence to suggest that Albanian border guards have at first failed to seal the border completely to arms smugglers supplying the rebels in Macedonia.
|-
| April || The government is strongly criticized for its unsuccessful policy toward [[human trafficking]]. The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) joins [[Save the Children]] in highlighting the trade in eastern European women and even Albanian children, and accuses local Albanian police of colluding in the lucrative industry. IOM points out that there have been fewer prosecutions of smugglers than of victims of the trade.
|-
| April 18 || The government announces that legislative elections will take place on June 24.
|-
| June 24 || In the first round of the parliamentary elections (turnout 54.9%), the ruling Socialist Party, with a reform-oriented program, wins 31 seats; the opposition Union for Victory coalition, formed by the Democratic Party, receives 16 seats. In the second round on July 8, the Socialist Party wins another 44 and the Union for Victory 30. The opposition had been split since 2000, when the New Democrat Party was formed, whose leader, [[Genc Pollo]], charged Berisha with failing to offer convincing answers to the country's essential problems. Pollo's leadership appealed to many voters who were looking for a group among the opposition that could demonstrate some political competence. The new party wins six seats in the new parliament.
|-
| July 30 || The opposition Democratic Party (PDS) announces that it will not accept the results of the "farcical" legislative election and that it will consequently stay away from the People's Assembly. According to final results announced on August 21 the ruling Socialist Party won a clear majority of 73 seats in the 140-seat Assembly, while the Union for Victory won only 46. Observers from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] disagree with the PDS and describe the poll as free and fair.
|-
| September 3 || The Democratic Party boycotts the opening session of the People's Assembly in defiance of the government's recent electoral victory.
|-
| September 12 || Parliament gives Prime Minister Ilir Meta's new government a vote of confidence. Within the governing coalition the Socialist Party controls all key ministries. Arta Dade becomes foreign minister (the first woman in Albanian history to hold that post), Ilir Gjoni interior minister, and Pandeli Majko defense minister; Anastas Angjeli remains finance minister. The chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Skënder Gjinushi, takes charge of labour and social affairs, while another Social Democrat, former foreign minister Paskal Milo, becomes minister of Euro-Atlantic integration. Former justice minister [[Arben Imami]] becomes minister of local government and decentralization, pledging to focus on strengthening the role of cities and towns; Niko Kacalidha (of the Union Party, which represents many [[ethnic Greek]]s) is appointed to the new post of state minister for minorities and the diaspora. For his part, Prime Minister Meta pledges to upgrade power supplies, proceed with privatization, fight corruption and organized crime, improve ties with Western Europe and neighbours in the Balkan region, and promote [[free trade]].
|-
| December || Five cabinet members resign after a concerted campaign by Fatos Nano, the leader of the ruling Socialist Party, to bring about a reshuffle. Nano has accused the government of high-level [[embezzlement|corruption]].
|-
| rowspan="5" valign="top" | 2002 || || Albania is working to conclude [[free-trade agreement]]s with Macedonia, Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Croatia. The economy suffers a slight setback. Unemployment creeps up during the year. A United Nations Development Project report estimates that one-third of the population lives in poverty, earning less than $1 per capita per day. Large segments of the population live from [[subsistence agriculture]] and do not receive unemployment benefits.
|-
| January 29 || [[Prime Minister of Albania]] [[Ilir Meta]]  resigns in anger over a continuing row with the leader of his Socialist Party, [[Fatos Nano]], who has been resisting the appointment of ministers to vacant cabinet positions. Earlier that day the opposition Democratic Party ended its four-month boycott of the People's Assembly.
|-
| February 7 || Defense Minister [[Pandeli Majko]] receives the backing of the various warring factions within the ruling Socialist Party to be the country's next prime minister. Nominated by outgoing premier Meta, Majko agrees to accommodate supporters of party leader Nano in a new cabinet. The previous deadlock led the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] to freeze aid payments until the situation was resolved. On February 16 President Meidani accepts Majko's proposed cabinet, including [[Kastriot Islami]] as finance minister, [[Luan Rama]] as defense minister, and [[Stefan Çipa]] as interior minister; [[Arta Dade]] is to remain as foreign minister. The cabinet is approved by Parliament on February 22.
|-
| June 24 || Parliament elects [[Alfred Moisiu]] as president (97–19). He is sworn in July 24. On July 25 Prime Minister Majko resigns. On July 31 Parliament approves (81–48) a new government with Socialist Party Chairman Fatos Nano as prime minister, Majko as defense minister, Ilir Meta as foreign minister, and Luan Rama as interior minister; Kastriot Islami remains finance minister. Nano's appointment marks the end of a power struggle between the party leader and his two younger challengers Meta and Majko, both of whom had served as prime minister since Nano resigned the post during a period of civil unrest in 1998. Media analysis suggests that Nano elbowed Meta and Majko aside in a grab for power after realizing that he was too controversial a figure to aspire to the presidency. The European Parliament had urged Albanian legislators to elect a president who would be acceptable to both the governing coalition and the opposition. Moreover, Meta and the outgoing president, Meidani, both openly opposed Nano's candidacy for the presidency. The election of Moisiu essentially sealed the Socialist legislators' compromise with the opposition led by the Democratic Party. Nano and Berisha say that the deal signals that the two rival party leaders have put years of fighting behind them. Moisiu, a 73-year-old retired general, served as president of the Albanian North Atlantic Treaty Association and is considered friendly by the opposition.
|-
| August 29 || The [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]'s chief of mission, [[Geert-Hinrich Ahrens]], praises Albania in his end-of-mission address to the OSCE Permanent Council, reporting that the country is "in the forefront of reform in the region" and adding that recent achievements have "brought Albania to the threshold of opening negotiations for a Stabilization and [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] with the European Union." Finnish diplomat [[Osmo Lipponen]] succeeds Ahrens on September 1.

|-
| July 18 || Angered by Nano's comments during a cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Meta resigns in protest at Nano's "nihilistic, tendentious, and denigrating" criticism. On July 22 Marko Bello is nominated to be foreign minister, but he is rejected by parliament on July 28. On July 29 Luan Hajdaraga is named acting foreign minister.
|-
| October 12 || The Socialist Party wins a narrow victory over the Democratic Party in local elections. Turnout is around 50%.
|-
| October 17 || Interior Minister Luan Rama is sacked. He has been accused of punching the editor-in-chief of Vizion Plus television, Ilir Babaramo, in a Tirana restaurant on October 14 because of criticism broadcast by the TV station two months ago. On October 23 Prime Minister Nano's nominees for foreign minister, [[Namik Dokle]], and for interior minister, [[Fatmir Xhafa]], are rejected by parliament. On October 25 Nano picks [[Igli Toska]] to be acting interior minister.
|-
| October 19 || In Tiran, more than 2,000 people hold a "people's marathon" to celebrate the beatification of [[Mother Teresa]], who was born to Albanian parents in what is now the [[Republic of Macedonia]].
|-
| December 29 || Parliament finally approves new ministers for the vacant posts. [[Kastriot Islami]] becomes foreign minister, [[Arben Malaj]] succeeds him as finance minister, and [[Igli Toska]] becomes interior minister.
|-

|-

The [[Albanian lek]] has strengthened from 143 lekë to the US dollar in 2000 to 92 lekë in 2007, mainly due to the depreciation of the [[United States dollar#Historical exchange rates|US dollar]], but also thanks to the overall improvement of the Albanian economy.
|-
| June 10 || US President [[George W. Bush]] visited Albania, the first sitting US President to do so. While Mr Bush was glad-handing cheering crowds, it appears as if his wristwatch is stolen.

Prior to the election, the electoral law was changed to a regional proportionally system.Berisha's alliance won enough seats to form a government, though it fell one seat short of a majority during the elections of Jun 28, 2009, having to join forces with a splinter socialist party, the [[Socialist Movement for Integration]] of [[Ilir Meta]], whom Berisha appointed to the post of Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs, and later Minister of Economy, Trade and Energy. It is the first time since the start of multi-party democracy in 1991 that a ruling party has been forced into a coalition through not winning enough seats on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8171633.stm | work=BBC News | title=Albania PM re-election confirmed | date=July 27, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| November || Protests begin in Tirana, led by opposition Socialist Party leader [[Edi Rama]], against allegedly rigged vote counting in the 2009 elections. [[Berisha]] has refused any recount of the votes, on the ground that the [[Albanian Constitution]] do not foresee such procedure.

This is a timeline of first achievements in [[spaceflight]] from the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] through the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|first multinational human-crewed mission]]—spanning the era of the [[Space Race]]. Two days after the [[United States]] announced its intention to launch an [[artificial satellite]], on July 31, 1956, the Soviet Union announced its intention to do the same. [[Sputnik 1]] was launched on October 4, 1957, beating the United States and stunning people all over the world.

'''Vincenz Hasak''' (b. [[Nové Město pod Smrkem|Neustadt]], near Friedland, [[Bohemia]], 18 July 1812; d. 1 September 1889, as dean of Weisskirchlitz, near [[Teplice]]) was a Catholic historian. After completing his classical and theological studies in [[Litoměřice]], he became chaplain in [[Arnsdorf]], a post he held for eighteen years. Thenceforth to his death he was pastor in Weisskirchlitz. While chaplain, he began to collect old books, paintings, and copper-plate engravings, also gems and shells. He succeeded in collecting a small but highly esteemed museum. His library became particularly famous because of the copious collection of rare early printed books, e.g. the ten pre-Reformation German translations of the Bible.

He also made a scientific use of his treasures, and wrote several books about them, notable contributions in his day to the knowledge of medieval German religious life and the German language. Especially worthy of mention are: 
*''Der christliche Glaube des deutschen Volkes beim Schluss des Mittelalters'' (Christian Belief of Germans at the end of the Middle Ages) ([[Ratisbon]], 1868), a very consisting of ninety-three printed books and manuscripts; 
*''Dr. M. Luther und die religiöse Literatur seiner Zeit bis zum Jahre 1520)'' (Ratisbon, 1881), a documentary description of the religious and moral conditions of the Middle Ages;
*''Die Himmelstrasse'' (Ratisbon, 1882); 
*''Die letzte Rose, oder Eklärung des Vater Unser nach Markus von Weida'' (Ratisbon, 1883) 
*''Ein Vergissmeinnicht oder Von der heiligen Messe'' (Ratisbon, 1884); 
*''Herbstblumen, oder christlicher Volksunterricht in der vorreformatorischen Zeit'' (Ratisbon, 1885).

The '''War of the Bands''' ({{lang-eu|Bando gerrak}}, {{lang-es|Guerra de los Bandos}}) was a [[civil war]], really an extended series of [[blood feud]]s, in the western [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascony]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The main [[primary source]] for the War is ''Las Bienandanças e fortunas'' by [[Lope García de Salazar]], written ''c''.1471. The war is named after the aristocratic networks of familial alliances and their armed followings, known as ''bandos'' (bands), that carried out constant wars for power and honour across three kingdoms. The wars ceased only with the imposition of royal authority under [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. 

The wars resulted partly from the destabilising effect of the [[Castilian Civil War]] and the ensuing political weakness of the [[House of Trastámara]]. That the [[Seniory of Biscay]] effectively ceased to exist after 1370 and was subsumed in 1379 into Castile only exacerbated the effects of political anarchy on Biscay. The rise of the towns, notably [[Bilbao]] and [[Bermeo]], caused jockeying for municipal power between the rich urban families. The landed nobility, [[enfeoffed]] in the heavily [[encastellated]] countryside, nursed feuds that dated back centuries. The [[Legizamon]] and [[Zamudiano]] had been enemies since 1270. Many minor noble families were caught in the feuds of the great families by ties of marriage. 

In 1362, in the early stage of the conflicts, the Legizamon and Zurbarán families fought a battle in the streets of Bilbao. They battled again in the market of Bermeo in 1413. Thereafter until 1433 the fighting between the two bands continued without a truce. The Basurto, who had been enemies of the Legizamon over the rights to a salmon, fought on the side of the Zurbarán. The urban warfare was less fatal than the pitched battles often fought in the countryside: only five men died in a fracas in Bilbao in 1440 and only ten in the streets of Bermeo in 1443. 

In 1413 a private war broke out between [[Juan de Sant Pedro]], from the [[Labourd]] in the [[Kingdom of England|English]] Duchy of Gascony, and the Navarrese houses of the Espeleta and the Alzate. After the head of the Alzate and his son were killed, [[Fernando de Gamboa|Lord Fernando]] of the Gamboa family of [[Gipuzkoa]] married his son to the daughter and heiress of the Alzate. In consequence he led an attack on Juan de Sant Pedro to avenge his daughter-in-law's family. He was defeated and killed and 150 men died in the battle. 

Around 1420 the Gamboinos extended their feuding with an assault by night on the Oñaz family, also of Guipúzcoa. On Christmas, the Oñaz' manor was set alight and the head of the house plus nine others died in the blaze. The Oñaz family lands were then ravaged by the Gamboinos and their allies, but the allies of the Oñaz came to their defence. Of the latter, the Lezcano attacked the Gamboino-allied Balda family and killed its leader. With the end of this little war a whole new network of blood feuds had come into being. 

The Gamboinos and the Balda fought against the Oñaz and the Lezcano at [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]] in 1446. The Oñaz were victorious and burnt the Gamboino fortress at [[Azkoitia]]. Seventy men and twelve of the leaders were killed. The families, with every wider networks of allies, engaged again in 1447 and 1448. 

As early as 1390 and 1393 warring in Biscay had been reduced by the intervention of the royalist ''[[hermandad]]es'', capable of drawing on the revenues of royal estates. In 1415 the ''corregidor'', the royally-appointed governor of the ''hermandad'', acting on royal orders, siphoned off Biscayan wheat to the [[Asturias]], inciting a rebellion. The Biscayans were defeated at [[Erandio]] with the loss of sixty men and the wheat transfers continued. In 1442 the ''hermandades'' interfered successfully in Bilbao and [[Mondragón]], but the peace established did not endure. In 1457 the war between the Gamboinos and the Oñaz was brought to an abrupt end when the ''hermandades'' rebelled against them both, seized their manors, and expelled their leaders from Guipúzcoa.

'''William Cubbon''' [[M.A.]]  (28 May 1865 – 1 January 1955) was a Manx nationalist, [[antiquarian]], author, businessman and librarian who was the first secretary of the [[Manx Museum]], later becoming Director of the Museum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner Yearbook 1914.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Isle of Man Times.''

==Biography==
===Early life===
William Cubbon was born in the small [[Hamlet (place)#United Kingdom|hamlet]] of [[The Level railway station|Croit-e-Caley]] in the parish of [[Rushen]], [[Isle of Man]], on 28 May 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imuseum.im/Olive/APA/IsleofMan/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=MNH%2F1952%2F05%2F27&amp;id=Ar00101&amp;sk=A06B24C9&amp;viewMode=image ''Mona's Herald.'' Wednesday, May 27, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, James Cubbon, was a [[Master Mariner]] who hailed from [[Port St Mary]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

===Business===
After leaving school, Cubbon took employment with the ''Isle of Man Examiner'' as a [[Typesetting|compositor]] and in 1900, together with Horace Lightfoot, Cubbon acquired the ''Manx Sun'' newspaper. Under the ownership of Cubbon and Lightfoot, the editorial standpoint of the ''Manx Sun'' became [[nationalist]] in orientation, and in addition to his newspaper proprietorship Cubbon also became heavily involved in the promotion of Manx history and culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

The ''Manx Sun'' and its business were taken over by the ''Isle of Man Examiner'' in 1906, with Cubbon rejoining the title in the capacity of manager of the stationery business.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

Leaving the ''Examiner'' in 1912, Cubbon became Borough Librarian of [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]; in this period he published
''A Manx Book of Poetry (1913)'', which was particularly aimed at young people with a view to getting them involved in the culture of the Isle of Man. He also published a set of maps illustrating the ancient treens (divisions of parishes) and land divisions in the island's six [[Local government in the Isle of Man#Sheadings|sheadings]], along with the names of the principal early land owners. During the [[First World War]] Cubbon became manager of the [[Labour Exchange]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

===Manx Museum===
In 1922 the [[Manx Museum]] was established on the former site of Noble's Hospital in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. [[P.M.C. Kermode|Philip Kermode]] was appointed the museum's director, with Cubbon appointed as secretary.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt; Following Kermode's death in 1932 Cubbon succeeded him as director, a post he held until his retirement in 1940, when he was replaced by [[Basil Megaw]] [[FRSE]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt; One of the  first undertakings by Cubbon in his role as secretary was the compilation of the indexes and several other appendixes to the Rev. Theophilus Talbot's English translation of the ''Manorial Roll'', referred to as the ''Manx Doomsday Book'', which was published in 1924.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;
[[File:William Cubbon.jpg|thumb|125px|left|A bust of William Cubbon]]

Said to have been passionately patriotic with regard to the [[Isle of Man]], his appointment as Director of the Manx Museum was said to have been Cubbon's great ambition. In 1899 he had helped in the formation of the [[Manx language|Manx Language Society]] ''(Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh)'', and served the society as secretary and president. This in turn led to him becoming an energetic figure in the Natural History and [[Antiquarian]] Society, again serving in the role of president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

During his time at the Manx Museum, Cubbon compiled the ''Bibliography of the Literature of the Isle of Man'', published in two editions in 1933 and 1939; he also conducted numerous explorations for the Antiquarian Society and gave lecture on various subjects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

At the age of 85 Cubbon began work on his ''Island Heritage'', which was published in 1952.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

===Honours and awards===
In recognition of his achievements William Cubbon received the degree of [[Master of Arts]] from [[Liverpool University]]. The [[Government of Norway]] conferred on him the [[Knighthood]] of the [[Order of St Olav]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

===Death===
William Cubbon passed away at the home of his son, at [[Brentwood, Essex]] on [[New Year's Day]], 1955.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manxliterature"/&gt;

The [[Westphalian_sovereignty#Modern_views_on_the_Westphalian_system|Westphalian System]] is the preeminent world-system operating in the contemporary world, denoting the system of [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state_(polity)|states]] and [[nation-states]] produced by the [[Peace_of_Westphalia|Westphalian Treaties]] in 1648. Several world-systems can coexist, provided that they have little or no interaction with one another. Where such interactions becomes significant, separate world-systems merge into a new, larger world-system. Through the process of [[globalization]], the modern world has reached the state of one dominant world-system, but in human history there have been periods where separate world-systems existed simultaneously, according to [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]. The most well-known version of the world-system approach has been developed by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]. A world-system is a crucial element of the [[world-system theory]], a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to [[world history]] and [[social change]].

==Characteristics==
World-systems are defined by the existence of a division of labor.  The modern world-system has a multi-state political structure (the interstate system) and therefore its division of labor is international [[division of labor]].  In the modern world-system, the division of labor consists of three zones according to the prevalence of profitable industries or activities: core, semiperiphery, and periphery.  Countries tend to fall into one or another of these interdependent zones [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]] and the [[periphery countries]].&lt;ref name=CAMV&gt;Carlos A. Martínez-Vela, [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/WorldSystem.pdf World Systems Theory], paper prepared for the [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/NewNotebook.htm Research Seminar in Engineering Systems], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TB&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The dictionary of anthropology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=%22world-system+is%22+hyphen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y8FRTOu5E8iIsAaak42PAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world-system is" hyphen&amp;f=false Google Print, p.498-499]&lt;/ref&gt; Resources are redistributed from the underdeveloped, typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world (the periphery) to developed, industrialized core.

World-systems, past world-systems and the modern world-system, have temporal features. ''Cyclical rhythms'' represent the short-term [[Statistical fluctuations|fluctuation]] of [[economy]], while ''secular trends'' mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general [[economic growth]] or decline.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The term ''contradiction'' means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term vs. long term trade-offs. For example, the problem of [[underconsumption]], wherein the drive-down of wages increases the profit for the capitalists on the short-run, but considering the long run, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the ''crisis'': a crisis occurs, if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system.

The world-systems theory stresses that world-systems (and not [[nation state]]s) should be the basic unit of [[social analysis]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=IW&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein, (2004), [http://www.uop.edu.jo/download/PdfCourses/SA/E6-94-01.pdf WORLD-SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, in World System History , [Ed. George Modelski], in [[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]] (EOLSS), Developed under the Auspices of the UNESCO, Eolss Publishers, Oxford ,UK&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we should focus not on individual states, but on the relations between their groupings (core, semi-periphery, and periphery).

== Immanuel Wallerstein ==
The most well-known version of the world-system approach has been developed by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], who has provided several definitions of what a world-system is, twice in 1974, first

{{cquote|"...a system is defined as a unit with a single division of labor and multiple cultural systems."&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein. 1974. "The Rise and Future Demise of the World-Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 16: p. 390. Cited after [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and second as 

{{cquote|"…a social system, one that has boundaries, structures, member groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) ''the Modern World-System'', New York, Academic Press, pp. 347-57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1987 he elaborated his definition:

{{cquote|"...not the system of the world, but a system that is a world and which can be, most often has been, located in an area less than the entire globe. World-systems analysis argues that the units of social reality within which we operate, whose rules constrain us, are for the most part such world-systems [...]. ...there have been thus far only two varieties of world-systems: world-economies and world empires. A world-empire (examples, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Han China]]) are large bureaucratic structures with a single political center and an axial division of labor, but multiple cultures. A world-economy is a large axial division of labor with multiple political centers and multiple cultures."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

Thus, we can differentiate world-systems into politically unified (world-empires) and not unified (world-economies).&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Small, non-state units such as [[tribe]]s are micro-systems.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

==World System vs. world-system(s)==
World system refers to the entire world, whereas world-system is its fragment - the largest [[unit of analysis]] that makes sense.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Wallerstein stresses the importance of [[hyphen]] in the title:

{{cquote|"... In English, the hyphen is essential to indicate these concepts. "World system" without a hyphen suggests that there has been only one world-system in the history of the world."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

There is an ongoing debate among scholars whether we can talk about multiple world-systems. For those who support the multiple world-systems approach,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Chase-Dunn Ch. K. and Hall Th. D. (1997), ‘Rise and Demise. Comparing World - Systems’ Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there have been many world-systems throughout worlds history, some replacing others, as was the case when a multipolar world-system of the 13th-14th centuries was replaced by a series of consecutive [[Europe]]- and [[Western world|the West]]-centered world-systems.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet (1989), "Before European Hegemony: The World System AD. 1250-1350"&lt;/ref&gt; Others coexisted unknowingly with others, not linked to them directly or indirectly; in those cases the world-systems weren't worldwide (for example, prior to [[colonization of Americas]], the Americas world-systems had no connection with the one encompassing [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;André Gunder Frank, Barry K. Gills, The world system: five hundred years or five thousand?, Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-15089-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVAWQ1D8UJUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22world-system+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ALVRTLv1J5SssAa_15zoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world-system%20is%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; From around 19th century onward, due to the process of [[globalization]], many scholars agree that there has been only one world-system, that of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="RobertsHite2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.
