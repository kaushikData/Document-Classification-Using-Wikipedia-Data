The '''2009 Arab League summit''' was held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] on March 30, 2009. The Arab League defied the [[International Criminal Court]] by giving a "warm welcome" to [[Sudanese President]] [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], whom the Court placed a warrant on for war crimes in the [[Darfur genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/29/AR2009032902507.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Brian | last=Murphy | title=Sudan's Leader Arrives in Qatar | date=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] boycotted the summit amid differences with Qatar stemming from the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is behind Egyptian President Mubarak's absence from Arab Summit?|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/29/content_11096352.htm|author=Hu Dandan and Liao Zhenyun|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia were also hesitant to come to the summit if Iran or Hamas were in attendance (neither of the parties came while the Saudis did).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Incidents==
After [[Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] speech, [[Libyan]] leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] called [[King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] a liar, accusing him of "bringing the Americans to occupy Iraq" and of being "made by Britain and protected by the US.", while stating: "I am an international leader, the dean of the Arab rulers, the king of kings of Africa and the imam (leader) of Muslims, and my international status does not allow me to descend to a lower level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muammar Gaddafi accuses Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah of lying at Arab summit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/5079290/Muammar-Gaddafi-accuses-Saudi-Arabias-King-Abdullah-of-lying-at-Arab-summit.html|author=Adel Darwish|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's Gadhafi storms out of Arab summit|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/libya-s-gadhafi-storms-out-of-arab-summit-344|publisher=[[NDTV]] ([[Associated Press]])|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then invited the King to visit him to solve the issues between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Libya's Kadhafi hurls apologies to Saudi king'' |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090330-libyas-kadhafi-hurls-insults-saudi-king |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hlQa00n2?url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090330-libyas-kadhafi-hurls-insults-saudi-king |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.&lt;ref name="Wolters"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wolters-Kluwer-Bouvier-Law-Dictionary/dp/1454806117|title=The Wolters Kluwer Bouvier Law Dictionary: Desk Edition|last=Sheppard|first=Stephen Michael|date=2012-05-21|publisher=Aspen Publishers|isbn=9781454806110|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstract of title==
{{Main|Abstract of title}}
The Abstract of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage law|mortgages]], and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.&lt;ref name="Wolters"/&gt;

==Clear title==
{{Unreferenced section|type=Law|date=November 2007}}
A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks{{Clarify|reason= does this mean "it shews an unbroken chain"?|date=February 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

==Patent law==
In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in United States patent law) of an invention. Under [[United States patent law]], the abstract may be called "Abstract of the Disclosure".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0600_608_01_b.htm 608.01(b) Abstract of the Disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; 37 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/1.72  1.72 - Title and abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative process==
Certain government bureaucracies, such as a ''department of motor vehicles'' will issue an '''abstract''' of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.

==History==
In the community of Brenham, Texas, the [[American Jewish Congress]] and the [[Texas Civil Rights Project]] filed a lawsuit against a social services program who they believe used a tax funded jobs program to support religious practices which violated the separation of church and state.

==NGO reports==
The [[Rockefeller Institute of Government]] reported that the lawsuit is a response to the 1996 gathering of a number of churches and businesses in Brenham, Texas, that formed the "Jobs Partnership of Washington County," a program which has come under legal scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Tuttle, Robert" /&gt; 

The Texas Freedom Network, a nonpartisan organization, reports that, "The religious message seemed to have a coercive impact on clients. About one-third of the participants said in the program evaluation that they felt pressure to join the host church, Grace Fellowship Baptist Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfn.org/religiousfreedom/faithbased/jobspartnership/ |title=Jobs Partnership of Washington County: Spending Taxpayer Funds on Overtly Religious Activities |work=Texas Faith-Based Initiative at Five Years: TFNEF Report (2002) |author= |accessdate=2007-11-01 |year=2002 |publisher=Texas Freedom Network |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010024943/http://www.tfn.org/religiousfreedom/faithbased/jobspartnership/ |archivedate=2007-10-10 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final ruling==
The lawsuit went back and forth between state and federal courts and was twice appealed. In January 2003, the lawsuit that is believed to the first constitutional challenge to a “charitable choice” contract, came to a conclusion. The case was finally dismissed, "on the ground that there was no live controversy." &lt;ref name="Let Freedom Ring" /&gt;

The '''Amicable Grant''' was a tax imposed on England in 1525 by the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Called at the time "a benevolence", it was essentially a forced loan, a levy of between one sixth and one tenth on the goods of the laity and on one-third of the goods of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, "Tudor Rebellions" (5th Edition,2004) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The Amicable Grant should have been levied with Parliamentary authority, but was not, and so the legal framework for its collection was extremely weak. This was partly because it was brought to Parliament by [[Thomas Wolsey]], who was becoming increasingly unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wolsey_thomas.shtml|title=Thomas Wolsey (c.1475–1530)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Widespread passive resistance, with a growing threat of armed resistance,  meant little money was raised and the project was dropped. King Henry VIII now lacked funds for his war in France and made peace.

==Causes==
In 1525 [[Henry VIII of England]] wanted to mount an invasion of France (the ''Great Enterprise'') since the King of France, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], had been captured by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. Henry required additional funds of £800,000, so to gain said money Wolsey resorted to the Amicable Grant.  The [[English Parliament]] was at this time unlikely to support war, since it was proving to be expensive. Furthermore, Henry's previous French endeavours, which had occurred in 1522 and 1523, had proved less than successful.

==Effects==
{{anchor|Rebellion}}&lt;!--used by the redirect: [[Resistance to the Amicable Grant]]--&gt;
===Short term===
Trouble was inevitable and indeed, even anticipated, for the Commons were financially exhausted; the forced 'loans' of 1522–1523 had not been repaid and the subsidy of 1523 was still being collected. [[Archbishop Warham]] reported on 12 April that he found the Kentish clergy 'not inclined to the grant' and that the heads of the religious houses had answered 'that they cannot contribute as required'. At Ely they said they would gladly sell their cattle and goods 'but no man in the country has money to buy or lend'.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, "Tudor Rebellions" (5thedn.,2004) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Discontent reached dangerous levels across England. In [[Essex]], Kent, [[Norfolk]], Warwickshire, and [[Huntingdonshire]], the grant provoked reactions ranging from reluctance to outright refusal. It provoked an open rebellion in [[Suffolk]] and a taxpayer strike, which spread to the borders of Essex and [[Cambridgeshire]]. In the most serious rebellion in England since 1497, 10,000 men converged on the major trading town of [[Lavenham]]. An eyewitness reported that the militants only failed because loyal townsmen led by [[John Spring of Lavenham|Sir John Spring]] had removed the clappers from the bells of Lavenham church, which were to have been rung to signal the start of the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, J. "Tudor England" (1990) p.103&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rebellion was eventually crushed by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, but the rebels had made their point. Wolsey was forced to abandon the Grant and reduce the payments for the 1523 [[subsidy]]. Discontent in London prompted Henry to halve demands to save some of the tax, before abandoning it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fellows|first=Nicholas|title=Disorder and Rebellion in Tudor England|publisher=Hodder Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of May, the rising's ringleaders were brought before the Star Chamber and pardoned. Wolsey led an ostentatious ceremony of reconciliation, begging the king for pardon for his fellow Suffolk men, even supplying them with more than enough cash to cover their time in gold and a piece of silver.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, "Tudor Rebellions" (5th Edition,2004) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term===
Wolsey's climbdown was humiliating, and may have contributed to his fall in 1529 since this was the first occasion in which Wolsey had seriously failed to enact Henry's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Derrick|title=Tudor England: 1485–1603|publisher=Collins Educational|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opinion made a significant impact on foreign policy too, reducing considerably the fiscal potential of the Henrician government and forcing Henry to abandon his European schemes; peace with France was the only course, ending significant military endeavours for England until the Scottish campaign of 1542.

'''Assigned risk''' means a driver of a [[motor vehicle]], or a class of such drivers, who would be denied [[insurance]] coverage by [[insurance companies]], but are required to be covered under U.S. state law.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/assigned+risk Free Dictionary], citing the American Heritage Society dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''assigned risk'' is also used in [[Workers' compensation]] law.

==Motor vehicle insurance==
The [[state government]], usually the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], assigns the risky [[motorist]]s to [[automobile insurance]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, at 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

High risk drivers are often undesirable to insurance companies, and may not be able to purchase insurance through conventional means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insurance.cch.com/RUPPS/assigned-risk.htm See the Rupp's definition on the CCH website]&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered high-risk because of numerous [[speeding]] or other [[traffic ticket]]s, or a recent history of [[motor vehicle accident]]s, or in states that have a [[point system (driving)|point system]], accumulation of so many points. The state DMV point system may be different from the insurance companies' point system.&lt;ref&gt;Under N.Y.

==Workers' compensation==

Assigned Risk systems are also used for [[workers' compensation]], whereby businesses who have had unsatisfactory loss performance or whose employees perform such hazardous functions that voluntary insurance companies will not insure them, can be assigned to an insurer. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A common problem with assigned risk is that some states' assigned risk plans only provide coverage for that state, causing businesses whose employees travel to other states to have various issues, including but not limited to the possibility of an uncovered claim from an employee claiming another state's benefits.  If unable to secure a voluntary policy providing multiple state coverage, it is always possible to purchase a separate state's Worker's Compensation fund or NCCI assigned risk to fill the coverage gap, but this can be unfairly cost inefficient as some payroll is inevitably rated for in more than one policy - causing the premium to be much higher than if a voluntary coverage had been obtained. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

This is especially an issue for Truckers or Contractors whose rates are already high and for whom it can be very difficult to obtain voluntary coverage due to the nature of their work. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

{{About||financial sector "taxes on transactions" (instead of "taxes on institutions")|financial transaction tax}}

A '''bank tax''', or a '''bank levy''', is a [[tax]] on [[bank]]s which was discussed in the context of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. On 16 April 2010, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) put forward three possible options to deal with the crisis., which were presented in response to an earlier request of the [[G20]] leaders, at the September [[2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit]], for an investigative report on options to deal with the crisis.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;Richard T. Page, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1724530 "Foolish Revenge or Shrewd Regulation? Financial-Industry Tax Law Reforms Proposed in the Wake of the Financial Crisis?"] 85 [[Tul. L. Rev.]] 191 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF opted in favour of the "financial stability contribution" (FSC) option, which many media have referred to as a "bank tax." 

Both before and after that IMF report, there was considerable debate among national leaders as to whether such a "bank tax" should be global or semi-global, or whether it should be applied only in certain nations.

==History==
In the context of the financial crisis of 2007–08, in August 2009, British [[Financial Services Authority]] chairman Lord [[Adair Turner]] said in [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect magazine]] that he would be happy to consider a "tax on banks" to prevent excessive bonus payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8229500.stm |title=Turner defends bank tax comments |author=[[BBC]] |date= August 30, 2009|work= |publisher= [[BBC]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===G20 request to IMF===
At the [[2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit]], in September, the G20 national leaders asked the IMF "to prepare a report for our next meeting with regard to the range of options countries have adopted or are considering as to how the financial sector could make a fair and substantial contribution toward paying for any burdens associated with government interventions to repair the banking system."&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kairoscanada.org/en/ecojustice/news-list/news/archive/2010/04/browse/1/article/an-idea-whose-time-has-come-adopt-a-financial-transactions-tax/?tx_ttnews |title=An Idea Whose Time Has Come: Adopt a Financial Transactions Tax |author=John Dillon |date=May 2010 |work=KAIROS Policy Briefing Paper No. 24 revised and updated |publisher=[[KAIROS]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123144102/http://www.kairoscanada.org/en/ecojustice/news-list/news/archive/2010/04/browse/1/article/an-idea-whose-time-has-come-adopt-a-financial-transactions-tax/?tx_ttnews |archivedate=January 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial stability contribution (FSC) ====
Financial stability contribution (FSC) – a tax on a financial institution’s balance sheet (most probably on its liabilities or possibly on assets) whose proceeds would most likely be used to create an insurance fund to bail out the industry in any future crisis rather than making taxpayers pay for bailouts.

Much of the IMF’s report is devoted to the first option of a levy on all major financial institutions balance sheets. Initially it could be imposed at a flat rate and later it could be refined so that the institutions with the most risky portfolios would pay more than those who took on fewer risks. 

The levy could be modeled on US President Obama’s proposed [[Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee]] to raise US$90 billion over 10 years from US banks with assets of more than US$50 billion. If Obama’s proposal had passed, the proceeds would have gone into general government revenues. They would have been used to pay the costs of the 2008 crisis rather than gone into an insurance fund in anticipation of the next one.&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8633455.stm|title=IMF proposes two big new bank taxes to fund bail-outs  |author=[[BBC]] |date= April 21, 2010|work= |publisher= BBC|accessdate=22 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100422203502/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8633455.stm |archivedate= 22 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial activities tax (FAT) ====
A financial activities tax (FAT) – a tax on the sum of bank profits and bankers’ remuneration packages with the proceeds going into general government revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.breakingviews.com/2010/04/21/fat%20tax.aspx?sg=nytimes|title= Low-FAT diet|author=[[Peter Thal Larsen]] |date=23 April 2010 |work= |publisher= Reuters Breaking News|accessdate=23 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424082421/http://www.breakingviews.com/2010/04/21/fat%20tax.aspx?sg=nytimes| archivedate= 24 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial transaction tax (FTT) ====
{{Main|Financial transaction tax}}

A financial transactions tax (FTT) – a tax on a broad range of financial instruments including stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives.

In November 2009, two months after the G20 Pittsburgh summit, G20 national Finance Ministers met in Scotland to address the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], but were unwilling to endorse the German proposal for a financial transactions tax:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"European Union leaders urged the International Monetary Fund on Friday to consider a global tax on financial transactions in spite of opposition from the US and doubts at the IMF itself. In a communiqué issued after a two-day summit, the EU’s 27 national leaders stopped short of making a formal appeal for the introduction of a so-called "[[Tobin tax]]" but made clear they regarded it as a potentially useful revenue-raising instrument."&lt;ref name = "EUcall"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa162054-e65e-11de-bcbe-00144feab49a.html|title= EU leaders urge IMF to consider global Tobin tax |publisher= [[The Financial Times]] |author= Tony Barber |date = 2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the IMF does not endorse an FTT, it concedes that "The FTT should not be dismissed on grounds of administrative practicality."&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interim"/&gt;

====Difference between a bank tax and a financial transactions tax====
A "bank tax" ("bank levy") differs from a financial transaction tax in the following way:

A financial transaction tax is a [[tax]] on a specific type (or types) of [[financial transaction]] for a specific purpose (or purposes). This term has been most commonly associated with the [[financial sector]], as opposed to [[consumption tax]]es paid by [[consumer]]s. However, it is not a tax on the [[financial institution]] itself.  Instead, it is charged only on the specific transactions that are designated as taxable. If an institution never carries out the taxable transaction, then it will never be taxed on that transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This illustration is attributed to the public lecture of economist Rodney Schmidt, Principal Researcher, [[The North-South Institute]], June 20, 2010, at the "People's Summit," held at [[Ryerson University]], Toronto, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if it carries out only one such transaction, then it will only be taxed for that one transaction. As such, this tax is neither a financial activities tax (FAT), nor a financial stability contribution (FSC) (or "bank tax"),&lt;ref name="distraction"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20100624/Flaherty-on-bank-tax-100624/|title=Flaherty says global bank tax a distraction for G20 |author=[[The Canadian Press]] |date= June 24, 2010|work= |publisher=[[CTV news]] via [[The Canadian Press]]  |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. This clarification is important in discussions about using a financial transaction tax as a tool to selectively discourage excessive [[speculation]] without discouraging any other activity (as [[Keynes]] originally envisioned it in 1936.&lt;ref name="Spratt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stampoutpoverty.org/?lid=9889 |title=A Sterling Solution |author=Dr. Stephen Spratt of Intelligence Capital |date=September 2006 |work=Stamp Out Poverty report|publisher=Stamp Out Poverty Campaign |pages=15–16|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; )

==Aftermath to IMF report==
On June 27, 2010 at the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit]], the G20 leaders declared that a "global tax" was no longer "on the table," but that individual countries will be able to decide whether to implement a levy against financial institutions to recoup billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailouts.&lt;ref name="Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/bank/article/829540--banks-relieved-as-g20-backs-off-on-bank-tax |title=Banks relieved as G20 backs off on bank tax |author= Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew|date=June 27, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Britain, France and Germany had already agreed before the summit to impose a "bank tax."&lt;ref name="Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew"/&gt; On May 20, 2010, German officials were understood to favour a [[financial transaction tax]] over a financial activities tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article7131991.ece |title=Merkel leads calls for global financial tax as markets continue to slide |author= David Charter|date=May 20, 2010 |work= |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=24 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529231504/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article7131991.ece| archivedate= 29 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two simultaneous taxes considered in the European Union===
On June 28, 2010, the European Union's executive said it will study whether the European Union should go alone in imposing a  [[financial transaction tax|tax on financial transactions]] after G20 leaders failed to agree on the issue.

The [[financial transactions tax]] would be ''separate'' from a bank levy, or a resolution levy, which some governments are ''also'' proposing to impose on banks to insure them against the costs of any future bailouts. EU leaders instructed their finance ministers in May 2010 to work out by the end of October 2010, details for the banking levy, but any [[financial transaction tax]] remains much more controversial.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-to-study-bank-transaction-tax-after-g20-reuters_molt-a1825662d825.html?x=0|title=
EU to study bank transaction tax after G20 |author= [[Reuters]]|date= June 28, 2010|work= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Should the bank tax be global?===
On August 30, 2009, British [[Financial Services Authority]] chairman Lord [[Adair Turner]] had said it was "ridiculous" to think he would propose a new tax on London and not the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8229500.stm |title=Turner defends bank tax comments |author=[[BBC]] |date= August 30, 2009|work= |publisher= [[BBC]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May, and June 2010, the government of Canada expressed opposition to the bank tax becoming "global" in nature.&lt;ref name="distraction"/&gt;

===Controversy over the IMF's refusal to promote a financial transactions tax===
In a detailed analysis of the IMF’s proposals, Stephan Schulmeister of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research finds that, "the assertion of the IMF paper, that [a [[financial-transactions tax]]] ‘is not focused on the core sources of financial instability,’ does not seem to have a solid foundation in the empirical evidence."&lt;ref name="proposals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-566355 |title= IMF bank tax proposals cause controversy|author=[[Bretton Woods Project]] |date=June 17, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Bretton Woods Project]] |accessdate=24 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728102650/http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-566355| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet at least one independent commentator has endorsed the IMF's view.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

In an alternative critique of the IMF's stance, Aldo Caliari of U.S. NGO the Center of Concern said, "the naiveté with which the IMF approaches its preferred mechanism — a bank tax tied to systemic risks — is astonishing for such a knowledgeable institution, unless it is in fact designed to let the financial sector off the hook."&lt;ref name="proposals"/&gt; He argues that the FAT and FSC do not reduce the overall risk in the system, and may increase it if banks are encouraged to feel that the taxes provide a government guarantee of future bailouts. Nonetheless, a 2010 [[Tulane Law Review]] article lent lukewarm support to President Obama's [[Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee]], which is a "bank tax" similar to the FSC.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt; The Tulane article concluded that taxing financial transactions would be "foolish", and that a bank tax "could constitute shrewd regulatory reform if done properly."&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

The bench was a typical feature of the courts of the [[Order of St. John]] in [[Malta]], such as at the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]], where judges and the nominated College of Advocates sat for court cases and review laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scietia|last=Harding|first=Hugh W.|date=1950|title=Advocates Under the Code de Rohan and the Present Law|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2016(1950)3(Jul.-Sept.)/02.pdf|volume=3|issue=2|page=121|issn=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520111517/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20%28Malta%29/Scientia.%2016%281950%293%28Jul.-Sept.%29/02.pdf|archive-date=20 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used to differentiate judges ("the bench") from [[Lawyer|attorneys]] or [[barristers]] ("[[Bar (law)|the bar]]"). The phrase "bench and bar" denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

The goal of the Act is to "ensure peace in the agricultural fields by guaranteeing justice for all agricultural workers and stability in labor relations."&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975,'' Cal.Stats. 1975, Third Extraordinary Session, c. 1 Sec. 1 at 4013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act, part of the [[California Labor Code]], explicitly encourages and protects "the right of agricultural employees to full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment, and to be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection."&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1140.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act established rules and authorized regulations similar to those of [[National Labor Relations Act]], a federal law which formally protected the collective bargaining rights of most American workers except farm and domestic workers.&lt;ref name="Higgins"&gt;Higgins, John E. and Janus, Peter A. ''The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act.'' 5th ed. Washington, D.C.: BNA Books, 2006. {{ISBN|1-57018-585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[California Agricultural Labor Relations Board]] (ALRB) administers the Act.  The ALRB has two functions: To conduct, oversee, and certify representation elections, and to investigate [[unfair labor practice]] (ULP) charges and pursue remedies.&lt;ref name="Hurt" /&gt;  [[Administrative law judge]]s and agency staff adjudicate most cases, with the five-member Board serving as a final arbiter.&lt;ref name="Hurt" /&gt;

==Background==
Collective bargaining rights for most hourly workers in the United States were first given legal protection in 1933 by Section 7a of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA). Although NIRA did not specifically exempt agricultural laborers from the protection of the Act, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]]—eager to win over farm-state members of Congress—argued that farmworkers were excluded.&lt;ref name="NYTEditorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;Weber, Devra. ''Dark Sweat, White Gold: California Farm Workers, Cotton, and the New Deal.'' Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-520-20710-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was enacted in 1935, it, too, specifically exempted agricultural workers due to pressure from the "farm bloc" in Congress.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NLRA was not the only federal law to discriminate against farmworkers.  The [[Social Security Act]] of 1935 and [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 also excluded them. See: Hurt, ''American Agriculture: A Brief History,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a number of attempts were made in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s to organize farm laborers, these efforts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Irving.

In August 1966, the National Farm Workers Association and Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, two unrecognized and relatively minor labor unions claiming to represent farm workers in California, merged to form the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (the predecessor organization to the [[United Farm Workers]]).&lt;ref name="Fight"&gt;Feriss, Susan; Sandoval, Ricardo; and Hembree, Diana. ''The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Movement.'' New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. {{ISBN|0-15-600598-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the philosophy of [[pacifism]] in the face of often violent reaction to its organizing efforts and engaging in [[strike action|strikes]], [[hunger strike]]s, [[boycott]]s and [[secondary boycott]]s (including the particularly successful [[Delano grape strike]]), marches, rallies, and cutting-edge public relations campaigns, the United Farm Workers (UFW) began organizing large numbers of agricultural laborers into unions.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt; In some cases, the UFW even won recognition and negotiated contracts.&lt;ref name="Hurt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;

==Impetus for legal action==

===The Salad Bowl strike===
{{main|Salad Bowl strike}}
A series of violent strikes and inter-union jurisdictional battles set the political stage for passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act. By 1969, the UFW was on the verge of winning the four-year-old Delano grape strike.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt; But as the Delano grape strike seemed to be ending, an attempt by the [[Teamsters|International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] to organize farm laborers in the [[Salinas Valley]] in California led to the costly "Salad Bowl strike."&lt;ref name="SaladBowlStrike"&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Harvest, Shipping Near Standstill in 'Salad Bowl' Strike." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Six thousand drivers and packing workers represented by the Teamsters struck on July 17, 1970, winning a contract on July 23 under which growers gave the Teamsters, not the UFW, access to farms and the right to organize workers into unions.&lt;ref name="SaladBowl"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902752,00.html "From Fruit Bowl to Salad Bowl."

===Worsening violence of the jurisdictional dispute===
The Teamsters resumed their dispute with the UFW in December 1972, which led to further extensive disruptions in the state agricultural industry, mass picketing, mass arrests, and extensive violence.&lt;ref name="Hurt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arneson"&gt;Arneson, Eric, ed.

''Los Angeles Times.'' July 14, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The violence worsened when the dispute moved into the Delano vineyards. Seventy farm workers were attacked on July 31, a UFW picketer was shot on August 3, five firebombs were thrown at UFW picket lines on August 9, two UFW members were shot on August 11, and a UFW picketer was shot to death on August 16.&lt;ref&gt;"70 Nonunion Farm Workers Attacked."

"Chavez Picket Shot to Death in Violence Near Bakersfield." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 17, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a tentative agreement was reached on September 27, 1973; the Teamsters again agreed to leave jurisdiction over farm field workers to the UFW.&lt;ref name="ShabecoffChavezReaches"&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. "Chavez Reaches Tentative Accord." ''New York Times.'' September 28, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chavez Says Pact Means Teamsters Will Leave Fields." ''New York Times.'' September 29, 1973./&lt;/ref&gt;

The new agreement did not last long. On November 7, just 41 days later, the Teamsters union said it would not repudiate the contracts it had signed.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. "Teamsters Shift Stand on Coast." ''New York Times.'' November 8, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; But the UFW now had too few resources and membership to do much about it.&lt;ref name="Hurt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arneson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Teamsters, Chavez Peace Precarious." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 9, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The UFW deployed its best strategic weapon, the boycott, and kept up the push for a national boycott of grapes, wine and lettuce.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Chavez Calls for Wine, Grape, Lettuce Boycott." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 10, 1973; "Grape and Lettuce Boycott to Widen." ''New York Times.'' November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamsters reiterated their pledge to uphold their contracts in November.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Teamsters Pledge to Honor Farm Pacts." ''Los Angeles Times.''

''New York Times.'' November 17, 1973; Steiger, Paul and Bernstein, Harry. "Fitzsimmons Reverses Position." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 22, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1974, many observers concluded that the UFW was no longer a viable force.  It called a few small strikes, defied court injunctions to stop picketing, and continued pushing its national boycotts. &lt;ref&gt;"Chavez Calls 2-Day Strike." ''New York Times.'' February 19, 1974; "Farm Union to Defy Court In Gallo Boycott Picketing." ''New York Times.'' March 3, 1974; Bernstein, Harry. "Chavez Wins AFL-CIO Backing for Boycott." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 8, 1974; "Boycott of California Crops Supported by A.F.L.- C.I.O." ''New York Times.'' April 9, 1974; Shabecoff, Philip. "A.F.L.-C.I.O. Backs Chavez Boycott." ''New York Times.''

November 4, 1974; "Judge on Coast Dissolves Order Restricting Suits by Farm Union." ''New York Times.'' November 17, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; But in July, it was forced to end picketing at some grape fields near Delano.&lt;ref&gt;Del Olmo, Frank. "UFWA Ends Picketing at Some Grape Fields." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 6, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamsters were in no better position to win organizing battles. It had opened a major organizing drive in March 1974 &lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Teamsters Open Massive Drive to Eliminate Chavez Farm Union." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 29, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and established a regional farm workers' local in June,&lt;ref&gt;"Teamsters Start Farm Union Local." ''New York Times.'' June 7, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort was in chaos by November.&lt;ref&gt;"Teamsters Local Termed in 'Chaos'." ''New York Times.'' November 10, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper columnists, however, began wondering in June whether the UFW had any capacity to fight, and by February 1975 had concluded the union had no future.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Charles T. "Chavez and the State of His Union." ''Los Angeles Times.'' June 23, 1974; Griffith, Winthrop. "Is Chavez Beaten?" ''New York Times.'' September 15, 1974; Taylor, Ronald B. "Chavez's Union: A Future?" ''New York Times.'' February 8, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Modesto march and the push for legislation===
The ongoing fight between the Teamsters and UFW and its effect on UFW's organizational viability led César Chávez to seriously consider legal reform as a solution to his union's problems.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold"&gt;del Castillo, Richard Griswold and Garcia, Richard A. ''Cesar Chavez: A Triumph of Spirit.'' Stillwater, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8061-2957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez had rejected legislative solutions in the past by arguing that a truly successful union movement must be built from the ground up rather than rely on top-down activity.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt; But Chávez began to reconsider this stand in light of the attacks by the Teamsters. Additionally, the time seemed right for a legislative program: [[Jerry Brown]], long an avid supporter of the UFW, had been elected [[Governor of California]] in November 1974.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt; Brown had even hired LeRoy Chatfield, a former high-level UFW staffer, as one of his key aides.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;

Once in office, however, Brown's support for the UFW cooled.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt; The UFW knew it had to make a strong political showing in order to push Brown and the [[California State Legislature]] to act.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;Levy, Jacques E.; Chávez, César; Ross, Fred Jr.; and Levy, Jacqueline M. ''Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-8166-5049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFW considered more mass picketing, more rallies, and more boycotts, but the union was worried that it had lost the support of farm workers and the public and that such events would point out the weakness of the union rather than its strength.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt; Instead, the UFW settled on a 110-mile (180&amp;nbsp;km) march by a small group of UFW leaders from [[San Francisco]] to the [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]] in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]].&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt; The organizers envisioned a small but dramatic march that would not require large numbers of participants. Just a few hundred marchers left San Francisco on February 22, 1975.&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Union Begins A Protest March." ''New York Times.'' February 23, 1975; Del Olmo, Frank. "Chavez Union Marches to Back Winery Boycott." ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 25, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; But more than 15,000 people joined them en route by the time they reached Modesto on March 1.&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Olmo, Frank. "Chavez Forces Gather for Rally." ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 28, 1975; Del Olmo, Frank. "Demonstrators at Gallo Aim for Farm Labor Law." ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 28, 1975; "The State." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 2, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spontaneous, spectacular success of the Modesto march garnered significant media attention, and proved that the UFW still had the support of farm workers.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;

==Legislative history of CALRA==
The dramatic success of the Modesto march energized the farm labor movement in California. Governor Brown quickly began pushing for labor law reform. Grower resistance never emerged, as many employers were reluctant to continue the fight against the UFW. "The grape boycott scared the heck out of the farmers, all of us," said one major grower, and employers did not want another UFW boycott.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arneson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feriss, Sandoval, and Hembree, ''The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Movement,'' 1998, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous legislative efforts===
Several previous efforts to enact legislation protecting collective bargaining rights for farm workers had emerged in California between 1969 and 1975, but all had failed. César Chávez had briefly supported labor law reform in California in April 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Chavez Moves for Revision of Proposed Laws." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 10, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Conservatism|Conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[State Senator]] George Murphy had sponsored a bill backed by Republicans and growers the same year to guarantee the right to organize, imposed secret-ballot elections, and restricted right to strike and to engage in boycotts.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Murphy Will Offer Bill on Farm Worker Union." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 18, 1969; "Sen. Murphy Offers Bill to Bar Tactics Like the Grape Boycott." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 30, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; But the Murphy bill, as well as a less restrictive bill in the State Assembly, died.&lt;ref&gt;Averill, John H. and Seeger, Murray. "Murphy Move on Farm Labor Bill Under Fire." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 23, 1969; "Assembly Bill Proposed Rules for Farm Unions." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 18, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy introduced an even more restrictive bill in 1970, but that too failed.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Workers Strike Ban Asked by Murphy." ''Los Angeles Times.'' Jan 21, 1970; Bernstein, Harry. "Chavez Rejects Secret Farm Vote Proposal." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 2, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first positive sign for labor law reform came in 1971.  An association of major growers agreed to support legislation which provided for recognition of farm worker unions in January 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Growers Will OK Farm Unions in Policy Change, Official Says." ''Los Angeles Times.'' January 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The State Senate narrowly approved a bill opposed by the UFW, but the Assembly killed the measure.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliam, Jerry. "Senate Narrowly Passes Farm Labor Bill Opposed by Chavez." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 5, 1971; Gilliam, Jerry "Assembly Committee Kills Last Farm Labor Bill of '71 Session." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the support for the growers in the State Senate, the growers backed a [[Initiative|ballot measure]], Proposition 22, which would have guaranteed the right to organize but placed heavy restrictions on the right to strike, boycott, and picket.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Allan. "The Farm Labor Initiative--Fair to All or All Too Unfair?" ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 31, 1972; Vizzard, James L. "The Measure Would Restrict the Union to the Point That It Would Be Killed." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 31, 1972; Bernstein, Harry. "Prop. 22: Two Sides of the Farm Labor Issue." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Then-[[California Attorney General]] Jerry Brown sued to have Proposition 22 removed from the ballot amid allegations of signature fraud on the approving petition, violation of child labor laws (children as young as six years old were alleged to have been paid to collect signatures), and bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott, William. "Brown Sues to Remove Farm Ballot Measure." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 14, 1972; Oliver, Myrna. "Prop. 22 Signatures Forged, Suit for $60 Million Charges." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 6, 1972;  Farr, William. "5 Charged With Fraud on Prop. 22 Petitions." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 3, 1972; Oliver, Myrna. "Judge Orders Halt to 3 Proposition 22 TV Ads." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 3, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The measure went down to defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott, William. "Voters Hand Stern Rebuttal to Costly Proposition Drives." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 9, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next legislative push came in 1973. The [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], the nation's largest association of farmers and a representative of many California growers, proposed amending the federal National Labor Relations Act to permit agricultural workers to organize.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Farmers Change Stand on Workers." ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 15, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The change led California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] to introduce a bill in the California state legislature that would permit agricultural field workers to unionize under secret ballot elections as well as ban secondary boycotts.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliam, Jerry. "Farm Labor Bill Asks Secret Union Elections." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 27, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; But the state Assembly did not pass the bill.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Labor Bill Defeated in Committee." ''Los Angeles Times.'' June 29, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; However, California's then-[[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], Jerry Brown—declaring that a "bloody civil war" existed in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]—came out in favor of a legislative solution in August 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"Brown Asks Emergency Farm Labor Legislation." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 19, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown, a longtime [[Labour law|labor attorney]] who had met César Chávez in 1968 and long supported the UFW and helped introduce UFW leaders to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] stars, directors, and studio heads in order to help the union win critical support in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;

Brown's public support and his impending run for governor (which was widely anticipated) led Chávez to make a stronger push for labor law reform in 1974. Chávez and [[John F. Henning]], Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the California Labor Federation (the state body of the [[AFL-CIO]], wrote the bill and first-term [[Chicano]] Assemblyman [[Richard Alatorre]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-Los Angeles) introduced the bill.&lt;ref name="Fight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Chavez, AFL-CIO Back Bill for Secret Farm Union Balloting." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 6, 1974; "Farm Labor Measure to Be Introduced." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 11, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; But Governor Ronald Reagan led opposition which killed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Chances Slim for Farm Workers' Secret Ballot." ''Los Angeles Times.''

Jerry Brown's election as governor significantly improved the chances of passing a bill in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Results of Election Boost Chances for 2 Key Labor Bills ." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 8, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the 26 paragraphs of Brown's inaugural address were devoted to the need for farm labor legislation, Assembly Speaker [[Leo T. McCarthy]] voiced his support for the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Labor Bill--Making a Start." ''Los Angeles Times.'' March 31, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill which would eventually become CALRA was introduced in both chambers of the state legislature on April 10, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;"Sweeping Farm Labor Bill Introduced in Sacramento." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 10, 1975; Skelton, George. "Brown Offers Bill on Farm Workers." ''Los Angeles Times.''

Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-253-34681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With McCarthy, some growers, and the UFW behind the bill, a key State Senate committee approved the bill on May 7.&lt;ref&gt;Goff, Tom.

"Senate Committee Approves Governor's Farm Labor Bill." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 8, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Key labor unions (including the Teamsters), arguing that [[card check]] rather than secret ballot elections should be the bill's preferred method of resolving unionization disputes, opposed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott, William.

May 10, 1975; "Teamsters Threaten Strike If Farm Bill Is Enacted." ''Associated Press.'' May 13, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a key State Assembly committee approved it on May 12, despite attempts by some Teamster members to intimidate legislators into opposing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Teamster members and others tried to seize control of the Assembly committee meeting, standing on desks, chanting, and pushing legislators. UFW members and their supporters engaged in scuffles with these individuals. See: "California Farm Bill Backed By Panel as Unionists Fight." ''United Press International.'' May 14, 1975; Stammer, Leo. "Farm Labor Bill OKd by Assembly Panel." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 13, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition was countered by the UFW, which held rallies to support the bill, and agreement was reached on May 19 on a compromise bill.&lt;ref&gt;"Parade Here Backs Efforts by Chavez To Unionize Farms."

"Agreement Reached on Farm Labor Bill." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, however, the deadline for passing a bill out of its chamber of origination had passed, and Governor Brown was forced to call a special session of the legislature to pass the farm labor bill.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Farm Labor Accord Sets Stage for Special Session." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A Senate committee approved the bill on May 21, the full Senate passed the bill on May 26, two Assembly committees reported the bill on May 27, and the Assembly passed the bill and set it to Governor Brown for his signature on May 29.&lt;ref&gt;"Teamsters Back Farm Labor Accord." ''New York Times.'' May 21, 1975; Gilliam, Jerry. "Farm Bill Clears Senate Panel 4-1, Faces One More." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 22, 1975; Gilliam, Jerry. "Senate Passes Farm Labor Bill." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 27, 1975; Gilliam, Jerry. "Farm Labor Bill Moves Quickly Toward Passage." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 28, 1975; Gilliam, Jerry. "Assembly Sends Farm Bill to Brown for Signing." ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 30, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Just 50 calendar days were needed to pass the bill.  Governor Brown signed the legislation into law on June 4, 1975.&lt;ref name="GovSigns" /&gt;

==Structure of the Act==
The Act defines agriculture to include farming (which includes cultivation and tillage of soil; dairy production; cultivation, growing, and harvesting of agricultural or horticultural commodities; raising livestock, bees, furbearing animals, or poultry; and/or forestry or lumbering operations), and includes all activities incidental to or in conjunction with agriculture (such as preparation for market, transportation, or storage).&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1140.4 (a).&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are defined in the Act, but the definition excludes anyone engaged in construction, painting, building repair,or land moving operations unrelated to the preparation of land for cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1140.4 (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes a five-member Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), whose five-year terms are staggered so that one member's term ends on January 1 of each year.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1141.&lt;/ref&gt; The ALRB must issue a written report on its activities to the Governor and Legislature each year,&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1143.&lt;/ref&gt; may establish officers or offices and delegate all or part of its authority to such on an as-needed basis,&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1141-1150.&lt;/ref&gt; and has extensive investigatory, subpoena, and enforcement powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Sections 1151 and 1160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act defines unfair labor practices for both employers and labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1152-1155.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1154 (d) of the Act bans strikes (including [[recognition strike]]s) by workers who have not selected an organization as their labor representative through the procedures outlined by the Act, but protects secondary picketing and publicity only if the labor union is the certified bargaining representative or has not lost an election at the worksite in the past 12 months and only if the publicity or picketing does not induce others to engage in strikes.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1154 (d).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1154.5 explicitly bans [[hot cargo]] agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1154.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also requires bargaining in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1155.2-1155.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act outlines procedures similar to those of the National Labor Relations Act for electing a representative labor organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1156-1159.&lt;/ref&gt; Only secret ballot elections are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1156.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board has the right to determine the correct bargaining unit,&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1156.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and an election is triggered only when a petition signed by a majority of current workers is presented.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1156.3 (a).&lt;/ref&gt; There are several bars to holding an election (including the existence of an existing certified labor organization, an election was held and lost within the previous 12 months, and an election was held but no contract executed within the previous 12 months).&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1156.3-1156.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

To encourage the adoption of collective bargaining agreements, the Act (as amended) provides for the declaration of an impasse, mandatory and binding 30-day mediation and conciliation, review of the mediator's report, and court review of binding mediation.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1164.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act contains a "make-whole" remedy for bad-faith bargaining intended to encourage employers to bargain in good faith. Under this provision, the ALRB can "take affirmative action including...making employees whole, when the Board deems such relief appropriate, for the loss of pay resulting from the employer's refusal to bargain".&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Labor Relations Act.'' California Labor Code. Division 2, Part 3.5, Section 1160.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Governor Brown nominated the ALRB's first five members ([[Roger Cardinal Mahony|a Catholic bishop]], a farmer, a member of [[La Raza Unida Party]], a former UFW official, and a former Teamsters attorney) on June 23, 1975, just 18 days after signing the Act into law.&lt;ref&gt;"Five to Be Named to Farm Labor Vote Board." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 24, 1975; "Bishop, Farmer, Unionists on New Farm Labor Unit." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 17, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The ALRB had an initial budget of $1.5 million ($6.46 million in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars).&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/cf/more.php?id=44_0_2_0 Martin, Philip. "Labor Relations in California Agriculture: 1975-2000." ''Changing Face.'' 6:4 (October 2000).]&lt;/ref&gt;

CALRA went into effect on August 28, 1975.&lt;ref name="Effect"&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Farm Labor Law in Effect." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 29, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Draft regulations governing the operation of the Board and secret ballot organizing elections were issued 10 days earlier, but did not address the controversial issue of whether union organizers would have access to the workplace (e.g., fields).&lt;ref name="Effect" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Election Rules Released." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 19, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The ALRB issued rules giving organizers access to fields on August 29, and the UFW filed for the first union elections under the Act on September 1.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Unions Win Access to Fields." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 30, 1975; Bigham, Joe. "UFWA Files First Petitions for Elections." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 2, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; But a federal district court enjoined the Board from implementing its worksite access rules on September 3&lt;ref&gt;Stammer, Larry. "Union Access to Fields Curbed." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 4, 1975; "U.S. Judge Enjoins California From Enforcing Rule Giving Union Aides Access to Farms." ''New York Times.'' September 4, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;—putting a halt to some ballot-counting in several elections.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Labor Tally Barred On Coast." ''New York Times.'' September 6, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the first week of elections, the UFW had won 22 bargaining units and the Teamsters 13, while growers had alleged the UFW had committed unfair labor practices in several elections.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Union Leads Teamsters In Coast Bargaining Elections." ''New York Times.'' September 13, 1975; "Growers Charge Unfair Labor Practices After UFWA Wins." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 14, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The California Supreme Court lifted the ban on union organizers in the fields on September 18, and the ALRB issued its first formal ULP complaints (against two growers) the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "UFWA Wins State High Court Ruling." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 19, 1975; Bernstein, Harry. "Union Access to Farms Gets Judge's OK." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 11, 1975; Bernstein, Harry. "Farm Labor Board Takes Historic Step." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inexperience of the Board and its agents, the large number of court challenges to the new law, the large number of elections held, and the large number of alleged violations of the law led to significant delays in voting, ballot-counting, and enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Enforcement of Farm Law to Be Tightened." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 30, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A special panel of attorneys and investigators was named by Governor Brown on October 4 to help alleviate the backlog,&lt;ref&gt;"Brown to Name Farm Labor Unit." ''New York Times.'' October 5, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; and strengthened penalties for anyone found guilty of committing a ULP were put in place on October 16 to help reduce the number of violations.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Harry. "Farm Labor Board Moves to Crack Down on Growers." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 17, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of the law==
By the end of January 1976, the ALRB had received 604 election petitions, conducted 423 elections involving over 50,000 workers (80 percent of elections had objections filed), received 988 ULP charges, issued 254 citations for violations of the Act, and issued 27 decisions.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Between 1975 and 1984, unions won 88 percent of all elections, but between 1984 and 2003 won less than 50 percent of elections.&lt;ref name="Mandatory"&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7article/article34.htm Martin, Philip and Mason, Bert. "Mandatory Mediation Changes Rules for Negotiating Farm Labor Contracts." ''California Agriculture.'' January-March 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, however, two-thirds of all elections had been held in the Act's first three years, and since 1978 about half of all elections had been [[NLRB election procedures#Decertification elections|decertification elections]].&lt;ref name="Voos"&gt;Voos, Paula Beth. ''Contemporary Collective Bargaining in the Private Sector.'' Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-913447-60-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large number of union elections, CALRA's effect on union membership seems mixed at best. Much of this evidence focuses on the UFW, assumed to be the prime beneficiary of the Act. Membership in the UFW fell from a high of more than 70,000-60,000 in 1972 to a low of 6,000-5,000 in 1974, but rose to just 18,000 by 1977.&lt;ref name="ShabecoffChavezReaches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917865,00.html "Rendering to Cesar." ''Time.'' September 22, 1975.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Render"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946783,00.html "Render Unto Cesar." ''Time.'' March 21, 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamsters, however, had more than 55,000 farm worker members by 1977.&lt;ref name="ShabecoffChavezReaches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; The UFW had only six major collective bargaining agreements by 1994 (one vegetable grower, four citrus growers, one mushroom grower, and a host of small nurseries).&lt;ref name="Voos" /&gt; However, one study concludes that mass importation and use of illegal immigrants—not flaws in CALRA—are holding down additional collective bargaining gains.&lt;ref name="Voos" /&gt; Others conclude (on the basis of anecdotal evidence) that the Teamsters have signed [[sweetheart deal]]s with perhaps as many as 375 growers, holding down membership gains for the UFW.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, David. ''The Children of NAFTA: Labor Wars on the U.S./Mexico Border.'' Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-520-23778-1}}; Rosales, Francisco Arturo. ''Chicano!: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement.'' Houston, Tex.: Arte Publico Press, 1997. {{ISBN|1-55885-201-8}}; [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/14/business/fi-farmworker14 Lifsher, Marc. "UFW Seeks New Way to Organize." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 14, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize the ALRB for being politicized.  Critics point to the change in the Board in 1980, when [[George Deukmejian]], the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor of California, replaced the Brown board with allegedly pro-grower members, leading to low union confidence in the Board's impartiality and a severe decline in the number of election petitions brought before the board.&lt;ref&gt;F. Arturo Rosales. "The Agricultural Labor Relations Act." In ''Mexico and the United States.'' Lee Stacy, ed. Tarrytown, N.Y.: Marshall Cavendish, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7614-7402-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One positive outcome has been the end of jurisdictional warfare between the UFW and Teamsters. The UFW signed an agreement with the Teamsters in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by CALRA, while the Teamsters agreed to organize all other agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Wallace. "Chavez and Teamsters Sign Accord." ''New York Times.'' March 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;"Chavez Ends the Boycotts Of Lettuce, Grapes, Wine." ''New York Times.'' February 1, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Why did the two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters were on the verge of losing a jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.&lt;ref name="Render" /&gt;

It is also not clear whether CALRA has had a beneficial effect on the Californian economy. One study concluded that the Act actually resulted in a net economic loss: Higher prices were being charged for produce, farm worker earnings and land values had actually dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Cottle, Rex L.; Macaulay, Hugh H.; and Yandle, Bruce. "Some Economic Effects of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act." ''Journal of Labor Research.'' 4:4 (December 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, another analysis has concluded that these economic effects are minimal compared to the reduction in poverty which has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Philip L. ''Promises to Keep: Collective Bargaining in California Agriculture.'' Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8138-2988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act's "make-whole" provision has also come under scrutiny. Although the make-whole provision's goal is laudable, it is argued, the Board's decisions have led to litigation that lasts for years and mitigate the impact of any awards.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Philip L. and Egan, Daniel L. "The Makewhole Remedy in California Agriculture." ''Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review.'' 43:1 (October 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts at revision==
A number of efforts to revise CALRA have been made over the years.  The first significant effort came in 2000, when Democratic Governor Gray Davis vetoed an effort to expand CALRA's reach to [[Groom (horses)|stablehands]] at the state's [[race track|horse racing tracks]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Carla. "Governor Vetoes New Labor Rules for Stable Hands." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 2, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major revision was enacted in 2002. A rising number of impasses in collective bargaining appeared to be frustrating the purpose of CALRA.&lt;ref name="Pictsweet"&gt;Alvarez, Fred. "Bill Could End Impasse at Pictsweet." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The UFW backed two bills which would impose binding arbitration and mediation on unions and employers if an impasse was declared.&lt;ref name="Pictsweet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peril"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/us/farm-union-bill-holds-peril-for-california-leader.html Greenhouse, Steven. "Farm Union Bill Holds Peril for California Leader." ''New York Times.'' August 9, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bills passed the state legislature in August 2002, and Governor Davis signed them into law in October.&lt;ref name="Mandatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peril" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gregg. "Davis Signs Two Bills Mandating Mediation in Disputes." ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Growers filed suit in state court to have the amendments declared unconstitutional, but a state appeals court upheld the revisions in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Fred. "Fate of New Farm Labor Bill Rests With Davis." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 15, 2003; Hirsch, Jerry. "Mediator Can Impose Terms of Labor Pact." ''Los Angeles Times.'' July 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to revise the law in 2007 was also unsuccessful.  The UFW backed a bill which would allow card check unionization, arguing that large majorities of workers signed union authorization cards but then were intimidated into voting against the union during the election process.  The growers argued that the UFW was either duping or intimidating workers into signing union authorization cards, and that the secret ballot voting revealed the true feelings of workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/19/local/me-mahony19 Sallady, Robert. "Bill Would Alter Farm Union Voting Practices." ''Los Angeles Times.'' April 19, 2007]; Lifsher, Marc. "UFW Seeks New Way to Organize." ''Los Angeles Times.'' September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But the bill did not pass either chamber.

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Prior to the arrival of [[Europe]]ans the area was home to [[Nipmuc]], [[Wampanoag]] and [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] peoples.
[[File:Post Office and Fire Station, Central Falls, RI.jpg|thumb|left|Broad Street c. 1908]]
[[File:U.S. Cotton Co., Central Falls, RI.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Cotton Co. c. 1910]]

Central Falls has historic significance as being the site of a major battle during King Philip's War.  It was here on March 26, 1676 that Narragansett Indians ambushed Captain Michael Pierce and his Plymouth Colony troops who (with 20 Wampanoag Christian Indians) were pursuing them.  Nearly all those ambushed were killed including nine taken prisoner and later tortured to death at nearby Cumberland, Rhode Island.  A stone memorial marks the mass grave at the site known as "[[Nine Men's Misery]]".

In the 18th century, Captain Stephen Jenks built a [[trip hammer]] and [[blacksmith shop]] along the [[Blackstone River]], forming the nucleus of what would eventually become Central Falls. Other manufacturers, including a [[chocolate maker]], set up shop in the building and the new village became known as Chocolateville.

In 1824, Stephen Jenks suggested the name Central Falls, thus giving the village its permanent name.

Originally, Central Falls was one of the many villages within the town of [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]], but in 1871, having experienced a growth spurt, it split into three smaller towns: Smithfield, [[North Smithfield, Rhode Island|North Smithfield]] and [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]]. Central Falls then became part of the town of Lincoln.  Lincoln experienced its own growth spurt, so in 1895 Lincoln split into two towns, giving birth to the city of Central Falls.

While [[Quaker]]s made up the majority of the first European settlers in the area, they were soon followed by a diverse mix of immigrants from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[French Canada]]. By the 20th century, Central Falls had experienced its own population explosion and for a while was the most densely populated city in the United States. In recent decades, a large number of [[Hispanic]] immigrants have found a home in Central Falls. Central Falls has always been an extremely diverse city, so much so that when the city celebrated its 100th anniversary with a parade in 1995, more than 100 countries were represented.

==Geography==
Central Falls is located at {{Coord|41|53|24|N|71|23|33|W|type:city}} (41.889863, -71.392606).&lt;ref name="GR1" /&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|1.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (6.20%) is water. It is drained by the [[Blackstone River]].

Residents are served by the [[Central Falls School District]]. This school district is funded and appointed by the [[State of Rhode Island Department of Education]].

&lt;!---national news. Needs to be left here. Even the U.S. President commented on this ---&gt;
In February 2010, the entire faculty and administrative staff of Central Falls High School was fired after the teachers' union refused to accept one of the "[[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]]" options for restructuring failing schools.  In accordance with NCLB legislation, schools deemed failing have four options to follow for restructuring.  The teachers' union refused to accept to work 25 minutes of extra time under the "transforming model", so the superintendent proceeded and chose the "turnaround model", which requires a district to fire the entire staff (teachers and administrators). They may rehire up to 50% of the teachers for the beginning of the next school year. The school has a graduation rate of around 50%, and 7% of 11th-graders were proficient in mathematics in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/24/AR2010022402092.html | work=The Washington Post }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school had been identified as one of the worst in the state.

There has been at least one Catholic school present in Central Falls since 1895. By 1908, there were three: St. Matthew's, Holy Trinity,  and Notre Dame. In 1995, these three schools were combined to create St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Academy, which is located in the building originally serving St. Matthew's.  Currently, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Academy is the only non-public school in Central Falls.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Issues===
On April 25, 2010, the [[Providence Journal Bulletin]] ran an article detailing rampant [[fraud]] and [[corruption]] by Mayor Charles D. Moreau, outlining no-bid contracts and kickbacks from a high school friend, who was granted almost $2 million  in overpriced property boarding fees. The article further states that the same friend gave him a $6,875 furnace for his own home for only $6,000, which Moreau said he paid 'in cash'. The friend in question, Michael G. Bouthillette, was a campaign contributor to Moreau's multiple re-election campaigns. These allegations and others are currently being investigated by the [[Rhode Island State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Central_Falls_Boardups_04-25-10_UQHSU35_v115.3a580b3.html|title=providencejournal.com: Local &amp; World News, Sports &amp; Entertainment in Providence, RI|website=providencejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial straits of the city government of Central Falls have worsened in the 2000s as the state cut money to cities and towns and [[pension]]s and pensioner health insurance for city employees accumulated to the extent that the city government declared insolvency in May 2010 and went into [[receivership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/CF_REPORT_12-17-10_O6LGEUG_v52.34c8f37.html|title=providencejournal.com: Local &amp; World News, Sports &amp; Entertainment in Providence, RI|website=providencejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 1, 2011 Central Falls filed for bankruptcy under [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9, Title 11]] of the United States Code. It made the filing as it grappled with an $80 million unfunded pension and retiree health benefit liability that is over five times its annual budget of $17 million.{{update after|2013|11|6}}

'''''Creating Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. United States EPA: No. 88-1490''''' (First Argued March 6, 1989 – Finally Decided September 25, 1992) was a notable [[United States]] [[Environmental Law]] case involving the required reporting of safety breaches in management facilities along with reporting during interim period and reporting of unknown substances.  The case began when Chemical Waste Management, Inc appealed its fine from the EPA for environmental health hazards to the US court in 1989 and appealed it twice.&lt;ref name=epa1&gt;{{cite web| title =Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.

==Background==
[[US Congress|Congress]] established the [[RCRA]] in 1976 to form an environmental regulation program that allowed for comprehensive involvement and more fluid adjustments to be made especially during interim periods.&lt;ref name=scholar1&gt;{{cite web| title =CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. and Waste Management of North America, Inc., Petitioners,v.U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY and Lee M. Thomas, Administrator, Respondents.| work =United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.| url =https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17357313564113855781&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical Waste Management, Inc was a waste disposal company that was responsible for the safe and environmental management of hazardous materials.  At the time there were several environmental safety standards in place enforced by the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].  The EPA at the time required organizations and companies to make reports directly to the agency of any malfunctions or deteriorations of facilities.  In addition in 1988 it established the requirement that facilities must report any materials that had leakages, even of unconfirmed substances, as hazardous materials until testing could further distinguish, and thus should be treated as such.  The EPA also required disclosures of leakages and new hazards during interim periods of facilities' operations.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;

Chemical Waste Management, Inc had an on-site well-check system designed to test for any hazardous material leakage.  It had a two part system check, although the EPA at the time had raised this requirement to three checks.  Chemical Waste Management was in an interim stage where it had not installed the third check yet, but had not reached the required date of installment yet.  Inspectors had found that an unidentified substance had been leaking out of a facility that was unreported and unknown to Chemical Waste Management.  Chemical Waste Management failed to report these inspection findings of this interim period to the EPA.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;

When the EPA eventually found out about these violations, it fined the Chemical Waste Management for improper hazardous waste disposal.  The fines were not significantly large, as the supposed violations had only been occurring for a short interim period.  However, the EPA could fine firms and organizations up to $25,000 a day for the violation.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;

Chemical Waste Management believed that these fines were improper, since: 1. at the time the leakage substance was not considered hazardous, and 2. Chemical Waste Management had been on schedule to update its safety precautions.&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;

==Case==
In determining this case, the court brought into question if the EPA had correctly applied its regulations  correctly to the Chemical Waste Management.  The court believed that Chemical Waste Management was surely at fault for failing to report its faulty facilities as noted by inspectors.  It was therefore its duty to report its breaches of environmental standards.  The EPA at the time had a specific requirement that all notes made by inspectors were required to be reported to the agency itself even if the notes are not specifically linked to a malfunction or deterioration of facilities.  It was found that Chemical Waste Management was in a state of non-compliance and violation for under six months.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;

The case was first brought to the US District court and ruled in favor of the EPA and was then sent to the Appellate court.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;

During the appeals, the court questioned whether the time frame of the petitioner's claim had expired, since it had made the standards change and it was no longer a question of enacting standards, but simply arguing past standards were unfairly put upon the organization.  The court did not follow through with this claim, but it did aid in its final decision.&lt;ref name=scholar2&gt;{{cite web| title =Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. USEPA, 869 F. 2d 1526| work =Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia| url =https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11260199862489876670&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The court held that the EPA was correct in enforcing these regulations upon Chemical Waste Management.  It was reasonable to expect the firm to report leakage of a substance, although it was not considered hazardous.  It also held that it was reasonable to expect Chemical Waste Management to especially report leakages that had breached the two check system and thus were in violation of the old requirements, regardless of it being in a transitional stage.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=scholar1/&gt;

The court ruled in the EPA's favor, although the fine was significantly lower than before at $40,000, since Chemical Waste Management's violation had been minor, had little effect, and had been dealt with appropriately since the violation.&lt;ref name=epa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;

Both appeals to higher courts resulted in the same decision by the court, and the decision was made in favor of the EPA, finally resolved in 1992.&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;&lt;ref name=scholar2/&gt;

==Significance== 
This case outlined many protocols for environmental safety and health enforcement.  It further requires disclosure from organizations as mandatory self-reporting regarding their malfunctions in facilities.  Secondly it does not dismiss firms from environmental standards during interim periods of changing regulations.  It also further solidifies the notion that unknown substance leakages are to be classified as environmental hazards until they can be accurately identified and controlled.&lt;ref name=epa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa3/&gt;  The question of retroactivity does not strictly constitute retroactive lawmaking, since it was announced beforehand that new regulations would eventually be created and enforced.&lt;ref name=scholar2/&gt;

The '''Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities''' is an [[international human rights instrument|international human rights]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] of the [[United Nations]] intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with [[Disability|disabilities]]. Parties to the Convention are required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of [[human rights]] by persons with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full [[equality under the law]]. The Convention has served as the major catalyst in the global movement from viewing persons with disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing them as full and equal members of society, with human rights. It is also the only UN human rights instrument with an explicit [[sustainable development]] dimension. The Convention was the first human [[rights]] treaty of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=General Assembly Adopts Groundbreaking Convention, Optional Protocol on Rights of Persons with Disabilities |date=13 December 2006 |url=http://www.un.org/press/en/2006/ga10554.doc.htm |publisher=United Nations |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13 December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A/RES/61/106 |body=General Assembly |session=61 |type=Resolution |resolution_number=106 |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |date=13 December 2006 |accessdate=5 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the 20th party, it came into force on 3 May 2008.&lt;ref name="Scoop-EiF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0805/S00048.htm |title=Landmark UN treaty on rights of persons with disabilities enters into force |publisher=Scoop |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018, it has 162 signatories and 177 parties, which includes 172 states and the [[European Union]] (which ratified it on 23 December 2010 to the extent responsibilities of the member states were transferred to the European Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en |title= UN Treaty Collection: parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: List of parties |publisher=United Nations |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, a vote in the United States Senate fell six votes short of the two-thirds majority required for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Helderman |first=Rosalind S. |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-04/politics/35624605_1_treaty-disabled-children-americans-with-disabilities-act |title=Senate rejects treaty to protect disabled around the world |newspaper=Washington Post |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-20 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055440/https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-04/politics/35624605_1_treaty-disabled-children-americans-with-disabilities-act }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention is monitored by the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].

==History==

1981 to 1992 was the UN "Decade of Disabled Persons". In 1987, a global meeting of experts to review progress recommended that the UN General Assembly should draft an international convention on the elimination of discrimination against persons with disabilities. Draft convention outlines were proposed by [[Italy]] and subsequently [[Sweden]], but no consensus was reached. Many government representatives argued that existing human rights documents were sufficient. Instead, non-compulsory "Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities" were adopted by the General Assembly in 1993. In 2000, leaders of five international disability NGOs issued a declaration, calling on all governments to support a Convention. In 2001, the General Assembly, following a proposal by [[Mexico]], established an Ad Hoc Committee to consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral convention to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, based on a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, A. (2003) [http://www.disabilityworld.org/01-03_03/news/unconvention.shtml A UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: The Next Steps] Paper presented at the General Assembly Meeting of Rehabilitation International Arab Region, 8–9 March 2003, Kingdom of Bahrain.&lt;/ref&gt; Disability rights organisations, including the [[International Disability Alliance]] as coordinator of an ad hoc International Disability Caucus, participated actively in the drafting process, in particular seeking a role for disabled people and their organisations in the implementation and monitoring of what became the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/what_we_do/disability_rights/un_convention Handicap International UK - UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico initiated negotiations, with active support from [[United Nations Regional Groups#Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)|GRULAC]] (the Latin American regional group). When support for a Convention was foundering in 2002 due to [[Western European and Others Group|WEOG]] opposition, [[New Zealand]] played a pivotal role in achieving cross-regional momentum. Acting as facilitator from 2002–03, New Zealand eventually assumed the formal role of Chair of Ad Hoc Committee and led negotiations to a consensus agreement in August 2006, working closely with other Bureau members Jordan, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, and South Africa, as well as Korea and Mexico. The Convention became one of the most quickly supported human rights instruments in history, with strong support from all regional groups. 160 States have signed the Convention upon its opening in 2007 and 126 States ratified the Convention within its first five years. In recognition of its role in creating the Convention, as well as the quality of New Zealand's landmark national Disability Strategy, [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] [[Anand Satyanand]] received the 2008 World Disability Award on behalf of the nation.

As of 2015, for the first time in its history, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities opened an investigation into a signatory state for breaching their convention obligations. The investigation was triggered by article 6 of the optional protocol, which provides that an investigation will be carried out once the Committee receives "reliable information indicating grave and systematic violation" of the human rights of persons with disabilities. The [[government of the United Kingdom]] is being investigated, with the final report currently due to be released in 2017.&lt;ref name="UN inquiry considers alleged UK disability rights violations"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/20/un-inquiry-uk-disability-rights-violations-cprd-welfare-cuts |title=UN inquiry considers alleged UK disability rights violations |publisher=The Guardian |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The Convention follows the civil law tradition, with a preamble, in which the principle that "all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated " of [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] is cited, followed by 50 articles.  Unlike many UN covenants and conventions, it is not formally divided into parts.

'''Article 1''' defines the purpose of the Convention:

{{quote|to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent [[dignity]]}}

'''Articles 2 and 3''' provide definitions and general principles such as [[communication]] including [[Braille]], [[sign language]], [[plain language]] and [[nonverbal communication]], [[reasonable accommodation]] and [[universal design]].

'''Articles 4–32''' define the rights of persons with disabilities and the obligations of states parties towards them. Many of these mirror rights affirmed in other UN conventions such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] or the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention Against Torture]], but with specific obligations ensuring that they can be fully realised by persons with disabilities.

Rights specific to this convention include the rights to [[accessibility]] including the [[information technology]], the rights to live independently and be included in the community (Article 19), to personal mobility (article 20), habilitation and rehabilitation (Article 26), and to participation in political and public life, and [[culture|cultural life]], [[recreation]] and [[sport]] (Articles 29 and 30).

In addition, parties to the Convention must raise awareness of the human rights of persons with disabilities (Article 8), and ensure [[accessibility|access]] to [[road]]s, [[building]]s, and [[information]] (Article 9).

'''Articles 33–39''' govern reporting and monitoring of the convention by [[national human rights institutions]] (Article 33) and [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (Article 34).

'''Articles 40–50''' govern ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Convention.  '''Article 49''' also requires that the Convention be available in accessible formats.

==Core provisions==

===Guiding principles of the Convention===
There are eight guiding principles that underlie the Convention:

#Respect for inherent dignity, individual [[autonomy]] including the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons
#Non-discrimination
#Full and effective participation and [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] in society
#[[Respect diversity|Respect for difference]] and acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] and humanity
#[[Equal opportunity|Equality of opportunity]]
#[[Accessibility]]
#[[gender equality|Equality between men and women]]
#Respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities

===Definition of disability===
Article 2 (Definitions) does not include a definition of disability. The Convention adopts a [[social model of disability]], but does not offer a specific definition. The Convention's preamble (e) explains that the Convention recognises:

{{quote|...that disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others}}

Article one (Purpose) further offers that:

{{quote|Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments  which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.}}

However, the use of the term "include" should not be interpreted as excluding those who have short term or fluctuating conditions.

===Principle of "reasonable accommodation"===
The Convention defines "[[reasonable accommodation]]" to be "necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and [[fundamental rights|fundamental freedoms]]" at the Article 2 and demands this all aspects of life including [[inclusion (education)|inclusive education]].

===Prevention of discrimination===
The Article 8 of Convention stresses the [[awareness raising]] to foster respect for the rights and dignity against discrimination:
#To raise awareness throughout society, including at the family level, regarding persons with disabilities, and to foster respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
#To combat [[stereotype]]s, [[prejudice]]s and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on sex and age, in all areas of life.
#To promote awareness of the capacities and contributions of persons with disabilities.
#Initiating and maintaining effective public awareness campaigns designed: (i) to nurture receptiveness to the rights of persons with disabilities. (ii) to promote positive perceptions and greater social awareness towards persons with disabilities. (iii) to promote recognition of the skills, merits and abilities of persons with disabilities, and of their contributions to [[wikt:Special:Search/workplace|workplace]] and the [[labour market]]. 
#Encouraging all organs of the [[mass media]] to portray persons with disabilities in a manner consistent with the purpose of the present Convention.
#Promoting awareness-training programmes regarding persons with disabilities and the rights of persons with disabilities.

===Accessibility===
The Convention stresses that persons with disabilities should be able to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life. To this end, States Parties should take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access, to the physical environment, to transportation, to [[information and communications technology]], and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public.
[[Accessibility]] can be grouped into  three main groups. 
1. physical  accessibility
2. service  accessibility 
3. accessibility  to  [[information and communication technology|communication and information]]

===Situations of risk and humanitarian emergency===
Article 11 of the Convention affirms that States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]], all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of [[armed conflict]], humanitarian [[emergency|emergencies]] and the occurrence of [[natural disaster]].

===Recognition before the law and legal capacity===
Article 12 of the Convention affirms the equal recognition before the law and [[capacity (law)|legal capacity]] of the persons with disabilities.

States Parties should: 
#reaffirm that persons with disabilities have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.
#recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life.
#take appropriate measures to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity.
#ensure that all measures that relate to the exercise of legal capacity provide for appropriate and effective safeguards to prevent abuse in accordance with [[international human rights law]]. Such safeguards shall ensure that measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity respect the rights, will and preferences of the person, are free of [[conflict of interest]] and undue influence, are proportional and tailored to the person's circumstance, apply for the shortest time possible and are subject to regular [[judicial review|review]] by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. The safeguards shall be proportional to the degree to which such measures affect the person's rights and interests.

===Access to justice===
Article 13 of the Convention affirms the effective access to justice for persons with disabilities, stating that:
#States parties shall ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including through the provision of procedural and [[reasonable accommodation|age-appropriate accommodations]], in order to facilitate their effective role as a direct and indirect participants, including as [[witness]]es, in all legal proceeding, including at investigative and other preliminary stages.
#In order to help to ensure effective access to [[criminal justice|justice]] for persons with disabilities, states Parties shall promote appropriate training for those working in the field of administration of justice, including [[police]] and prison staff. This Article together with the Article 12 are cited by the "Handbook on prisoners with special needs"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4a0969d42.html Handbook on prisoners with special needs, pp. 47-48]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].

===Right to education===
The Convention states that persons with disabilities should be guaranteed the right to [[inclusive education]] at all levels, regardless of age, without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity.

States Parties should ensure that:
#children with disabilities are not excluded from [[free education|free]] and compulsory [[primary education]], or from [[secondary education]];
#adults with disabilities have access to general tertiary education, [[vocational training]], [[adult education]] and [[lifelong learning]];
#persons with disabilities receive the necessary support, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education; and
#effective individualized support measures are put in place to maximize academic and social development.

States Parties should take appropriate measures, such as:
#endorsing the learning of Braille, alternative script, [[augmentative and alternative communication|augmentative and alternative modes, means and formats of communication]] and orientation and mobility skills, and facilitating [[peer support]] and mentoring;
#supporting the learning of sign language and promoting the linguistic identity of the deaf community;
#advocating that education of persons, particularly children, who are blind and/or deaf, is delivered in the most appropriate languages and means of communication for the individual; and
#employing teachers, including teachers with disabilities, who are qualified in sign language and/or Braille, and to train education professionals and staff about disability [[awareness]], use of augmentative and alternative modes and formats of communication, and educational techniques and materials to support persons with disabilities.

===Right to health===
Article 25 specifies that "persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the [[right to health|highest attainable standard of health]] without discrimination on the basis of disability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disabilities-convention.htm#25 Article 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting the integrity of the person===
Article 17 of the Convention states that every person with disabilities has a right to respect for his or her physical and mental [[integrity]] on an equal basis with others.

===Respect for the family===
Article 23 of the Convention prohibits [[compulsory sterilization]] of disabled persons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/Regularsession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf?u Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (A/HRC/22/53)] states that persons especially with psychological disability are often subjected to unhuman treatment or medical abuses (para 57-70)&lt;/ref&gt; and guarantees their right to [[adoption|adopt children]].

===Habilitation and rehabilitation===
Article 26 of the Convention affirms that "States Parties shall take effective and appropriate measures, including through [[peer support]], to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, full physical, mental, social and vocational ability, and full inclusion and participation in all aspects of life. To that end, States Parties shall organize, strengthen and extend comprehensive [[habilitation]] and [[physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services and programmes, particularly in the areas of health, [[employment]], [[education]] and [[social services]], in such a way that these services and programmes:
#Begin at the earliest possible stage, and are based on the [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] assessment of individual needs and strengths;
#Support participation and inclusion in the community and all aspects of society, are voluntary, and are available to persons with disabilities as close as possible to their own communities, including in rural areas.
#States Parties shall promote the development of initial and continuing training for professionals and staff working in habilitation and rehabilitation service.
#States Parties shall promote the availability, knowledge and use of [[assistive device]]s and technologies, designed for persons with disabilities, as they relate to habilitation and rehabilitation.

===Participation rights===
The Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities recognised that "disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others" and that "persons with disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society."

The Convention makes participation of the disabled one of its principles, stating "The principles of the present Convention shall be:...Full and effective participation and [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] in society", subsequently enshrining the right of disabled to participate fully and equally in the community, education, all aspect of life (in the context of habilitation and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]), political and public life, [[right to science and culture|cultural life]], leisure and sports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

States Parties should take appropriate measure such as:
#To enables persons with disabilities to have the opportunity to develop and utilize their creative, [[art]]istic and intellectual potential, not only for their own benefit, but also for the enrichment of society.
#In accordance with [[international law]], to ensure that law protecting intellectual property rights do not constitute an unreasonable or discriminatory barrier to access by persons with disabilities to cultural materials.
#So that persons with disabilities should be entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including [[sign languages]] and [[deaf culture]].

===Work and employment===
Article 27 requires that States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to work, on an equal basis of others; this includes the right to the opportunity to gain a living by work freely chosen or accepted in a [[labour market]] and work environment that is open, inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities. And that States Parties shall safeguard and promote the realization of the [[right to work]], including for those who acquire a disability during the course of employment, by taking appropriate steps, including through legislation, to inter alia:
#Prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability with regard to all matters concerning all forms of employment, continuance of employment, career advancement and safe and healthy working conditions;
#Protect the rights of persons with disabilities, on an equal basis with others, to [[decent work|just and favourable conditions of work]], including equal opportunities and [[equal pay for equal work|equal remuneration for work of equal value]], safe and healthy working conditions, including protection from [[harassment]], and the [[redress]] of grievances;
#Ensure that persons with disabilities are able to exercise their labour and [[trade union]] rights on an equal basis with others;
#Enable persons with disabilities to have effective access to general technical and vocational guidance programmes, placement services and [[vocational education|vocational]] and continuing training;
#Promote employment opportunities and career advancement for persons with disabilities in the labour market, as well as assistance in finding, obtaining, maintaining and returning to employment;
#Promote opportunities for [[self-employment]], [[entrepreneurship]], the development of cooperative and starting one's own business.
#Ensure that [[reasonable accommodation]] is provided to persons with disabilities in the [[wikt:Special:Search/workplace|workplace]].
#Promote the acquisition by persons with disabilities of work experience in the open [[labour market]].
#Promote vocational and professional rehabilitation, job retention and return-to-work programmes for persons with disabilities.

States Parties shall ensure that persons with disabilities are not held in slavery or in servitude, and are protected, on an equal basis with others, from [[unfree labour|forces or compulsory labour]].

===Adequate standard of living and social protection===
Article 28 requires that States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to an [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]] for themselves and their families, including [[right to food|adequate food]], [[right to clothing|clothing]] and [[right to housing|housing]], and to the continuous improvement of living conditions, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this rights without discrimination on the basis of disability.

States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to [[social security|social protection]] and to the enjoyment of that rights without discrimination on the basis of disability, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of the rights, including measures;
#To ensure equal access by persons with disabilities to clean water service, and to ensure access to appropriate and affordable service, [[assistive technology|device]] and other [[social assistance|assistance]] for disability-related needs.
#To ensure access by persons with disabilities, in particular women and girls with disabilities and older persons with disabilities, to social protection programmes and [[poverty reduction]] programmes.
#To ensure access by persons with disabilities and their families living in situations of poverty to assistance from the State with disability-related expenses, including adequate training, [[counselling]], financial assistance and respite care.
#To ensure access by persons with disabilities to [[public housing]] programmes.
#To ensure equal access by persons with disabilities to retirement benefits and programmes.

===Right to vote===
[[Image:topvoter2.jpg|thumb|400px|ISG TopVoter, a machine designed specifically to be used by voters with disabilities.]]
Article 29 requires that all Contracting States protect "the right of persons with disabilities to vote by [[secret ballot]] in [[elections]] and public [[referendums]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ron McCallum, 'Participating in Political and Public life' (2011) 32 ''AltLJ'' 80. http://www.altlj.org/news-and-views/opinion/92-participating-in-political-and-public-life&lt;/ref&gt; According to this provision, each Contracting State should provide for voting equipment which would enable disabled voters to vote independently and secretly. Some democracies, e.g., the US,  Japan, Netherlands, Slovenia, Albania or India allow disabled voters to use electronic [[voting machines]] or electronic aides which help disabled voters to fill the paper ballot. In others, among them Azerbaijan, Kosovo, Canada, Ghana, United Kingdom, and most of African and Asian countries, visually impaired voters can use ballots in [[Braille]] or paper ballot templates. Many of these and also some other democracies, Chile for example, use adjustable desks so that voters on wheelchairs can approach them. Some democracies only allow another person to cast a ballot for the blind or disabled voter. Such arrangement, however, does not assure secrecy of the ballot.

Article 29 also requires that Contracting States ensure "that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use." In some democracies, i.e. Sweden and the US, all the polling places already are fully accessible for disabled voters.

==Reservations==

A number of parties have made [[reservation (law)|reservations]] and interpretative declarations to their application of the Convention.&lt;ref name="reservations"&gt;https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Declarations and Reservations. UN Treaties Collection. Retrieved 2016-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] does not consider itself bound to stop forcibly medicating those labeled mentally ill when it is considered a last resort.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

[[El Salvador]] accepts the Convention to the extent that it is compatible with its constitution.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

[[Japan]] declares that paragraph 4 of Article 23 of the Convention is interpreted not to apply to a case where a child is separated from his or her parents as a result of deportation in accordance with its [[immigration law]].

[[Malta]] interprets the right to health in Article 25 of the Convention as not implying any right to [[abortion]].  It also reserves the right to continue to apply its own election laws around accessibility and assistance.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

[[Mauritius]] does not consider itself bound by the Article 11 obligation to take all necessary measures to protect people with disabilities during natural disasters, armed conflict or humanitarian emergencies, unless permitted by domestic legislation.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

The [[Netherlands]] interprets the right to life in Article 10 within the framework of its domestic laws.  It also interprets Article 25(f), which bars the discriminatory denial of health care, as permitting a person to refuse medical treatment, including food or fluids.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

[[Poland]] interprets Articles 23 and 25 as not conferring any right to abortion.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] has reservations relating to the right to education, immigration, service in the armed forces and an aspect of social security law.&lt;ref name="reservations"/&gt;

The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disabilities-op.htm  Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ], Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The text is based heavily on the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]].

The Optional Protocol entered into force with the Convention on 3 May 2008.&lt;ref name="Scoop-EiF"/&gt; As of October 2017, it has 92 signatories and 92 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en |title= UN Treaty Collection: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities==

The [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention. It initially consisted of 12 independent human rights experts, with half elected for a two-year term and half elected for four-years.&lt;ref name="Art34"&gt;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter members will be elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.  As the Convention has achieved 80 ratifications, the Committee will be expanded to 18 members.&lt;ref name="Art34"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">The '''Draft Fifth Company Law Directive''' (1972–1988) is a [[European Union]] proposal for a Directive, primarily aimed to implement a right of employees to vote for the [[boards of directors]] in large companies. The Directive went through 3 major revisions, but was never agreed to come into law by enough member states.

==History==
===1972 revision===
The first Draft Fifth Company Law Directive was issued in 1972
Proposed that companies must have two-tiered boards of directors and that companies of over 500 workers should appoint one third of members to a supervisory board.

{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

===1983 Revision===
In 1983, in an attempt to secure new agreement a further revision was released.&lt;ref&gt;OJ (C 240) 2&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of two tier board was abandoned and the threshold was raised to 1000 workers before codetermination would be required. It envisaged that either  board representation would be available for employees on a two or one tier board, or the option of another employee representative body that would receive a copy of all board materials.

{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

===1988 revision===
The next attempt at revising the Directive allowed for a third to a half representation.

The '''Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act''', or '''Public Act 453 of 1976''', prohibits [[discrimination]] in [[Michigan]] on the basis of "religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations.&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt;

The law is named for its two primary sponsors, [[Daisy Elliott]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Detroit]], and [[Melvin L. Larsen]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]], and passed in 1976 with 25 votes in the [[Michigan Senate]] and 79 votes in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="legalnews912"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.legalnews.com/oakland/1367237 |title= Legal Milestone Honors Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act |work= Oakland County Legal News |date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate= December 8, 2014 |last= Gubbins |first= Roberta M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by Michigan Governor [[William Milliken]] on January 13, 1977&lt;ref name="michbar812"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article2068.pdf |format= PDF |title= The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act: Celebrating the Progress of Michigan’s Civil Rights Laws |last= Bowron |first= Aaron K. |journal= Michigan Bar Journal |date= August 2012  |volume= 91 |issue= 8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went into effect on March 31, 1977.&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt;

== History ==
The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act was passed in 1976,&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt; signed into law by Michigan Governor [[William Milliken]] on January 13, 1977,&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt; and went into effect on March 31, 1977.&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt; It has been  amended directly or indirectly nearly 20 times.&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt;

=== Prior protections ===
In 1885, Michigan adopted the Public Act 130 of 1885, otherwise known as the Civil Rights Act, which stated “all persons within the jurisdiction of (the state) shall be entitled to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating-houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land and water, theatres, and all other places of public accommodation and amusement”.&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt;&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1885act130"&gt;{{cite act |title= Civil Rights Act |number= 130 |date= 1885 |article= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BlMyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Michigan+Public+Act+130+of+1885&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8i1y1lqkZT&amp;sig=EDNQYONZ7ynZ3q_pjRVg57vthJ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bo2GVOLxJoS1yAT7woG4Dw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Michigan%20Public%20Act%20130%20of%201885&amp;f=false |accessdate= December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ferguson v. Gies]]'' relied on the Civil Rights Act in holding the “separate but equal” doctrine unconstitutional under Michigan law, over 60 years before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. In 1927, the Civil Rights Act survived constitutional challenge in ''[[Bolden v. Grand Rapids Operating Corporation]]''.&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt;

In the years following ''Bolden v. Grand Rapids Operating Corporation'', Michigan passed additional civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment. The progression of the state’s laws reached a new pinnacle when civil rights were given constitutional status in Michigan's Constitution of 1963, which also resulted in the formation of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission.&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt;

=== Passage ===
After attempting in 1966 to pass a Michigan version of the federal civil rights law that was adopted in 1964, Michigan State Representative [[Daisy Elliott]] was told by the leadership of her political party, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], that her measure would never pass unless she found a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to co-sponsor it. After being newly elected, Michigan State Representative [[Melvin L. Larsen]], a Republican from [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]], indicated in 1973 that he would co-sponsor the law. Larsen served on the Michigan House of Representatives civil rights committee that would hold hearings and vote on the proposed legislation. Larsen has stated that his Catholic faith and experience as a principal, athletic director, football coach and instructor at one of the Pontiac Catholic schools was what motivated him to support anti-discrimination measures.&lt;ref name="mlive1114"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2014/11/tim_skubick_who_is_elliott_and.html |title= Who is Elliott and Who is Larsen? Groundbreakers, That's Who |work= MLive |publisher= [[Booth Newspapers]] |date= November 23, 2014 |accessdate= December 9, 2014 |last= Skubick |first= Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was modeled on prior state civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and housing but considerably extended the reach of their application and broadened the forms of discrimination prohibited.&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt;

When proposed by Elliott and Larsen in 1973, the legislation faced opposition from the [[disability|disabled]] (referred to as "handicappers" at the time) and [[LGBT]] communities because it did not include protections for members of those communities. Elliott and Larsen indicated that the legislation was meant to focus on the [[African American]] community.&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mlive1114" /&gt; When the bill passed three years later, it was believed that adding "sexual orientation" would prevent the bill from passing, so it was left out. Elliott and Larsen made the decision to proceed with the final bill after Elliott offered to add Larsen's name to the bill and consulted him on the final effort to pass the bill in 1976.&lt;ref name="mlive1114" /&gt; Most issues raised by the disabled community were also addressed in 1976 with the passage of the Michigan’s [[Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt;

It passed with 25 votes in the [[Michigan Senate]] and 79 votes in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]],&lt;ref name="legalnews912"/&gt; and was signed into law by Governor [[William Milliken]] on January 13, 1977.&lt;ref name="michbar812" /&gt; The law went into effect on March 31, 1977.&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt;

=== Effort to add protections for LGBT people ===
As early as the 1973 committee hearing on the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, members of the [[LGBT]] community in Michigan sought to be included in the law.&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mlive1114" /&gt; In 1983, Republican state representative [[Jim Dressel]] co-sponsored House Bill 5000, which would have added "sexual orientation" to the list of protected characteristics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindstrom|first1=John|title=Remembering A Pioneering Moment In Gay Rights In The Legislature|url=http://www.gongwer.com/programming/blogindex.cfm?postid=6001#sthash.9r4Nizfs.CHo9isH7.dpbs|website=Gongwer Michigan|date=March 2013|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressel – who later came out as gay – was defeated for re-election the following year. Michigan's first openly LGBT state legislator, [[Chris Kolb]], included such a change in two other pro-LGBT bills&lt;ref name="btl205"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=11947 |title= Pro-LGBT Bills to Be Introduced, Kolb Seeking Co-Sponsors |work= [[Between the Lines (newspaper)|Between The Lines]] |date= February 24, 2005 |accessdate= December 9, 2014 |last= Wolfe |first= Dawn |location= Livonia, MI&lt;!--publication location, not article dateline location!--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;—none of which passed.&lt;ref name="midaily206"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.michigandaily.com/content/once-promising-kolbs-lgbt-bills-fizzle | title= Once Promising, Kolb's LGBT Bills Fizzle |work= [[The Michigan Daily]] |location= [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor |date= February 14, 2006 |accessdate= December 9, 2014 |last= Miller |first= Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then a number of additional bills have been introduced to add protections for the LGBT community. Most recently, a bill to add [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], and [[gender expression]] was introduced by State Representative [[Sam Singh]] in 2014. Another bill which only included sexual orientation was also introduced by State Representative [[Frank Foster (Michigan politician)|Frank Foster]], but did not receive support from the LGBT community or progressives as the bill left out members of the [[transgender]] community and did not adequately protect [[lesbian]], [[gay]], or [[bisexual]] people from discrimination.&lt;ref name="advocate1114"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.advocate.com/politics/2014/11/12/could-michigan-pass-gay-only-nondiscrimination-bill |title= Could Michigan Pass a Gay-Only Nondiscrimination Bill? |work= [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date= November 12, 2014 |accessdate= December 9, 2014 |last= Brydum |first= Sunnivie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills received a hearing before the Michigan House Commerce Committee, but neither bill received a committee vote.&lt;ref name="mlive1214"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2014/12/historic_hearing_on_gay_rights.html |title='Historic' Gay Rights Hearing Ends Without Vote on Michigan Anti-Discrimination Proposals |work= MLive |publisher= Booth Newspapers |date= December 3, 2014 |accessdate= December 9, 2014 |last= Oosting |first= Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amendments ==
The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act has been amended directly or indirectly nearly 20 times&lt;ref name="elcra-txt" /&gt; to refine the law, its enforcement, and add protections for groups or classifications not originally named in the act such as height and weight. Most recently in 2009, Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] signed Public Act 190 of 2009, an amendment that increased employment protections for pregnant workers.&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt;

== Honors and recognition ==
The [[State Bar of Michigan]] recognized the law at the 37th Legal Milestone dedication on August 28, 2012, at the [[Michigan State Capitol]] in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].&lt;ref name="legalnews912" /&gt;

'''''Ex aequo et bono''''' ([[Latin]] for "according to the right and good" or "from equity and conscience") is a [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin phrase]] that is used as a legal [[technical terminology|term of art]]. In the context of [[arbitration]], it refers to the power of arbitrators to dispense with consideration of the law but consider solely what they consider to be fair and equitable in the case at hand.

Article 38(2) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) provides that the court may decide cases ''ex aequo et bono'' only if the parties agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0 |title=Statute of the Court |publisher=International Court of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the ICJ decided a case using "equitable criteria" in creating a boundary in the Gulf of Maine for Canada and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/67/067-19841012-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf |title=Case concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=October 12, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 33 of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]]'s Arbitration Rules (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/arb-rules/arb-rules.pdf |title=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules |publisher=United Nations Commission on International Trade Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that the arbitrators shall consider only the applicable law unless the arbitral agreement allows the arbitrators to consider ''ex aequo et bono'', or [[amiable compositeur]], instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.arbitration.rules.1976/33.html |title=Article 33 – Applicable law, amiable compositeur |work=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is also expressed in many national and subnational arbitration laws such as section 22 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW).

On the other hand, the constituent treaty of the Eritrea–Ethiopia Claims Commission explicitly forbids the body from interpreting ''ex aequo et bono''.

==Ex aequo==
The phrase '''''ex aequo''''' (without ''et bono'') is used to mean "equally placed", often in the context of competition winners.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' (1998). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=PA561 "ex aequo"], p. 561. {{ISBN|8186062254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:hand.jpg|thumb|500px|right]]

In [[Germany]], family law was one of the first areas to establish the thought of [[mediation]], and still is the main field of application of mediation.&lt;ref&gt;[Weiler, Eva und Schlickum, Gunter. Praxisbuch Mediation. München, 2008 p. 45]&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts in [[Family law|Family Law]] are characterized by a high rate of personal conflicts.
A possible definition of conflict might be:

''Conflict means … the perceived differences of interests or the conviction that the actual aspirations of the parties can no be received at the same time.''&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 119]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basis for personal disputes is the fact that conflicting parties don't come to their own in their [[personal relationship]]s. After various intents of solving the problems on their own or setting an end to the dispute, the last chance is to get help by a third person. Some hope for an improvement of their  marriage by [[marriage counseling]], but in most cases without success. Others try to solve their conflicts by law and hand in a [[lawsuit]]. After reviewing this lawsuit, the judge can suggest to consult a mediator, if reasonable.

There are various constellations of conducting the mediation process. [[Divorce]]s can be regulated by court. Related issues, like [[child support]], [[visitation rights]] or household goods can be resolved by mediation. It is also possible to try to solve all controversies in the  mediation process. In this case, the parties can plead for abating legal proceedings. The employed lawyers can recommend a mediator and at the same time can be [[legal aid]] during the mediation process.

The mediator, as against the consulting lawyer, deals with concerns and interests of both parties. 
The mediator is not suggested or determined by one party alone. This could lead to unwanted disputes or affect the mediation procedure, because one party could feel disadvantaged. 
Whether choosing mediation or not is the parties decision. If they decide to conduct the mediation process, but can't agree as intended, it is not of their disadvantage. The still can go back to the legal process and continue the lawsuit, or file a new one.

==Principles of family mediation==

===Extrajudicial proceeding===

At the beginning, the mediation process was known as an extrajudicial proceeding and was introduced as an alternative to the classical lawsuit. In the meantime, more and more mediations are offered in court. They are conducted by a so-called “judge-mediator” after the commencement of proceedings. The number of judges with this additional qualification is not very high, but it is increasing. This development leads to a change in the point of view of mediations. They are no longer seen as alternative to lawsuits, but are regarded as possible element of the [[litigation]]. There is no longer competition between the legal process and the mediation process, but addition.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntariness===

It is the marriage partners' decision whether to conduct a mediation process or not, even if it is recommended by court. There is no constraint to take part in the mediation. All parties, also the mediator, are having the right to end the mediation process. So there is no obligation to bring the process to an agreement, exiting the process is possible at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrality===

It is the mediator's obligation to be a neutral facilitator. He arbitrates and serves the parties equally under the precondition that he is absolutely neutral and impartial. He does not favorite one site and needs to treat both parties equally. It would be useful for the mediator not knowing the disputing parties, to prevent preferences, discrimination or personal influences on the decision. The confidence of both parties towards to mediator of great importance for a successful cooperation. If a party is not sure whether the mediator is neutral or not, it is best to continue the mediation process with another mediator.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 63/64]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of decision-making power===

The above-mentioned criteria of [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] and [[impartiality]] are also concerning judges. So where is the difference to a mediator? The mediator's essential characteristic is not having any decision-making power in a legal sense. He can support the parties finding a solution and guide them to the right way. At the end of the mediation process, he can make a written agreement, to which the parties must uphold. He needs to fulfill the formalities given for such an agreement. To become legally valid, the agreement needs to be recorded by Family Court or notarially certified.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality===

To protect the parties, the mediation process is confidential. When both parties are sure that their information is not made public and is protected against [[malpractice]], they are able to solve the conflict more open. They can be sure that problems that were discussed stay within the mediation group. If the mediation fails, the principle of confidentiality is of high importance, because parties can be sure that, if it comes to a lawsuit, information revealed in the mediation process can not be used against them. This applies for the participating parties as well as for the mediator. Information given by the parties in one-to-one conversations with the mediator also come under the non-disclosure obligation. He is not allowed to reveal it to the other party, except he obtains the permission of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The process of family mediation==

The mediator passes through a process with the parties that is divided into '''five phases''':&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 1: Initiation of mediation process ===

At the beginning the mediator has to comment his mission and function, so that the parties cannot be disappointed during the process. After this discussion, it must be settled if the existent problem of the parties can be answered by a mediation process. At the end of this phase a mediation contract is signed, which contains among other things rights and obligations of the mediator and the parties ([http://www.hannover-mediation.com/pages/vertrag-muster.php modal contract ]). The meaning of the contract is to lay a code of behavior, on which the involved must be keeping with.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 2: Theme collection ===
With the second phase starts the real [[conflict management]]. The extent of the conflict will be made clear and the points which are treating over the process are listed in detail. This way the mediator receives an overview about the dimension and is able to create a plan.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 86/87]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 3: Resolve the interests ===
This phase is the most important chapter of the mediation process. It is basic to deal explicitly with the conflicts. In this phase the parties must reveal their problems and voice their interests, to find the optimal problem-solving approach. If wishes or demands are not communicated at this, it will be difficult to involve those afterwards in the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 4: Options and solutions ===
After collecting the interests they can be search for common solution options. The different ideas will be collect and afterwards evaluated together. The ideas can be collected in different ways, for example by [[brainstorming]]. A solution concept will be designed in this phase and that will be developed in the last phase.&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 87/88]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase 5: The finish ===
At the end of the mediation, the solution concept from phase 4 will be a phrased into [[binding agreement]]. The agreement can be discussed with a  consultant lawyer. This way the parties can be sure that they have made a decision which is legally correct. The contract is an obligatory agreement. It needs to be validated, for example by [[Notarized|notarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[Gläßer, Ulla (Hrsg., Maihofer, Werner, Sprenger, Gerhard und Brugger, Winfried). Mediation und Beziehungsgewalt. Bd. 44. Baden-Baden, 2008 p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of family mediation in comparison to litigation==

There is no categorization in wrong or false. No party will be inculpated to be wrong or to have made mistakes in the past. The conflicts are reviewed, but with a forward-looking view to find the best solution the two parties. An advantage of mediation is, that the problems are not [[Delegation|delegated]], the parties try to solve the conflict themselves. This course might take longer, but after all the parties came as opponents to the mediation process and not as friends. In most cases, the idea of solving the problem wins after some time. Due to the voluntariness of the mediation process, a high commitment of the two parties is to be estimated. A positive attitude is thereby part of the course because the parties can agree in peace. Both parties must agree to the arrangement and need to implement the changes in the future. Furthermore, the mediation should encourage friendly contact between the parties after the mediation process.  Mediation shall be an impulse to advance the attitude in the future. So  the involved can easily stick to the bargain.

The mediation isn't a judicial action, but for all that the law will be included.&lt;ref&gt;[Mähler/Mähler (Hrsg., Haft, Fritjof und von Schlieffen, Katharina). Handbuch Mediation – Verhandlungstechnik Strategien Einsatzgebiete. Bd. 2. München, 2009 p. 482]&lt;/ref&gt; Admittedly not with the application of laws but only with the use of them. That means that mediation should be seen as law clarification. The purpose is to represent the three following points, without applying the law:
* Consultation about the legal position: The legal situation will be explained, and how a possible lawsuit would end.
* Decision-making: The legal options will be explained to the parties and they will be encouraged to represent their own interests.
* Form of contract: The parties are shown how the bilateral agreement is transferred into a contract, what legal consequences there are, and which formal requirements are essential.&lt;ref&gt;[Mähler/Mähler (Hrsg., Haft, Fritjof und von Schlieffen, Katharina). Handbuch Mediation – Verhandlungstechnik Strategien Einsatzgebiete. Bd. 2. München, 2009 p. 483]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of the family mediation in comparison to a lawsuit is the command of openness. The disputing parties are obliged to reveal all necessary facts and information. If any documents are revealed after the end of the mediation process, the agreement can be invalid. In some cases the statutory offense of [[fraud]] is given.
Another advantage of family mediation is the time. A lawsuit often takes several years, depending on the number of instances. The mediation process takes only several months depending on the type of conflict and the commitment of the disputing parties. 
Another advantage results from the time saving. The mediation process is less expensive. The mediator claims of course a charge, but this doesn’t overrun the court costs.&lt;ref&gt;[Erlenmeyer, Hans und Hangebrauck, Ralf. Mediation. Altenberge, 2008 p. 93/94]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5347">The fees due at the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) in relation to a European patent application are laid out in the Rules relating to Fees of 20 October 1977, as adopted by decision of the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]] of 7 December 2006 and as last amended by decision of the Administrative Council of 13 December 2017.

== Renewal fees ==
{{Main|Maintenance fees (patent)}}
Renewal fees are payable to the EPO in respect of pending European patent applications in respect of the third year from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|86|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fees are paid in advance of the year in which they are due (such that the renewal fee for the third year falls due two years from the date of filing) and fall due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|51}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|37}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due, except for the renewal fee in respect of the third year which may not be paid more than six months before it falls due.&lt;ref name="EPO-Guid-a-x-5.2.4"&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|a|x|5|2|4}}, "Renewal fees". (Reflecting the changes to {{EPC Rule|51|1}} as of April 1, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

If a renewal fee for a European patent application is not paid in due time, the renewal fee may still be validly paid within six months of the due date, provided that the additional fee provided by {{EPC Rule|51|2}} is also paid within the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|51|2}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|37|2}})&lt;/ref&gt; For the calculation of the six-month additional period, the so-called ''de ultimo ad ultimo'' rule is applied by the EPO.&lt;ref name="EPO-Guid-a-x-5.2.4"/&gt; According to this rule, the six-month period runs "from the last day of the month to the last day of the month".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j910004ep1.html Decision J4/91 of October 22, 1991], Legal [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Board of Appeal]] 3.1.1 of the European Patent Office. Published in [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|OJ]] 8/1992, 402.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a renewal fee was due in February 2004, the additional fee fell due on August 31, 2004 (Tuesday), i.e. six months from the end of February 2004.

The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|86|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, renewal fees are payable to the national offices of the EPC Contracting States in which the European patent is brought into effect. Each Contracting State then pays the [[European Patent Organisation]] a proportion of each renewal fee received for a European patent in that State.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whereas for a pending European patent application an applicant must pay a single maintenance fee at the EPO, it may be much more costly to pay several maintenance fees to the several national patent offices for maintaining a granted European patent in a number of countries. This however depends on the number of countries in which the patent proprietor wants to maintain its European patent into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/articl2.html Article 2.1(4) RFees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/vi/index.htm|title=Payment of renewal fees for European patents|work=National Law relating to EPC|publisher=European Patent Office (EPO)|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refund ==
Under certain circumstances, such as following the withdrawal of a European patent application or the withdrawal of an [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|appeal]], some fees that were paid may be refunded. This is true for search fees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/articl9.html Article 9 RFees]&lt;/ref&gt; the examination fee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/articl11.html Article 11 RFees]&lt;/ref&gt; and the appeal fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fee structure==
The fee structure "does not necessarily reflect the actual workload imposed on the EPO in any individual case. Rather, legislators have chosen [[lump sum]]s as fees that are for example independent of the number of auxiliary requests to be decided or the days allowed for conducting oral proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |opinion=Decision T 2017/12 |pinpoint=Reasons 2 |court=Board of Appeal of the EPO 3.5.06 |date=24 February 2014 |url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t122017ex1.html |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11418">The '''Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act''' ('''GPS Act'''), was a [[Bill (law)|bill]] introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2011 that attempted to limit government surveillance using [[geolocation]] information such as signals from [[global positioning system|GPS]] systems in [[mobile device]]s. The bill was sponsored by Sen. [[Ron Wyden]] and Rep. [[Jason Chaffetz]].&lt;ref name=wyden-press-release&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ron|title=Wyden, Chaffetz Introduce GPS Act|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=0b8d693f-7cab-4ba4-aae6-42b66b1eef0e|work=wyden.senate.gov |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its initial proposal in June 2011, the GPS Act awaits consideration by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] as well as the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House]].

According to its proponents, the GPS Act sets forth "a legal framework designed to give government agencies, commercial entities and private citizens clear guidelines for when and how geolocation information can be accessed and used."&lt;ref name=wyden-press-release/&gt; Advocates drafted the bill to address controversies surrounding  prior incidents in which police had attached [[GPS navigation device|GPS devices]] to suspects' vehicles without [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] and to set a legal precedent for such tracking in the future.&lt;ref name=Pineda-Moreno-cnn&gt;{{cite news |title=Court allows agents to secretly put GPS trackers on cars |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-27/justice/oregon.gps.surveillance_1_gps-device-appeals-chief-judge-alex-kozinski?_s=PM:CRIME |work=articles.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 November 2011 |date=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106103145/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-27/justice/oregon.gps.surveillance_1_gps-device-appeals-chief-judge-alex-kozinski?_s=PM%3ACRIME |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-busted&gt;{{cite news|last=Zetter|first=Kim|title=Busted!

==History==
Current legislation surrounding the issue of tracking an individual's location has proven legally ambiguous and technically outdated. To date, primary precedent draws from the 1983 ruling of ''[[United States v. Knotts]]'' (1983) and the contentious [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] of 1986. In that case the court ruled that electronic "[[Pager|beepers]]" could be fairly used to track a suspect's vehicle without warrant because the suspect in that case had willingly taken the device that was used to track them.&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=460&amp;invol=276&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] delivered the majority opinion that the monitoring of such "beeper" devices did not invade any individual's "legitimate [[expectation of privacy]]". As a person traveling on public streets is visible to the naked eye, the practice was thus upheld as neither a "search" nor a "seizure" under [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] definitions.&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"/&gt;

=== ''United States v. Jones'' ===
{{main|United States v. Jones (2012)}}
One notable incident of warrantless [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] in 2005 led to ''[[United States v. Jones (2012)|United States v. Jones]]'', decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In ''Jones'' the police obtained a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to attach a GPS device to the underside of the defendant's car but then violated the warrant's scope in both geography and in length of time.

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) defended the police's actions by contending that a warrant was unnecessary in the first place. It pointed to a two-decade precedent of warrantless GPS tracking. [[Roger L. Easton]], the principal inventor of modern GPS technology, filed an [[amicus brief]] urging the court to renounce the DOJ's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/gps-inventor-surveillance/ Roger L. Easton Urges Court to Reject Warrantless Tracking&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] argued that an individual has "no reasonable expectation of privacy" in his or her movements around public streets, and that legislation requiring certain standards for warrants would "severely impede" law enforcement officials in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/04/gpspetition.pdf | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[oral argument]], Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] suggested that legislatures could create restraints on law enforcement officers that would prevent such tracking.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking /&gt;

The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that the attachment of a GPS device on a vehicle and its monitoring, even on public streets, constituted a search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. However, only four of the justices argued that the search violated reasonable expectations of privacy while the other five rested their conclusion on other grounds. The GPS Act would effectively endorse the minority's position and establish that geolocational searches are presumptively unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784174374/EA24A9D27B574AEAPQ/1?accountid=14496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucelinks.cdlib.org"&gt;http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aibss&amp;atitle=Collect+it+all%3A+national+security%2C+Big+Data+and+governance&amp;title=GeoJournal&amp;issn=03432521&amp;date=2015-07-01&amp;volume=80&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=519&amp;au=Crampton%2C+Jeremy+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=GeoJournal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10708-014-9598-y&lt;/ref&gt; However, this ruling does not provide full protection from geolocational tracking methods, such as those used by telecommunication companies who reserve the right to collect geolocational information.&lt;ref name="ucelinks.cdlib.org"/&gt;

== Contents ==
If passed, the GPS Act would require [[probable cause]] and an accompanying warrant before government agencies could obtain private geolocational information on an individual, either through a mobile device or by the placement of a tracking bug. Taking a strong stance on [[consumer rights]], the bill would further forbid private businesses from sharing customer location data without explicit consent of the individual. The bill would cover [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] data as well as previously acquired historical location data.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/06/GPS-Bill-Text.pdf | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has set forth certain exceptions under which the acquisition of private tracking data by private or public entities would not be unlawful:&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt;
* As a response to theft, and for the purpose of tracking [[Possession of stolen goods|stolen merchandise]]
* As a personal safety net for children, as set forth by a parent or legal guardian
* In the case of emergency, where the individual has either personally requested assistance or is in known peril
* When the tracking information in question has been publicly broadcast

==Reception==

=== Support ===
The bill was initially co-sponsored by [[Bob Goodlatte]] (R-VA), Chairman of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet|House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet]]. Since the bill's introduction, six other members of the House, as well as Senator [[Mark Kirk]] (R-IL). have signed on as co-sponsors.

The bill has also gained support from a variety of civil liberties organizations including the [[ACLU]], [[CCIA]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], [http://digitalliberty.net/ Digital Liberty Organization], and [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name=wyden-gps&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ron|title=Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance ("GPS") Act|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332|work=Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance (“GPS”) Act|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar bills include one written by Senate Judiciary Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT), who aims to require a warrant to obtain GPS data from companies, and one by senators [[Al Franken]]  (D-MN) and [[Richard Blumenthal]] (D-CT), who would require device manufacturers to receive explicit consent from the end-user before tracking their location.&lt;ref name=nat-journal-gps-court&gt;{{cite web |last=Jerome |first=Sara |title=Supreme Court to Hear GPS Surveillance Case |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/supreme-court-to-hear-gps-surveillance-case-20111107 |work=nationaljournal.com |publisher=National Journal |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116094020/http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/supreme-court-to-hear-gps-surveillance-case-20111107 |archivedate=16 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her concurrence in ''[[United States v. Antoine Jones|U.S. v Jones]]'', Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] warned that the administration's defense of warrantless GPS tracking, if upheld, would allow federal agencies to track individuals through any cellular device, as law enforcement groups can also intercept signals the phones emit.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking /&gt;

===Opposition===
The [[Obama Administration]] has expressed potential opposition to the GPS Act based on the belief that GPS tracking is no more invasive than visual surveillance.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking&gt;{{cite news|last=Stohr|first=Greg|title=Police Use of Global-Positioning Devices Questioned by U.S. Supreme Court|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-08/police-use-of-global-positioning-devices-questioned-by-u-s-supreme-court.html|work=bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''German air passenger taxes''' are [[excise]] duties and other charges levied by the German government on most passengers departing by air, either in addition to the price of the airline ticket or incorporated into the ticket price.

==Ecological departure tax==
A [[departure tax]] is to apply for all departures starting from 1 January 2011. The amount depends on the destination country; the following table shows the minimum payable (agents may charge tax handling costs).

'''Good Epidemiological Practices'''  or '''Good Epidemiology Practices''' ('''GEP''') was a set of guidelines produced by the U.S. [[Chemical Manufacturers Association]] (CMA) in 1991 to improve [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] research practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guidelines for Good Epidemiology Practices for Occupational and Environmental Epidemiologic Research. The Chemical Manufacturers Association's Epidemiology Task Group. |journal=J Occup Med. |date=December 1991 |volume=33|issue=12|pages=1221–9|pmid= 1800677}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then adopted by the [[tobacco industry]] around 1993 as part of its "sound science" program to counter criticisms of the industry on health and environmental issues such as [[Passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].&lt;ref name="ong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constructing "Sound Science" and "Good Epidemiology": Tobacco, Lawyers, and Public Relations Firms |journal=Am J Public Health|date=November 2001 |volume=91|issue=11|pages=1749–57|pmid=11684593 |pmc=1446868 |authors= Ong EK, Glantz SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It failed to make much impact on the US and European regulators, but may have had more influence in its later manifestations in Asia and particularly China.

The complexities of creating Good Epidemiological Practices developments have been examined by University of San Francisco researchers [[Stanton Glantz]] and [[Elisa K. Ong]] in papers such as "Tobacco Industry Efforts to Subvert the IARC's Second hand smoke study" published in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)02098-5/fulltext |journal=Lancet |date=8 April 2000 |volume=355|issue=9211|pages=1253–9|title=Tobacco industry efforts subverting International Agency for Research on Cancer's second-hand smoke study|authors=Ong EK, Glantz SA |pmid=10770318 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02098-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that these were industry programs designed to manipulate the scientific standards of proof, and an attempt to set risk-evaluation standards that could be forced through by legislation, and imposed on the agencies ([[EPA]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], etc.) to hamstring the agencies' ability to regulate.&lt;ref name="ong"/&gt;

==Tobacco's GEP==
In February 1993, an executive of [[Philip Morris USA]], Ellen Merlo, wrote a memo to her CEO William Campbell outlining their strategies to discredit the 1992 report by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) that identified secondhand smoke as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group A human carcinogen]], and to counter what she described as "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="ong"/&gt;  Their public relations firm, APCO Associates, launched a "sound science" coalition in the United States, and [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC) was formed three months later in May 1993, with [[Garrey Carruthers]] the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/19/ethicalliving.g2 |title=The denial industry |first=George |last=Monbiot |date=September 19, 2006 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvIZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Our Daily Poison: From Pesticides to Packaging, How Chemicals Have Contaminated the Food Chain and Are Making Us Sick|first=Marie-Monique |last=Robin |pages=138&amp;ndash;140 |publisher=The New Press |date=9 December 2014 |isbn=9781595589309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George L. Carlo]], a science entrepreneur who worked with [[Federal Focus]] Inc., prepared one of the early draft documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qgjm0128|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu |date=May 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/lxjm0128|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu |date=June 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the legislative{{which|date=March 2018}} and public activist{{who|date=March 2018}} attacks on the tobacco industry had escalated, and they{{who|date=March 2018}} blamed this on the "twisted science" used by the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qpfx0005|title=Statements by EPA|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Europe the UN's [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) was about to release a similar report, which the tobacco industry also needed to counter.

Helmut Reif, [[Thomas Borelli|Tom Borelli]] and Mitch Ritter at Philip Morris's Science &amp; Technology division thought the CMA's GEP could be improved to help PM develop standards for secondhand smoke epidemiological studies. This initiative to "constructively improve" epidemiology would enlist the assistance of the industry's consultants, and they could then run an "offensive strategy"—essentially another proactive effort by the industry to shape the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/frbb0120|title=Industry Documents Library|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu|date=March 17, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/pmgx0111|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=March 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanna Sullivan, Philip Morris's main PR in Europe, advised her American superiors{{who|date=March 2018}} (June 1994) on how GEP might be used to combat the IARC's report, since this would give United Nations weight to the claim that second-hand smoke was potentially cancerous to non-smokers.  By establishing the standards of epidemiology and by using their influence in Congress to have GEP mandated by legislation, they hoped to design a set of established procedural standards for epidemiology.

The innovation here, was that they{{who|date=March 2018}} aimed to attack the techniques relied on by the EPA and IARC scientists. In the past, they{{who|date=March 2018}} had focussed attacks on specific adverse scientific findings and reports. GEP was designed to directed an attack on the techniques of epidemiology itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/gzwb0003|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=June 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They{{who|date=March 2018}} may have had little hope that this would be widely accepted by the majority of epidemiologists or by the regulators{{which|date=March 2018}}, but it made possible a vigorous public relations campaign in the media to challenge and denigrate any adverse findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qnmj0115|title=Industry Documents Library|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu|date=June 16, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panels and Conferences===
Initially Philip Morris utilised a small panel of trusted epidemiologists{{who|date=March 2018}} who regularly serviced the industry when it needed to defend against some adverse finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/jgjm0052|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=August 1, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were requested to improve on the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's GEP. Later they extended this mandate by conducting seminars on GEP and good risk-assessment practice around the world{{where|date=March 2018}}.  The tobacco industry itself needed to remain invisible and so they needed the front provided by third-party think-tanks and old allies.

The main organisation hired to run the GEP program was [[Federal Focus]] Inc., a PR company set up during the second term of the [[Reagan Administration]] by two top Agency officials, [[Thorne Auchter]], who had been the Director of the OSHA (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration) and [[James J. Tozzi]] who had been Reagan's "Deregulation Czar" as head of the OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs), at the OMB (Office of Management &amp; Budget). These two and the head of the EPA ([[Anne Gorsuch Burford]]) were among the 20 or so top Agency executives forced (or encouraged) to resign over Reagan's regulatory scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/kmvv0175|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=December 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Tozzi's technique at the OIRA was to block regulators{{which|date=March 2018}} from regulating by denying their agencies funding unless they cancelled one regulation before adding another. (Tozzi and Auchter also ran [[Multinational Business Services]], and the [[Institute for Regulatory Policy]]).

The main tobacco law firm, Covington &amp; Burling (C&amp;B) was also involved both in promoting the idea and in recruiting scientists{{who|date=March 2018}} willing to participate, usually only when assured that payment would be laundered through the law firm.  C&amp;B lawyer [[John Rupp]] initiated similar activities in Italy and Germany. The total expenses for this program in 1997 were about $300,000.

The GEP program "experts" that Auchter and Tozzi enlisted were pre-screened by Philip Morris Issues Managers and Federal Focus, and the results they produced were pre-tested at a number of conferences (which often didn't carry the GEP name). The first, known as the Lansdowne Conference, was held at a US conference center with only a few of their most trusted scientist helpers. They then widened the advisory pool and held a [[London Conference]] where Philip Morris opened the operation to British-American Tobacco and the other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hlvc0056|title=Industry Documents Library: Appendix Table A-5|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established what became known as the London Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hhdy0090|title=Principles for Evaluating Epidemiologic Data in Regulatory Risk Assessment|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A German conference soon followed.

Generally GEP failed to influence policy makers in America and Europe{{where|date=March 2018}}, so it was tried in Asia through conferences of the Asian [[WhiteCoats]] group (collectively known as 'ARTIST') and with other recruits in Kuala Lumpur, Hong-Kong, Yokohama,  Beijing, and then Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hjhh0049|title=International Workshop on Risk Assessment and Good Epidemiological Practices|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qjjv0123|title=Quality Assurance on in Epidemology |author=Robert Walk|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu |date=January 6, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Home Insurance Co. v. Dick''''', 281 U.S. 397 (1930),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Home Insurance Co. v. Dick|281|397|1930}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest [[Conflict of laws in the United States|conflict of laws]] cases in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[U.S. Constitution]] imposes certain limitations on the ability of states to apply their own law to events occurring in other states.

==Facts==
In this case, C. J. Dick was a resident of [[Texas]], but was living in [[Mexico]], where he was operating a [[tugboat]] for a Mexican company. The tugboat was lost in a fire, and Dick  returned to Texas to file a [[lawsuit]] against two [[New York (state)|New York]]-based [[reinsurer]]s of the Mexican [[corporation]] that owned the boat. Later analysts have questioned whether the true facts of the case were really before the courts as it reached various levels of appeal:

{{quotation|''Dick'' arose when a boat burned in Mexico. By the way, this may be the only hard fact in the case. By the time Dick reached the Supreme. Court, the facts as stated in Justice Brandeis's opinion were substantially, well, notional. But the important thing is what Justice Brandeis ''thought'' he was deciding.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Weinberg, Unlikely Beginnings of Modern Constitutional Thought, 15 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 291, 303 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Home Insurance Co. sought to dismiss the suit because Dick had waited more than a year to file the lawsuit, and a clause in the Home Insurance Co. insurance contract required that any action against it had to be brought within a year of the injury. Although this provision was valid under Mexican law, the Texas courts applied a Texas state law which deemed such clauses invalid unless they provided at least two years for the claimant to file a lawsuit.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court, in a unanimous opinion by Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]], held that the state of Texas has no power to affect contracts made outside the state, and having no relation to anything done or to be done within the state. The state therefore could not constitutionally apply its own rule invalidating contract clauses that required any statute of limitations under two years to a contract that had no relation to Texas beyond the fact that the plaintiff was a Texas resident. These contacts were insufficient to satisfy the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

The Supreme Court also rejected a number of defenses raised by Dick. First, the Court rejected claims that the state of Texas had a [[public policy]] interest in the outcome of the case, noting that Home Insurance Co. was basically dragged into the Texas courts against its will, and for a matter that did not involve an injury occurring in Texas or a party insured in Texas.

Second, the Court rejected the argument that it lacked [[subject matter jurisdiction]] for want of a [[federal question]] over a matter of local law. The Court rejected this argument because the case did not involve a local interpretation of the contract, but application of a law external to the contract itself.

Finally Dick contended that the Constitution does not require states to recognize laws of foreign countries. The court rejected this argument because the appeal raised a due process claim, not a claim under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]. The court noted that due process applies to [[Alien (law)|aliens]], and in any case that the defendant here was a New York company.

==Later developments==
The doctrine thereafter continued to steadily develop in a series of cases over the following decades. Within a few decades after the decision, the Supreme Court had also enunciated doctrines that would largely foreclose [[personal jurisdiction]] over the defendant in cases such as this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16488">{{Politics of the Isle of Man}}

The '''Isle of Man Government''' ({{lang-gv|Reiltys Ellan Vannin}}) is the [[government]] of the [[Isle of Man]]. The formal head of the Isle of Man Government is the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]], representing [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Lord of Mann]]. The executive head is the [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man|Chief Minister]].

[[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], the largest town on the Isle of Man, is its [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[seat of government]], where most Government offices and the parliament chambers ([[Tynwald]]) are located.

The Civil Service has more than 2,000 employees and the total number of public sector employees including the Civil Service, teachers, nurses, police, etc. is about 9,000. This is somewhat more than 10% of the population of the Island, and a full 23% of the working population. This does not include any [[military]] forces, as defence is the constitutional responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Government structure==
The Government consists of 7 departments, 9 statutory boards, 5 offices, and 9 other quasi-independent agencies (Public Lottery Trust, Manx Heritage Foundation, Arts Council, Sports Council, Swimming Pool Authorities, Local Government, Planning Authority, Health and Safety Executive Authority, Road Transport and Licensing Committee) all reporting to the [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|Council of Ministers]]. The departments all report directly to the Council of Ministers.

==Brief history==

===Lieutenant Governor===
Before modern times the government of the Isle of Man was in the hands of the Governor (or [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]]), who was the representative of the Lord of Man, assisted by his Council, consisting of the other permanent officials (the Bishop, Archdeacon, Deemsters, Attorney General, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry for the Isle of Man, 1792&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council evolved into the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]], the upper chamber of [[Tynwald]], the parliament of the Isle of Man.

After the [[Revestment (Isle of Man)|Revestment]] in 1765 the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], and not democratically responsible to the Manx people. Conflict between the [[House of Keys]] (popularly elected after 1866) and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head during the tenure of [[George Somerset, 3rd Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] (1902–18).

===Council of Ministers===
After [[World War I]] the Lieutenant Governor gradually ceded control to [[Tynwald]], a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Departmental Committee on the Constitution etc. of the Isle of Man, 1911, Cd.5950 (the 'MacDonnell Report')&lt;/ref&gt; 1959&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commission on the Isle of Man Constitution, 1959 (the MacDermott Report')&lt;/ref&gt; and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Joint Working Party on the Constitutional Relationship between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom, 1969 (the 'Stonham Report')&lt;/ref&gt; An Executive Council, chaired by him and including members of Tynwald, was established in 1949, and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island. Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1958, Finance Act 1962, Police (Isle of Man) Act 1962, Governor's Financial and Judicial Functions (Transfer) Act 1976: ''Statutes of the Isle of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lieutenant Governor ceased to chair the Executive Council in 1980, being replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution (Executive Council) Act 1984&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 they were given the title 'Minister' and the chairman was styled 'Chief Minister'.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Council was renamed the 'Council of Ministers'.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Ministers Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departments===
During the 19th century several bodies, which came to be known as 'Boards of [[Tynwald]]', were created to exercise functions under democratic control. These included the Board of Education (1872), Highway Board (1874), Asylums Board (1888), Government Property Trustees (1891) and Local Government Board (1894).  However, although direct taxation was levied by [[Tynwald]], the Boards' freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor's control of the Island's budget and his power to appoint certain of their members.

The structure of the Boards of Tynwald, along with other bodies variously called 'Statutory Boards' and 'Commercial Boards', became increasingly unwieldy after the 1950s, and was eventually reformed in the 1980s, when a system of 'ministerial government' was set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gumbley |first=K F W |title=Government Departments and Statutory Boards|journal=Manx Law Bulletin|volume=10 |year=1988 |pages=61–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Judge Advocate General's Corps''' also known as the "JAG Corps" or "JAG" is the legal arm of the [[United States Navy]]. Today, the corps consists of a worldwide organization of more than 730 commissioned officers serving as [[Judge Advocate]]s, 30 [[Limited Duty Officer|limited duty officers (law)]], 500 enlisted members (primarily in the [[Legalman]] rating) and nearly 275 civilian personnel, all serving under the direction of the [[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]].

The headquarters of the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the [[United States Department of the Navy]] is located at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
In 1775, the [[Continental Congress]] enacted the Articles of Conduct, governing the ships and men of the [[Continental Navy]]. However, soon after the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], all of these ships were sold and the Continental Navy, to include its [[Continental Marines]], the precursor of today's [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], were disbanded. In July 1797, Congress, after authorizing construction of six frigates, enacted the Rules for Regulation of the Navy as a temporary measure. Then, in 1800, Congress enacted a more sophisticated code adopted directly from the [[British Naval Code]] of 1749. There was little or no need for lawyers to interpret these simple codes, nor was there a need for lawyers in the uncomplicated administration of the navy prior to the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

During the Civil War, however, [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]] named a young assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia named Nathaniel Wilson to present the government's case in complicated [[courts-martial]]. Without any statutory authority, Secretary Welles gave Wilson the title of "[[Solicitor of the Navy Department]]," making him the first [[House counsel]] to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

By the Act of March 2, 1865, Congress authorized "the President to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for service during the rebellion and one year thereafter, an officer of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to be called the 'Solicitor and Naval Judge Advocate General.'" The [[United States Congress]] maintained the billet on a year-to-year basis by amendments to the Naval Appropriations Acts. In 1870, Congress transferred the billet to a newly established Justice Department with the title of naval solicitor.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

Colonel William Butler Remey, USMC, was the first uniformed chief legal officer of the navy, in 1878. Colonel Remey was able to convince Congress that the Navy Department needed a permanent uniformed Judge Advocate General and that naval law was so unique it would be better to appoint a line officer of the navy or Marine Corps. The bill to create the billet of Judge Advocate General of the Navy was signed in 1880.&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/history.htm|title=History: U.S. Navy JAG Corps|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=9 June 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], the Naval Appropriations Act of 1918 elevated the billets of navy bureau chiefs and judge advocate general to rear admiral. In July 1918, Captain George Ramsey Clark was appointed the first judge advocate general to hold the rank of [[rear admiral]].&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

During the rapid expansion of the navy during World War II, line officers who had been attorneys in civilian life were often pressed into service, frequently ad hoc, to serve as prosecutors and defense attorneys in court martial proceedings.  Many of these attorneys remained in the navy following the end of the war as general line officers, but serving as de facto judge advocates.  In 1947, the navy created a "law specialist" program to allow line officers restricted duty to perform legal services. By the Act of May 5, 1950, Congress required that the Judge Advocate General be a lawyer. The Act also required each Judge Advocate General of any service be a member of the bar with not less than eight years of legal duties as a commissioned officer. The Act also enacted the first [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] ([[UCMJ]]).&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

By 1967, the navy had 20 years of experience with the law specialist program. There was, however, increasing pressure to create a separate corps of lawyers.  That year, Congress decided to establish the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAGC) within the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]. The legislation was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on December 8, 1967, and redesignated all navy lawyers as [[United States Navy staff corps|staff officers]] within the navy, similar to [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|physicians]] and [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|chaplains]].  Prior to this change, all navy lawyers were Line Naval Officers.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

Prior to 2005, JAG Corps personnel primarily worked in one of three offices:  Navy Legal Service Offices (NLSO) providing defense and legal assistance to eligible personnel; Trial Service Offices (TSO) providing courts-martial prosecution, court reporting and administrative trial support; and Staff Judge Advocates (SJA) providing legal advice to U.S. naval base commanding officers.  In 2005, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy approved a pilot program which resulted in the merger of the navy's Trial Service Offices and Staff Judge Advocates into new commands known as Region Legal Service Offices (RLSO).  Additionally, the JAG Corps has attorneys and paralegals on aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships and flag ships, as well as in support of Seabee battalions and special operations commands.

==Insignia==
[[File:LN Rate Insignia.jpg|thumb|70px|Legalman enlisted rating insignia]]
The official insignia of the JAG Corps consists of two gold oak leaves, curving to form a semicircle in the center of which is balanced a silver "mill rinde" [sic]. In ancient France, the ''fer de moline'', or [[millrind]], was a symbol of equal justice for all under the law. The two counterbalancing oak leaves are identical and connote the scales upon which justice is weighed. Oak leaves denote a corps, and symbolize strength, particularly the strength of the hulls of the early American Navy, which were oak-timbered. In the milling of grains, the millrind was used to keep the stone grinding wheels an equal distance apart to provide consistency in the milling process. It, thus, symbolizes that the wheels of justice must grind exceedingly fine and exceptionally even. In the 16th century, this symbol was adopted in England as a symbol for lawyers.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

The millrind can also be found in both the Staff Corps Officers Specialty Insignia and in the [[Enlisted Rating]] Insignia (LN [[Legalman]]).

==Legalman==
{{main|Legalman}}
:''See: {{section link|List of United States Navy ratings|Administration, deck, technical, and weapons specialty ratings}} ('''at''' "Legalman")''
[[Legalman|Legalmen]] are trained [[paralegal]]s who assist navy and Marine Corps lawyers and work in navy legal offices.

On January 4, 1972, Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee approved the recommendation for establishment of the Legalman enlisted rating. A memorandum from the Chairman of the Rating Review Board announced the approval, stating in part, "the scope of the new rating will provide judge advocates with the personnel trained in court reporting, claims matters, investigations, legal administration, and legal research. This scope is in consonance with the new concept in the civilian legal community where many areas of legal services can be provided by competent trained personnel under the supervision of a lawyer." On October 4, 1972, 275 petty officers were selected for conversion to the new Legalman rating.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

In 2007, the Legalman education and training pipeline was adapted in order to fully train Legalmen as paralegals. The Naval Justice School's NJS curriculum was adapted to include four American Bar Association (ABA) approved paralegal college courses. Legalmen now leave NJS with 10 semester hours of college credit in paralegal studies.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

==Judge Advocate General of the Navy==
The '''[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]] (JAG)''' and the '''[[Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy]] (DJAG)''' are appointed positions. They are both nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] and must be confirmed via majority vote by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The JAG and DJAG are appointed to a four-year term of office but they usually serve for three. The JAG and DJAG have historically been officers in the service of the navy. Federal statutes, however, state that a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] officer &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/5148(b).html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430092234/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/5148%28b%29.html |date=2009-04-30 }} 10 USC 5148. Judge Advocate General's Corps: Office of the Judge Advocate General; Judge Advocate General; appointment, term, emoluments, duties.&lt;/ref&gt; can be appointed to either position as long as he meets the requirements stated in the section. By statute the JAG is  appointed as a three-star [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] or [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] while holding office &lt;ref name="Pub.L. 110-181"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?tab=main&amp;bill=h110-4986] Pub.L. 110-181: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pub.L. 110-181 text"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-4986] Pub.L. 110-181: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 full text&lt;/ref&gt; and the DJAG is appointed as a two-star [[Rear Admiral (upper half)|rear admiral]] or a [[Major General (United States)|major general]].&lt;ref name="Pub.L. 110-181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pub.L. 110-181 text"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149-] 10 USC 5149. Office of the Judge Advocate General: Deputy Judge Advocate General; Assistant Judge Advocates General.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than age and years of military service, there is no other statute of limitations on how many times a JAG or DJAG can be renominated for appointment to that position if the President so chooses.

'''''Loop v. Litchfield''''' 42 N. Y. 351 (1870)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrence.edu/fast/boardmaw/Loop_Litch.html Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122075410/http://www.lawrence.edu/fast/boardmaw/LOOP_LITCH.HTML |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a part of the historic line of cases holding that the [[privity]] requirement barred a [[products liability]] action unless the product in question was "inherently dangerous."

==Facts==
A manufacturer negligently made a small balance wheel for use on a circular saw. The manufacturer pointed out the defect in the wheel to the buyer, who wished to purchase a cheap article and was willing to assume the risk of the defect. The buyer then loaned the saw to a neighbor who used it and, five years after the manufacture,  was killed when the wheel flew apart.

==Held==
The court held the manufacturer not liable.
*The court distinguished ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'' and advanced a theory that conditioned liability on the "imminently dangerous" nature of the object in question.  The issue was whether a particular defective product was "inherently dangerous"—the manufacturer only owed duty to the lessee if the danger was an imminent one -- "The vendor of an article of his own manufacture is not liable to one who uses the same, with the consent of the purchaser, for injuries resulting from a defect therein, unless such article is, in its nature, dangerous.
*The court ruled that a flywheel in a machine was not such an object. The court explained: "Poison is a dangerous subject. Gunpowder is the same. A torpedo is a dangerous instrument, as is a spring gun, a loaded rifle, or the like." But the flywheel, like "an ordinary carriage wheel, a wagon axle, or the common chair in which we sit," was not inherently dangerous, so the privity requirement applied and the injured plaintiff could not recover from the manufacturer. In the sale of a mislabeled poison, "[t]he injury . . . was a natural result of the act," but in the case of a defective flywheel, "[t]he bursting of the wheel and the injury to human life was not the natural result or the expected  consequence of the manufacture and sale of the wheel."

==Subsequent court cases==
Three years later, in ''[[Losee v. Clute]]'', the plaintiff was injured by a defective steam boiler; the court decided that this, too, was an ordinary object, not an inherently dangerous one."

'''''Malum in se''''' (plural ''mala in se'') is a [[list of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] meaning ''wrong'' or ''evil in itself''.  The phrase is used to refer to conduct assessed as sinful or inherently wrong by nature, independent of regulations governing the conduct.  It is distinguished from ''[[malum prohibitum]]'', which is wrong only because it is prohibited.

For example, most human beings believe that [[murder]], [[rape]], and [[theft]] are wrong, regardless of whether a law governs such conduct or where the conduct occurs, and is thus recognizably ''malum in se''. In contrast, ''malum prohibitum'' crimes are criminal not because they are inherently bad, but because the act is prohibited by the law of the state. For example, law in the United States requires drivers to drive on the right side of the road. This is not because driving on the left side of a road is considered immoral, but because consistent rules promote safety and order on the roads.

This concept was used to develop the various [[common law offence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Yogis, Q.C., ''Canadian Law Dictionary'', Barrons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to describe the underlying conceptual difference between "''malum in se''" and "''malum prohibitum''" is "''iussum quia iustum''" and "''iustum quia iussum''", namely something that is commanded (''iussum'') because it is just (''iustum'') and something that is just (''iustum'') because it is commanded (iussum).

The '''Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967''' c.41, shortened to '''Marine Broadcasting Offences Act''' or "Marine offences Act", became law in the [[United Kingdom]] at midnight on Monday 14 August 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/41&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently amended by the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006]] and the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2925965 |title=Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was to extend the powers of the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]] (which was incorporated by this Act), beyond the territorial land area and [[territorial waters]] of the UK to cover airspace and external bodies of water. 

The Act represented the UK's ratification of the 1965 "European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations outside National Territories" (sometimes referred to as the "[[Council of Europe]] Strasbourg Convention" or "Strasbourg Treaty").&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/sozlesmeler/coktaraflisoz/ak/ingilizce/053_ing.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that the Bill was introduced in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1966, there were radio stations and proposals for television stations outside British licensing jurisdiction with signals aimed at Britain. These stations were at sea but there were press reports of stations broadcasting from aircraft (Caroline TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline TV - the press cuttings|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/ctv.htm|website=www.offshoreradio.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and from a ship (Radex TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radex TV|url=http://www.offshoreradiomuseum.co.uk/page764.html|website=www.offshoreradiomuseum.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Act extended to the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] (despite the protests of the Governments there). The Act meant that the operation of offshore, [[pirate radio|pirate radio stations]] became illegal if they were operated or assisted by persons subject to UK law. It prohibited "carrying by water or air goods or persons to or from it" which made [[tendering]] illegal. Station operators thought they could continue if they were staffed, supplied and funded by non-British citizens, but this largely  proved impractical.

==Origins ==
In 1966, broadcasting in the UK was controlled by the British [[General Post Office]], which had granted exclusive radio broadcasting licences to the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] and television licences to the BBC and 16 regional [[ITV Network|Independent Television]] companies.

The power of the GPO covered letters delivered by the [[Royal Mail]], newspapers, books and their printing presses, the encoding of messages on lines used to supply electricity; the electric telegraph, the electric telephone (which was originally deemed an electronic post office); the electric wireless telegraph and the electric wireless telephone which became known as "telephony" and later wireless broadcasting. In the 1920s the GPO had been circumvented by broadcasting from transmitters in countries close to British listeners. [[World War II]] terminated these broadcasts except for [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].

==Broadcasting pressure groups==
In the 1950s a pressure group campaigned with the help of [[Winston Churchill]] to pass the [[Television Act 1954]] that broke the BBC television monopoly by creating ITV. Some members wanted commercial competition to radio but were thwarted by a succession of governments.

By the 1960s several companies formed in the hope that radio licences would be issued. Radio monopolies in adjoining nations had been broken by transmitters on ships in international waters. The first attempt to broadcast offshore to Britain was by [[Commercial Neutral Broadcasting Company|CNBC]], an English-language station from the same ship as [[Radio Veronica]] broadcasting in Dutch to the [[Netherlands]]. CNBC ended transmissions but press reports followed that GBLN, ''The Voice of Slough'', would transmit from a ship with sponsored programming already booked and advertised by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]]. GBLN was followed by reports that GBOK was attempting to get on air from another ship, both ships to be anchored off south-east England. Many in these early ventures were known to each other.

Some of the commercial television group members had registered broadcasting companies and were working to create offshore radio. The first venture was "Project Atlanta" in 1963, which had ties to British political leaders, bankers, the music industry and to [[Gordon McLendon]], who had helped [[Radio Nord]] broadcast from a ship off Sweden. When that was put off the air by Swedish law it became available to British entrepreneurs. Before [[Radio Atlanta]] got on the air, [[Radio Caroline]] began broadcasting in March 1964.

Texas connections to British stations led [[Don Pierson]] of [[Eastland, Texas]] to promote three American-radio format stations off Britain: [[Wonderful Radio London]] or Big L, [[Swinging Radio England]] and Britain Radio. By 1966 other stations had come on the air transmitting to [[Scotland]], northern and southern England, or were in the process of doing so. Press reports included rumours of offshore television stations and the brief success of the Dutch [[REM Island]] operation called Radio and TV Noordzee heightened the fear of the authorities that de facto unregulated broadcasting was becoming so entrenched due to its popularity that it would not be possible to stop it.

==Existing laws ==
Although these stations maintained sales and management offices in Britain, the transmitters were not under British law. In many instances the ships were registered in other countries.

==Claims of piracy==
Parliamentary debates listed several reasons why unlicensed broadcasting should be stopped. Opponents referred to "pirate radio stations". Allegations of piracy included misappropriation of World War II military installations; wavelengths allocated to others and the unauthorised playing of recorded music. Other claims said the vessels were a danger to shipping and that signals could interfere with aircraft and police, fire and ambulance services.

==Timing ==
In 1966, a dispute among offshore radio operators brought the issue of unlicensed radio stations to the fore.  [[Reginald Calvert]], operator of [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], had refused to pay [[Radio Caroline]]'s operator [[Oliver Smedley]] for a substandard transmitter. Smedley hired some riggers to occupy the Radio City facility (on [[Shivering Sands Army Fort|Shivering Sands]], a disused offshore defence fort), and in an altercation at Smedley's house, Smedley killed Calvert.  This incident strengthened the position of the Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]], who wanted to bring the pirate stations under control, enough to see the passage of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act on 15 August 1967.

==Results==
The offshore stations fell into four groups:

*Local operators of small stations such as Radio Essex and Radio City and Radio 390 who conducted their businesses with limited budgets primarily from disused forts on offshore sandbars. The UK silenced these stations by bringing the sandbars within UK waters.
* Regional operators such as Radio 270 and Radio Scotland who lacked the resources to relocate to other countries and staff their operations with non-British personnel.
* The ship stations of [[Wonderful Radio London]] and [[Swinging Radio England|Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio]]. While Wonderful Radio London made money, the others had lost  so they closed ahead of the law to save further expense. Radio London continued broadcasting until its last transmission on the eve of the new law, when the station closed.
* The Radio Caroline ships announced they would move to Holland, with an advertising office in [[New York City]]. The reality was felt in early 1968 when two tugs representing the supply company{{clarify|post-text=Company supplying what?|date=March 2012}} towed the vessels away to satisfy debts &lt;ref&gt;The pirate radio hall of fame [http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/towed1.htm "Radio Caroline in the sixties"]. Retrieved on 21 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Continuing challenges ==
Although challenges began with [[Radio North Sea International]] in 1970, governments [[radio jamming|jammed]] it until it moved to a position off the Netherlands. There was no Dutch equivalent of the Act until 1974; upon its introduction RNI closed.

Radio Caroline returned through the 1970s using a vessel that later sank in 1980, then returned with a new ship in 1983, primarily conducted with volunteer help. For much of this period Caroline's ships also hosted Dutch-language stations whose revenue, along with that of American evangelical broadcasts, kept the station on the air.

In 1984 Caroline was joined by [[Laser 558]] another vessel with American backing, and while the latter gained a huge audience, the legislation plus a sea embargo monitoring supplies out to Laser drove its operators into insolvency as well as putting additional pressure on Caroline. An attempt to revive Laser under new management only lasted a few months from 1986-7.

The [[Great Storm of 1987]] damaged Radio Caroline's antenna tower, which collapsed a few weeks later. A smaller antenna system was built but was less efficient. Dutch and British governments then raided the Radio Caroline ship and removed much of its equipment, but again it limped back on the air until late 1990 when its funding ran out. Attempts to secure more proved futile, and thereafter it pursued legal means of broadcasting.

==Apparent conclusion of unlicensed British offshore radio==
The end of the offshore [[Radio Caroline]] came when the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], which built on all similar and related legislation, together with a storm that caused its staff temporarily to abandon the ship, caused the station to come ashore in 1991, where enthusiasts continue to build a broadcasting business using the new licensing system available to British broadcasters.

A '''missing heir''' is a person related to a ''decedent'' (dead person), or [[testator]] of a [[Will (law)|will]], but whose residence, domicile, [[Post office]], or other address is not known.  A missing heir may be an [[orphan]] or other person under a [[disability]], who may need a [[Legal guardian|guardian]] or custodian of funds.

''Missing heirs'' often come up in the context of legal actions involving [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Title (property)|title]] to [[real property]], or a [[quiet title]] action.  A [[private investigator]], [[probate research]] firm or forensic genealogist may be hired by the [[executor]], [[trustee]], or [[Administrator (law)|administrator]] to find the missing heirs.

A [[probate court]] or surrogate judge may require the service of a [[citation]], notice of petition, [[summons]], or [[subpoena]] to the relevant persons who may be missing persons, or may know the whereabouts of such person.

Some courts, such as Suffolk County Probate Court in [[Boston]], actively solicit missing heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.probatecourtiannella.com/MissingHeirs.htm Suffolk County Probate Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probate research]] companies specialize in locating missing and unknown heirs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27686">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Mount Laurel'' doctrine}}
The '''''[[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey|Mount Laurel]]'' doctrine''' is a controversial judicial interpretation of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]]. The doctrine requires that municipalities use their [[zoning]] powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate income households.

The doctrine takes its name from the lead case in which it was first pronounced by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] in 1975: ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' (commonly called ''Mount Laurel I''), in which the plaintiffs challenged the zoning ordinance of [[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey]], on the grounds that it operated to exclude low and moderate income persons from obtaining housing in the municipality.

==History==

===Initial development===

After the decision in ''Mount Laurel I'', suits were filed against numerous municipalities. The plaintiffs in such suits fell into three classes: lower income persons who actually sought housing and advocacy organizations on their behalf; the New Jersey Public Advocate; and builders who sought to construct developments containing affordable housing.

These early exclusionary zoning suits were beset by numerous difficulties and little, if any, affordable housing resulted. In 1983 appeals in several of these cases (of which ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' was again the lead case), gave the New Jersey Supreme Court the opportunity to reaffirm and tweak the ''Mount Laurel'' Doctrine and provide several mechanisms and remedies to make the doctrine more effective.

===1980s legislative reaction===

The New Jersey Supreme Court was aware that the ''Mount Laurel II'' decision would be controversial and would engender debate about the proper role of the courts. The opinion invited legislative action to implement what the court defined as the constitutional obligation.

In 1985 the [[New Jersey Legislature]] responded by passing the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824154325/http://www.state.nj.us/dca/coah/fha.shtml Fair Housing Act]. Accepting the premise that there was some constitutional obligation for municipalities to foster some degree of affordable housing, this legislation created an administrative agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]] (COAH), to establish regulations whereby the obligation of each municipality in terms of the number of units and how the obligation could be satisfied.

A municipality which elected to participate in COAH's administrative process prior to being sued was provided with protection from litigation and especially the builder's remedy. As a transitional provision, the act provided that municipalities involved in litigation when the act was passed were to be able to transfer the litigation to COAH unless manifest injustice would result.

COAH developed regulations under which the specific number of affordable units that each municipality would be required to provide (its "pre-credited need") could be determined. Participating municipalities developed compliance plans to address this need by such means as the application of credits (''e.g.'' filtering, spontaneous rehabilitation, extra credit for rental units), the use of regional contribution agreements (transferring part of the obligation to a willing municipality, usually an urban center, in the same region along with payment in an amount agreed by the municipalities) and zoning for affordable housing (usually involving increased density and mandatory set-asides). When COAH approved a municipality's compliance plan it would grant "substantive certification" which was designed to provide the municipality with protection from exclusionary zoning litigation.

From the municipal point of view, the advantages of COAH's administrative process included the use of a formula to calculate fair share that might produce a lower obligation than the court would impose, the availability of the regional contribution agreement to reduce the number of units and the ability to determine where in the municipality that affordable housing ought to be developed rather than being forced to permit a development as a reward to a successful builder-plaintiff. Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating.

===Criticism of the decision===
While the Mount Laurel decision mandates a state constitutional obligation for every municipality in a "growth area" to provide a fair share of its region's present and prospective housing needs for low and moderate income families, there is no funding source specified for low or very-low income families, in a state that already has some of the nation's highest property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 "McHose Says 'Fair Housing' Bill Misses the Mark; Doesn't Address Why Housing is Unaffordable in New Jersey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027212202/http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 |date=2007-10-27 }}, [[Alison Littell McHose]] press release dated June 11, 2007 on PoliticsNJ.com.

[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DF123AF937A15751C0A960948260 "Judicial Duty in New Jersey"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 1986. Accessed June 22, 2007. "For 11 years, New Jersey's Supreme Court has struggled with the constitutional issues implicit in the desire of Mount Laurel, a Burlington County township, to zone out low-income housing. For its labor the court earned its share of criticism for ''judicial activism.'' Last week, it yielded supervision of housing to a new state agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]]. That was no defeat for judicial activism but a handsome vindication of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s judicial response to the Fair Housing Act===

The New Jersey Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature's adoption of the Fair Housing Act. A number of trial court decisions had denied transfer of pending cases to COAH under the manifest injustice standard, but the Supreme Court read that term very narrowly and ordered the cases transferred. The trial courts were directed to conform their rulings with regard to calculation of each municipality's obligation and how to meet it to COAH's regulations and the statute was found facially constitutional and interpreted to grant COAH ample authority, such as restraining the use of scarce resources (sewer capacity, potable water, land) for other than providing affordable housing, to assure that affordable housing might actually be built.

==The Council on Affordable Housing (COAH)==

COAH is a currently defunct government agency created in the 1980s to administer Mt. Laurel requirements. Some have argued it needs reinvigoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/07/21/explainer-coming-to-terms-with-the-intricacies-of-fair-housing-after-coah/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Council on Affordable Housing}}

==The Fair Share Housing Center==
The Fair Share Housing Center, or FSHC, is a Cherry Hill-based nonprofit organization founded in 1975 that litigates against towns in enforcement of fair housing development.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Fund for New Jersey's Support of a Housing Rights Group https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/housing/2014/10/7/behind-the-fund-for-new-jerseys-support-of-a-housing-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have alleged that the FSHC has "ties to developers."&lt;ref&gt;We must stop the affordable housing crisis https://njersy.co/2qut45a via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder's remedy lawsuits==
A "builder's remedy lawsuit" is a New Jersey lawsuit filed by a real estate developer in an attempt to force a New Jersey town to allow the construction of a large, multi-family housing complex that includes some affordable housing alongside ordinary apartments.

Usually, the developer's court papers will make specific mention of the Mt. Laurel doctrine, which holds municipalities responsible for providing affordable housing to low and moderate income households. Some have argued that developers exploit the Mount Laurel doctrine with the builder's remedy and prevent town efforts to combat overdevelopment and sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey's Housing Law Works Too Well, Some Say https://nyti.ms/2uKoAZx&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent "builder's remedy" lawsuits or related concerns include:

*Annandale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/hunterdon/index.ssf/2015/11/beaver_brook_development_likely_topic_in_clinton_t.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bridgewater.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/articles/k-hovnanian-proposes-townhome-development-off-ro&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cranford.  The developers Samuel and Peter Hekemian sued the Township of Cranford to allow a mass-density development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2008/10/hekemian_proposes_419_units_me.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case case=4188147394512128653&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cranfordtaxpayers.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; One Cranford local opined that the builder's remedy "takes the power from our township engineers, public safety officials, board of education members and budget offices and gives it to the S. Hekemian Group, a Paramus-based builder of apartment complexes. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. It is a court order based on what they refer to as builder remedy litigation. Apparently, progress is only found in concrete."&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_brian_campbell/2013/03/cranford_-_a_town_is_citified.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emerson. Local officials expressed concerns over impact of Mount Laurel on development of a 19-acre patch of woods that town officials have been trying to turn into a park.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/03/nyregion/new-jersey-s-housing-law-works-too-well-some-say.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Livingston. Despite the efforts of the Livingston-Short Hills Coalition, affiliates of the [[Kushner Companies]] filed an affordable housing suit to build developments in the town.&lt;ref&gt;https://patch.com/new-jersey/livingston/millburn-responds-to-public-on-affordable-housing-case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/08/livingston_makes_deal_to_allow.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Millburn.  Residents of [[Millburn, New Jersey]] objected to a proposed land development by Canoe Brook, which would create a 250-room hotel, 200 residential units and a multi-deck parking structure adjacent to the Mall at Short Hills.;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njbiz.com/article/20151110/NJBIZ01/151119977/carl-goldberg-at-the-intersection-of-development-and-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/millburn-slash-short-hills/articles/millburn-residents-say-no-to-new-housing-developm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Montvale. The S. Hekemian Group filed to intervene in Montvale's affordable-housing litigation to build 1,000 units, arguing the borough "is in violation of its constitutional duty to create sufficient realistic opportunities" for affordable housing. In June 2017, Mayor Mike Ghassali stated, "Now we are on a path to spend untold amounts of time, money and borough resources to defend our town from a monstrous development that would change our community forever" regarding the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/06/30/developer-seeks-build-1-000-housing-units-montvale-property/442753001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/04/20/montvale-seeks-best-outcome-affordable-housing-plan/100616524/&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Milford.  Despite objections from a community group, "Stop Overdevelopment New Milford,",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/SODofNewMilford/&lt;/ref&gt; the developer S.Hekemian Group (SHG), led by Robert S. Hekemian and Peter Hekemian, brought a Mount Laurel builder's remedy suit against [[New Milford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/12/development_of_14-acre_site_splits_north_jersey_to.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "I certainly do feel I have a gun to my head" said New Milford's mayor, Ann Subrizi at the close of 2016.  The township ultimately settled, causing development of one of the last undeveloped tracts of land in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freitnj.com/about-freit; http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/04/20/montvale-seeks-best-outcome-affordable-housing-plan/100616524/&lt;/ref&gt;
*West Orange.  The Fair Share Housing Center,and Garden Homes, an affiliate of the [[Zygi Wilf|Wilf family]], owners of the [[Minnesota Vikings]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Wilf]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} have brought legal action to create more affordable housing units in [[West Orange, New Jersey]].

==Regional Contribution Agreements (RCAs)==

In 1985, the Fair Housing Act created the now-repealed Regional Contribution Agreement system.  The RCAs meant that towns could pay to get out of up to half of their affordable housing obligation by funding affordable housing elsewhere as required by the New Jersey Supreme Court's Mt. Laurel decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njfuture.org/2007/01/31/rcas-regional-contribution-agreements/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, at the behest of the Fair Share Housing Center's Peter O' Connor and over the objections of some suburban Democrats, Governor Corzine signed a law barring RCAs. A500. He signed A-500 into law during a ceremony at Fair Share Housing Development's Ethel R. Lawrence Homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_john_atlas/2008/07/new_jersey_regional_coalition.html&lt;  ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/A0500/500_U1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/05/26/nj-gubernatorial-primary-guadagno-ciattarelli/102188626/&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have demanded that RCAs be returned to cut down on sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/05/23/letter-bring-back-rcas-affordable-housing/337819001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newjerseyconferenceofmayors.com/magazine/winter_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

In 1983, the NJ Supreme Court cautioned that, in requiring affordable housing, our State Constitution "does not require bad planning.  It does not require suburban spread.  It does not require rural municipalities to encourage large scale housing developments.  It does not require wasteful extension of roads and needless construction of sewer and water facilities for the out-migration of people from the cities and the suburbs.  There is nothing in our Constitution that says that we cannot satisfy our constitutional obligation to provide lower income housing and, at the same time, plan the future of the state intelligently."&lt;ref&gt;Southern Burlington County, et al. v. Township of Mount Laurel, et al., 92 N.J. 158, 238 (1983) (Mt Laurel II).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some commentators have denounced the environmental impact of the current regime. As the result of one successful builder's remedy lawsuit brought by S. Hekemian Group, developers may construct a 360-unit, high density housing development in [[Cranford, New Jersey]] next to a flood plain. Some assert such developments could worsen flooding in an already flood-prone area that was ravaged by [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mulshine, State Wants to Flood Cranford with High-Density Housing, THE STAR-LEDGER, September 7, 2011, http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2011/09/state_wants_to_flood_cranford.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New Jersey residents assert they fear sprawl, the destruction of historic New Jersey small town architecture, and crowding: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As an environmental scientist, I am concerned with the question of how many residents can be sustained before we reach an environmental tipping point. When do our water systems fail to provide the supply needed (remember the Bergen County dire drought warning last October?); when does the volume of traffic finally overwhelm our existing roadways and extend commuting times to impossible limits (remember the last time you sat in local traffic?); when does the air quality become too unhealthy to breath (remember the ozone and poor air-quality alerts just last month?); how many people can actually be sustained with a reasonable quality of life within our municipalities, counties and state?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/06/22/letter-schepisi-leads-important-discussion-housing/417571001/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One Parsippany resident stated, "I'm very frustrated that this significant tract of undeveloped land is being razed for development when so much property in Parsippany lies vacant," said Dave Kaplan, of the Stop the Overdevelopment at Waterview opposition group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/07/06/controversial-whole-foods-project-breaks-ground-parsippany/455311001/&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club applauded Christie's efforts to reform affordable housing law in 2010: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The current COAH law has had a bigger impact on land use and development than any other law in New Jersey's history. The Sierra Club strongly supports a requirement for affordable housing. As towns grow, they must provide a fair share of it. But the need for affordable housing should not undermine the environmental protections given to wetlands, flood plains, steep slopes, stream buffers that protect water supplies, ocean-fronts, and endangered species habitat. And no homes should be built where water supply is at critically low levels. Furthermore, new housing should be located where jobs are, to reduce the carbon footprints and pollution associated with automobile commuting.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Essential in Affordable Housing Review.http://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/new-jersey-chapter/njs_sierran/Sierran_10B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present-day demands for legislative reform==
Some believe the NJ Supreme Court seeks legislative action to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine based on recent rulings, as of mid-2017:

=== January 2017 NJ Supreme Court decision ===
In January 2017, the NJ Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that towns had to consider any historic failure to provide affordable housing.  As one commentator put it, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This case resolved affordable housing regulation debates that have been ongoing since 1999. However, the Court provided no guidance on the method of implementation of affordable housing accommodations that it now requires of municipalities. This decision leaves numerous unanswered questions and it will depend heavily on the Legislature to issue reform of affordable housing requirements. This decision requires implementation of affordable housing accommodations into township plans that have not otherwise considered them since 1999. It is likely that the open spaces in towns will now be filled with affordable housing units, which will bring an influx of population to municipalities. ...We will need to watch the Legislature to see how and if it will alter the current affordable housing regulations to comply with the Court's recent ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawgapc.com/blog/affordable-housing-in-new-jersey/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MaryAnn Spoto, N.J. on the hook for thousands more affordable housing units, Supreme Court says http://s.nj.com/SHt7UaT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Cook, Two River Times, http://tworivertimes.com/holmdel-talks-affordable-housing-with-residents/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Katzban, Archive: Confusion over COAH spreads https://njersy.co/2t98Tyn via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Symons, NJ Supreme Court says towns must catch up on affordable housing http://nj1015.com/nj-supreme-court-says-towns-must-catch-up-on-affordable-housing/?trackback=twitter_top @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In its January 2017 opinion, the NJ Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature to re-approach the affordable housing issue: "We recognize, as we have before, that the Legislature is not foreclosed from considering alternative methods for calculating and assigning a municipal fair share of affordable housing, and to that end, we welcome legislative attention to this important social and economic constitutional matter," Justice LaVecchia wrote.&lt;ref&gt;In re Declaratory Judgment Actions Filed by Various Muns., 446 N.J.Super. 259, 281 (App. Div. 2016), aff'd as modified on other grounds, 227 N.J. 508 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Rizzo, N.J. Supreme Court: Towns must have affordable housing http://northjersy.news/2k05wks via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislator outcry===
A Morris County Freeholder candidate,  Harding Committeeman Nicolas Platt, proposed in May 2017 that all mayors state-wide conduct a sit-in in Trenton and refuse to leave the statehouse until legislators acted to reduce the overdevelopment impact of the builder's remedy issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/05/30/freeholder-candidate-rallying-mayors-housing-issue/355671001/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen and Passaic County Assemblywoman [[Holly Schepisi]] argued in a July 2017 opinion piece that reform was urgently needed: "If built, the number of new homes alone would far exceed all the homes in the entire borough of Manhattan," she stated, calling the issue one of overdevelopment "madness."

In the summer of 2017, Schepisi held the first of several planned public hearing in Paramus with various civic leaders on mandated affordable housing with local mayors and other state assembly members.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblywoman hears mayors concerns on court-mandated affordable housing https://njersy.co/2syG9yI&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is long past time for the Legislature to act, and block [the nonprofit group Fair Share Housing Center] from their objective of destroying our suburban communities," said one mayor at the hearing according to the press. "We really need action. Nobody has done what they need to do."

Schepisi stated she invited the Fair Share Housing Center to attend but received a letter declining an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/16/assemblywoman-hears-mayors-concerns-court-mandated-affordable-housing/401538001/;
http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/17/affordable-housing-advocates-takes-aim-assemblywoman-over-forum/404679001/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Somerset County, Montgomery Township Mayor Ed Trzaska said the influx of apartment complex development would ruin the rural character of the area, "overwhelm the township's infrastructure, greatly increase property taxes and burden the school system and negatively impact the quality of life in the township."
.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing mandate threatens quality of life, mayor says http://s.nj.com/UYpPrLP&lt;/ref&gt;

In Union County, in the summer of 2017, the Clark town council issued a unanimous resolution demanding for the state legislature to take action to reform the affordable housing issue; the mayor stated that otherwise, "Union County will look like Queens in 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;State Legislators: 'Lead or Get Out of the Way' https://www.tapinto.net/towns/clark/articles/clarks-mayor-bonaccorso-to-state-legislators-l&lt;/ref&gt;

In Berkeley Heights in Union County in June 2017, Council President Marc Faecher said he considered the Legislature's failure to act on overdevelopment to be an "abject failure by our state government."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/berkeley-heights/articles/affordable-housing-the-who-what-when-and-why-e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public outcry==

In June 2018, NJ 101.5 radio host [[Bill Spadea]] advocated for a constitutional amendment to revoke the doctrine, arguing the imposition of unnecessary development increased tax burdens unfairly.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing law making NJ un-affordable (Opinion) http://nj1015.com/affordable-house-making-nj-un-affordable-opinion @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional town partnership approaches==
In the summer of 2017, the mayors of five Bergen County towns announced they were "teaming up to take a regional perspective on affordable housing, in an effort to find reasonable solutions that will protect the integrity of their communities."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2017-07-08/5-towns-team-up-to-make-progress-on-affordable-housing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vacant and abandoned properties==

"Owing to its ongoing high rate of residential foreclosures, New Jersey has become known the Land of the Zombie Houses."&lt;ref&gt;https://articles.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/07/dont_give_nj_zombie_homes_the_upper_hand_editorial.amp&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have argued that the deluge of abandoned and vacant properties in New Jersey should be taken into account before forced building occurs in less crowded areas.  They have also suggested that the state step up funding for code enforcement to reduce burdens of urban blight on attractive home development, including enforcement on absentee landlords.  The City of Newark is "working with the Urban League to identify vacant or abandoned properties that can be sold to small developers to then sell at cost to residents. About 16 percent of Newark's housing is vacant and the city has a high eviction and foreclosure rate according to a Rutgers report. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/02/a_year_later_newark_sweetheart_land_deals_harbor_m.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://urbanomnibus.net/2016/02/why-hasnt-anyone-built-on-newarks-1000-love-lots/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/newark/articles/new-quality-of-life-initiative-will-ramp-up-code&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2018/04/can_newark_be_a_model_city_to_curb_against_gentrif.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick Picks Committee, Law Firm to Move on Abandoned Houses https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/articles/new-brunswick-picks-committee-law-firm-to-move-o-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayoral Musings: Vacant and Abandoned http://www.snjtoday.com/story/38565358/mayoral-musings-vacant-and-abandoned#.W0d-k2SYxc8.twitter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacant and afraid: Getting a grip on abandoned homes | Opinion http://s.nj.com/gCDW8TI&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Privacy Commission''', or '''NPC''', is an independent body created under Republic Act No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Republic Act No. 10173, An Act Protecting Individual Personal Information in Information and Communications Systems in the Government and the Private Sector, Creating for this purpose a National Privacy Commission, and for Other Purposes, (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; mandated to administer and implement the provisions of the Act, and to monitor and ensure compliance of the country with international standards set for data protection.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is attached to the [[Philippines]]' [[Department of Information and Communications Technology (Philippines)|Department of Information and Communications Technology]] (DICT) for purposes of policy coordination, but remains independent in the performance of its functions.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission safeguards the fundamental human right of every individual to privacy, particularly [[Information privacy]] while ensuring free flow of information for innovation, growth, and national development.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fulfil its mandate, the Commission is vested with a broad range of powers, from receiving complaints and instituting investigations on matters affecting personal data protection to compelling entities to abide by its orders in matters affecting data privacy. It also represents the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine Government]] internationally on data protection related issues. The Commission formulates and implements policies relating to the protection of personal data, including the relevant circulars and advisory guidelines, to assist organisations in understanding and complying with the Data Privacy Act. The Commission also reviews organizational actions in relation to data protection rules and issue decisions or directions for compliance where necessary. It is mandated to work with relevant sector regulators in exercising its functions.

Beyond regulating data protection issues, the NPC also undertakes public and sector-specific educational and outreach activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/01/09/1661022/privacy-body-raises-private-sector-awareness-data-security|title=Privacy body raises private sector awareness on data security|first=Rainier Allan|last=Ronda|newspaper=Philippine Star|date=1 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help organizations adopt good data protection practices and to help individuals to better understand how they may protect their own personal data from misuse.

The Data Privacy Act of 2012 is the first law in the [[Philippines]] which acknowledges the rights of Individuals over their Personal Data and Enforcing the responsibilities of entities who process them.

The initial definition was offered first in Republic Act 8792, Section 32 better known as the eCommerce Act of the Philippines and was formally introduced by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on its Department Administrative Order #08 - Defining Guidelines for the Protection of Personal Data in Information Private Sector. Along with the Anti-Cybercrime Bill (now RA 10175), The first draft of the law started in 2001 under the Legal and Regulatory Committee of the former Information Technology and eCommerce Council (ITECC) which is the forerunner of the [[Commission on Information and Communications Technology (Philippines)|Commission on Information and Communication Technology]] (CICT). It was headed by former Secretary Virgilio "Ver" Peña and the Committee was chaired by Atty. Claro Parlade. It was an initiative of the Information Security and Privacy Sub-Committee chaired by Albert Dela Cruz who was the President of PHCERT together with then Anti-Computer Crime and Fraud Division Chief, Atty. Elfren Meneses of the NBI. The administrative and operational functions was provided by the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) acting as the CICT secretariat.

With rising concerns by the [[Business process outsourcing in the Philippines|Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines]] (IBPAP) of an absence of a Data Privacy Law, [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] passed Senate Bill No. 2965 and House Bill No. 4115 on June 6, 2012. President [[Benigno S. Aquino III]] signed Republic Act No. 10173 or the '''''Data Privacy Act of 2012''''' on August 15, 2012. The law was influenced by the [[Data Protection Directive]] and the APEC Privacy Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hldataprotection.com/2012/08/articles/international-eu-privacy/philippine-data-privacy-law-is-signed-into-law/|title=Philippine Data Privacy Law is Signed into Law|publisher=HL Chronicle of Data Protection|date=23 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Aquino appointed on March 7, 2016 Raymund Liboro as inaugural head of the commission with Damian Domingo O. Mapa and Ivy D. Patdu as inaugural deputy privacy commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbytes.ph/2016/03/07/dost-exec-named-first-commissioner-of-national-privacy-commission/|title=DOST exec named first commissioner of National Privacy Commission|work=NewsBytes.ph|date=7 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fixed terms of office, they continued with their roles during the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]].

After consultation with various private organizations, civil societies and a series of public hearings in Manila, Cebu and Davao, the Implementing Rules and Regulations&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.ph/images/uploads/20160825-IRR-RA-10173-data-privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the Data Privacy Act was signed on August 24, 2016. It took effect on September 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbytes.ph/2016/08/27/irr-for-data-privacy-act-released-4-years-after-passage-of-law/|title=IRR for Data Privacy Act released 4 years after passage of law|work=NewsBytes.ph|date=27 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Commission formally investigated the Commission on Elections for the [[Commission on Elections data breach]] one of the largest security breach in government held personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/01/06/1660106/comeleak-bautista-faces-criminal-raps|title=Comeleak: Bautista faces criminal raps|first=Rainier Allan|last=Ronda|newspaper=Philippine Star|date=6 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2017, NPC announced that the Commission on Elections was being investigated for another security breach due to alleged theft of a computer containing personal data of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/873559/another-comeleak-theft-probed|title=Another Comeleak? Theft probed|first=Vince F.|last=Nonato|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=21 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NPC also began coordinating with different sectors on privacy and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/866488/agency-reminds-bank-on-data-privacy-law|title=Agency reminds bank on data privacy law|first=Kathleen|last=de Villa|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=30 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the National Privacy Commission was accepted as a member in the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners and the Asia Pacific Privacy Authorities.

'''Nationality and citizenship in the [[Nauru|Republic of Nauru]]''' are currently defined and regulated by the [[Constitution of Nauru]] and the ''Nauruan Community Ordinance 1956-1962''. Dual citizenship is permitted.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
Part VIII of the Constitution pertains to citizenship, and defined who was to become a citizen of Nauru upon the country's accession to independence in 1968. Article 71 refers to the ''Nauruan Community Ordinance 1956-1962''. Any person who is
:''"included in one of the classes of persons who constituted the Nauruan Community within the meaning of the Nauruan Community Ordinance 1956-1966 of Nauru is a Nauruan citizen."''

Section 4 of the Ordinance in question establishes legal belonging to the "Nauruan community". Nauruans under this law include
*''"[[Nauruan people|aboriginal natives of the Island of Nauru]] by virtue of the institutions, customs and usages of the aboriginal natives of the Island of Nauru"''
*non-Nauruan [[Pacific Islander]]s who are married to a Nauruan, and who thereby are deemed to become Nauruan
*non-Nauruan Pacific Islanders who have settled in Nauru, provided that they adhere to certain criteria, such as adopting a Nauruan way of life (cf. section 5.c.)
*any child born to two Nauruan parents within any of the definitions above, and any child born to a Nauruan who has married a Pacific Islander

The Constitution re-iterates the provisions of the Ordinance, and provides additional means of obtaining citizenship. These include:
*being born in Nauru and having no possibility of obtaining citizenship of any other country
*being a woman who marries a Nauruan citizen
*being granted citizenship by Parliament

The Constitution also establishes that the [[Parliament of Nauru]] may "make provision for depriving a person of his Nauruan citizenship", except if that person obtained citizenship through the provisions of the 1956 Ordinance, and except if that person was born of two Nauruan parents or of a Nauruan parent married to a Pacific Islander. Parliament is also authorised by the Constitution to "make provision for the renunciation by a person of his Nauruan citizenship".

==Attempted ban on dual citizenship for MPs, 2008==
On 22 March 2008, the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the Nauruan Parliament, [[David Adeang]], called a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing government ministers, who therefore did not attend. Opposition MPs, Adeang included, constituted a majority of legislators present, and passed a ruling outlawing dual citizenship for Members of Parliament.

The ruling, if applied, would affect senior Cabinet ministers Dr. [[Kieren Keke]] and [[Frederick Pitcher]]. Were they compelled to resign from Parliament, the Opposition would control a majority of seats in Parliament.

The government rejected the legitimacy of the ruling, stating that it was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because of the lack of parliamentary [[quorum]].&lt;ref name="RNZI_38778"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=38778 |title=Nauru government rejects citizenship ruling |date=26 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Marcus Stephen]] accused Adeang and the Opposition of passing the ruling "after dark on Easter Saturday", "under candelight".&lt;ref name="RNZI_38761"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=38761 |title=Nauru President frustrated over parliament developments |date=25 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment to the citizenship law was unconstitutional, thus confirming that persons with dual nationality remain entitled to sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/200804/s2210463.htm?tab=latest "Nauru judge blocks citizenship law change"], ABC Radio Australia, 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Northern Ireland 1972-98}}
The '''Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention''' ('''NICC''') was an elected body set up in 1975 by the United Kingdom [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Harold Wilson]] as an attempt to deal with constitutional issues surrounding the status of [[Northern Ireland]].

==Formation of the Constitutional Convention==
The idea for a constitutional convention was first mooted by the [[Northern Ireland Office]] in its [[white paper]] ''The Northern Ireland Constitution'', published on 4 July 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd5675.htm |title=The Northern Ireland Constitution (1974) |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=1 January 1974 |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper laid out plans for elections to a body which would seek agreement on a political settlement for Northern Ireland. The proposals became law with the enactment of the [[Northern Ireland Act 1974]] later that month. With [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Robert Lowry, Baron Lowry|Robert Lowry]] appointed to chair the new body, elections were announced for 1 May 1975.

The elections were held for the 78-member body using the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]] in each of Northern Ireland's twelve [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] constituencies. Initially the body was intended to be purely consultative, although it was hoped that executive and [[Legislature|legislative]] functions could be [[Devolution|devolved]] to the NICC once a cross-community agreement had been reached.

[[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] opposed to the NICC once again banded together under the umbrella of the [[United Ulster Unionist Council]] (UUUC) and this coalition proved the most successful, taking 46 seats.

==Leading members==
{{main|Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention}}
A number of leading Northern Ireland politicians were elected to the NICC, increasing hope that the body might achieve some of its aims. Also elected were some younger figures who went on to become leading figures in the future of Northern Ireland politics. These included:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
* [[Glenn Barr]] – VPUP
* [[John Warden Brooke, 2nd Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]] – UPNI
* [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] – VPUP
* [[Austin Currie]] – SDLP
* [[Reg Empey]] – VPUP
* [[Brian Faulkner]] – UPNI
* [[Gerry Fitt]] – SDLP
* [[John Hume]] – SDLP
* [[James Kilfedder]] – UUP
* [[Seamus Mallon]] – SDLP
* [[Oliver Napier]] – APNI
* [[Ian Paisley]] – DUP
* [[Martin Smyth]] – UUP
* [[John Taylor, Baron Kilclooney|John Taylor]] – UUP
* [[David Trimble]] – VPUP
* [[Harry West]] – UUP
{{div col end}}

==Progress of the NICC==
The elections left the body fundamentally weakened from its inception as an overall majority had been obtained by those Unionists who opposed power sharing as a concept. As a result, the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention Report published on 20 November 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr Martin Melaugh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/convention/nicc75report.htm |title=Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention Report, 20 November 1975 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended only a return to majority rule as had previously existed under the old [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] government. As such a solution was completely unacceptable to the nationalist parties, the NICC was placed on hiatus.

Hoping to gain something from the exercise, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Merlyn Rees]] announced that the NICC would be reconvened on 3 February 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} However, a series of meetings held between the UUUC and the SDLP failed to reach any agreement about SDLP participation in government, and so the reconvened NICC once again failed to achieve a solution with cross-community support. As a result, Rees announced the dissolution of the body on 4 March 1976 and Northern Ireland remained under [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Significance of the NICC==
On the face of it, the NICC was a total failure as it did not achieve its aims of agreement between the two sides or of introducing 'rolling devolution' (gradual introduction of devolution as and when the parties involved saw fit to accept it). Nevertheless, coming as it did not long after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-sponsored [[Sunningdale Agreement]], the NICC indicated that no British government would be prepared to re-introduce majority rule in Northern Ireland. During the debates [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] accepted the possibility of power-sharing with the SDLP, a move that split the UUUC and precipitated the eventual collapse of [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Vanguard]].

The idea of electing a consultative body to thrash out a deal for devolution was also retained and in 1996 it was revived when the [[Northern Ireland Forum]] was elected on largely the same lines and with the same overall purpose. The Forum formed part of a process that led to the [[Belfast Agreement]] and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

[[File:NYS-Notary-Seal.jpg|thumb|An [[Paper embossing|Embossed]] Notary Seal. This type of seal is no longer legally sufficient in New York State.]]

In the [[United States]], a '''notary public''' is a person appointed by a state [[government]], e.g., the governor, lieutenant governor, state secretary, or in some cases the state legislature, and whose primary role is to serve the public as an impartial [[witness]] when important documents are signed.  Since the notary is a state officer, a notary's duties may vary widely from state to state and in most cases bars a notary from acting outside his or her home state unless they also have a commission there as well.

==Overview==
In 32 states the main requirements are to fill out a form and pay a fee; many states have restrictions concerning notaries with criminal histories, but the requirements vary from state to state. Notaries in 18 states and the District of Columbia are required to take a course, pass an exam, or both; the education or exam requirements in Delaware and Kansas only apply to notaries who will perform electronic notarizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nass.org/ ''Issues and Trends in State Notary Regulation'']. (2011). National Association of Secretaries of State. pp. 6, 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notary is almost always permitted to notarize a document anywhere in the state where their commission is issued.  Some states simply issue a commission "at large" meaning no indication is made as to from what county the person's commission was issued, but some states do require the notary include the county of issue of their commission as part of the jurat, or where seals are required, to indicate the county of issue of their commission on the seal.  Merely because a state requires indicating the county where the commission was issued does not necessarily mean that the notary is restricted to notarizing documents in that county, although some states may impose this as a requirement.

Some states (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, among others) allow a notary who is commissioned in a state bordering that state to also act as a notary in the state if the other allows the same.  Thus someone who was commissioned in Montana could notarize documents in Wyoming and North Dakota, and a notary commissioned in Wyoming could notarize documents in Montana, a notary from Wyoming could not notarize documents from North Dakota (or the inverse) unless they had a commission from North Dakota or a state bordering North Dakota that also allowed North Dakota notaries to practice in that state as well.

Notaries in the United States are much less closely regulated than notaries in most other [[common law|common-law]] countries, typically because U.S. notaries have little legal authority. In the United States, a lay notary may not offer [[law|legal]] advice or prepare documents - except in Louisiana and Puerto Rico - and in most cases cannot recommend how a person should sign a document or what type of notarization is necessary. There are some exceptions; for example, [[Notary public (Florida)|Florida notaries]] may take affidavits, draft inventories of safe deposit boxes, draft protests for payment of dishonored [[Cheque|checks]] and [[promissory note]]s, and solemnize marriages. In most states, a notary can also certify or attest a copy or facsimile.

The most common notarial acts in the United States are the taking of '''acknowledgements''' and '''oaths'''. Many professions may require a person to double as a notary public, which is why US [[court reporters]] are often notaries as this enables them to swear in witnesses ([[Deposition (law)|deponents]]) when they are taking [[deposition (law)|depositions]], and secretaries, bankers, and some lawyers are commonly notaries public. Despite their limited role, some American notaries may also perform a number of far-ranging acts not generally found anywhere else.  Depending on the jurisdiction, they may:  take depositions, certify any and all petitions (ME), witness third-party absentee ballots (ME), provide no-impediment marriage licenses, solemnize civil marriages (ME, FL, SC), witness the opening of a safe deposit box or safe and take an official inventory of its contents, take a renunciation of dower or inheritance (SC), and so on.

===Acknowledgment===

"An '''acknowledgment''' is a formal [oral] declaration before an authorized public officer. It is made by a person executing [signing] an instrument who states that it was his [or her] free act and deed." That is, the person signed it without undue influence and for the purposes detailed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Piombino, Alfred E. (1996). ''Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for Vermont''. n.p.: East Coast Press. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''certificate of acknowledgment''' is a written statement signed (and in some jurisdictions, sealed) by the notary or other authorized official that serves to prove that the acknowledgment occurred. The form of the certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but will be similar to the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before me, the undersigned authority, on this ______ day of ___________, 20__ personally appeared _________________________, to me well known to be the person who executed the foregoing instrument, and he/she acknowledged before me that he/she executed the same as his/her voluntary act and deed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oath, affirmation, and jurat===

A '''jurat''' is the official written statement by a notary public that he or she has administered and witnessed an '''oath''' or '''affirmation''' for an [[oath of office]], or on an '''affidavit''' - that is, that a person has sworn to or affirmed the truth of information contained in a document, under penalty of perjury, whether that document is a lengthy deposition or a simple statement on an application form. The simplest form of jurat and the oath or affirmation administered by a notary are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''Jurat''': "Sworn (or affirmed) to before me this _______ day of ____________, 20__."
*'''Oath:''' "Do you solemnly swear that the contents of this affidavit subscribed by you are correct and true?"
*'''Affirmation''' (for those opposed to swearing oaths): "Do you solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm that the statements made by you are true and correct?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Venue===

In the U.S., notarial acts normally include what is called a venue or caption, that is, an official listing of the place where a notarization occurred, usually in the form of the state and county and with the abbreviation "ss." (for Latin ''scilicet'', "to wit") normally referred to as a "subscript", often in these forms:

{|
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
State of .......)
                )ss:
County of.......)
&lt;/pre&gt;
||
&lt;pre&gt;
State of ________
County of _______, to-wit:
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

The venue is usually set forth at the beginning of the instrument or at the top of the notary's certificate. If at the head of the document, it is usually referred to as a caption. In times gone by, the notary would indicate the street address at which the ceremony was performed, and this practice, though unusual today, is occasionally encountered.

===California===

The California Secretary of State, Notary Public &amp; Special Filings Section, is responsible for appointing and commissioning qualified persons as notaries public for four-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=08001-09000&amp;file=8200-8230 ''§8200''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to sitting for the notary [http://notaryeducation.sos.ca.gov/ exam], one must complete a mandatory six-hour [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/checklist-complete-approved-education.htm course of study]. This required course of study is conducted either in an online, home study, or in-person format via an [http://notaryeducation.sos.ca.gov/ approved notary education vendor].&lt;ref&gt;California Secretary of State. (n.d.). [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/notary_checklist.htm ''Notary Public Check List''.] Viewed 9 January 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429220647/http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/notary_checklist.htm |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both prospective notaries as well as current notaries seeking reappointment must undergo an "expanded" [[FBI]] and California Department of Justice background check.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=08001-09000&amp;file=8200-8230 ''§8201.1''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various statutes, rules, and regulations govern notaries public. California law sets maximum, but not minimum, fees for services related to notarial acts (e.g., per signature: acknowledgment $15, jurat $15, certified power of attorney $15, et cetera).&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=8211.&amp;lawCode=GOV ''§8211''.]&lt;/ref&gt; A finger print (typically the right thumb) may be required in the notary journal based on the transaction in question (e.g., deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust affecting real property, power of attorney document, et cetera). Documents with blank spaces cannot be notarized (a further anti-fraud measure). California explicitly prohibits notaries public from using literal foreign language translation of their title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/forms/notary-guidelines-2001.pdf Notary Public Disciplinary Guidelines.] (2001). California Secretary of State. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of a notary seal is required.

===Colorado===

Notarial acts performed in Colorado are governed under the Notaries Public Act, 12-55-101, et seq.  Pursuant to the Act, notaries are appointed by the Secretary of State for a term not to exceed four years.  Notaries may apply for appointment or reappointment online at the Secretary of State's website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sos.state.co.us/notary/pages/public/becomeNotary.xhtml]&lt;/ref&gt; A notary may apply for reappointment to the notary office 90 days before her commission expires. '''Beginning in early 2010,''' '''all new notaries will be  required to take a training course and pass an examination''' to ensure minimal competence of the Notaries Public Act.  A course of instruction approved by the Secretary of State may be administered by approved vendors and shall bear an emblem with a certification number assigned by the Secretary of State's office.  An approved course of instruction covers relevant provisions of the Colorado Notaries Public Act, the Model Notary Act, and widely accepted best practices. In addition to courses offered by approved vendors, the Secretary of State offers free certification courses at the Secretary of State's office.  To sign up for a free course, visit the notary public training page at the following link.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosos.learnercommunity.com/home]&lt;/ref&gt;  A third party seeking to verify the status of a Colorado notary may do so by visiting the Secretary of State's website at the following link.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.state.co.us/NotaryPublic/verifyNotarySearch.do Colorado Secretary of State - Verify a Notary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Constituents seeking an apostille or certificate of magistracy are requested to complete the form found on the following page before sending in their documents or presenting at the Secretary of State's office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/notary/forms/NAUTH.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Federal===
Apart from military officers (see below) there are no federal notaries. Federal law, however, provides for authentication in lieu of notarization in 28 U.S.C. 1746. That section provides that to meet any notarization requirement under federal law or practice, an unsworn declaration under penalties of perjury is sufficient. The declaration may be executed inside or outside the United States. The existence of the statute is not well known with the result that state notarizations are sought (or required) by federal officers who are unfamiliar with 28 U.S.C. 1746. &lt;ref&gt;31 J. Marshall L. Rev. 927 (1997-1998)

===Florida===

{{Main|Notary public (Florida)}}
Florida notaries public are appointed by the Governor to serve a four-year term. New applicants and commissioned notary public must be bona fide residents of the State of Florida and first time applicants must complete a mandatory three-hour education course administered by an approved educator. Florida state law also requires that a notary public post bond in the amount of $7,500.00. A bond is required in order to compensate an individual harmed as a result of a breach of duty by the notary. Applications are submitted and processed through an authorized bonding agency. Florida is one of three states (Maine and South Carolina are the others) where a notary public can solemnize the rites of matrimony (perform a marriage ceremony).&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of State. (n.d.). [http://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/education/faq/marriage.html ''Marriage ceremony''.] Viewed 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of State appoints [[Civil law notary|civil law notaries]], also called "Florida International Notaries", who must be Florida attorneys who have practiced law for five or more years. Applicants must attend a seminar and pass an exam administered by the Department of State or any private vendor approved by the department. Such civil law notaries are appointed for life and may perform all of the acts of a notary public in addition to preparing [[Act (document)|authentic acts]].

===Illinois===

Notaries public in [[Illinois]] are appointed by the [[Secretary of State of Illinois|Secretary of State]] for a four-year term. Also, residents of a state bordering Illinois ([[Iowa]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]]) who work or have a place of business in Illinois can be appointed for a one-year term. Notaries must be United States citizens (though the requirement that a notary public must be a United States citizen is unconstitutional; see ''[[Bernal v. Fainter]]''), or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence; be able to read and write the English language; be residents of (or employed within) the State of Illinois for at least 30 days; be at least 18 years old; not be convicted of a felony; and not had a notary commission revoked or suspended during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Secretary of State. 2010. [http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub16.pdf ''Notary Public Handbook''.] pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

An applicant for the notary public commission must also post a $5,000 bond, usually with an insurance company and pay an application fee of $10. The application is usually accompanied with an oath of office. If the Secretary of State's office approves the application, the Secretary of State then sends the commission to the clerk of the county where the applicant resides. If the applicant records the commission with the county clerk, he or she then receives the commission. Illinois law prohibits notaries from using the literal Spanish translation in their title and requires them to use a rubber stamp seal for their notarizations. The notary public can then perform his or her duties anywhere in the state, as long as the notary resides (or works or does business) in the county where he or she was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Secretary of State. (2010). [http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub16.pdf ''Notary Public Handbook''.] pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kentucky===
A notary public in [[Kentucky]] is a public servant appointed by either the [[Kentucky Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] or the [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] to administer oaths and take proof of execution and acknowledgements of instruments. Notaries public fulfill their duties to deter fraud and ensure proper execution. There are two separate types of notaries public that are commissioned in Kentucky. They are Notary Public: State at Large and Notary Public: Special Commission. They have two distinct sets of duties and two different routes of commissioning. For both types of commissions, applicants must be eighteen (18) years of age,  of good moral character (not a convicted felon) and capable of discharging the duties imposed upon him/her by law.  In addition, the application must be approved by one of the following officials in the county of application: a [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|Circuit Judge]], the Circuit Court Clerk, the county [[Judge/Executive]], the County Clerk, a county [[Magistrate]] or member of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. The term of office for both types of notary public is four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/bus/businessrecords/notaries/Documents/NotaryHandbook2012.PDF Kentucky Secretary of State Notary Public Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Notary Public: State at Large'' is either a resident or non-resident of Kentucky who is commissioned to perform notorial acts anywhere within the physical borders of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that may be recorded either in-state or in another state. In order to become a Notary Public: State at Large, the applicant must be a resident of the county from which he/she makes application or be principally employed in the county from which he/she makes the application. A completed application is sent to the Secretary of State's office with the required fee. Once the application is approved by the Secretary of State, the commission is sent to the county clerk in the county of application and a notice of appointment is sent to the applicant. The applicant will have thirty days to go to the county clerk's office where they will be required to 1.) Post either a [[surety bond|surety]] or property bond (bonding requirements and amounts vary by county) 2.) Take the Oath/Affirmation of Office and 3.) File and record the commission with the county clerk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/bus/businessrecords/notaries/Documents/NotaryHandbook2012.PDF Kentucky Secretary of State Notary Public Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Notary Public: Special Commission'' is either a resident or non-resident of Kentucky who is commissioned to perform notorial acts either inside or outside the borders of the Commonwealth on documents that must be recorded in Kentucky. The main difference in the appointment process is that, unlike a Notary Public: State at Large, a Notary Public: Special Commission is not required to post bond before taking the oath/affirmation nor are they required to be a resident or employed in Kentucky. In addition, where a Notary Public: State at Large is commissioned directly by the Secretary of State, a Notary Public: Special Commission is appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Secretary of State. It is permitted to hold a commission as both a Notary Public: State at Large and a Notary Public: Special Commission, however separate applications and filing fees are required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/bus/businessrecords/notaries/Documents/NotaryHandbook2012.PDF Kentucky Secretary of State Notary Public Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kentucky Notary Public is not required to use a seal or stamp and a notarization with just the signature of the notary is considered to be valid. It is, however, recommended that a seal or stamp be used as they may be required on documents recorded or used in another state. If a seal or stamp is used, it is required to have the name of the notary as listed on their commission as well as their full title of office (Notary Public: State at Large or Notary Public: Special Commission). A notary journal is also recommended but not required (except in the case of recording protests, which must be recorded in a well-bound and indexed journal).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/bus/businessrecords/notaries/Documents/NotaryHandbook2012.PDF Kentucky Secretary of State Notary Public Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana===

Louisiana notaries public are commissioned by the Governor.  They are the only notaries to be appointed for life.  The Louisiana notary public is a civil law notary with broad powers, as authorized by law, usually reserved for the American style combination "barrister/solicitor" lawyers and other legally authorized practitioners in other states. A commissioned notary in Louisiana is a civil law notary that can perform/prepare many civil law notarial acts usually associated with attorneys and other legally authorized practitioners in other states, except represent another person or entity before a court of law for a fee (unless they are also admitted to the bar). Notaries are not allowed to give "legal" advice, but they are allowed to give "notarial" advice - i.e., explain or recommend what documents are needed or required to perform a certain act - and do all things necessary or incidental to the performance of their civil law notarial duties. They can prepare any document a civil law notary can prepare (to include inventories, appraisements, partitions, wills, protests, matrimonial contracts, conveyances, and, generally, all contracts and instruments in writing) and, if ordered or requested to by a judge, prepare certain notarial legal documents, in accordance with law, to be returned and filed with that court of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lna.org/ Louisiana Notary Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the law effective 1 July 2008 imposes certain new requirements; while seals are still not required, if they are used they must be photographically reproducible.  Also, the notary's registration number must appear on any document notarized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/OfficialDocuments/Notary/2009NotaryHandbook.pdf ''A Handbook for Virginia Notaries Public.''] (2009). Richmond, Virginia: Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107041256/http://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/OfficialDocuments/Notary/2009NotaryHandbook.pdf |date=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the law effective 1 July 2008 will permit notarization of electronic signatures.

On July 1, 2012, Virginia became the first state to authorize a signer to be in a remote location and have a document notarized electronically by an approved Virginia [[eNotary|electronic notary]] using audio-visual conference technology by passing the bills SB 827 and HB 2318.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0834 | title=CHAPTER 834 | accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/notary/enotary-faq.cfm | title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming a Virginia Electronic Notary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wyoming===

[[Wyoming]] notaries public are appointed by the Secretary of State and serve a four-year term.  A Wyoming notary public has jurisdiction throughout the states of Wyoming and Montana.  These states permit notaries from neighboring states to act in the state in the same manner as one from that state under reciprocity, e.g. as long as that state grants notaries from neighboring states to act in their state.

===Controversies===

A Maryland requirement that to obtain a commission, a notary declare his belief in God, as required by the Maryland Constitution, was found by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', {{ussc|367|488|1961}} to be unconstitutional.  Historically, some states required that a notary be a [[citizen]] of the United States. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[Bernal v. Fainter]]'' {{ussc|467|216|1984}}, declared that to be impermissible.

In the U.S., there are reports of notaries (or people claiming to be notaries) having taken advantage of the differing roles of notaries in common law and civil law jurisdictions to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/statdoc/ntpublico.shtml |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404021913/http://www.sos.state.tx.us/statdoc/ntpublico.shtml |archivedate=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims of such scams are typically illegal immigrants from civil law countries who need assistance with, for example, their immigration papers and want to avoid hiring an attorney.  Confusion often results from the mistaken premise that a notary public in the United States serves the same function as a ''Notario Publico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries (which are [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries).  Prosecutions in such cases are difficult, as the victims are often deported and thus unavailable to testify.

===Military===

Certain members of the United States Armed Forces are given the powers of a notary under federal law (10 U.S.C. section 1044). Some military members have authority to certify documents or administer oaths, without being given all notarial powers.  In addition to the powers granted by the federal government, some states have enacted laws granting notarial powers to commissioned officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA403141&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=Notarial Services |accessdate=4 June 2009 |date=10 April 1997 |publisher=U.S. Army }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odon Lessley Bacqué, Jr.''', also known as '''Don Bacqué''' (born November 30, 1944), is an [[Independent (politics)|No Party]] former member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] for District 43 in [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]], [[Louisiana]], who served a single term from 1988 to 1992.&lt;ref name=lahouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2016: Lafayette Parish|publisher=House.louisiana.gov|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he released ''A Walk in the Park: A Vietnam Comedy'', a book of comedy about the foibles of the [[Vietnam War]], in which he served from 1968 to 1970.

==Background==

Bacqué (pronounced ''BAH KAY'') is one of four sons of Odon L. Bacqué, Sr. (1917-1993), and the former Lydia Aponte (1920-2007), a native of [[Puerto Rico]] who attended college in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Bacqué's brothers are Frank R. Bacqué, M.D., William J. Bacqué, and Jean Louis Bacqué (1949-1954). His [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] parents married in 1943 and moved to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], where he was born the next year. His mother, who held a degree in [[Chemistry]], was a lab instructor from 1965 to 1986 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], then known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana. Bacque's parents and brother Jean Louis are interred at Lafayette Memorial Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22489186|title=Lydia Aponte Bacqué|publisher=findagrave.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather, Frank M. Bacqué, served a single term in the Louisiana House under then [[Governor]] [[Sam Houston Jones]] from 1940 to 1944.&lt;ref name=lahouse/&gt; 
 
From 1959 to 1961, Bacqué, attended [[Charlotte Catholic High School]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]]. He returned to Lafayette for his senior year at Cathedral Carmel High School, from which he graduated in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/people/Odon-Bacque/74344001|title=Odon Bacque (Class of 1962)|publisher=classmates.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he  obtained a bachelor's degree in [[History]] from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and planned to enter law school but instead faced [[conscription]] by the [[United States Army]]. He entered officer candidate school and served in the former [[South Vietnam]] with the 5th [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]], popularly known as the [[Green Berets]]. After his two years in the military, Bacqué returned to Lafayette, launched a [[life insurance]] business, was later named to the [[Million Dollar Round Table]], and became involved in various civic affairs.&lt;ref name=bacquejr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolisolutionsgroup.com/Bacque.html|title=Odon L. Bacque, Jr., CLU|publisher=bolisolutionsgroup.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, as the president (now called chairman) of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, Bacqué supported the consolidation of the Lafayette city and parish governments.&lt;ref name=acadian/&gt; In 1983, Bacqué received the Distinguished Service Award given annually by the Lafayette [[Junior Chamber International]]. He organized a Vietnam Veterans group in Lafayette. He has served as the state co-chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Committee that built a monument in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to honor the 881 veterans from Louisiana who did not return from the war.&lt;ref name=bacquejr/&gt;

Bacqué is a past and current president of the Lafayette Estate and Business Planning Council. He is a past state president of the Louisiana Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, an organization of which he has been a member since 1970, when he entered the insurance business.&lt;ref name=bacquejr/&gt;

==Civic and political highlights==

In 1986, Bacqué was the founding chairman of Leadership Lafayette, a program sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce to train community leaders.&lt;ref name=acadian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadianabusiness.com/turk-file/1306|title=Turk File 07.25.2007|publisher=acadianabusiness.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Bacqué unseated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Michael Thompson (Louisiana politician)|Michael F. Thompson]]. In the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 24, Thompson led a three-candidate field with 7,345 votes (45 percent) to Bacqué's 6,473 (40 percent). The remaining but critical 2,377 votes were polled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Vance Lanier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10241987/10241987_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 24, 1987|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 21 [[general election]], the Lanier backers swung strongly to Bacqué, who prevailed, 6,811 (57 percent) to Thompson's 5,106 ballots (43 percent). Thompson's defeat was also attributed to the failure of some 2,200 Republican voters who participated in the primary to return to the polls for the second round of balloting. The successful Republican candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]], [[Paul Hardy]], won in Lafayette Parish over the Democratic incumbent [[Bobby Freeman (politician)|Robert "Bobby" Freeman]] at the same time that Thompson was going down to defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11211987/Default.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 21, 1987|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a freshman legislator, Bacqué stood alone in 1989, when he attempted to deny seating to newly elected representative [[David Duke]], a former figure in the [[Ku Klux Klan]], on the grounds that Duke was not a legal resident of his district. When Duke's election opponent, fellow Republican [[John S. Treen]], failed in a court challenge, Duke was seated but without Bacqué's acquiescence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], "David Duke? He's Just Another Freshman", ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pp. 157-164; {{ISBN|0-9700156-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Lafayette City and Parish President [[Joey Durel]] named Bacqué to fill the unexpired term of Don Higginbotham on the Lafayette Regional Airport Commission. Higginbotham, a Democrat-turned-Republican, had earlier served with Bacqué in the state House.&lt;ref name=acadian/&gt;

In 2010, Bacqué served for five months on the Lafayette Charter Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikestaggforlafayette.com/?tag=odon-bacque-jr|title=Odon Bacqué, Jr.|publisher=mikestaggforlafayette.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bacqué was a political donor to Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[Mary Landrieu]], who failed in her bid for a fourth term in the [[runoff election]] against Republican [[Bill Cassidy]] on December 6. He has also contributed to his own Lafayette-area former congressman, Republican [[Charles Boustany]] of [[Louisiana's 3rd congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/odon-bacque.asp?cycle=14|title=Odon Bacqué Political Campaign Contributions: 2014 Election Cycle|publisher=campaignmoney.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-fiction writer==

In 2014, Bacqué published the [[e-book]] ''A Walk in the Park: A Vietnam Comedy'', which examines comic situations he encountered in the military but without the cynicism of such well-known [[novel]]s as ''[[Catch-22]]'' or ''[[MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors]]''. Bacqué told the reporter Bill Decker of the ''[[Lafayette Daily Advertiser]]'' that his "experience wasn't heroic. It was comedic. ... Those things that we did to occupy that time is what most young people do when they’re in a crazy situation."&lt;ref name=bdecker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.theadvertiser.com/article/20140412/NEWS01/304120019/Acadiana-People-Bacque-s-book-tells-war-stories-from-behind-lines|title=Bill Decker, Acadiana People: Bacqué's book tells war stories from behind the lines, April 13, 2014|publisher=''[[Lafayette Daily Advertiser]]''|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacqué had mistakenly believed that his poor eyesight would spare him from combat. Forty years after his military service ended, Bacqué found that his memories were fading until, when he was moving to another house, he comes across some wartime letters that he had written to his wife, the former Carola Lipsey (born November 12, 1946), known as "Cookie" Bacqué, by whom he has two daughters, Leslie and Emily. The letters quickly rekindled his Vietnam experience and enabled him to write his book.&lt;ref name=bdecker/&gt;

The '''Outer Space Treaty''', formally the '''Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies''', is a [[treaty]] that forms the basis of international [[space law]]. The treaty was opened for signature in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] on 27 January 1967, and entered into force on 10 October 1967. As of October 2018, 107 countries are parties to the treaty, while another 23 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.&lt;ref name=unoda&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/outer_space  | title = Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies  | accessdate = 2017-09-16 | publisher= [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[Taiwan]], which is currently recognized by {{numrec|ROC||UN member states}}, ratified the treaty prior to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|vote to transfer China's seat]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1971.&lt;ref name=unodacn/&gt;

==Key points==

The Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international [[space law]]. Among its principles, it bars states party to the treaty from placing [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Earth]] orbit, installing them on the [[Moon]] or any other [[celestial body]], or otherwise stationing them in [[outer space]]. It exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications (Article IV). However, the treaty does not prohibit the placement of [[conventional weapons]] in orbit and thus some highly destructive attack strategies such as [[kinetic bombardment]] are still potentially allowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/ejil/chm051|title=Legality of the Deployment of Conventional Weapons in Earth Orbit: Balancing Space Law and the Law of Armed Conflict|journal=European Journal of International Law|volume=18|issue=5|pages=873|year=2007|last1=Bourbonniere|first1=M|last2=Lee|first2=R. J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also states that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and that space shall be free for exploration and use by all the States.

The treaty explicitly forbids any government to claim a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, (2003) The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wiscoscin International Law Journal, 21, at 409&lt;/ref&gt; Article II of the treaty states that "outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means." However, the State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article VIII]]&lt;/ref&gt; The State is also liable for damages caused by its space object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article VII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for activities in space==
Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty deals with international responsibility, stating that "the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty" and that States Parties shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities.

As a result of discussions arising from [[Project West Ford]] in 1963, a consultation clause was included in Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty: "A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment."&lt;ref&gt;Terrill Jr., Delbert R. (May 1999), [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/space/terrill.pdf Project West Ford], "The Air Force Role in Developing International Outer Space Law" (PDF), Air Force History and Museums:63–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IX]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==

===List of parties===

The Outer Space Treaty was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, and entered into force on 10 October 1967. As of July 2017, 107 countries are parties to the treaty, while another 23 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.&lt;ref name=unoda/&gt;

Multiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location.  This location is noted by: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington, DC.  Also indicated is whether the state became a party by way of signing the treaty and subsequent [[ratification]], or by [[wikt:accession|accession]] to the treaty after it had closed for signature.

===Partially recognized state abiding by treaty===
The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by {{numrec|ROC||UN member states}}, ratified the treaty prior to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|vote to transfer China's seat]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1971.  When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the Republic of China's (ROC) ratification as "illegal".  The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that they still consider them to be "bound by its obligations".&lt;ref name=unodacn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/a/outer_space/china/acc/washington|title=China: Accession to Outer Space Treaty|accessdate=2015-03-01|publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">'''Party of New Type (PNT)''' is a voluntary public association in Russia, formed on an informal basis of a common world outlook. It  is not an officially registered party. S.Sulakshin is Chairman of the Party and one of the self-nominated candidates in [[2018 Russian Presidential Election|the 2018 Russian presidential election]].
== History of creation ==
In the scientific circulation  the term "party of new type" was entered into by [[Lenin, V. I.|Vladmir Lenin]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 2015, the General Director of the Center for Political Thought and Ideology, Stepan Sulakshin, announced the idea of creating  PNT as opposition to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ng.ru/politics/2015-10-29/1_partia.html|title="Партия нового типа" ищет руководителя|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he made a declaration of intent to create a "party of new type." Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] also used the phrase, in reference to the [[United Russia]] party: "The past election campaign marked the beginning of the most important stage for our Party - the formation of a new type of party." It is likely that the formulation was included in the speech of the prime minister by the efforts of the speechwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://er.ru/news/146613/|title=Медведев: «Единая Россия» находится на этапе формирования Партии нового типа|date=24 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The founding congress of PNT was held on June 17, 2017. At the congress it was decided to create a party as a public association without registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuromir.tv/uchreditelnyy-syezd-partii-novogo-tipa/|title=учредительный Съезд|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1pnt.ru/uchreditelnyy-syezd-pnt/uchred2017|title=Есть такая партия! Партия нового типа. ПНТ|website=1pnt.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Ideology ==
Sulakshin S. refused to call the party's agenda left-patriotic, explaining that it "has a universal program aimed at all citizens." PNT stands on the balanced political platform of a "solidary society" in which revolutions and expropriations will never again occur, but will be based on "work, justice and freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ng.ru/politics/2017-09-29/1_7084_sulakshin.html|title=Конкуренцию Путину хочет составить еще один несистемный кандидат|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retsstat symbol, Justice Party of Denmark, 1939.svg|thumb|160px|The concept in its Danish variant (''Retsstat''), as illustrated in [[Justice Party of Denmark|Justice Party]] propaganda, 1939]]
'''''Rechtsstaat''''' is a [[doctrine]] in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking, originating in [[Germany|German]]  [[jurisprudence]].  It can be translated into English as "[[rule of law]]", alternatively "legal state", "state of law", "state of justice", "state of rights", or "state based on justice and integrity".&lt;ref&gt;The word also occurs, with the same meaning, in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Rechtsstaat'' is a "[[Constitutionality|constitutional]] [[State (polity)|state]]" in which the exercise of [[government|governmental power]] is constrained by the [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], ''The Concept of the Political'', ch. 7; ''Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt; and is often tied to the [[Anglo-America]]n concept of the [[rule of law]], but differs from it in that it also emphasizes what is [[Justice|just]] (i.e., a concept of [[morality|moral]] rightness based on [[ethics]], [[rationality]], [[law]], [[natural law]], [[religion]], or [[Equity (law)|equity]]). Thus it is the opposite of ''Obrigkeitsstaat'' or ''Nichtrechtsstaat'' (a state based on the arbitrary use of power),&lt;ref&gt;''The Legal Doctrines of the Rule of Law and the Legal State (Rechtsstaat)''.
Editors: Silkenat, James R., Hickey Jr., James E., Barenboim, Peter D. (Eds.), Springer, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and of ''[[Unrechtsstaat]]'' (a non-''Rechtsstaat'' with the capacity to become one after a period of historical development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerd Roellecke |publisher=FAZ.net |url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCF3AEB154CE64960822FA5429A182360/Doc~E5C24C1DE09D24A248777027712B9409C~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html?rss_aktuell |format= |title=War die DDR ein Unrechtsstaat? |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Rechtsstaat'', the power of the state is limited in order to protect [[citizen]]s from the arbitrary exercise of [[authority]]. The citizens share legally based [[civil liberties]] and can use the [[court]]s. 

==Immanuel Kant==
{{also|Rule according to higher law}}
German writers usually place the theories of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the ''Rechtsstaat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant did not use the word ''Rechtsstaat'', but contrasted an existing state (''Staat'') with an ideal, constitutional state (''Republik'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heuschling|first=Luc|title=État de droit, Rechtsstaat, Rule of Law|location=Paris|publisher=Dalloz|date=2002|language=French|pages=54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written [[constitution]]. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea: a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity. Kant proposed that this happiness be guaranteed by a moral constitution agreed on by the people and thus, under it, by moral government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Reiss|editor-first=Hans|translator=H.B. Nisbet|title=Kant's Political Writings|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|date=1971|pages=79, 117-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation| Kant's political teaching may be summarized in a phrase: republican government and international organization. In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (''Rechtsstaat'') and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law.' ... Taking simply by itself, Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' because they flow from the very concept of law. A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Strauss|editor1-first=Leo||editor2-last=Cropsey|editor2-first=Joseph|title=History of Political Philosophy|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1987|pages=581-2, 603}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actual expression ''Rechtsstaat'' appears to have been introduced by [[Carl Theodor Welcker]] in 1813,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welcker|first=Karl Theodor|title=Die letzten Gründe von Recht, Staat und Strafe|location=Giessen|date=1813}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was popularised by [[Robert von Mohl]]'s book ''Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates'' ("German Policy Science according to the Principles of the Constitutional State") (1832–33). Von Mohl contrasted government through policy with government, in a Kantian spirit, under general rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heuschling|first=Luc|title=État de droit, Rechtsstaat, Rule of Law|location=Paris|publisher=Dalloz|date=2002|language=French|pages=36-40}} In this context ''Polizei'' means "policy", not "police": Stewart, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of the ''Rechtsstaat''==
[[File:DBP 1981 1105 Grundgedanken der Demokratie.jpg|thumb|German stamp (1981). ''Rechtsstaat, Fundamental Concept of Democracy - "The legislature is bound by the constitutional order, the executive and the judiciary by law and right." (Article 20(3) [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]])'']]
The most important principles of the ''Rechtsstaat'' are:&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Stern, Das Staatsrecht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, I 2nd edition, § 20, Munich 1984, {{ISBN|3-406-09372-8}}; Reinhold Zippelius, Allgemeine Staatslehre/Politikwissenschaft, 16th edition, §§ 8 II, 30-34, Munich 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-406-60342-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The state is based on the supremacy of national constitution and guarantees the safety and [[constitutional rights]] of its citizens
* [[Civil society]] is an equal partner to the state
* [[Separation of powers]], with the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of government limiting one another's power and providing for checks and balances
* The [[judicature]] and the [[Executive branch|executive]] are bound by law (not acting against the law), and the legislature is bound by constitutional principles
* Both the [[legislature]] and democracy itself are bound by elementary constitutional rights and principles
* [[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] of state acts and the requirement of providing a reason for all state acts
* Review of state decisions and state acts by independent organs, including an appeal process
* Hierarchy of laws and the requirement of clarity and definiteness
* Reliability of state actions, protection of past dispositions made in good faith against later state actions, prohibition of [[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]]
* Principle of the [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] of state action

==Russian model of ''Rechtsstaat'': a concept of the legal state==
The [[Law of the Russian Federation|Russian legal system]], borne out of transformations in the 19th century under the reforms of Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], is based primarily on the German legal tradition. It was from here that Russia borrowed a doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "legal state". The concept of "legal state" ({{Lang-ru|Правовое государство, pravovoe gosudarstvo}}) is a fundamental (but undefined) principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s [[Constitution of the Russian Federation|post-Communist constitution]]: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the first dispositive provision of [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukraine’s Constitution]] declares: "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." The effort to give meaning to the expression "legal state" is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]], wrote in 2003:

:Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform''], ed. Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of legal state adopted many elements of [[constitutional economics]]. [[Constitutional economics]] is a field of [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] that describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy, including the [[budget process]]. The term "constitutional economics" was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new academic sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the [[Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making." According to Buchanan, the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and "may be called the idealized [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] world" where the individual "who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[State (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." He believes that a [[constitution]], intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the state and society against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html Buchanan Entry at Nobel site]&lt;/ref&gt; The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual [[budget]] planning, as well as the latter's [[Transparency in government|transparency]] to the civil society, are of primary importance to the implementation of the [[rule of law]]. Moreover, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment]] of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. "[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Some Russian researchers support an idea that, in the 21st century, the concept of the legal state has become not only a legal but also an economic concept, at least for Russia and many other transitional and developing countries.

'''Richard FitzAlan, 4th or 11th Earl of Arundel and 9th Earl of Surrey''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Garter|KG]]&lt;/small&gt; (1346 &amp;ndash; 21 September 1397) was an English medieval nobleman and military commander.

==Lineage==
Born in 1346, he was the son of [[Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel]] and [[Eleanor of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=CP&gt;G. E. C. ''The Complete Peerage'' p. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father to the title of [[Earl of Arundel]] on 24 January 1376.

His brother was [[Thomas Arundel]], the [[Bishop of Ely]] from 1374 to 1388, [[Archbishop of York]] from 1388 to 1397, and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1397 and from 1399 until his death in 1414.&lt;ref name=Powell398&gt;Powell, et al. ''The House of Lords'' p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[coronation]] of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], Richard FitzAlan carried the [[Coronation crown|crown]].&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;

==Admiral==
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 328 - Arundel, Gloucester, Nottingham, Derby, and Warwick, Before the King.jpg|300px|right|thumb|'''Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel'''; [[w:Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester]]; [[w:Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham]]; [[w:Henry IV of England|Henry, Earl of Derby]] (later Henry IV); and [[w:Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]], demand [[w:Richard II of England|Richard II]] to let them prove by arms the justice for their rebellion]]

In 1377, Richard FitzAlan held the title of [[Admiral]] of the West and South.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; In this capacity, he attacked [[Harfleur]] at [[Whitsun]] 1378, but was forced to return to his ships by the defenders. Later, he and [[John of Gaunt]] attempted to seize [[Saint-Malo]] but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Seward124&gt;Seward ''The Hundred Years War'' p. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power Struggle===
FitzAlan was closely aligned with [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas, Duke of Gloucester]], who was uncle of [[King Richard II]]. Thomas was opposed to Richard II's desire for peace with [[France]] in the [[Hundred Years War]] and a power struggle ensued between him and Gloucester. In late 1386, Gloucester forced King Richard II to name himself and Richard FitzAlan to the King's Council.&lt;ref name=Seward136&gt;Seward ''The Hundred Years War'' p. 136-139&lt;/ref&gt; This Council was to all intents and purposes a Regency Council for Richard II. However, Richard limited the duration of the Council's powers to one year.&lt;ref name=Powell400&gt;Powell et al. ''The House of Lords'' p. 400-401&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knight of the Garter===
In 1386, Richard II named Richard FitzAlan [[Admiral]] of England and made him a [[Knight of the Garter]].&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; As Admiral of England, he defeated a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off [[Margate]] in March 1387, along with [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray]], [[Earl of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=Powell400/&gt;

==New favourites==
In August 1387, the King dismissed Gloucester and FitzAlan from the Council and replaced them with his favourites - including the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Alexander Neville]]; the [[Duke of Ireland]], [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere]]; [[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Michael de la Pole]]; the [[Earl of Suffolk]], Sir [[Robert Tresilian]], who was the Chief Justice; and the former [[Mayor of London]] [[Nicholas Brembre]].&lt;ref name=Powell404&gt;Powell et al. ''The House of Lords'' p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radcot Bridge==
The King summoned Gloucester and FitzAlan to a meeting. However, instead of coming, they raised troops and defeated the new Council at [[Battle of Radcot Bridge|Radcot Bridge]] on 22 December 1387. During that battle, they took the favourites prisoner. The next year, the [[Merciless Parliament]] condemned the favourites.

FitzAlan was one of the [[Lords Appellant]] who accused and condemned Richard II's favorites.&lt;ref name=Seward136/&gt; He made himself particularly odious to the King by refusing, along with Gloucester, to spare the life of Sir [[Simon de Burley]] who had been condemned by the Merciless Parliament. This was even after the queen, [[Anne of Bohemia]], went down on her knees before them to beg for mercy. King Richard never forgave this humiliation and planned and waited for his moment of revenge.

In 1394, FitzAlan further antagonized the King by arriving late for the queen's funeral. Richard II, in a rage, snatched a wand and struck FitzAlan in the face and drew blood.  Shortly after that, the King feigned a reconciliation but he was only biding his time for the right moment to strike.  Arundel was named Governor of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in 1388.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;

===Opposed to peace===
Peace was concluded with France in 1389. However, Richard FitzAlan followed Gloucester's lead and stated that he would never agree with the peace that had been concluded.&lt;ref name=Seward136/&gt;

==Marriage and children==
Arundel married twice.

His first wife was [[Elizabeth de Bohun]], daughter of [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton]] and [[Elizabeth de Badlesmere]]. They married around 28 September 1359 and had seven children:&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Cawley, ''Medieval Lands, Earls of Arundel (Fitzalan)''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his first wife in 1385, Arundel married Philippa Mortimer, daughter of [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]]. Her mother was [[Philippa Plantagenet]], the only daughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp]] and thus a granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. They had no children.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;

'''SMS ''Admiral Spaun'''''{{efn|name=SMS}} was a [[scout cruiser]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. Named for Admiral and ''Marinekommandant'' (Commander-in-Chief of the Navy) [[Hermann von Spaun]], ''Admiral Spaun'' was constructed shortly before [[World War I]]. [[Laid down]] at the [[Pula|Pola]] Navy Yard in May 1908, the cruiser was launched in October 1909. ''Admiral Spaun'' was commissioned into the Navy just over a year later, in November 1910. The first ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy to be constructed with [[steam turbine]]s, her design later influenced the construction of the {{sclass-|Novara|cruiser|2}}s.

''Admiral Spaun'' served as the [[flotilla leader]] of the Second Torpedo Flotilla at the outbreak of World War I and was stationed out of the naval base at [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. She saw limited action during the first year of the war, and following Italy's declaration of war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, the cruiser participated in [[Bombardment of Ancona|a bombardment of the Italian coastline]]. Throughout the rest of 1915, ''Admiral Spaun'' engaged in various operations across the [[Adriatic Sea]]. While she was involved in missions centred mostly around [[Trieste]] in the northern Adriatic for the rest of the war, ''Admiral Spaun'' also participated in many of Austria-Hungary's naval operations as far south as the [[Otranto Barrage]] and the [[Strait of Otranto]], alongside the ''Novara''-class cruisers.

Emboldened by the Austro-Hungarian victory during the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]], and determined to break the Otranto Barrage with a major attack on the strait, Austria-Hungary's newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet (German: ''Flottenkommandant'') [[Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya]] organised a massive attack on the Allied forces with ''Admiral Spaun'', alongside seven [[battleship]]s, three cruisers, four destroyers, four torpedo boats, and numerous submarines and aircraft, but the operation was abandoned after the battleship {{SMS|Szent István||2}} was sunk by the Italian [[motor torpedo boat]] ''[[MAS (motorboat)|MAS-15]]'' on the morning of 10 June.

After the sinking of ''Szent István'', the ships returned to port where they remained for the rest of the war. When Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in October 1918, the Austrian government transferred its navy to the newly formed [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in order to avoid having to hand the ship over to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Following the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] in November 1918, ''Admiral Spaun'' was seized by the Allies and transferred to Italy, where she participated in a victory parade through the [[Venice Lagoon]] in March 1919. The final distribution of Austria-Hungary's former navy was settled under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in 1920. ''Admiral Spaun'' was ceded to the United Kingdom before being sold for scrap and broken up between 1920 and 1921.

==Background==
[[File:Rudolf Montecuccoli.png|thumb|left|upright|Rudolf Montecuccoli, ''Marinekommandant'' of the Austro-Hungarian Navy from 1904 to 1913|alt=A black-and-white photo of an elderly naval officer in full dress uniform, with several medals pinned to his left breast.]]
In 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy consisted of ten battleships of various types, three armoured cruisers, six protected cruisers, eight torpedo vessels, and 68 torpedo craft. The total tonnage of the navy was {{convert|131000|t|LT ST}}.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=35}} While the navy was capable of defending the coastline of Austria-Hungary, this fleet was drastically outclassed by other major [[Mediterranean]] navies, namely Italy and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=19}} Following the establishment of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904,{{efn|name=ANL Name}} and the October appointment of Vice-Admiral [[Rudolf Montecuccoli]] to the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (German: ''Marinekommandant'') and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: ''Chef der Marinesektion''),{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=170}}{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=38}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy began an expansion program suitable for that of a [[Great Power]]. Montecuccoli immediately pursued the efforts championed by his predecessor, Admiral [[Hermann von Spaun]], and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy.{{sfn|Vego|1996|pp=38–39}}

During the first decade of the 20th century, Austria-Hungary's naval policy began to shift away from simply coastal defence, to projecting power into the Adriatic and even Mediterranean Seas. This change in policy was motivated by both internal and external factors. New railroads had been constructed through Austria's [[Central Eastern Alps|Alpine passes]] between 1906 and 1908, linking Trieste and the Dalmatian coastline to the rest of the Empire and providing the interior of Austria-Hungary with quicker access to the sea than ever before. Lower tariffs on the port of Trieste aided the expansion of the city and a similar growth in Austria-Hungary's merchant marine. These changes necessitated the development of a new line of battleships capable of more than the defence of Austria-Hungary's coastline.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=68–69}}

Prior to the turn of the century, [[sea power]] had not been a priority in Austrian foreign policy, and the navy had little public interest or support. The appointment of Archduke Franz Ferdinand – heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne and a prominent and influential supporter of naval expansion – to the position of [[admiral]] in September 1902 greatly increased the importance of the navy in the eyes of both the general public and the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=68}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=144}} Franz Ferdinand's interest in naval affairs stemmed primarily from his belief that a strong navy would be necessary to compete with Italy, which he viewed as Austria-Hungary's greatest regional threat.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=43}}

===Austro-Italian naval arms race===
As the first scout cruiser of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''Admiral Spaun'' was authorized when Austria-Hungary was engaged in a naval arms race with its nominal ally, Italy.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=194}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=158}} Italy's Regia Marina was considered the most-important naval power in the region which Austria-Hungary measured itself against, often unfavourably. The disparity between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian navies had existed for decades; in the late 1880s Italy boasted the third-largest fleet in the world, behind the [[French Navy]] and the British [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=128}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=173}} While that disparity had been somewhat equalized with the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and the [[German Imperial Navy]] surpassing the Italian Navy in 1893 and in 1894,{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=128}} by 1904 the balance began to shift towards Italy's favour once more.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=173}} Indeed, by 1904 the size of the Italian Regia Marina was by tonnage was over twice that of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and while the two nations had relatively even numbers of battleships, Italy had over twice as many cruisers.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=36}}

===Montecuccoli's plan===
''Admiral Spaun'' first conceived on paper in early 1905 when Montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern Austrian fleet as part of his plan to construct a navy large enough to contest the Adriatic Sea. This initial plan consisted of 12 battleships, four armoured cruisers, eight scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 high seas torpedo craft, and six submarines. While specifics had yet to be drawn up, the four cruisers in Montecuccoli's plan would ultimately become ''Admiral Spaun'' and the three ships of the ''Novara'' class.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=39}}{{sfn|Kiszling|1934|p=739}} Due to a political crisis within the Hungarian government, a vote on Montecuccoli's proposed program was delayed for most of 1905. It would not be until the end of the year before the Austrian and Hungarian Delegations for Common Affairs approved Montecuccoli's program. Under the terms of the budget agreement, 121,000,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Krone]] was set aside for warship construction over a period of three years, with the installments for this special credit being retroactively pushed back to 1904. The budget lacked funding for the three other cruisers Montecuccoli wished to construct, but included funding for the three {{sclass-|Erzherzog Karl|battleship|1}}s, six destroyers, and ''Admiral Spaun''.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=39}}

Designed for scouting missions,{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=181}} ''Admiral Spaun'' was based on the premise that the theater of operations she would operate in would be largely confined to the Adriatic Sea. She was intended to act as a fast moving scout cruiser capable of conducting hit-and-run missions while also threatening communications and convoy routes.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}} Montecuccoli believed that should Austria-Hungary be drawn into a larger naval conflict encompassing the Mediterranean, ''Admiral Spaun'' would still be capable of fulfilling her role successfully and that a class of [[battlecruiser]]s was not necessary for such a scenario.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=74}} Following the construction of ''Admiral Spaun'', her design was so well received that she was used to influence the construction of the three ''Novara''-class cruisers which followed her.{{sfn|Vego|1996|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Noppen|2016|p=20}} The similarities between ''Admiral Spaun'' and the ''Novara''s were so close that despite being different classes, both contemporary and modern publications occasionally link all four ships together as members of the same class.{{sfn|Henderson|1919|p=353}}{{sfn|Gill|1916|p=307}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=266}} ''Admiral Spaun'' had a crew of 320–327 officers and men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=33}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}{{efn|name=Complement}}

''Admiral Spaun'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|130.6|m|ftin}}. At the [[waterline length|waterline]], the cruiser had a length of {{convert|129.7|m|ftin}}, while her [[length between perpendiculars]] measured {{convert|125.2|m|ftin}}. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.8|m|ftin}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|5.3|m|ftin}} at [[deep load]]. She was designed to displace {{convert|3500|t|LT ST}} at normal load, but at full combat load she displaced {{convert|4000|t|LT ST}}. The propulsion systems of the ship consisted of six [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbines and four shafts. These turbines were designed to provide {{convert|25130-25254|shp|kW|abbr=on}}{{efn|name=Propulsion}} and were powered by 16 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, giving ''Admiral Spaun'' a top speed of {{convert|27.07|kn}} during her sea trials.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=33}}{{sfn|Alger|1910|p=1150}}

''Admiral Spaun'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of seven 50-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[Škoda 10 cm K10|{{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed forward on the [[forecastle]] of the ship, four were located amidship, two on either side, and one was located on the [[quarterdeck]]. She also possessed a [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss#Austro-Hungarian service|{{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] SFK L/44 gun. A Škoda [[Škoda 7 cm K10|{{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}}/50 K10]] [[anti-aircraft gun]] and four {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes in twin mounts were added to ''Admiral Spaun'' in 1916.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=33}} The guns of ''Admiral Spaun'' were of a smaller caliber than many other cruisers of the era,{{sfn|Dickson|O'Hara|Worth|2013|p=25}} which led to plans to remove the guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the ship and replace them with a pair of {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|1}} guns fore and aft, but these modifications were not able to take place before the war ended. Her smaller armament was due in part because of a desire within the Austro-Hungarian Navy for ''Admiral Spaun'' to have a faster speed and greater armour than most other contemporary cruisers of the era. As a result, the armament of the cruiser had to be scaled down.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}

''Admiral Spaun'' was protected at the waterline waterline by an [[armored belt|armoured belt]] which measured {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidship. The guns had {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[gun shield|shields]], while the thickness of the deck for the ship was {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}}.

==Construction==
[[File:Admiral Spaun launched.png|thumb|The launching of ''Admiral Spaun'' from the Pola Navy Yard on 30 October 1909|alt=]]
''Admiral Spaun'' was laid down at the [[Pola Navy Yard]] on 30 May 1908.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}} During construction, [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] struck an agreement with the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company to allow for the construction of ''Admiral Spaun''{{'}}s steam turbines to be assembled in Trieste using materials found from within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=181}} She was the first ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy to be constructed with steam turbines.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}

In September 1909, Montecuccoli proposed to the Austro-Hungarian Ministerial Council a budget for 1910 which would authorise construction on the three cruisers of the ''Novara'' class, alongside the four dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|0}} battleships and several torpedo boats and submarines. While Montecuccoli's desire to construct a new class of cruisers was delayed, this time due to the financial costs Austria-Hungary took on following the annexation of Bosnia and the mobilisation of her fleet and army at the height of [[Bosnian crisis]], the navy was given funds to speed up completion of the {{sclass-|Radetzky|battleship|0}} battleships and ''Admiral Spaun''.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=62}}

After nearly a year and a half of construction, ''Admiral Spaun'' was launched on 30 October 1909.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=58}} Thereafter, she conducted sea trials for a year. When ''Admiral Spaun'' was ordered, she was designed to attain a speed greater than contemporary cruisers found in other navies around the world, such as the [[United States Navy]] and the British [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}} In September 1910, it was reported that she obtained a top speed of {{convert|27.07|kn}}. This was {{convert|1.07|kn}} faster than her contracted speed.{{sfn|Alger|1910|p=1150}} After the conclusion of her sea trials, ''Admiral Spaun'' was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 15 November 1910.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}

== Service history ==
===Pre-war===
[[File:Admiral Spaun at rest.png|thumb|''Admiral Spaun'' at rest|alt=|left]]
Within a year of ''Admiral Spaun''{{'}}s commissioning into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the [[Italo-Turkish War]] erupted in September 1911. Despite the fact that Austria-Hungary and Italy remained nominal allies under the Triple Alliance, tensions between the two nations remained high throughout the war. The Austro-Hungarian Navy was placed on high alert, while the Army was deployed to the Italian border.{{sfn|Vego|1996|pp=87–88}} While the war would ultimately become localised at the request of Austria-Hungary to parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and Libya, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out even before Italy and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were able to conclude a peace agreement. Once again, the Ottoman military proved insufficient to defeat its opponents. The [[Balkan League]] of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro swiftly overran the Ottoman Empire's last remaining European possessions in a matter of weeks.{{sfn|Vego|1996|pp=134–136}} By November 1912, Serbia appeared poised to obtain a port on the Adriatic Sea. Austria-Hungary strongly opposed this as a Serbian port on the Adriatic could drastically alter the balance of power in the region, bring Serbia and Italy closer together through economic ties, and also serve as a Russian naval base.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=139}}

Austria-Hungary found support from Italy, who opposed Serbian access to the Adriatic on the belief that Russia would use any Serbian ports to station its Black Sea fleet. Italy also feared that Austria-Hungary itself would one day annex Serbia, and thus gain more Adriatic coastline without handing over any Italian-speaking territories such as Trentino or Trieste.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=139}} Russia and Serbia both protested to Vienna this objection to a potential Serbian coastline. By the end of November 1912, the threat of conflict between Austria-Hungary, Italy, Serbia, and Russia, coupled with allegations of Serbian mistreatment of the Austro-Hungarian consul in [[Prizren|Prisrena]] led to a war scare in the Balkans. Both Russian and Austria-Hungary began mobilizing troops along their border, while Austria-Hungary began to mobilize against Serbia. During the crisis, the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was also fully mobilized. At the time, several Austro-Hungarian warships had already been deployed to the Aegean Sea or the city of [[History of Istanbul#Ottoman Empire|Constantinople]] to protect Austro-Hungarian interests during the Italo-Turkish War and the First Balkan War. The Navy subsequently ordered ''Admiral Spaun'' and {{SMS|Aspern||2}} from their stations in Constantinople. They were ordered to join the rest of the fleet in the Aegean Sea in the event of a war with Serbia and Russia.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=140}}

By December 1912, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had, in addition to ''Admiral Spaun'', a total of seven battleships, five cruisers, eight destroyers, 28 torpedo boats, and six submarines ready for combat.{{sfn|Vego|1996|p=140}} The crisis eventually subsided after the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]], which granted Serbia free access to the sea through an internationally-supervised railroad, while at the same time establishing an independent Albania. The Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy was subsequently demobilised on 28 May 1913.{{sfn|Vego|1996|pp=144–145, 153}}

In June 1914, the battleship {{SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} was tasked with transporting Archduke Franz Ferdinand to the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in order to watch military manoeuvres. Following the manoeuvres, Ferdinand and [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|his wife Sophie]] planned to visit [[Sarajevo]] to open the state museum in its new premises.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=9, 285}} On 24 June the battleship brought the Archduke from Trieste to the [[Neretva|Narenta River]], where he boarded a yacht which took him north towards Sarajevo. After observing the military maneuvers for three days, the Archduke met his wife in Sarajevo. On 28 June 1914, they were shot to death by [[Gavrilo Princip]].{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=36}}

Upon hearing of the assassination, ''Marinekommandant'' [[Anton Haus]] sailed south from Pola with an escort fleet comprising ''Admiral Spaun'', ''Viribus Unitis''{{'}}s sister ship {{SMS|Tegetthoff||2}}, and several torpedo boats. Two days after their murders, Ferdinand and Sophia's bodies were transferred aboard ''Viribus Unitis'', which had been anchored waiting to receive the Archduke for his return, and were transported back to Trieste.{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=238}} ''Viribus Unitis'' was shadowed by Haus' escort fleet for the journey, with the fleet moving slowly along the Dalmatian coast, usually within sight of land. Coastal towns and villages rang church bells when the ships passed while spectators watched the fleet from the shoreline.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=244}} The Archduke's death triggered the [[July Crisis]], culminating in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on 28 July 1914.{{sfn|Stevenson|1996|p=12}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=245}}

===1914===
{{see also|Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau}}
[[File:Admiral Spaun underway.png|thumb|''Admiral Spaun'' underway|alt=]]
Events unfolded rapidly in the ensuing days. On 30 July 1914, Russia declared full mobilisation in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia. Austria-Hungary declared full mobilisation the next day. On 1 August, both Germany and France ordered full mobilisation and Germany declared war on Russia in support of Austria-Hungary. While relations between Austria-Hungary and Italy had improved greatly in the two years following the 1912 renewal of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]],{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=232–234}} increased Austro-Hungarian naval spending, political disputes over influence in [[Principality of Albania|Albania]], and Italian concerns over the potential annexation of land in the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] caused the relationship between the two allies to falter in the months leading up to the war.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=245–246}} Italy's 1 August declaration of neutrality in the war dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes to use their larger ships—including ''Admiral Spaun''—in major combat operations in the Mediterranean, as the navy had been relying upon coal stored in Italian ports to operate in conjunction with the Regia Marina. By 4 August, Germany had already [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|occupied Luxembourg]] and [[German invasion of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] after declaring war on France. The United Kingdom subsequently declared war on Germany that same day in support of Belgian neutrality.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=246}}

Shortly after the onset of the war, the assistance of the Austro-Hungarian fleet was called upon by the German [[Mediterranean Division]], which consisted of the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||2}} and light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||2}}.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=53}} The German ships were attempting to break out of [[Messina]], where they had been taking on coal prior to the outbreak of war. By the first week of August, British ships had begun to assemble off Messina in an attempt to trap the Germans. While Austria-Hungary had not yet fully mobilised its fleet, a force was assembled to assist the German ships. This consisted of ''Admiral Spaun'', along with the three ''Radetzky''s and the three ''Tegetthoff''s, the armoured cruiser {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}, six destroyers, and 13 torpedo boats.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=248–249}} The Austro-Hungarian high command, wary of instigating war with Great Britain, ordered the fleet to avoid the British ships and to only support the Germans openly while they were in Austro-Hungarian waters. On 7 August, when the Germans [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|broke out of Messina]], the Austro-Hungarian fleet had begun to sail for [[Brindisi]] to link up with the Germans and escort their ships to a friendly port in Austria-Hungary. However, the German movement toward the mouth of the Adriatic had been a diversion to throw the British and French off their pursuit, and the German ships instead rounded the southern tip of Greece and made their way to the [[Dardanelles]], where they would eventually be sold to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Rather than follow the German ships towards the [[Black Sea]], the Austrian fleet returned to Pola.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=249, 258–259}}

Following France and Britain's declarations of war on Austria-Hungary on 11 and 12 August respectively, the French Admiral [[Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère]] was issued orders to close off Austro-Hungarian shipping at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea and to engage any Austro-Hungarian ships his Anglo-French fleet came across. Lapeyrère chose to attack the Austro-Hungarian ships blockading Montenegro. The ensuing [[Battle of Antivari]] ended Austria-Hungary's blockade, and effectively placed the Strait of Otranto firmly in the hands of Britain and France.{{sfn|Koburger|2001|pp=33, 35}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=251}}

After the Battle of Antivari and [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|the breakout of ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'']] from Messina, the Austro-Hungarian Navy saw very little action, with many of its ships spending much of their time in port. The navy's general inactivity was partly caused by a fear of mines in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=144}} Other factors contributed to the lack of naval activity in the first year of the war. Admiral Haus was fearful that direct confrontation with the French Navy, even if it should be successful, would weaken the Austro-Hungarian Navy to the point that Italy would have a free hand in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=260}} This concern was so great to Haus that he wrote in September 1914, "So long as the possibility exists that Italy will declare war against us, I consider it my first duty to keep our fleet intact."{{sfn|Halpern|1987|p=30}} Haus' decision to keep his fleet in port earned sharp criticism from the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], the German Navy, and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry,{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=261}} but it also led to a far greater number of Allied naval forces being devoted to the Mediterranean and the Strait of Otranto. These could have been used elsewhere, such as against the Ottoman Empire during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=380–381}} Throughout the rest of 1914, ''Admiral Spaun'' was among the most active ships in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, despite chronic engine problems.{{sfn|Dickson|O'Hara|Worth|2013|pp=31–35}}

===1915===
[[File:Admiral Spaun underway2.png|left|thumb|''Admiral Spaun'' at sea]]
By January 1915, Haus had adopted a cautious strategy to preserve his fleet, as Austria-Hungary was drastically outnumbered by the Anglo-French fleets in the Mediterranean, and the attitude of Austria-Hungary's erstwhile ally Italy remained unknown. Haus decided the best course of action would be to act as a [[fleet in being]], which would tie down Allied naval forces, while torpedo boats, [[naval mine|mines]], and raids with fast cruisers like ''Admiral Spaun'' could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the enemy fleets before a decisive battle could be fought.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=141}}

However, engine and other machinery problems related to her propulsion systems hindered ''Admiral Spaun''{{'}}s abilities to be deployed for operations in the Adriatic in a similar fashion to the ships of the ''Novara'' class. Indeed, Gardiner and Grey write in ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906–1921'' that "the ship suffered so many teething troubles with her engines that she never participated in the cruiser operations of her successors, although she saw wartime service in minor and less dangerous roles."{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}} Instead, the ships of the ''Novara'' class continued operations in the Adriatic, conducting missions such as towing [[U-boat]]s out into the Mediterranean or raiding Allied convoys and drifters guarding the Straight of Otranto.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=268}} Nevertheless, ''Admiral Spaun'' would participate in the largest and most successful Austro-Hungarian naval operation of the war following Italy's entry into the conflict on the side of the Allies in May 1915.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=144}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=107}}

===Bombardment of Ancona===

Smoke can be seen coming out of both the land and the guns of each ship.]]
After failed negotiations with Germany and Austria-Hungary over Italy joining the war as a member of the [[Central Powers]], the Italians negotiated with the [[Triple Entente]] for Italy's eventual entry into the war on their side in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], signed on 26 April 1915.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=272}} On 4 May Italy formally renounced her alliance to Germany and Austria-Hungary, giving the Austro-Hungarians advanced warning that Italy was preparing to go to war against them. On 20 May, Emperor Franz Joseph&amp;nbsp;I gave the Austro-Hungarian Navy authorisation to attack Italian ships convoying troops in the Adriatic or sending supplies to Montenegro. Haus meanwhile made preparations for his fleet to sortie out into the Adriatic in a massive strike against the Italians the moment war was declared. On 23 May 1915, between two and four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola,{{efn|name=Ancona}} the Austro-Hungarian fleet, including ''Admiral Spaun'', departed to bombard the Italian coast.{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=144}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=107}}

During the Austro-Hungarian attacks along the Italian coastline, ''Admiral Spaun'', the cruisers {{SMS|Saida||2}}, {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, and {{SMS|Szigetvár||2}}, as well as nine destroyers, provided a screen against a possible Italian counterattack. The expected Italian counterattack failed to materialize however. While scouting in the southern Adriatic, ''Admiral Spaun'' bombarded the port of [[Termoli]], inflicting damage on a railway bridge and freight train, before moving on to [[Campomarino]] where she shelled the city's freight yard and train station buildings, destroying both.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=274–275}} Meanwhile, the core of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, spearheaded by the ships of the ''Tegetthoff'' class, made their way to [[Ancona]]. The [[bombardment of Ancona]] was a major success for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In the port of Ancona, an Italian steamer was destroyed and three others damaged, while an Italian destroyer—''Turbine''—was sunk further south. The infrastructure of the port of Ancona and the surrounding towns was severely damaged. The railroad yard and port facilities in the city were damaged or destroyed, while local shore batteries defending them were knocked out. Multiple wharves, warehouses, oil tanks, radio stations, and coal and oil stores were set on fire by the bombardment, and the city's electricity, gas, and telephone lines were severed. Within the city itself, Ancona's police headquarters, army barracks, military hospital, sugar refinery, and Bank of Italy offices all saw damage. 30 Italian soldiers and 38 civilians were killed, while an additional 150 were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=107–108}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=274–275}} During the attacks along the Italian coastline that day, Austro-Hungarian seaplanes also bombed Venice and Ancona.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=275}}

The Austro-Hungarian fleet would later move on to bombard the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in port.{{sfn|Hore|2006|p=180}} The objective of the bombardment of Italy's coastline was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces along the border with Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems,{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=107}} and the surprise attack on Ancona and the Italian Adriatic coast succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the [[Alps]] for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary valuable time to strengthen the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian front]] and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=109}} The bombardment and sinking of several Italian ships also delivered a severe blow to Italian military and public morale.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=276}}

===1915–1916===
[[File:Admiral Spaun deck.png|thumb|right|upright|The deck of ''Admiral Spaun'' in 1917. The four twin torpedo tube mounts are visible under their covers|alt=]]
Following Italy's entry into the war in May 1915, ''Admiral Spaun'' would be among the most regularly used ships throughout the rest of the year against the Italians in the Adriatic. However, her mechanical problems prevented her from engaging in the same number of raids and sorties as the ''Novara''-class cruisers.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=303}} During this time, ''Admiral Spaun'' spent most of her time in service in the northern Adriatic, providing cover for Austro-Hungarian ships conducting mine-laying and mine-sweeping operations.{{sfn|Noppen|2016|p=22}} Nevertheless, she did participate in some raids in the southern Adriatic in a secondary role. On the night of 28 December 1915, ''Helgoland'' and five destroyers participated in a raid on French and Italian ships. During this raid, ''Helgoland'' rammed and sank the French submarine {{ship|French submarine|Monge|Q67|2}} between [[Brindisi]] and the Albanian port of [[Durrës|Durazzo]], before attacking shipping in Durazzo the following morning.{{sfn|Gill|1916|p=307}} After sinking several ships in the port, two of the Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanying ''Helgoland'' struck mines and one sank. In response to these setbacks, ''Novara'', ''Admiral Spaun'', and the {{sclass-|Monarch|coastal defence ship|0}} [[coastal defence ship]] {{SMS|Budapest||2}} were mobilised to support ''Helgoland'' and the Austro-Hungarian destroyers. ''Helgoland'' was unscathed in the operation and managed to evade the Allied pursuit when darkness fell, rendezvousing with the reinforcements sent out to escort her back to Cattaro.{{sfn|Halpern|2004|pp=7–8}}{{snf|Halpern|1994|p=161}} ''Admiral Spaun'' saw much less action throughout 1916 as mechanical issues remained a problem. Instead, she remained on duty in more secondary roles and underwent a refit to strengthen her anti-aircraft and torpedo weaponry.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}{{sfn|Noppen|2016|p=22}} Despite these setbacks, throughout most of the war ''Admiral Spaun'' and the ''Novara''-class ships served as the "real capital ships of the Adriatic",{{sfn|Dickson|O'Hara|Worth|2013|p=37}} as many of the larger ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy—such as the ''Tegetthoff''-class battleships—remained at port in Pola between May 1915 and June 1918.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=261}}{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=144}}

===1917–1918===
Following the torpedoing of the coastal defence ship {{SMS|Wien||2}} on 10 December 1917, ''Admiral Spaun'', the pre-dreadnought battleship {{SMS|Árpád||2}}, and six destroyers were sent to reinforce Austria-Hungary's harbour defences in Trieste. On 19 December, these warships linked up with ''Budapest'', as well as 16 torpedo boats, five [[minesweeper]]s, and five seaplanes to bombard Italian artillery positions at the mouth of the Piave River. This operation was supposed to provide cover for a division of the [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd]] to cross the river, but failed due to poor weather. By 1 January, ''Admiral Spaun'' and the rest of this fleet had withdrawn back to Pola.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=313}}

After the [[Cattaro Mutiny]], Admiral [[Maximilian Njegovan]] was fired as ''Marinekommandant'', though at Njegovan's request it was announced that he was retiring.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=144}} [[Miklós Horthy]], who had since been promoted to commander of the battleship {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}, was promoted to rear admiral and named ''Flottenkommandant'' (Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet). Horthy's promotion was met with support among many members of the naval officer corps, who believed he would use Austria-Hungary's navy to engage the enemy. Horthy's appointment posed difficulties. His relatively young age alienated many of the senior officers, and Austria-Hungary's naval traditions included an unspoken rule that no officer could serve at sea under someone of inferior seniority. This meant that the heads of the First and Second Battle Squadrons, as well as the Cruiser Flotilla, all had to go into early retirement or take shore-based positions.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=326}}

===Otranto Raid===
[[File:Gulf of Taranto map.png|thumb|Map showing the location of the Straits of Otranto at the southern end of the Adriatic|alt=A map showing the Strait of Otranto. The southeastern tip of Italy can be seen on the left, with the coast of Albania appearing on the right.|left]]Horthy was determined to use the fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage, and he planned to repeat his [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|successful raid on the blockade in May 1917]].{{sfn|Koburger|2001|p=104}} Horthy envisioned a major attack on the Allied forces with his four ''Tegetthoff''-class ships providing the largest component of the assault. They would be accompanied by the three ships of the ''Erzherzog Karl''-class pre-dreadnoughts, three ''Novara''-class cruisers, ''Admiral Spaun'', four ''Tátra''-class destroyers, and four torpedo boats. Submarines and aircraft would also be employed in the operation to hunt down enemy ships on the flanks of the fleet.{{sfn|Halpern|1987|p=501}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=335}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}

On 8 June 1918 Horthy took his flagship, ''Viribus Unitis'', and ''Prinz Eugen'' south with the lead elements of his fleet.{{sfn|Koburger|2001|p=104}} On the evening of 9 June, ''Szent István'' and ''Tegetthoff'' followed along with their own escort ships. Horthy's plan called for ''Novara'' and ''Helgoland'' to engage the Barrage with the support of the ''Tátra''-class destroyers. Meanwhile, ''Admiral Spaun'' and ''Saida'' would be escorted by the fleet's four torpedo boats to [[Otranto]] to bombard Italian air and naval stations.{{sfn|Halpern|2004|p=142}} The German and Austro-Hungarian submarines would be sent to [[Vlorë|Valona]] and Brindisi to ambush Italian, French, British, and American warships that sailed out to engage the Austro-Hungarian fleet, while seaplanes from Cattaro would provide air support and screen the ships' advance. The battleships, and in particular the ''Tegetthoff''s, would use their firepower to destroy the Barrage and engage any Allied warships they ran across. Horthy hoped that the inclusion of these ships would prove to be critical in securing a decisive victory.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=335}}

En route to the harbour at [[Slano|Islana]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with the battleships ''Viribus Unitis'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' for the coordinated attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]], ''Szent István'' and ''Tegetthoff'' attempted to make maximum speed in order to catch up to the rest of the fleet. In doing so, ''Szent István''{{'}}s turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced. When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase the ship's speed, ''Szent István'' produced an excess of smoke. At about 3:15&amp;nbsp;am on 10 June,{{efn|name=time of attack}} two Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. ''MAS 15'' fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25&amp;nbsp;am at ''Szent István''. ''Szent István'' was hit by two {{convert|45|cm|adj=on|0}} torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms. ''Tegetthoff'' attempted to take ''Szent István'' in tow, which failed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} At 6:12&amp;nbsp;am, with the pumps unequal to the task, ''Szent István'' capsized off [[Premuda]].{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=335}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=134–135}}

Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, and possible Allied dreadnoughts responding to the scene, Horthy believed the element of surprise had been lost and called off the attack, forcing ''Admiral Spaun'' back to port. In reality, the Italian torpedo boats had been on a routine patrol, and Horthy's plan had not been betrayed to the Italians as he had feared. The Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|p=135}} Nevertheless, the loss of ''Szent István'' and the blow to morale it had on the navy forced Horthy to cancel his plans to assault the Otranto Barrage. The Austro-Hungarian ships returned to their bases where they would remain for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=134–135}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=336}}

===End of the war===
By October 1918 it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl&amp;nbsp;I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allied Powers in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria-Hungary informed Germany that [[Dual Alliance (1879)|their alliance]] was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet. While a mutiny was spared, tensions remained high and morale was at an all-time low. The situation was so stressful for members of the navy that the captain of ''Prinz Eugen'', Alexander Milosevic, committed suicide in his quarters aboard the battleship.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=350–351}}

On 29 October the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs#National Council|National Council]] in [[Zagreb]] announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to a formal conclusion. The National Council also called for Croatia and Dalmatia to be unified, with Slovene and Bosnian organisations pledging their loyalty to the newly formed government. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl&amp;nbsp;I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=351–352}} Emperor Karl&amp;nbsp;I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other "nations" which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=352}} All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=352}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=136–137, 139}}

The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being fired. This was considered preferential to handing the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly dethroned Emperor Karl&amp;nbsp;I, keeping the possibility of [[Trialism in Austria-Hungary|reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy]] alive. The transfer to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs began on the morning of 31 October, with Horthy meeting representatives from the South Slav nationalities aboard his flagship, ''Viribus Unitis'' in Pola. After "short and cool" negotiations, the arrangements were settled and the handover was completed that afternoon. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from ''Viribus Unitis'', and was followed by the remaining ships in the harbour.{{sfn|Koburger|2001|p=118}} Control over the battleship, and the head of the newly-established navy for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, fell to Captain [[Janko Vuković]], who was raised to the rank of admiral and took over Horthy's old responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=353–354}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=136–137, 139}}{{sfn|Halpern|1994|p=177}}

===Post-war===
[[File:Admiral Spaun Venice.png|thumb|right|''Admiral Spaun'' participating in the Italian victory celebrations in Venice in March 1919|alt=]]
On 3 November 1918 the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending the fighting along the Italian Front.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=329}} The Armistice refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary's warships to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. As a result, on 4 November 1918, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume. On 5 November, Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola.{{sfn|Sieche|1985|p=137}} While the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs attempted to hold onto their ships, they lacked the men and officers to do so as most sailors who were not South Slavs had already gone home. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola harbour had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at [[Corfu]], the Allied Powers agreed the transfer of Austria-Hungary's Navy to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Sieche|1985|pp=138–140}} Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to surrender the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November 1918.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|pp=357–359}}

While under Italian custody, ''Admiral Spaun'' sailed into Venice in March 1919 as part of an Italian victory parade, alongside the captured battleships ''Tegetthoff'' and ''Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand''. All three entered the Venice Lagoon flying the Italian flag, and were escorted into the port where they were displayed as war trophies by the Italians.{{sfn|Sieche|1985|pp=138–140}} It would take a year for the final disposition of the ships to be settled by the Allied powers through the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=359}} The United Kingdom was ceded ''Admiral Spaun'' under the terms of the treaty.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=360}} Much like the larger battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, however, Admiral Spaun's post-war service would be short. The same year the British were granted possession of the cruiser, she was sold for scrap to Italian ship breakers and broken up between 1920 and 1921.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=336}}

'''Saul Stacey Williams''' (born February 29, 1972) is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, musician, slam poet, writer, and actor. He is known for his blend of poetry and [[alternative hip hop]] and for his lead roles in the 1998 independent film ''[[Slam (film)|Slam]]'' and the 2013 jukebox musical [[Holler If Ya Hear Me (musical)|''Holler If Ya Hear Me'']], featuring [[Tupac Shakur]]'s music.

==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], New York, and is the youngest of three children in his family. He attended [[Newburgh Free Academy]], where he wrote his song "Black Stacey". He graduated from [[Morehouse College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in acting and philosophy, then moved to New York City, where he earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in acting from [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts#Graduate Acting Program|Graduate Acting Program]] at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=NYU Graduate Acting Alumni | url=http://gradacting.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ga_alumbios.html | year=2011  | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams speaks about graduating college, falling in love, and beginning his career" &gt;{{cite news |first=Ferrari |last=Sheppard |title= Saul William Interview |url=http://www.stopbeingfamous.com/past-interviews/stopbeingfamous-com-interview-with-saul-williams|accessdate=2010-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at New York University he became part of the New York café poetry scene. Williams has also lived in [[Brazil]] as an [[exchange student]] from 1988 to 1989.

==Career==

===Poetry===
[[File:Saul Williams SXSW 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Williams live at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] 2008]]
By 1995, Williams had become an open mic poet. In 1996, he won the title of [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]]'s [[Poetry slam|Grand Slam Champion]]. The documentary film ''[[SlamNation]]'' follows Williams and the other members of the 1996 Nuyorican Poets Slam team ([[Beau Sia]], [[muMs da Schemer]], and [[Jessica Care Moore]]) as they compete in the 1996 [[National Poetry Slam]] held in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon. The following year, Williams landed the lead role in the 1998 feature film ''[[Slam (film)|Slam]]''. Williams featured as both a writer and actor in the film,&lt;ref name="wiyf"&gt;Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008). ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam.'' Soft Skull Press, p. 226. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which would win both the [[Sundance Festival]] Grand Jury Prize and the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] Camera D'Or (Golden Camera).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139615/awards |title=IMDB Awards page for ''Slam''|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Saul Williams concert.jpg|upright|thumb|left|200px|NiggyTardust! tour, Montreal (2008)]]

Around 1998, Williams was also breaking into music. He had performed with such artists as [[Nas]], [[The Fugees]], Christian Alvarez, [[Blackalicious]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[KRS-One]], [[Zack De La Rocha]], [[De La Soul]], and [[DJ Krust]], as well as poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Sonia Sanchez]]. After releasing a string of EPs, he released the [[LP album|LP]] ''[[Amethyst Rock Star]]'' with producer [[Rick Rubin]] in 2001. In September 2004, he released [[Saul Williams (album)|his self-titled album]] to much acclaim. He played several shows supporting [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their European tour in summer 2005, and has also supported [[The Mars Volta]]. Williams was invited to the [[Lollapalooza|Lollapalooza music festival]] around that time, and the Chicago stage allowed Williams to attract a wider audience. He appeared on the Nine Inch Nails album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', and supported the group on their 2006 tour of North America. On the tour, Williams announced that [[Trent Reznor]] would co-produce his next album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=06&amp;m=3#1142284426 | title = Saul Williams recording with Trent/Atticus | publisher = The NIN Hotline | date = March 13, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collaboration resulted in 2007's ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]''. The album was available only from its website until a physical CD was issued, featuring new tracks and extended album artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drop-d.ie/article.php?article_id=567 |title=

The other option was for users to pay $5 to support the artist directly and be given the choice of downloading the higher-quality MP3 version or the lossless [[FLAC]] version. The material was produced by [[Trent Reznor]] and mixed by [[Alan Moulder]]. It was Reznor who said, after his own recent dealings with record labels, that they should release it independently and directly to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26846_0_2_0_C|title=Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) produced album by Saul Williams yours for zero dollar |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428195638/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26846_0_2_0_C |archivedate=April 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Sparq Training commercial featured Williams' song "List of Demands (Reparations)". In a November 2008 interview with [[Wired News|Wired.com]], Williams talked about his forthcoming projects: "There's one album that I'm waist-deep into. I'm aiming to finish it up next month. Trent wants to work on a sequel for ''Niggy'' that I think would be cool, and I also have an album and new songs demoed at home that I'm ready to go into the studio and lay down. It’s a complete reflection of how I feel in this country; it's a very transformative time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/11/one-year-later.html |title=One Year Later, Saul Williams Talks Niggy Tardust’s Wins, What’s Next |publisher=Wired|website=Blog.wired.com |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams' fourth album, ''[[Volcanic Sunlight]]'', was released on November 11, 2011. Williams showcased the album at London's [[Hoxton]] Bar Kitchen on January 26, 2011. Livemusic interviewed Williams on the evening and made a subsequent film, produced by artist [[Alex Templeton-Ward]]. When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: "I'm making this up, I have no idea but here we go. I think that it would be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, like you have a window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn't open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost."

Williams' fifth album, ''[[MartyrLoserKing]]'', was released on January 29, 2016.

In March 2018, [[The Kills]] released their cover of Williams' "List of Demands (Reparations)" and Williams opened for The Kills' sold-out performance at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles on August 13, 2018.

===Writing===
As a writer, Williams has been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Bomb Magazine]]'', and ''African Voices'', as well as releasing four collections of poetry. As a poet and musician, Williams has toured and lectured across the world, appearing at many universities and colleges. In his interview in the book ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam'', Williams explained why he creates within so many genres: "It's not that I balance those arts out, all the different arts balance me out. So, that there is a certain type of emotion that is more easily accessible through music than poetry... some things are meant to be written, some are meant to be sung, some things are meant to be hummed, some things are made to be yelled, and so that's just how life works."&lt;ref name="wiyf5"&gt;Aptowicz (2008), ''Words in Your Face'', p. 229.82-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, he released ''NGH WHT {{ndash}} The Dead Emcee Scrolls with The Arditti Quartet'', a reading of his 2006 poetry book of the same name. This collaboration with Thomas Kessler (who also set Williams' spoken-word track ",said the shotgun to the head" to music) was released with two payment options: listeners could download chapters 18 to 22 of the 27-minute composition in MP3 format for free, or could download the entire 33-chapter composition in lossless [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] format for $6, along with the isolated vocal and quartet multitracks. The entire paid download totalled in size at 563 [[megabytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saulwilliams.com/NGH_WHT/ |title=NGH WHT - Dead Emcee Scrolls with The Arditti Quartet |website=Saulwilliams.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams contributed to two tracks on the 2011 album ''Baba Love'' by [[Arthur H]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/inrockstv/inrockstv-article/t/69613/date/2011-08-31/article/en-coulisses-avec-arthur-h-et-saul-williams/|title=En studio avec Arthur H et Saul Williams |accessdate=November 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115093550/http://www.lesinrocks.com/inrockstv/inrockstv-article/t/69613/date/2011-08-31/article/en-coulisses-avec-arthur-h-et-saul-williams |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
On film Williams has starred in ''[[Slam (film)|Slam]]'' (1998), and ''[[Today (2012 film)|Today]]'' (2012). On stage Williams was chosen for the lead role in ''[[Holler If Ya Hear Me (musical)|Holler If Ya Hear Me]]'', a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical featuring music by [[Tupac Shakur]]. Though it features Shakur's music, the musical is not about his life. It is an original script written by Todd Kreidler.

The EU economic governance, '''Sixpack''' describes a set of European legislative measures to reform the [[Stability and Growth Pact]] and introduces greater macroeconomic surveillance. These measures were bundled into a "six pack" of regulations, tabled in September 2010 as two versions respectively by the [[European Commission]] and a [[Council of the European Union|European Council]] task force. In March 2011 the [[ECOFIN|ECOFIN council]] reached a preliminary agreement for the content of the Sixpack with the Commission, and negotiations for endorsement by the [[European Parliament]] then started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2011.hu/package-six-legislative-proposals|title=Package of six legislative proposals|publisher=Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union|date=April 2011|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately it entered into force 13 December 2011, after one year of preceding negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120604040314/http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/nn_53848/DE/Wirtschaft__und__Verwaltung/Europa/20110920__29__Faq__Schuldenkrise.html?__nnn=true Erkärungsseite the Ministry of Finance Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/de/headlines/content/20110429FCS18371/html/Reform-der-EU-Wirtschaftsregierung-Wider-die-Schuldenspirale side of the European Parliament (German), in the English text is called a "sixpack".]&lt;/ref&gt; The six regulations aim at strengthening the procedures to reduce [[Government deficit|public deficit]]s and address [[macroeconomic]] imbalances.

== Overview ==
All 28 EU member states are committed by the paragraphs in the EU Treaty, referred to as the [[Stability and Growth Pact]] (SGP), to implement a fiscal policy aiming for the country to stay within the limits on government deficit (3% of GDP) and debt (60% of GDP); and in case of having a debt level above 60% it should each year have a declining trend. Each year all EU member states are obliged to submit a SGP compliance report for the scrutiny and evaluation of the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], that will present the country's expected fiscal development for the current and subsequent three years. These reports are called "stability programmes" for eurozone Member States and "convergence programmes" for non-eurozone Member States, but despite having different titles they are identical in their content. After the reform of the SGP in 2005, these programmes have also included the [[Medium-Term budgetary Objective]]s (MTOs), being individually calculated for each Member State as the medium-term sustainable average-limit for the country's [[structural deficit]], the Member State is also obliged to outline the measures it intends to implement to attain its MTO. If the EU Member State do not comply with both the deficit limit and the debt limit, a so-called "Excessive Deficit Procedure" (EDP) is initiated along with a deadline to comply, which outlines an "adjustment path towards reaching the MTO".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/emu/who/index_en.htm|title=Who does what in EMU|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the six instruments in the Sixpack are used to conduct further reforms of the "Stability and Growth Pact" (SGP), focusing on improving compliance. These reforms do not change any of the conditions already imposed by the SGP, but aim to enforce greater budgetary discipline among the Member States of the [[euro area]] by stipulating that sanctions come into force earlier and more consistently. For example, when a country against which an excessive deficit procedure was opened fails to take necessary measures to eliminate its deficit, an interest-bearing deposit equalling 0.2% of GDP is due. With continued non-compliance the deposit is converted into a fine. In addition, automatic sanctions are triggered based on a different voting mechanism in the Council of the European Union. At the same time the national accounts statistics and forecast practices of Member States are adjusted to comply with EU standards. If it is determined that a country has reported false data, an additional fine may be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.de/finanzen-und-wachstum/artikel/six-pack-reform-des-stabilitatspakts-bestatigt-005460 laws, explanations, reactions, "Six-Pack: Reform of the Stability Pact confirmed"] EurActiv.de 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining two pieces of legislation in the Sixpack relate to the [[Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure]], an early warning system and correction mechanism for excessive macroeconomic imbalances.

== Further proposals for the Eurozone ==
Development of the Eurozone [[fiscal union]] can be described as the fourth stage of the [[Economic and Monetary Union|EMU]], proposed to be implemented for the Eurozone in the near future.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The argument presented was, that Member States sharing the same currency will also need more integration of fiscal policies (closer collaboration on fiscal matters) and tighter budgetary surveillance, to prevent and combat the occurrence of financial instability caused by macroeconomic imbalances inside the monetary union.

A step towards increased fiscal discipline of member States of the European Union was taken on 23 November 2011, when the [[European Commission]] proposed the two Regulations (also known as the "Two-pack"), which introduced additional coordination and surveillance of budgetary processes for all eurozone members.&lt;ref name="Proposed regulation 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:DKEY=627835:EN:NOT|title=Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area (COM/2011/0821 final – 2011/0386 COD)|publisher=Europa|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proposed regulation 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:DKEY=627834:EN:NOT|title=Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area (COM/2011/0819 final – 2011/385 COD)|publisher=Europa|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional regulations complement the [[Stability and Growth Pact|SGP]]'s requirement for surveillance, by enhancing the frequency of scrutiny of Member States' policymaking, but do not place additional requirements on the policy itself. The frequency of monitoring will depend on the economic health of the member state. As of the entry into force of the regulations, all eurozone member states are obliged to respect "Regulation 1", while "Regulation 2" – demanding even more in depth and frequent monitoring – will only be triggered if the state receive macroeconomic financial assistance or has an ongoing [[Excessive Imbalance Procedure|Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP)]]:&lt;ref name="2 extra budgetary surveillance regulations for Eurozone member states"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-822_en.htm?locale=en|title=Economic governance: Commission proposes two new Regulations to further strengthen budgetary surveillance in the euro area (MEMO/11/822)|publisher=Europa|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''1. Regulation 473/2013:''' ''On common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area.''&lt;ref name="Regulation 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:140:0011:0011:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EU) No 473/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2013: On common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area|format=PDF|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the eurozone member state is not involved in an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) or Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP) or Financial assistance programme, the only extra monitor requirement (compared to the SGP) will be for the member state to submit its draft fiscal budget for the upcoming year to the European Commission: no later than 15 October; and it shall then await receiving the Commission's opinion before it is debated and voted for in the national parliament. The European Commission will not be granted any veto right over the national parliaments potential pass of a fiscal budget, but will have the role to issue warnings in advance to the national parliaments, if the proposed draft budget is found to compromise the debt and deficit rules outlined by the [[European Fiscal Compact]]. The reporting requirements towards Eurozone member states subject to open EDP's are regulated by article 6 to 12, outlining that "status reports for corrective action" shall be published by 6 months intervals from the moment the Council has granted the country an official deadline for EDP correction, and with the frequency increased to quarterly reports for those "Member States persisting in failing to put into practice the recommendations of the Council" for corrective measures to remedy the excessive deficit situation - leading to a Council notice for immediate implementation of deficit reduction measures in accordance with [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#Article 126|article 126(9) of the TFEU]]. Article 6 to 12 does not apply for those Member States with open EDP's who are also subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme - as their increased reporting requirements are specifically outlined by regulation 472/2013.&lt;ref name="2 extra budgetary surveillance regulations for Eurozone member states"/&gt;

: '''2. Regulation 472/2013:''' ''On the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.''&lt;ref name="Regulation 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:140:0001:0001:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EU) No 472/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2013: On the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability|format=PDF|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eurozone member states with an ongoing EIP, or being involved in a financial assistance program from [[European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism|EFSM]]/[[European Financial Stability Fund|EFSF]]/[[European Stability Mechanism|ESM]]/[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]/other bilateral basis, will be required to further increase the level and frequency for submitted monitor/surveillance reports to the European Commission. This so-called "enhanced surveillance" will mean, that "status reports for corrective action" needs to be published on a quarterly basis, and that the Commission on that basis will be allowed to send warnings to the national parliament of the member state concerned, about a likely missed compliance with programme targets and/or the fiscal adjustment path to comply with EDP deadlines, at such an early stage in the process, that the affected member state still have sufficient time to implement needed counter-measures to prevent the possible delay of the required compliance. Regulation 472/2013 will continue to apply for member states recently having ended a macroeconomic financial assistance programme, with a post-programme surveillance being active until at least the time when more than 25% of the borrowed money has been repaid. In the event of a "persistent risk to the financial stability or fiscal sustainability of the Member State concerned", the Council may also decide to further extend the duration of the post-programme surveillance. Finally it shall be noted, that regulation 472/2013 will not apply for a member state without an open EIP receiving macroeconomic financial assistance only in the form of an undrawn "Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line".&lt;ref name="2 extra budgetary surveillance regulations for Eurozone member states"/&gt;

The two above regulations apply towards all eurozone member states, and together form a stronger budgetary governance with a more tight system of monitoring and surveillance by the European Commission. According to [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#Article 136|article 136]] in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], the enactment and entry into force of the regulations required the Council's adoption in agreement with the [[European Parliament]], subject to a qualified majority of the 17 eurozone member states. The [[ECOFIN|ECOFIN council]] reached a final agreement with the Parliament's Permanent Representatives Committee on 20 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st06/st06962.en13.pdf|title=Press release: 3227th Council meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) on 5 March 2013|format=PDF|publisher=Council of the European Union|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament then adopted the two-pack on 12 March,&lt;ref name="legal status for twopack regulation 2011/0385"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2011/0385(COD)|title=Legislative observatory - Procedure file 2011/0385 COD.

Most provisions will apply from the date of entry into force. In regards of the increased reporting frequency for member states with an open EDP, and the requirement to set up independent national bodies monitoring compliance with the fiscal rules, these article provisions will however only apply starting from 31 October 2013.&lt;ref name="Regulation 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Regulation 2"/&gt;

The provisions of the Two-pack (which only apply for Eurozone member states), complements and extends the Stability and Growth Pact already reformed by the Six-pack, and it also integrates some elements of the already ratified intergovernmental [[European Fiscal Compact]], directly into EU law. Examples of identical elements with the Fiscal Compact: ''1) Member States are required to transpose the SGP fiscal rules into national legislation, 2) Member States in EDP are required to prepare "economic partnership programmes", 3) Member States are required to submit their debt issuance plans for an ex-ante coordination with other Member States''. The new legal structure introduced by the Two-pack, was in March 2013 expected to be used for the first time, when the 2014 fiscal budget draft laws shall be submitted to the [[European Commission]] for prior review and comments by 15 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-196_en.htm|title=‘Two-Pack’ completes budgetary surveillance cycle for euro area and further improves economic governance (Memo 13/196)|publisher=European Commission|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurobonds ===
On 23 November 2011, the European Commission also presented a [[Green paper]] for the possible introduction of [[Eurobonds]] (referred to as "Stability Bonds"), that outlined different options and levels for common issuance and common guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:DKEY=627611:EN:NOT|title=Green paper on the feasibility of introducing Stability Bonds (COM/2011/0818 final)|publisher=EUR-Lex|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having concluded a public consultation on the subject in January 2012, the Commission asked for the political opinion of the ''European Economic and Social Committee''. This opinion was submitted to the Commission on 11 July 2012, with a recommendation for the Commission to continue the political work to develop a proposal. The committee revealed that it favoured the option where eurobonds should carry full common payment guarantees (from all eurozone member states), but only substitute a part of the current national bonds (subject to a fiscal responsibility criteria still to be developed). It was fully agreed, that the impact of introducing eurobonds would be an effective tool to ensure low (and more equal) interest rates across all eurozone countries (with the degree of its effect being related to how big a share of national bonds would be substituted with eurobonds). The committee however also called for additional impact studies, to map if (or by how much) the 3 different levels for introduction of eurobonds, potentially also could introduce some negative consequences, in the form of an increased risk that each of the eurozone countries might exploit the gained "security delivered by common eurobonds", just to lower their exercised degree of "fiscal responsibility" at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2012:299:0060:01:EN:HTML|title=Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the 'Green Paper on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds' COM(2011) 818 final |publisher=EUR-Lex|work=Official Journal C.299, P.0060-0071|date=4 October 2012|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of Eurobonds (Stability Bonds) is expected first to require a Treaty change and/or other political agreements first to be implemented. Despite of a relative long roadmap for a possible introduction of eurobonds, it is believed an agreement for this proposal could have an immediate impact on market expectations, resulting in the immediate decline of funding costs through lower government bond yields, for those Member States currently facing funding pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-820_en.htm|title=European Commission Green Paper on the feasibility of introducing Stability Bonds (MEMO/11/820)|publisher=Europa|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] presented on 28 November 2012 a "Blueprint", on how it see the path on the short + medium + long term towards building a ''deep and genuine EMU''. In this report, the introduction of eurobonds were described as the last final step on the path to create a genuine fiscal union, and something only to be introduced in the long term (beyond 5 years from 2012). The report suggested for the medium term (18 months to 5 years), that it was more appropriate as a first step, to introduce a common issuance by eurozone Member States of the so-called '''eurobills''', which are defined as being short-term instruments to finance government debt with a maturity of up to one or two years. This first eurobills step would still require a treaty change along with an increased call for implementing an even tighter fiscal policy integration (creating in advance a "strong budgetary governance and a watertight system of monitoring and surveillance" in the Eurozone, beyond of what has already been implemented by the Six-pack and Two-pack&lt;ref name="2 extra budgetary surveillance regulations for Eurozone member states"/&gt;). Introduction of eurobills would however, not require a full fiscal policy integration straight from the start, because of the fact that it would only cover introduction of common short term debt, which only represents a minor fraction of the governments overall debt pile, and thus the risk of excersiced "moral hazard" in the individual member states would also be limited (because the majority of the governments debt, financed by medium and long-term bonds, will still be yielded according to each state's credit rating at financial markets).&lt;ref name="Blueprint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-909_en.htm|title=A Blueprint for a deep and genuine Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): Frequently Asked Questions (MEMO/12/909)|publisher=European Commission (Europa)|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Blueprint" on the next steps towards a deeper Economic and Monetary Union, is to be considered as the first draft version of a joint report from the "Four presidents" (signed by [[President of the European Council]], [[President of the European Commission]], [[President of the European Central Bank]] and the [[Eurogroup#President|President of the Eurogroup]]), that will be further discussed by the European Council on 13–14 December 2012.&lt;ref name="ECOFIN meeting December 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-935_en.htm?locale=en|title=Preparation of Economic and Finance Ministers Council, Brussels, 4 December 2012 (MEMO/12/935)|publisher=European Commission (Europa)|date=3 December 2012|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence and Competitiveness Instrument (CCI) ===
The European Commission also recently proposed the establishment of a Convergence and Competitiveness Instrument (CCI) within the EU budget. The proposal is to create a special EU budget account with earmarked money, for supporting the timely implementation of needed structural reforms (traditionally considered to be politically unpopular to implement), where the implementation funding would be paid by the CCI fund conditional on strict adherence to a prior signed "contractual arrangement" for the agreed structural reform, with the two contracting parties being the Member State and the Commission. If the Member State implements the identified and needed structural reforms to ensure convergence/competitiveness, then the CCI budget will so to speak pay the Member State an economic reward of behaving in a sound and responsible way.&lt;ref name="Blueprint"/&gt; The proposal is expected to be further debated, soon after the Council have concluded an agreement for the next 7-year EU budget (also referred to as the "Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014–2020").

An additional/related suggestion also currently being debated, is to create the CCI outside the EU budget and only let it apply for eurozone member states, with a budget instead to be covered by income from the collection of the [[European Union financial transaction tax|Financial Transaction Tax]] (FTT). In October 2012, the FTT was formally agreed to be implemented and enter into force 1 January 2014 in 11 out of 17 eurozone member states.&lt;ref name="ECOFIN meeting December 2012"/&gt; Currently no formal decision was however reached, if the collected income should be kept as direct national income, or perhaps instead be transferred to a supranational eurozone budget.

=== Banking Union ===
The proposal to create a Banking Union, covers both the creation of a [[Single Supervisory Mechanism]] (SSM), and after its adoption also a [[Single Resolution Mechanism]] (SRM) to deal with banks in difficulties. This new independent organisation, is supposed to be in charge of the restructuring and resolution of banks within the EU Member States participating in the Banking Union (meaning that it is not limited to the eurozone). The European Commission presented the proposal 12 September 2012 and at the EU summit in October, it was agreed to formally request that a final proposal for the SSM framework be agreed between the Council and Parliament before the end of the year, with the aim for the SSM to be founded in 2013 and fully established to cover all banks starting from 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name="ECOFIN meeting December 2012"/&gt;

On 29 November 2012, the Economic and Monetary affairs Committee of the European Parliament voted on and approved the initial framework proposal and a mutually approved final proposal agreement between the Council and Parliament is now the next step. Remaining issues for the [[ECOFIN|ECOFIN council]] to consider at their next meeting on 4 December 2012, is to decide on: "the role of the national supervisors, the governance of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and the voting rights within [[European Banking Authority|EBA]]".&lt;ref name="ECOFIN meeting December 2012"/&gt; At the council meeting there was not sufficient time to agree on any final decision, so the council will be called for a second meeting within 8 days, with the aim of concluding the work ahead of the EU summit on 13–14 December. Any change of the EU legislation about EBA require (according to article 114 of the TFEU): A qualified majority at the Council in conjunction with the Parliament's approval. While any change of the EU legislation about ECB's function/role require (according to article 127(6) of the TFEU): "Unanimity for adoption by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the ECB".&lt;ref name="ECOFIN meeting decisions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/134037.pdf|title=Press release – 3205th ECONOMIC and FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Council meeting (provisional version)|format=PDF|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Stochastic forensics was invented in 2010 by computer scientist [[Jonathan Grier]] to detect and investigate [[Insider threat|insider]] [[data theft]].&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;  Insider data theft has been notoriously difficult to investigate using traditional methods, since it does not create any [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] (such as changes to the [[file attributes]] or [[Windows Registry]]).&lt;ref name="Dark_Reading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carvey"&gt;Carvey, Harlan. "Windows forensic analysis DVD Toolkit". 2nd ed. Syngress Publishing; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   Consequently, industry demanded a new investigative technique.&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt;

Since its invention, stochastic forensics has been used in real world investigation of insider data theft,&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"&gt;Grier, Jonathan (May 2012).  [https://www.digitalforensicsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=795&amp;Itemid=72 "Investigating Data Theft with Stochastic Forensics"].  "Digital Forensics Magazine."&lt;/ref&gt; been the subject of academic research,&lt;ref name="J_Digital_Investigation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishide, T., Miyazaki, S., &amp; Sakurai, K. (2012). "Security Analysis of Offline E-cash Systems with Malicious Insider". Journal of Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications, 3(1/2), 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and met with industry demand for tools and training.&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DC3_Agenda"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black Hat Briefings]]'', USA 2012.[https://www.blackhat.com/usa/bh-us-12-briefings.html#Grier Catching Insider Data Theft with Stochastic Forensics].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins in statistical mechanics===

Stochastic forensics is inspired by the [[statistical mechanics]] method used in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt;  [[Classical mechanics|Classical Newtonian mechanics]] calculates the exact position and momentum of every [[particle]] in a system.  This works well for systems, such as the [[solar system]], which consist of a small number of objects.  However, it cannot be used to study things like a [[gas]], which have intractably large numbers of [[molecules]].  Statistical mechanics, however, doesn't attempt to track properties of individual particles, but only the properties which [[Emergence|emerge]] statistically.  Hence, it can analyze complex systems without needing to know the exact position of their individual particles.

{{Quotation|We can’t predict how any individual molecule will move and shake; but by accepting that randomness and describing it mathematically, we can use the laws of statistics to accurately predict the gas’s overall behavior. Physics underwent such a paradigm shift in the late 1800s... Could digital forensics be in need of such a paradigm shift as well?|Jonathan Grier|Investigating Data Theft With Stochastic Forensics|Digital Forensics Magazine, May 2012}}

Likewise, modern day computer systems, which can have over &lt;math&gt;2^{8^{10^{12}}}&lt;/math&gt; states, are too complex to be completely analyzed.  Therefore, stochastic forensics views computers as a [[stochastic process]], which, although unpredictable, has well defined [[probabilistic]] properties.  By analyzing these properties [[Statistics|statistically]], stochastic mechanics can reconstruct activity that took place, even if the activity did not create any artifacts.&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dark_Reading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt;

==Use in investigating insider data theft==

Stochastic forensics chief application is detecting and investigating [[Insider threat|insider]] [[data theft]].  Insider data theft is often done by someone who is technically authorized to access the data, and who uses it regularly as part of their job.  It does not create artifacts or change the [[file attributes]] or [[Windows Registry]].&lt;ref name="Carvey"/&gt;  Consequently, unlike external [[Attack (computing)|computer attacks]], which, by their nature, leave traces of the attack, insider data theft is practically invisible.&lt;ref name="Dark_Reading"/&gt;

However, the [[statistical distribution]] of [[filesystems]]' [[metadata]] is affected by such large scale copying.  By analyzing this distribution, stochastic forensics is able to identify and examine such data theft.  Typical filesystems have a [[heavy tailed]] distribution of file access.  Copying in bulk disturbs this pattern, and is consequently detectable.&lt;ref name="J_Digital_Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;

Drawing on this, stochastic mechanics has been used to successfully investigate insider data theft where other techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="J_Digital_Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dark_Reading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt; Typically, after stochastic forensics has identified the data theft, follow up using traditional forensic techniques is required.&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Stochastic forensics has been criticized as only providing evidence and indications of data theft, and not concrete proof.  Indeed, it requires a practitioner to "think like Sherlock, not Aristotle."  Certain authorized activities besides data theft may cause similar disturbances in statistical distributions.&lt;ref name="J_Digital_Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital_Forensics_Magazine"/&gt;

Furthermore, many [[operating systems]] do not track access [[Timestamp#Digital timestamps|timestamps]] by default, making stochastic forensics not directly applicable.  Research is underway in applying stochastic forensics to these operating systems as well as [[databases]].&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;

Additionally, in its current state, stochastic forensics requires a trained forensic analyst to apply and evaluate.  There have been calls for development of tools to automate stochastic forensics by [[Guidance Software]] and others.&lt;ref name="Information_Week"/&gt;

'''''The George Washington Law Review''''' is a [[law review]] edited and published by students at the [[George Washington University Law School]] that examines legal issues of national significance.  The review was established in 1932 and publishes six issues each year, containing scholarly articles, [[essay]]s, and student notes.

The review also devotes a double issue to the annual Law Review Symposium. To celebrate its 75th Anniversary in 2006, the review published its inaugural issue of the ''Annual Review of Administrative Law''. An issue dedicated to this growing field has become an annual feature of the review.

In 2006, ''The George Washington Law Review'' was ranked 25th of law reviews based upon submissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/expresso/2006/top.html ranked by ExpressO in the top 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty of the More''' was concluded on 30 August 1525 between [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the interim French government of [[Louise of Savoy]]. It was celebrated by Henry and the French ambassadors at [[the More]], [[Hertfordshire]], a castle owned by Henry's chief minister, [[Cardinal Wolsey]].

England, with Wolsey negotiating, agreed to give up some territorial claims on France, receiving in return a pension from the French of £20,000 a year. France settled what was owed to Henry VIII's sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary, dowager queen of France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mgshistory.org/u2tudor/fp%203%20and%204%201521-25.doc&lt;/ref&gt; England also agreed to work to secure the release of [[Francis I of France|King Francis of France]], then held prisoner by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Spain.

England had been troubled by the threat of a renewal of the "[[Auld Alliance]]" between France and Scotland, and France agreed to prevent the Scottish [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] from returning to Scotland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">The '''Truce''' or '''Armistice of Pläswitz''' was a nine-week armistice during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], agreed between [[Napoleon I of France]] and the Allies on June 4, 1813 (the same day as the [[Battle of Luckau]] was being fought elsewhere). It was proposed by [[Metternich]] during the retreat of the main Allied army into [[Silesia]] after [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], seconded by Napoleon (keen as he was to buy time to strengthen his cavalry, rest his army, intimidate Austria by bringing the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] up to [[Ljubljana|Laibach]] and negotiate a separate peace with Russia) and keenly accepted by the Allies (thus buying time to woo Austrian support, bring in further British funding and rest the exhausted Russian army). The Truce conceded all of [[Saxony]] to Napoleon, in return for territory along the [[Oder]], and was initially scheduled to end on 10 July, but later extended to 10 August.

In the time the Truce bought, the [[Landwehr]] was mobilised and Metternich finalised the [[Treaties of Reichenbach (1813)|Treaty of Reichenbach]] on June 27, agreeing that Austria would join the Allies should Napoleon fail to meet certain conditions by a specific day. He failed to meet those conditions, the Truce was allowed to lapse without renewal, and Austria declared war on August 12.
