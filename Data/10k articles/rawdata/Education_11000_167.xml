[[Academic ranks]] in [[Denmark]] are the titles, relative importance and power of professors, researchers, and administrative personnel held in [[academia]].

==Overview==
Academic positions at the level of Professor:&lt;ref&gt;http://ufm.dk/lovstof/gaeldende-love-og-regler/uddannelsesinstitutioner/stillingsstruktur-for-videnskabeligt-personale-ved-universiteterne&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Professor'' ([[professor]])
* ''Forskningsprofessor'' (research professor)
* ''Professor MSO'' (professor with special responsibilities; temporary rank)
* ''Forskningsprofessor MSO'' (research professor with special responsibilities; temporary rank)

Academic positions at the level of Associate Professor:&lt;ref&gt;http://ufm.dk/lovstof/gaeldende-love-og-regler/uddannelsesinstitutioner/stillingsstruktur-for-videnskabeligt-personale-ved-universiteterne&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Lektor'' (Associate Professor), time traditionally divided as 50-40-10 between teaching, research, and administration
* ''Seniorforsker'' (Senior Researcher)

Academic positions at the level of Assistant Professor:&lt;ref&gt;http://ufm.dk/lovstof/gaeldende-love-og-regler/uddannelsesinstitutioner/stillingsstruktur-for-videnskabeligt-personale-ved-universiteterne&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Post doc'' ([[Post-doc]]), generally a research position without the possibility of teaching 
* ''[[Adjunct professor|Adjunkt]]'' (Assistant Professor), usually almost the same teaching/research/administration division as ''lektor'', although sometimes a little more time for research
* ''Forsker'' (Researcher)

Academic positions below the level of Assistant Professor:&lt;ref&gt;http://ufm.dk/lovstof/gaeldende-love-og-regler/uddannelsesinstitutioner/stillingsstruktur-for-videnskabeligt-personale-ved-universiteterne&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''phd studerende'' (PhD Fellow)
* ''Forskningsassistent'' (Research Assistant)
* ''Undervisningsassistent'' (Assistant Lecturer)
* ''Ekstern lektor'' (Part-time Lecturer), requires a master's degree in the subject taught, but not a research degree (PhD or equivalent)

Special positions:&lt;ref&gt;http://ufm.dk/lovstof/gaeldende-love-og-regler/uddannelsesinstitutioner/stillingsstruktur-for-videnskabeligt-personale-ved-universiteterne&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of specialised academic positions such as Senior Adviser and Associate Clinical Professor are also in use.

Administrative positions:
* ''Rektor'' (rector)
* ''Prorektor'', second-ranked official of governance, deputy rector.
* ''Dekan'' (dean), head of a faculty (humanities, natural sciences, etc.)
* ''Institutleder'' (head of department), head of department (computer science, mathematics, etc.)
* ''Studieleder'' (programme director), head of a study programme (business administration, civil engineering, etc.)

==Professorship==
In Denmark the word professor is only used for full professors. An associate professor is in Danish called a ''lektor'' and an assistant professor is called an ''adjunkt''. Before promotion to full professorship, one can get a time limited (usually 5 years) post as an MSO (professor med særlige opgaver) or "professor with special responsibilities." The post of professor with special responsibilities involves fixed-term specific functions as well as duties that are otherwise associated with professorships. The qualification requirements correspond to those of ordinary professorships. This position gives time for the school to raise funds for the permanent professorship. An additional step between lektor and full professor is ''[[docent]]''. A docent has the same work as a professor but they do not actively take part in senior administrative duties, such as heading a department. The Danish PhD does not come with a title; only the local docent, after a similar extended thesis to the German docent,  brings the right to be addressed as ''doktor''.

A [[secondary school]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the '''Al-Thager Model School''' ({{lang-ar|مدارس الثغر النموذجية}}, the name roughly is "The Haven"&lt;ref name="Coll143"&gt;Coll 143&lt;/ref&gt;) is a two-story building that used to house both primary and secondary grades, as well as residential dormitories on the second level.

==History==
[[Faisal bin Abdul Aziz]] founded the school in [[Taif]] in the early 1950s. In 1964 Faisal opened a large campus for the school in [[Jeddah]], and from that point forward, arranged an annual fund of several million [[Saudi riyal]]s from the national budget. Kamal Adham, Faisal's Turkish father-in-law, traveled to the United Kingdom to meet officials from the government. Adham told the officials that the school ought to be modeled after [[Victoria College (Sudan)|Victoria College]], a school in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]] inspired by [[British education]].&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt; The [[Government of Saudi Arabia]] provided funds and staff members for the school.&lt;ref name="Coll142"&gt;Coll 142&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Coll, author of ''The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century'', said that during the 1960s and 1970s Al-Thager "had the reputation of a private enclave for the sons of businessmen and the royal family."&lt;ref name="Coll142143"&gt;Coll 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Thager became the most prestigious school in Jeddah.&lt;ref name="CollYoungOsama"&gt;Coll, Steve. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20051215085524/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051212fa_fact YOUNG OSAMA]." ''[[The New Yorker Fact]]''. Issue of 2005-12-12. Retrieved on 7 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's entrance examinations were open to all Saudis. Some lower class Saudis were granted acceptance and attended the school with wealthier Saudis. Around that era, each graduating class consisted of around 60 boys.&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt; During that period many Egyptian and Syrian teachers, who had been involved in dissident Islamic organizations in their home countries, taught at Al-Thager, as many did in other Saudi primary and secondary schools and universities.&lt;ref name="Coll144"&gt;Coll 144&lt;/ref&gt; Coll said in the 1960s and early 1970s that the school "had a relatively secular flavor."&lt;ref name="CollYoungOsama"/&gt;

Around the early 1970s many Al-Thager students engaged in political debates. One group of students, influenced by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[President of Egypt]], were in favor of [[Pan-Arab nationalism]]. Another group of students, influenced by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], were in favor of additional [[Islam]]ic influence in politics in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Coll147"&gt;Coll 147&lt;/ref&gt; Coll said that Al-Thager was "a conspicuous example of modernization without secularization."&lt;ref name="Coll153"&gt;Coll 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
In the 1960s the school campus was located near downtown [[Jeddah]], with the campus north of Old Jeddah Road. A two story concrete and fieldstone building served as the school's main classroom building. Steve Coll, author of ''The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century'', said that the building was in a "featureless modern style."&lt;ref name="Coll142"/&gt; The school had two classroom wings, one for middle school students and one for high school students. An interior courtyard was located between the wings.&lt;ref name="Coll142"/&gt;

In the 1960s most students were day students and commuted to school. The boarding students and some foreign teachers lived in dormitories on the school's second floor.&lt;ref name="Coll142"/&gt;

In the 1960s Al-Thager was the only school in Jeddah to have [[air conditioning]].&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt;

==Curriculum and discipline==
Steve Coll, author of ''The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century'', said that in the 1960s and 1970s Al-Thager "prided itself on its modern curicculum" and that it was the only Saudi school that "could even begin to compare itself to a place like" [[Brummana High School]] in [[Brummana]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Coll142"/&gt; During that period the school had English instruction provided by many foreign [[English teacher]]s from [[England]] and [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt; Al-Thager, like other Saudi schools, had religion as a core component in the instruction. At noon, the boys performed ''[[zuhr]]'', the Islamic prayer at noontime.&lt;ref name="Coll143144"&gt;Coll 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; Each morning, the school prompted boys in a military-style call of order to assemble in rows. Teachers had canes, and disciplined boys by striking their feet.&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt;

==Dress code==
The students wear western-style school uniforms seen in American and British [[university preparatory school]]s; in most Saudi schools for boys, the students wear [[thobe]]s and cloth headdresses. During the 1960s and 1970s, students wore white oxford shirts with ties, grey trousers, black socks, and black shoes. During winter periods students wore charcoal-coloured blazers.&lt;ref name="Coll143"/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
[[Osama bin Laden]] began attending Al-Thager in 1968, either in the fifth or sixth grade.&lt;ref name="Coll142"/&gt; Osama's education at Al-Thager ended in 1976. Former teachers, Brian Fyfield-Shayler and Seamus O’Brien gave an interview to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in which they claimed that they remembered teaching Osama bin Laden at the school.&lt;ref name="CollYoungOsama"/&gt; Some of Osama's half-brothers were enrolled at Al-Thager.&lt;ref&gt;Coll 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Recidivism Coalition''' ('''ARC''') is a [[Los Angeles]]-based non-profit organization founded by [[Scott Budnick (film producer)|Scott Budnick]]. ARC is a support network for formerly incarcerated individuals and advocates for [[criminal justice reform]]. ARC’s mission is to reduce [[incarceration]], improve the outcomes of formerly incarcerated individuals, and to build healthier communities.

== History ==
In 1997, Budnick first became interested in juveniles in prison after reading a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article about [[Brandon Hein]] and three other youths who were found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in California even though three of them never touched the weapon.&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mechanic|first1=Michael|title=Why the Producer of "The Hangover Part III" Spends So Much Time in Prison|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/hangover-part-iii-executive-producer-scott-budnick-california-prison-interview|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budnick sent the article to a producer who optioned it for a documentary film called ''Reckless Indifference''.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;

In 2003, Budnick began volunteering at the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, California.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt; Budnick was a volunteer teacher for a group called [[InsideOUT Writers]].&lt;ref name=Rainey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rainey|first1=James|title=Resurrection Story Inspires on Prophet's Campaign Trail|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-prophet-walker-20140421-m-story.html#page=1|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, Budnick still volunteers at the Nidorf Juvenile Hall.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehta|first1=Seema|title=For Writers in Juvenile Hall, Sentences Can be Liberating|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-juvenile-hall-writers-20140922-story.html#page=2|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this experience and others, Budnick began to tell administrators and politicians about the problems he was seeing in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt; After the success of Budnick's [[The Hangover]] franchise, Budnick was able to leverage the work he does for incarcerated juveniles.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt; [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] went with Budnick to the Sylmar juvenile detention center, to [[Men's Central Jail]] and out to [[California State Prison, Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;

In 2012, Budnick was named California's Volunteer of Year by Governor Jerry Brown for a program he envisioned. After seeing kids desperate to change their lives but unable to because of California law at that time, Budnick and other launched a pilot program out of Los Angeles County where every single kid coming into the prison system—if they are doing the right things on their own—got to go to a place where they could get their high school diploma or GED, go to college classes, learn a trade, and be in self-help programs and substance-abuse programs.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt; In 2013, the program was adopted statewide.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;

== Founding ==
Budnick began to see many of the kids he worked with—in some of his college programs—come out of prison and going into universities, community colleges, and obtaining employment. Budnick saw a network of ex-offenders and ex-gang-members who were changing their lives. Then, Budnick and others started doing retreats where the formerly incarcerated young people would meet with mentors and lawyers, and eventually formed a private [[Facebook]] page where they organized events and provided support.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;

In 2013, Budnick officially launched the Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC), a formal organization of formerly-incarcerated young adults who work to support one another, and that also aims to lower the number of people flowing into the criminal justice system through policy advocacy and community organizing. Budnick said "I started to see that there was not an organization out there that had high-achieving guys coming out of prison who could articulate why hope is important and why kids deserve a second chance and why kids are different from adults."&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;

=== Support network ===
ARC serves as a support network and a connection to services for over one hundred formerly incarcerated individuals. Members must commit to live crime-free, gang-free, drug-free, in school or working, and in service to their community. ARC provides support through mentoring, case management, internship and employment opportunities, regular support network meetings and social outings. Members receive mentoring from professional adult volunteers, known as ARC Allies, and through ARC’s Leadership Council that includes formerly incarcerated youth who are now university graduates, lawyers, engineers, politicians and other successful professionals.{{r|ARC}} ARC host retreats for members of the ARC network.&lt;ref name=mother /&gt;&lt;ref name=sunday /&gt;

=== Policy advocacy ===
ARC’s policy reform advocacy is conducted by formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully transformed their lives.&lt;ref name=ARC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work |website=Anti-Recidivism Coalition|url=http://www.antirecidivism.org/our_work|publisher=Anti-Recidivism Coalition|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ARC teamed up with the [[Ford Foundation]] and others to host a [[TEDx]] conference inside [[Ironwood State Prison]] with hundreds in attendance.&lt;ref name=TED&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mechanic|first1=Michael|title=TEDx goes to Prison|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/ironwood-state-prison-tedx-richard-branson-scott-budnick-sean-stephenson|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC produced a documentary about the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the 9-min doc of TEDxISP! |url=http://www.antirecidivism.org/tedxironwoodstateprison2014 |publisher=Anti-Recidivism Coalition |accessdate=2 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419212411/http://www.antirecidivism.org/tedxironwoodstateprison2014 |archivedate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prophet Walker, a founding member of ARC, was a guest of [[Michelle Obama]]'s at the 2015 State of the Union.&lt;ref name=SOTU&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Kurtis|title=State of the Union: Who are Michelle Obama's guests?|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-na-pn-sotu-guests-20150119-htmlstory.html|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving a six-year prison sentence, Walker sought to strengthen the bond between police officers and inner-city residents.&lt;ref name=SOTU /&gt;&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Aaron|title=Who is Prophet Walker?

'''Astronomy Day''' is an annual event in the United States - and later in other countries, like in Hungary - intended to provide a means of interaction between the general public and various [[astronomy]] enthusiasts, groups and professionals.

== History ==
This event was started in 1973 by Doug Berger, the president of the Astronomical Association of Northern [[California]]. His intent was to set up various [[telescope]]s in busy urban locations so that passersby could enjoy views of the heavens. Since then the event has expanded and is now sponsored by a number of organizations associated with astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Sky and Telescope;"''Celebrate Astronomy Day''"[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/celebrate-astronomy-day].  Nepe Sky And Telescope:April 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy Day also forms part of [[National Astronomy Week]], which begins on the preceding Monday.

Originally, Astronomy Day occurred on a Saturday between mid-April and mid-May, and was scheduled so as to occur at or close to the first quarter [[Moon]]. In 2007, an autumn rendition of Astronomy Day was added. It was scheduled to occur on a Saturday between mid-September and mid-October so as to be on or close to the first quarter [[Moon]].

== Future events ==
The [[Moon|lunar]] influence on the schedule means that the events happen on a different date each year, rather than set calendar dates. The table below shows the dates for up coming Astronomy Days:

'''Benazir Salam''' is an [[Indian classical dance]]r from [[Bangladesh]].

== Career ==
Benazir is the daughter of Md. Abdus Salam and Kohinoor Salam. She began her dance career at the dance school of ''Abdul Hasib Panna'' called ''Nikkon Shilpi Goshthi'' in 1983 in [[Rajshahi]], [[Bangladesh]]. She was considered the national child of the years 1986, 1988 and 1989 through a competition organized by the [[Shishu Academy]] of [[Bangladesh]]. In those competitions she performed [[Kathak]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Modern Dance]] and [[Folk Dance]]. She was awarded gold medals in [[Manipuri dance]], Modern Dance and Katthak Dance in Dhaka Junior Art and Music Festival 1988, sponsored by [[British Council]] and [[ANZ Grindlays Bank]]. She won the first Prize in Classical Dance (Katthak) in the National Education Week, [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh in 1990. She also won [[UNESCO]] Clubs Cultural Award, Bangladesh in the same year.

She received a scholarship from the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iccrindia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICCR) for her undergraduate (honors) degree in [[Odissi]] from [[Rabindra Bharati University]] between 1996 and 1999. She secured the first position among her class and received the university gold medal. Benazir subsequently completed her masters in Odissi dance from the university securing the first position and the gold medal. During her stay at the university, she was a disciple of renowned dancer Muralidhar Majhi and Poushali Mukherjee.

Currently she teaches Odissi dance at her own school in Bangladesh, ''Nupur''.&lt;ref&gt;Deepita, Novera. "Benazir: a Promising Odissi Dancer." The Daily Star 30 January 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">'''The Frank H. Buck Scholarship''' was a [[scholarship]] offered by the Frank H. and Eva B. Buck Foundation. The scholarship awarded approximately twelve to fifteen students scholarships each year. These scholarships intended to supplement any other financial aid awarded to the recipient so that all the ordinary costs of an education were covered.

The mission of the Buck Foundation was to support education in all of its aspects. They achieved this through the scholarship program which provides scholarship support to students chosen from the six counties that were [[California's 3rd congressional district|the congressional district]] served by [[Frank H. Buck]] in the 72nd through 76th United States Congresses (1932-42) - [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Solano County, California|Solano]] and [[Yolo County, California|Yolo]]. The foundation also provided grant support to educational institutions, libraries and other nonprofit organizations in support of their goals.

{{As of|2008}}, the Buck Foundation provided scholarship support to more than 259 students from within its geographic area. These students attended colleges and universities throughout the United States, as well as international educational institutions. They have studied a broad range of fields – the arts, sciences, liberal arts, economics, government, law, medicine, management – and are now making a positive contribution to society and their communities.

[[File:Carbonsnake.webm|thumb|Carbon snake experiment]]

'''Carbon snake''' is a demonstration of the [[dehydration reaction]] of [[sugar]] by concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]. With concentrated sulfuric acid, granulated table sugar ([[sucrose]]) performs degradation reaction which changes its form to black solid-liquid [[mixture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemical Demonstrations a handbook for teachers of chemistry volume 1|last=Shakhashiri|first=Bassam Z.|last2=Shreiner|first2=Rodney|last3=Bell|first3=Jerry A.|publisher=University of Wisconsin press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-299-08890-3|location=|pages=77-78|chapter=1.32 Dehydration of Sugar by Sulfuric Acid}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon snake experiment can sometimes be misrecognized as [[Black snake (firework)|black snake]], "sugar snake," or "burning sugar", which involve the reaction with [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] instead of sulfuric acid.

== Explanation ==

Concentrated sulfuric acid can perform a dehydration reaction with [[table sugar]]. After mixing, the color changes from white to brownish and eventually to black. The expansion of the mixture is the result of [[vaporization]] of [[water]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] inside the container. The gases inflate the mixture to form a snake-like shape, and give off a burned sugar smell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[granularity]] of the sugar can greatly affect the reaction: powdered sugar reacts very quickly but sugar cubes take longer to react.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg9wmU7Z-6s Don't Try This at Home - 3 - Sulfuric Acid and Sugar]&lt;/ref&gt;

When sucrose gets dehydrated, heat is given out to the surroundings in an [[exothermic reaction]], while [[graphite]] and liquid water are produced by the decomposition of the sugar:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spectacular Chemical Experiment|last=Roesky|first=Herbert W.|publisher=Wiley|year=2007|isbn=978-3-527-31865-0|location=|pages=17|chapter=Experiment 6: Sugar coal by splitting off water from sugar with sulfuric acid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; {{sub|({{serif|s}})}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{sub|({{serif|aq}})}} + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{sub|({{serif|g}})}} → 11 C {{sub|({{serif|s}})}} + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{sub|({{serif|g}})}} + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{sub|({{serif|g}})}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{sub|({{serif|g}})}}

As the acid dehydrates the sucrose, the water produced will dilute the sulfuric acid, giving out energy in the form of heat.

:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;  {{sub|({{serif|s}})}} → 12 C {{sub|({{serif|s}})}} + 11 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{sub|({{serif|l}})}}

== Alternative experiment ==

[[Paranitroaniline]] can be used instead of sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemical Demonstrations: A Sourcebook for Teachers Volume 1|last=Summerlin|first=Lee R.|last2=Ealy|first2=James L.|publisher=American Chemical Society|year=1988|isbn=978-0-841-21481-1|edition=2nd|location=|pages=171|chapter=Experiment 100: Dehydration of p-Nitroaniline: Sanke and Puff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes longer time for a black snake to develop and it requires heating under [[fumehood]], but once formed, the black snake rises from the container very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://communities.acs.org/thread/6242 Carbon Snake: demonstrating the dehydration power of concentrated sulfuric acid]&lt;/ref&gt;  It may lead to [[explosion]] if too much sulfuric acid is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKHUnHDphTc How to make P-Nitroaniline]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Edward Antonucci''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|t|ə|ˈ|n|uː|tʃ|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9UZWMlirbRU|"400th Episode Special: Cartoon Network Interview with Danny Antonucci"}}&lt;/ref&gt; born February 27, 1957) is a Canadian animator, director, producer, and writer. Antonucci is known for creating the [[Cartoon Network]] animated comedy series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]''. He also created ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'', ''[[Cartoon Sushi]]'', and ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]''.

Antonucci dropped out of the [[Sheridan College|Sheridan College of Visual Arts]] to take a job as an animator at [[Hanna-Barbera]], where he worked on a number of series, including ''[[The Flintstones Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''. He continued his career in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], where he worked on animated shorts and [[television commercials]] for International Rocketship Limited, and created his first solo work, the animated short ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]''. At [[MTV]], he worked on a number of commercials, his series ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', and the animation showcase program ''[[Cartoon Sushi]]'', which he co-created with Keith Alcorn. He went on to create ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' for Cartoon Network. In 2008, Antonucci signed to the now-defunct [[WildBrain]].

Throughout his career, Antonucci won a number of awards. Many of his commercials for [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[ESPN]] and [[Levi's]] won a number of awards. ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'' was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic.

==Early life==
Antonucci's parents were [[Italians|Italian]] immigrants to Canada. His experiences as a child in an immigrant family deeply influenced his later work, such as ''Lupo the Butcher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ns5RPHQigg|title=WMX 66 "Interview with Danny Antonucci"|author=Xolo.tv|date=August 25, 2006|access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonucci attended the [[Sheridan College|Sheridan College of Visual Arts]] but quit to take a job as an animator&lt;ref name ="animationfestival"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.animationfestival.ca/archives/2006/index.php?option=com_oiaf&amp;task=showevent&amp;i=74&amp;Itemid=433| title =Danny Antonucci| work =[[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]| accessdate =June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
at Canimage Production, a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]].&lt;ref name ="W!ldbrain"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/antonucci-makes-toons-with-wldbrain/| title =Antonucci Makes Toons with W!LDBRAIN| first= Ryan| last =Ball| work =[[Animation Magazine]]| date =September 5, 2008| accessdate =May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Starting his career as an animator, Antonucci worked on numerous shows, including ''[[The Flintstones Comedy Hour]]'',&lt;ref name ="W!ldbrain"/&gt; ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''.&lt;ref name ="kidzworld"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.kidzworld.com/article/7993-ed-edd-n-eddy-tv-show-facts#| title =Ed, Edd n Eddy TV Show Facts| work =Kidzworld.com| accessdate =May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intending to move to [[Los Angeles]] in 1984 to find more work, Antonucci landed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. He landed a job at International Rocketship Limited, animating short films and [[television commercials]]. His first effort was on the short film ''Hooray for Sandbox Land''.

===International Rocketship Limited, foundation of a.k.a. Cartoon, and MTV work===
Antonucci's first solo work was ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'', produced by International Rocketship Limited, about a short-tempered butcher who swears at the meat he is cutting and gets extremely mad at the smallest mistakes. Antonucci says the short arose out of his own frustration at having to work in children's film for so long, and to try his hand at creating a full-fledged character on film. The short animated film screened at several film festivals, including [[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]] in the [[United States]].

The 'Lupo' character was eventually licensed by the [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] athletic shoe company. This led to additional work, including animated commercials for [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and [[MTV]]. He also originally created bumpers for [[Cartoon Network]] featuring the [[jester]].

On April 1, 1994, Antonucci started an animation company named [[a.k.a. Cartoon]], which produced the short-lived [[MTV]] series ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', which began airing in 1994 and ended its run in 1995. Antonucci went on to work on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Cartoon Sushi]]'' show in 1997, directing, writing and providing voices, in addition to being responsible for the title sequence of the show.

===''Ed, Edd n Eddy''===
{{Main|Ed, Edd n Eddy}}
Feeling confined to "gross" and "edgy" work, such as his series ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show again with his company [[a.k.a. Cartoon]].&lt;ref name=Season1DVD/&gt; He resolved, however, to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the cartoon styles from the 1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD&gt;{{cite video| people =Danny Antonucci| year = October 10, 2006| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season—''Interview with the Creator''| time = 0:22–2:34 | medium = DVD| publisher = [[Warner Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonucci spent months designing the show, before trying to sell it to [[Nickelodeon]]. Nickelodeon told him that they would take the show, if they also obtained creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, and instead took the show to [[Cartoon Network]]. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci go in his own direction.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD/&gt;

Antonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD/&gt; To give the impression of movement, ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' uses shimmering character outlines similar to ''[[Squigglevision]]''.&lt;ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"/&gt; The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', but are still visible,&lt;ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Shumway|author2=Wayne, Lamont|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: A Unique Approach|date=June 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.03/4.03pages/SCAD_EEE.php3|work=Animation World Magazine|issue=4.3|accessdate=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD/&gt;

According to Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD-1&gt;{{cite video| people =Danny Antonucci| year = October 10, 2006| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season—''Interview with the Creator''| time = 2:15–4:39 | medium = DVD| publisher = [[Warner Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eds also possess personality traits similar to [[The Three Stooges]], whose money-making schemes and antics also invariably backfire.&lt;ref name="DVDTalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28046/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-complete-second-season/|title=DVD Talk Review: Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy — The Complete Second Season|accessdate=July 31, 2007|last=Cornelius|first=David|date=April 24, 2007|work=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cul-de-sac children and the [[Kanker Sisters]] were all based on children he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first-generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.&lt;ref name=Season1DVD-1/&gt;

''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' is the only [[A.k.a. Cartoon]] show to have a theatrical movie based on the animated television series. The series' finale movie, ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'', aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.&lt;ref name=BigPS&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Kapko|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show Premiers in the U.S.|date=November 16, 2009|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/ed-edd-n-eddy-s-big-picture-show-premiers-us|work=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On March 30, 2012, the series received another opportunity to air re-runs on the revived block ''[[Cartoon Planet]]''.&lt;ref name=CartoonPlanet&gt;{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Zach|title=Cartoon Network Brings Back The Classics With Cartoon Planet|url=http://www.webpronews.com/cartoon-network-brings-back-the-classics-with-cartoon-planet-2012-03|publisher=WebProNews|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WildBrain and upcoming series===
While Antonucci was working on ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'', it was announced on September 4, 2008 that he signed to [[WildBrain]]; Antonucci stated that he was "already kicking around three different ideas for his first Wildbrain project."&lt;ref name="WildBrainVariety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/digital/news/wildbrain-pacts-with-antonucci-1117991652/|title=WildBrain pacts with Antonucci|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|Penske Media Corporation]]|date=September 4, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2013, animator [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] posted a short interview with Antonucci for his class on his website, and on the end wrote: "He's currently working on a new series, so rock on."&lt;ref name="JoeMurrayStudio"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]]|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/2434/june-11-2013/|title=June 11, 2013|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
Antonucci's first solo work ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'' was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic.&lt;ref name=BigPS/&gt; [[Eric Fogel]], creator of ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', stated that ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'' "opened [his] eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired [him] to pursue a career path that was a bit more... twisted".&lt;ref name=Change&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Kapko|title=The Toon That Changed My Life|date=February 5, 2010|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/the-toon-that-changed-my-life/|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Antonucci received a number of awards. He worked on a number of award-winning commercials for [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[ESPN]] and [[Levi's]].&lt;ref name=BigPS/&gt; In 1998, for his work on ''[[Cartoon Sushi]]'', Antonucci received a [[National Cartoonists Society Division Awards|National Cartoonists Society Division Award]] for [[National Cartoonists Society Division Awards#Television Animation Award|Television Animation]]. His series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' received several awards and nominations; for his work on the series, Antonucci won a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] for Best Television Animation in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Animation World News: Awards|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.03/4.03pages/4.03awards.php3|work=[[Animation World Network|Animation World Magazine]]|issue=4.3|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Leo Awards|Leo Award]] for Best Director in an Animated Production or Series in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 Winners|url=http://www.leoawards.com/2012/2000_winners.html|work=[[Leo Awards]]|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became best known for ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', which with an almost 11-year run remains the longest running original [[Cartoon Network]] series and Canadian-made animated series to date.&lt;ref name=BigPS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CN/D3 Unleash New Ed, Edd n Eddy Game|first=Chris|last=Grove|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/6990|date=September 5, 2008|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also [[Cartoon Network]]'s most popular series among boys ages 2–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midway Enters Publishing Agreement For 3 Cartoon Network Shows |first=Marc-André |last=Sarrazin |url=http://www.nintendospin.com/news/midway-enters-publishing-agreement-for-3-cartoon-network-shows/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904151647/http://www.nintendospin.com/news/midway-enters-publishing-agreement-for-3-cartoon-network-shows/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |date=February 26, 2005 |work=NintendoSpin.com |accessdate=May 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Higgins, head of [[WildBrain]], considered ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' to be a "landmark in animation".&lt;ref name ="W!ldbrain"/&gt; [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], famous for creating the animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', called Antonucci "one of the founders and mainstays of modern animation".&lt;ref name="JoeMurrayStudio"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]]|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/2434/june-11-2013/|title=June 11, 2013|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">An '''executive head teacher''', '''executive head master''', '''executive head mistress''', '''executive head''' or '''executive principal''' is the substantive or strategic [[head teacher]] of more than one school in the [[United Kingdom]].

The position role of an executive head teacher usually comes in one of three forms: The appointed executive head is responsible for the management of more than one school. They remain the head teacher of their current school, but also become the strategic leader of one or more other schools. The executive head has no substantive headship in any school but remains the strategic leader of a chain, federation or collaboration of schools. In the case of the third option, the executive head teacher is above the head teachers appointed to manage each individual school within the consortium.

The role of executive heads was first introduced in 2004 when in 1996 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] announced that a new policy would allow head teachers who had been classed as outstanding to take over the leadership of schools who had been designated by local authorities as failing. The idea put forward that once the standards in those failing schools had improved, a new head teacher could take over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/340000/executive-heads-summary.pdf Executive heads: Summary report] National College &lt;/ref&gt; Today however the role and idea of and executive head teacher has expanded, with many staying in place within a system leadership role rather than specific headship roles; working with a number of head teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/jul/09/executive-headteacher-schools-leadership|title=The rise of the executive headteacher|first=Nick|last=Morrison|date=9 July 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a prominent educator in [[landscape architecture]] and a pioneer in introducing women into the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DZUAAAAMAAJ|title=Architecture and women: a bibliography documenting women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural critics and writers, and women in related fields working in the United States|last=Doumato|first=Lamia|date=1988-11-01|publisher=Garland Pub.|isbn=9780824041052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She received her undergraduate degree in science from [[Kalamazoo College]] in 1908, and the BArch and MID (Master in Landscape Design) in 1924 from the [[University of Michigan]]. She ran her own landscape firm from 1916-1926 and worked as a draftsperson for J.W. Case in Detroit.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02eFrTPIo4gC|title=No Boundaries: University of Illinois Vignettes|last=Hoddeson|first=Lillian|date=2004-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252072031|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She arrived at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]] in 1926 and spent the rest of her career there, developing a highly ranked landscape architecture department with colleagues [[Stanley Hart White|Stanley White]] and Karl Lohmann. In 1926 she was hired as associate teacher, then in 1929 she was hired as the first female tenure track faculty member. In 1949 she was promoted to associate professor, then in 1951 she was made full professor in the Department of Landscape Architecture. She retired in 1953.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drWgBgAAQBAJ|title=Women, Modernity, and Landscape Architecture|last=Dümpelmann|first=Sonja|last2=Beardsley|first2=John|date=2015-02-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317556558|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to teaching she also maintained her own practice.  An expert in the area of plants and planting design, she published and lectured extensively, and developed a plant cataloging system for educating students that was later published.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuA4AQAAIAAJ|title=Shaping the American Landscape: New Profiles from the Pioneers of American Landscape Design Project|last=Birnbaum|first=Charles A.|last2=Foell|first2=Stephanie Sue|date=2009-01-01|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=9780813927893|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her students went on to play a prominent role in the field of landscape architecture, including [[Hideo Sasaki]], [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]], and [[Richard Haag]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Greenwave''' is a mass [[science]] [[experiment]] involving primary schools across [[Ireland]]. It examines and records how spring arrives in [[Ireland]]. This is an educational and science initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0202/1201821933083.html Article in The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish students observe and record when certain plants and animals react to the longer days and warmer temperatures, in order to find out whether the "green wave" of spring moves from south to north across [[Ireland]] or inland from the coast to the centre of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story/?trs=mhgbauauid Article in the Sligo Weekender]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/tipp-schools-take-part-in-experiment-on-spring-season-1288914.html Article in The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt06/developing/dis.html Forfás Annual Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking part in Greenwave is a practical way to support the teaching of Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) part of the Irish Primary School Curriculum. The students develop their skills in:
*Observing
*Classifying
*Recognising patterns
*Estimating and measuring
*Recording and communicating

Schools registered in the [[Discover Primary Science]] programme, another initiative of DSE, can also earn credit towards their Award of Science Excellence by taking part in Greenwave.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]] and [[Science.ie]].

'''Kodu''', originally named ''Boku'', is a [[Computer programming|programming]] [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) by [[Microsoft]]'s [[FUSE Labs]]. It runs on [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]]. It was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101023190005/http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025855024c |title=Xbox LIVE Marketplace |date=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Windows version is available to the general public for download from Microsoft's FUSE web portal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodugamelab.com/ What is Kodu | Projects | Fuse Labs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kodu is a [[visual programming]] tool which builds on ideas begun with [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] in the 1960s and other current projects such as [[AgentSheets]], [[Squeak]] and [[Alice (software)|Alice]]. It is designed to be accessible by anyone.

Kodu is available to download as an Xbox 1 Indie Game.  There is also a PC version in an open beta which is available to anyone at their website.

Kodu is different from those other projects in several key ways:
* It avoids typing code by having users construct programs using visual elements via a game controller
* Rather than a bitmapped or 2D display, programs are executed in a 3D simulation environment, similar to [[Alice (software)|Alice]]

Kodu Game Lab has also been used as an educational learning tool in selected schools and learning centers.
Y8 have been set a task to do a 1-week project on their consoles.
Students have to have over 20 marks to pass the test overall marks are 25.

==Language design==
Kodu's programming model is simplified and can be programmed using a gaming controller or a combination of the keyboard and mouse. It dispenses with most "serious" programming conventions, including symbolic variables, branching, loops, number and string manipulation, subroutines, polymorphism, and so on.

This simplicity is achieved by situating the programming task in a largely complete simulation environment. The user programs the behaviors of characters in a 3d world, and programs are expressed in a high-level, sensory paradigm consisting of a [[rule-based system]] or language, based on conditions and actions similarly to [[AgentSheets]].

The typical "hello world" of Kodu is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''see - fruit - move - towards'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The grammar, as it were, of this expression is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''&lt;condition&gt; &lt;action&gt;'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where &lt;condition&gt; is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''&lt;sensor&gt; [&lt;filter&gt; ...]'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And &lt;action&gt; is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''&lt;verb&gt; [&lt;modifier&gt; ...]'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An illustrative variant of the above program is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''see - red - fruit - move - towards - quickly'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many different types of games can be made in Kodu, such as racing, strategy, RPGs, adventure, platform, puzzle, 1st person shooters, and others.

== Career ==
She was born Julie Sophie Gmeiner in Kronstadt (Brassó), in the region of [[Transylvania]]&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;, in [[Austria-Hungary]] (today [[Brașov]], [[Romania]]). She was the third of ten siblings, called Lula.&lt;ref name="Killyen" /&gt; The children received early musical instruction, and several of her siblings also became professional musicians: the mezzo-soprano [[Ella Gmeiner]], the bass-baritone Rudolf Gmeiner, the cellist Julius Gmeiner, and the pianist Luise Gmeiner.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt; 

Lula learned the violin at age six and played in the Kronstadt orchestra at age 15. A year later, she began voice lessons with the composer Rudolf Lassel, who dedicated a composition to her and premiered it with her.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt; From age 18, she studied at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] with [[Gustav Walter]], a notable voice teacher of the time.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt; About 1898, she moved to Berlin, where she studied with Emilie Herzog, [[Etelka Gerster]] and [[Lilli Lehmann]].&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kösters" /&gt; 

She performed [[Lied]]er by [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Max Reger]], among others, many of them written for her or dedicated to her. She married the Transylvanian engineer Ernst Mysz in Kronstadt in 1900. The couple had three daughters, two of whom died young, while the third, Susanne, would marry the tenor [[Peter Anders (tenor)|Peter Anders]], who studied with her mother.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;

Lula Mysz-Gmeiner was awarded the title of an Austrian-Hungarian [[Kammersänger]]in in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. Kutsch, Leo Riemens: ''[[Großes Sängerlexikon]].'' CD-ROM-Version (= 3. erweiterte Auflage (1997–2000)), Band 4, 2475.&lt;/ref&gt; She made concert tours in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt; She often collaborated with the pianists {{ill|Eduard Behm|de}}, [[Emil Mattiesen]], [[Arthur Nikisch]], [[Siegfried Ochs]], and Reger.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kösters" /&gt; Reger dedicated several lieder to her including his [[List of compositions by Max Reger#88|''Vier Gesänge'', Op. 88]], published in 1905.&lt;ref name="Kösters" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMSLP|work=4 Gesänge, Op.88 (Reger, Max)|cname=4 Gesänge, Op.88 (Reger, Max)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in concerts, singing for example the ''[[Alto Rhapsody]]'' by Johannes Brahms and Lieder by Hugo Wolf with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], conducted by [[Oskar Fried]], on 8 April 1907.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; In October 1923, she sang in two concerts of a program in memory of Reger at the [[St. Nikolai, Kie)|St. Nikolai]] in [[Kiel]]. [[Fritz Stein]] conducted the Oratorienverein and the Städtisches Orchester in ''[[List of compositions by Max Reger#112|Die Nonnen]]'', ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Requiem]]'' and ''[[Der 100. Psalm]]''.&lt;ref name="Kiel" /&gt;

From 1920, she was a voice teacher at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Staatlich akademische Hochschule für Musik zu Berlin]]. Among her students were [[Carla Henius]], [[Maria Müller]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] and [[Carla Spletter]].&lt;ref name="Kösters" /&gt; She lost her apartment in Berlin during World War II and taught from 1945 at the Landesakademie in [[Schwerin]]. She died in Schwerin on 7 August 1948.&lt;ref name="Meier" /&gt;

'''Outward Bound Costa Rica (OBCR)''' (formerly known as "Costa Rica Rainforest Outward Bound School" or CRROBS) is a non-profit [[experiential learning]] and [[outdoor education]] organization based in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. It is a charter of [[Outward Bound International]] (OBI).

==Mission and philosophy==
Learning through experience was the philosophy of the original Outward Bound when it was founded in 1941.&lt;ref name="Leadership the Outward Bound Way"&gt;Mountaineers Books ''Leadership the Outward Bound Way''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an educational process based on action and reflection. Experiences are intentionally designed, presented, and reflected upon to instill values and promote skills.  The mission of OBCR is to promote personal, cultural, and environmental integrity through Outward Bound principle-based adventure. Staff undertake diversity training to help deliver this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.miis.edu/jordanbowlby/files/2015/01/Diversity-Awareness-Non-Discrimination-Instructor-Training-3.pdf|title=Diversity Awareness and Non-discrimination Instructor Training for Outward Bound Costa Rica|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2015|website=The Middlebury Institute of International Studies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Costa Rica charter combines adventure activities - including [[hiking]], [[rafting]], [[kayaking]], [[surfing]], [[rappelling]], [[SCUBA diving]] and [[tree climbing]] - with the cultural experience of learning first-hand about the Costa Rican way of life and environment by staying with local families and immersion  in wilderness settings. The organization's aim is to develop 12 character traits:&lt;ref name="Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976)."&gt;''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''.  Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Outward Bound school was opened in [[Aberdyfi|Aberdovey]], [[Wales]] in 1941 by [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Lawrence Holt]]  with the support of the [[Blue Funnel Line]].&lt;ref name="Birth of Outward Bound"&gt;Outward Bound International (2004). ''[http://www.outwardbound.net/about/history/ob-birth.html Birth of Outward Bound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110062628/http://www.outwardbound.net/about/history/ob-birth.html |date=2007-11-10 }}''.  Retrieved October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Outward Bound grew out of Hahn's work in the development of the [[Gordonstoun]] school and what is now known as the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award]].  Outward Bound's founding mission was to give young [[seaman|seamen]] the ability to survive harsh conditions at [[sea]] by teaching confidence and tenacity. Jim Hogan served as warden for the first year of the school.&lt;ref name="Aberdovey"&gt;Aberdovey''[http://www.outward-bound.org/docs/info/Aberdovey.htm]''.  Retrieved October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fifty years later, in September 1991, a Coloradoan named Jim Rowe traveled by land from home - where he had been working as an instructor for Colorado Outward Bound School (COBS) - to Costa Rica. The first year in Costa Rica he focused on learning first-hand [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] culture, rainforest [[ecology]], and Costa Rican [[geography]]. He returned the second year with a monolithic raft and some [[SCUBA diving]] equipment to begin an adventure activities company, using the same boat to run SCUBA and river trips.&lt;ref name="K. Egan"&gt;K. Egan, Personal Communication, Retrieved June 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rowe's third year he focused more on equipment, river rafting, and [[mountaineering]]. His central location in [[Quepos]] had three uncrowded rivers ideal for rafting. Running day trips on the river helped him build the needed capital and marketing funds to establish a school for running courses more relevant to his philosophical approach to instructing. Rather than running quick commercial trips, he started leading trips whose objectives were to learn through adventure. He founded Save the Rainforest Expeditions School (STRES) to provide an avenue to work with youth applying the same philosophies as he used at COBS.&lt;ref name="Richards, A."&gt;Richards, A. ''[http://www.outward-bound.org/lic_sub3_history.htm Introduction: The Inward Odyssey of Outward Bound]'' Retrieved October 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; STRES claimed to focus on teaching self-reliance, leadership, compassion, and service&lt;ref name="Birth of Outward Bound"/&gt; in a Costa Rican environment: Outward Bound principles were taught through rainforest adventures and service projects geared toward rainforest conservation as well as indigenous village assistance.&lt;ref name="OBGLPF"&gt;Clark, J. Colin ''Outward Bound Global Leaders Program Fieldbook''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, Rowe applied for and received a provisional charter (a charter that would become a permanent charter after three years) if OBCR maintained Outward Bound International (OBI) policies and procedures. In September 1997, OBCR received a full charter from Outward Bound International.&lt;ref name="K. Egan"/&gt;

==Current==
Outward Bound Costa Rica instructed 4,787 students in 2008 and totaled 23,816 SPDs (Student Participation Days).&lt;ref&gt;Costa Rica Rainforest Outward Bound School(2008). ''Reporte Anual.'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers reflect students who participated in Open Enrollment courses(OBCR's scheduled courses), [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] courses, day and weekend courses with Costa Rica's local schools and organizations, custom-made courses, and Iztarú Scouting Camp courses.

==International students==
===International student information===
In 1990, the Faculty of Overseas of PNU was established for the study of Persian Language and Literature at Bachelor, Master and Ph.D levels. The aims of these programs is to give foreign students an understanding of Iranian culture and art.

In the new organization of the university, the Faculty of Overseas is replaced by the International Study Center. This implies that the Center is authorized to offer all the degree programs of PNU. These programs are correspondence courses, which heavily rely on textbooks. The language of instruction is [[Persian language|Persian]]. The center has 1182 students admitted through Degree programs in 55 countries.

===Admission===
Since it is impossible for most international students to enroll and take part in the National University Entrance Exam, the International Study Center provides opportunities for students to continue their studies through degree programs at Bachelor, Master and Ph.D level.

International applicants are admitted at the university on the basis of their high school GPA or their exam results. The center also enrolls students on the basis of their secondary school or their bachelor's degree GPA at two levels of bachelor's and master's degrees subsequently. The final exams of students of the center are administered with the assistance of the Iranian consulates and embassies around the world. Having acquired necessary scores at the exams of the first semester, and having a high educational background at university or high school levels with high GPA, the encompassing students will become regular students.

===Language courses for non-Persian===
The following [[Persian language|Persian]] basic language courses are launched for non-Iranian nationals worldwide:

==Controversy==
Iranian universities faced criticism in early 2007 about their treatment of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] students. Although religious identification has been removed from entrance exam papers, students are reportedly being expelled once their religion is discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/03/01/1172338754204.html Baha'i group says Iran discriminates - Breaking News - World - Breaking News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2007/03/070306_mf_bahai_students.shtml BBCPersian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy specifically focused on Payame Noor when an official university letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.bahai.org/img/7941/300/0/nc/bwns_7941-300.jpg Official letter from university to discriminate against Baha'i students (in Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the expulsion as government policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai.us/Bahais-expelled Iranian policy calls for Baha'i expulsions | Bahai Faith | Baha'i Faith&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 30 Baha'i students have been expelled under the policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/510 Bahá'í World News Service - Bahá'í International Community - Official character of Baha'i expulsions in Iranian university revealed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in 2008, the university declared that [[Arabic]] will be the "second language" of the university, and that all its services will be offered in Arabic, concurrent with [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiozamaaneh.com/news/2008/03/post_4081.html رادیو زمانه | خبر اول | ایران | دومین زبان دانشگاه پیام نور شد&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Iranian Arabs]]).

'''Peter James Denning''' (born January 6, 1942) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]] and writer. He is best known for pioneering work in [[virtual memory]], especially for inventing the [[working-set model]] for [[computer program|program]] behavior, which addressed [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] in [[operating system]]s and became the reference standard for all [[memory management]] policies.  He is also known for his works on principles of operating systems, operational analysis of queueing network systems, design and implementation of CSNET, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] digital library, codifying the great principles of [[computing]], and most recently for the book ''The Innovator's Way'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Innovator's Way: Essential Practices for Successful Innovation'', MIT Press (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; on innovation as a set of learnable practices.

== Biography ==
Denning was born January 6, 1942, in Queens, NY, and raised in Darien, CT.  He took an early interest in science, pursuing [[astronomy]], [[botany]], [[radio]], and [[electronics]] while in grade school.  At [[Fairfield Prep]], he submitted home designed computers to the science fair in 1958, 1959, and 1960.  The second computer, which solved [[linear equations]] using [[pinball]] machine parts, won the grand prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/citations/pjdfair59.html Peter J. Denning - ACM 40 Years 2007]. Cs.gmu.edu (1959-04-12). Retrieved on 2014-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Manhattan College]] for a [[Bachelor degree|Bachelor]] in [[Electrical engineering|EE]] (1964) and then [[MIT]] for a [[PhD]] (1968).  At MIT he was part of [[Project MAC]] and contributed to the design of [[Multics]].  His PhD [[thesis]], "Resource allocation in multiprocess computer systems", introduced seminal ideas in working sets, locality, thrashing, and system balance.

At [[Princeton University]] from 1968 to 1972, he wrote his classic book, ''Operating Systems Principles'', with [[E G Coffman]].  He collaborated with [[Alfred Aho]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] on optimality proofs for paging algorithms and on a simple proof that compilers based on precedence parsing do not need to backtrack. At [[Purdue University]] (1972–1983) he supervised numerous PhD theses validating locality-based theories of memory management and extending the new mathematics of operational analysis of queueing networks.  He co-founded [[CSNET]].  He became department head in 1979 and completed another book on computational models, ''Machines, Languages, and Computation'', with [[Jack Dennis]] and Joe Qualitz.

At NASA Ames from 1983 to 1991 he founded the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riacs.edu RIACS]&lt;/ref&gt; and turned it into one of the first centers for interdisciplinary research in computational and space science.

At [[George Mason University]] from 1991 to 2002 he headed the Computer Science Department, was an associate dean and vice provost, and founded the Center for the New Engineer.  The Center was a pioneer in web-based learning. He created a design course for engineers, called ''Sense 21'', which was the basis of his project to understand innovation as a skill.  He created a course on Core of Information, Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/itcore Core of Information Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108085524/http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/itcore/ |date=January 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the basis his Great Principles of Computing  project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatprinciples.org Great Principles of Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Naval Postgraduate School]] since 2002 he heads the Computer Science Department, directs the Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.edu/Cebrowski Cebrowski Institute for Innovation and Information Superiority]&lt;/ref&gt;  He chaired the faculty council.

Denning served continuously as a volunteer in [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) since 1967. In that time he served as president, vice president, three board chairs, Member-at-Large, Editor of [[ACM Computing Surveys]], and Editor of the monthly [[Communications of the ACM|ACM Communications]].  He received seven ACM awards for service, technical contribution, and education.  ACM presented him with a special award&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/citations/pjdacm07.html special award]&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2007 recognizing 40 years of continuous service.

Denning has received 26 awards for service and technical contribution.  These include one quality customer service award, three professional society fellowships, three honorary degrees, six awards for technical contribution, six for distinguished service, and seven for education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/pjdawards.html complete list].&lt;/ref&gt;

He married [[Dorothy E. Denning]] in 1974.  She went on to become a noted computer security expert.

== Work ==
Denning's career has been a search for fundamental principles in subfields of computing. He writes prolifically. From 1980 to 1982 he wrote 24 columns as ACM President, focusing on technical and political issues of the field.  From 1985 to 1993 he wrote 47 columns on "The Science of Computing" for 
American Scientist magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanscientist.org American Scientist magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on scientific principles from across the field. Beginning in 2001 he has written quarterly "IT Profession" columns&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/CACMcols/ "IT Profession" columns]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Communications of the ACM]], focusing on principles of value to practicing professionals.

=== Virtual memory ===
In 1970 he published a classic paper that displayed a scientific framework for virtual memory and the validating scientific evidence, putting to rest a controversy over virtual memory stability and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P. J. | title = Virtual Memory | doi = 10.1145/356571.356573 | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–189 | year = 1970 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he proposed the working set as a dynamic measure of memory demand and explained why it worked using the locality idea introduced by Les Belady of [[IBM]].  His working set paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P. J. | title = The working set model for program behavior | doi = 10.1145/363095.363141 | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 323–333 | year = 1968 | pmid =  | pmc = }} working set paper]&lt;/ref&gt; became a classic. It received an ACM Best paper award in 1968 and a SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigops.org/awards/hall-of-fame.html SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005.

=== Operating system principles ===
In the early 1970s he collaborated with Ed Coffman, Jr., on ''Operating Systems Theory'', which became a classic textbook used in graduate courses and stayed in print until 1995.  That book helped to erase doubts that the OS field could be approached as a science.

In the middle 1970s he collaborated with Jeffrey Buzen on operational analysis, extending Buzen's basic operational
laws to deal with all queueing networks.  The operational framework explained why computer performance models work so well, even though violating the traditional stochastic Markovian assumptions.  It has become the preferred method for teaching performance prediction in computing courses.

In the early 1980s, he was one of the four founding Principal investigators of [[CSNET|Computer Science Network]], sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]]  The other three were [[Dave Farber]], Larry Landweber, and Tony Hearn.  They led the development of a fully self-supporting CS community network that by 1986 included 165 sites and 50,000 users.  CSNET was the key transitional stepping stone from the original [[ARPANET]] to the [[NSFNET]] and then the [[Internet]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.   In 2009, the [[Internet Society]] awarded CSNET its prestigious Jon Postel award, recognizing its key role in bridging from the ARPANET to NSFNET.

He led the ACM Digital Library project 1992-97, which went live in 1997.  The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] became the first professional society to offer a fully searchable library of everything it ever published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Rous | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1145/205323.205348 | title = The ACM electronic publishing plan | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 97–109 | year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = }} ACM Electronic Publishing Plan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Principles of Computing ===
In 1999, he expanded the search for fundamental principles to cover all of computing.  The discovery of natural information processes in biology, physics, economics, materials, and other fields convinced him that the basic definitions of computation had to be modified to encompass natural information processes as well as artificial.  He and his team have produced a draft framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatprinciples.org draft framework]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Principles framework revealed that "innovating" is a core practice of computing.  Unable to find anyone who understood how to teach the skill of innovating, he joined with Bob Dunham and identified eight foundational practices of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Dunham | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1145/1125944.1125974 | title = Innovation as language action | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 47 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }} eight foundational practices of innovation&lt;/ref&gt;  They published ''The Innovator's Way'', a book laying the eight essential practices of successful innovation.

=== Computing education ===
Denning has been a major influence in computing education.  In the early 1970s he led a task force that designed the first core course on operating systems (OS) principles.  OS became the first non-math CS core course.  In the mid 1980s he led a joint ACM/IEEE committee that described computing as a discipline with nine
functional areas and three cognitive processes, the basis of ACM Curriculum 1991.  In the 1990s he set out on a quest to codify the great principles of computing.  He maintains that computing is a science both of natural and artificial information processes.  NSF designated him a Distinguished Education Fellow&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/citations/pjdcdef07.html Distinguished Education Fellow]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 to launch a movement to use the Great Principles framework for innovations in education and research.  In 2009, ACM's SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) recognized his contributions with its lifetime service award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/citations/pjdsigcse10.html SIGCSE Lifetime Service Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humor ==
Denning is an inveterate punster who frequently uses humor to get points across. Examples:

* All speech is free.  It's just the consequences that get you.
* A request is not in the words you speak.  It is in the listening of those who hear you.
* After many years of trying to make computers think like brains, AI researchers got brains that think they are computers.

'''Radford University''' is a co-educational public university located in [[Radford, Virginia]]. It is one of the state's eight doctorate-granting public [[universities]]. Founded in 1910, Radford offers curricula for [[undergraduates]] in more than 100 fields, graduate programs including the [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[M.B.A.]], [[M.A.]], [[M.S.]], [[Ed.S.]], [[Psy.D.]], [[M.S.W.]], and specialized [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral programs]] in health-related professions.&lt;ref name="RUdoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/%7Epsyc-web/psyd/index.htm |title=Doctor of Psychology |publisher=Radford University |accessdate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723131405/http://www.runet.edu/%7Epsyc-web/psyd/index.htm |archivedate=2008-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Radford''' was founded in Radford as a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505013518/http://www.runet.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about/history.html |archivedate=May 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the school was renamed the '''State Teachers College at Radford''', with the primary intent of training teachers in the [[Appalachian region]]. In 1943, as part of the state's consolidation movement, the college merged with the [[Virginia Tech|Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] in nearby [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], serving as the larger university's women's campus.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; The merger dissolved in 1964, and following a period of sustained and significant growth, Radford College was granted university status in 1979.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; In 2008, the Virginia General Assembly authorized three [[Doctorate|doctoral programs]] at Radford University, and the first doctoral degrees were awarded in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about/history.html|title=Our History {{!}} Radford University|website=www.radford.edu|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randolf "Randy" S. David''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] journalist, sociologist, and public intellectual. He is a professor emeritus of sociology at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]. He currently pens a weekly newspaper column for the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', as well as being a member of the board of advisor of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.abs-cbn.com/ir/BOD.aspx] retrieved February 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Randy David hails from [[Pampanga]] and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, major in Sociology, from the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |author=Pepper Marcelo |title=The Wisdom of Randy David |url=http://www.planetphilippines.com/archives/2005/sep1-15-05/current/features_current/feature2.html |publisher=Planet Philippines Online Edition |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305150625/http://www.planetphilippines.com/archives/2005/sep1-15-05/current/features_current/feature2.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also pursued doctoral studies at the [[University of Manchester]], though he opted not to complete them and chose instead to remain in the Philippines during the [[martial law]] government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

A longtime professor in the Department of Sociology of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], David first came into widespread prominence in 1986, when he accepted an offer by the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to host a public affairs talk show on [[DZTV-TV|IBC-13]]. The show, named ''Truth Forum'', was notable as the only public affairs talk show during its time that was conducted in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], rather than English. David later joined the newly re-established [[Associated Broadcasting Company]] as a newscaster and the host of a new talk show, ''[[Public Life with Randy David]]''. After leaving the network in 1995, David hosted ''Public Life'' for [[GMA Network]], and until 2003, ''Off the Record'' (with [[Katrina Legarda]]) for [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation|ABS-CBN]], his last regular hosting stint to date. Since 1995, his newspaper column, ''Public Lives'', has appeared every Sunday on the pages of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

On February 25, 2006, David was arrested in [[Quezon City|Santolan, Quezon City]] while celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The reason for the arrest was the lack of permit to rally, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] having revoked all permits after she declared [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|a state of national emergency]] just a few hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Professor, 2 others nabbed (2:29 p.m.) |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/02/24/professor.2.others.nabbed.(2.29.p.m.).html |work= |publisher=Sun.Star |date=2006-02-24|accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Police arrest UP prof, Akbayan leader |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=30846 |work= |publisher=[[ABS-CBN]] |date= 2006-02-24 |accessdate=2007-06-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224330/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=30846 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released with all charges dropped. In May, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] declared that the arrests of David and his co-detainees were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =''David v. Arroyo'', G.R.

David expressed interest in running for a congressional seat in Pampanga should Gloria Macapagal Arroyo run for Congresswoman in the 2010 general elections, a fight that has been dubbed by several Senators and mediamen as "David vs. Gloriath".&lt;ref&gt;Philippine Daily Inquirer: June 26, 2009, front page&lt;/ref&gt; David later chose not to run, and Arroyo was elected to the seat in May 2010.

==Family==
David is married to [[Karina Constantino-David]] who served until 2008 as the Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) of the [[Philippines]]. The couple has four children, including [[broadcast journalist]] [[Kara David]], UP National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS) professor Dr. Carlos Primo David, Nadya Melina David and Jika David.  The [[Bishop of Kalookan]], the Most Reverend Pablo Virgilio David, D.D. is his younger brother. David is also the son-in-law of the [[historian]] [[Renato Constantino]].

'''Refund to Savings''' (R2S) is an innovative, rigorously designed and scalable program intended to help low-income households build savings and increase financial security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx Refund to Savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204204502/http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx |date=2013-02-04 }}. Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a collaboration between the [[Center for Social Development]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Duke University]], and [[Intuit|Intuit Inc]]. R2S is the largest savings experiment conducted in the United States to date. This initiative builds on Intuit’s [[TurboTax]] Free File Alliance Online product, available free to lower-income taxpayers, to reach thousands of households.

The goal of the initiative is to design and test a low-touch, scalable intervention that can transform the tax-refund windfall into savings to improve financial security. The intervention builds on existing infrastructure and integrates with normal financial behavior, so it can quickly and inexpensively be expanded to reach millions of American households.

==Key Researchers and Partners==

The experiment was developed by economics professors [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and  [[Dan Ariely]] at [[Duke University]] and uses [[Intuit Inc|Intuit's]] TurboTax tax preparation software.

==Background==

The moment people are notified about their tax refund is a golden opportunity to divert money into short- and long-term savings. The participant just learned they will be receiving money, the money feels like a windfall (outside of their normal income pattern) and they do not yet have the money in hand.

The R2S initiative capitalizes on this opportunity. The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. For example, would mentioning the names of the taxpayer’s children increases the desire to divert money? Or would providing taxpayers a sense 
of common behavior among their peers motivate increased debt clearing?

The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. The prompts are informed by behavioral economics principles and have been shown in prior research to significantly increase savings intention in lower-income taxpayers. The variation in the prompts tests the influence of particular motivations on financial decision-making, compared with an unprompted control group. The variation in defaults tests the effect of defaults and of anchoring on savings behavior.

==Research Agenda==

The R2S initiative involves collecting three streams of data to evaluate the impact of the intervention and inform the design of future innovations to build savings, including the Intention Survey, In-Product Saving Offer, and Household Financial Survey.

===Intention Survey===

The Intention Survey is cross-sectional and designed to elicit information about possible behaviors and responses to behavioral economics-inspired prompts. It also gauges ownership of financial products (e.g., checking account, savings bond) and interest in using or opening these products at tax time. Findings from the Intention Survey contributed to the development of the In-Product Saving Offer and the Household Financial Survey. In 2012, 4,087 Intuit customers responded to the Intention Survey.

===In-Product Saving Offer===
The In-Product Saving Offer is the largest saving experiment ever undertaken in the U.S. TurboTax Freedom Edition users with refunds are assigned randomly to a treatment condition or control group. The control group uses the regular TurboTax program. The treatment group uses a version of the program in which they receive a prompt and a saving opportunity designed to increase saving. Data generated by program use and refund allocation behavior will be evaluated to determine whether the prompts, saving opportunity, or both increased saving levels compared to the control groups. In 2012, 150,000 people were included in the study, and about 1 million tax filers are expected to be included in 2013.

===Household Financial Survey===
The Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a longitudinal cohort study designed to determine the impact of tax-time saving and examine the effects of supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for [[precautionary savings]]) factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved in the absence of the intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.

==Impact==
Ultimately, R2S has numerous implications for ongoing policy discussions at state and federal levels. First, the findings will show whether (a) the use of behavioral economics-inspired interventions can increase saving at tax time and (b) saving-promotion efforts yield increased financial security and improved household balance sheets. Second, the project could provide evidence on the effect of supply- and demand-side constraints to saving and thus inform policy discussions regarding financial access, financial knowledge, and consumer protection. Third, the design and operation of the R2S initiative may be of interest to those considering policy innovations that leverage private-sector resources or incorporate public-private partnerships to achieve public policy objectives.

The team is also planning an ambitious program of dissemination to share R2S findings with a variety of audiences. Several policy, academic, and general interest publications will be produced detailing the impact of the experiment and findings from the research in each year. R2S also plans to host events to share interesting findings with the research and policy communities and with the general public.

Like all [[Waldorf school]]s, the high school's curriculum followed the general outline that the founder of [[Waldorf education]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], developed for the original Waldorf School in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. However, in keeping with its mandate to prepare students for [[University of California]] (UC) admission, the Santa Cruz Waldorf High School integrated Waldorf curriculum with the course requirements of the UC system.

==Curriculum==
The school operated on a trimester system. In addition to the math, English, science, history, social studies, and foreign language core curriculum, the school provided specialty courses in art (painting, drawing, sculpture), practical arts (metalwork, woodwork, jewelry making, pottery, bookbinding), archery, chorus, drumming, chamber music and drama. In addition to the usual activities, the physical education program included surfing, rock climbing, kayaking, sailing, meditative motion, and hiking. Math courses were delivered at three skill levels: basic algebra, advanced algebra, and calculus.

In keeping with its Pacific Rim educational theme, the school's foreign language program included [[Mandarin Chinese]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=817 Edith Yang, Importance of a Global Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105065711/http://www.cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=817 |date=November 5, 2007 }} news article, ''City on a Hill Press''.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, '''school governors''' are the overseers of a school. In [[state school]]s they have three main functions:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270398/Governors-Handbook-January-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of:
*Giving the school a clear vision, ethos and strategic direction
*Holding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils
*Overseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent.

They are the largest volunteer force in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Being a governor|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Education/Schools/Governors.asp|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Governing Bodies (State Schools)}}State schools==

==={{anchor|Membership}}Composition===
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, every state school has a governing body, consisting of specified numbers of various categories of governors depending on the [[Education in England#Schools|type]] and size of school. Governors are unpaid, but they may be reimbursed for expenses for such as the care of dependants or relatives and travel costs.
Under section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employers must give anyone in their employment who serves as a governor reasonable time off their employ to carry out their governor duties. Employers can decide whether this time off is given with or without pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10028529 | work= Directgov | title= Time off for public duties | accessdate= 29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the following categories are applicable:
* Parent governors parents of children at the school;
* Staff governors: members of the school staff;
* Authority governors (previously known as LEA governors): nominated by the [[local education authority]];
* Co-opted governors (previously known as community governors): members of the local community (appointed by the rest of the governing body);
* Foundation, partnership and sponsor governors: representatives of any sponsoring bodies.

The proportions vary between differing types of school, but as an example, in [[Community school (England and Wales)|community school]]s, which are usually owned by the [[local education authority|LEA]], the regulations prescribe that parent governors should be at least one-third of the governors, staff governors at least two places, but no more than one-third, including the headteacher; LEA governors 20% and community governors at least 20%. Church schools will typically include a representative of the church in addition to the above categories. The minimum number of governors is nine, the maximum is twenty (although sponsor governors are additional to these numbers). Governors are appointed for a maximum of four years, this term is renewable.

The [[headteacher]] of each school is ''[[ex officio]]'' a staff governor, but he or she can decline to take up the position. Should they decide ''not'' to become a member of the governing body, their place is left vacant.&lt;ref name="gttl"&gt;{{cite web | title = Guide to the Law for School Governors | url = http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/guide%20to%20the%20law%20for%20school%20governors.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Department for Education]] | accessdate = 2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Staff governors'' (other than the head teacher) are elected by the school staff and must be paid to work at the school, directly by the school (that is, not under an external contract such as catering or cleaning). At least one staff governor must be a teacher, and if there are three or more staff governors, at least one must be a member of the support staff. If no member of the appropriate category stands for election, the vacant place can be filled by an elected person from the other category (i.e. if no teachers wish to become governors, all staff governors may be support staff, and vice versa).

''Parent governors'' can either be elected by parents of children at the school, or if insufficient numbers are elected, can be appointed by the governing body to fill any remaining vacancies. Such appointees need not be parents of children currently attending the school – if no suitable candidates are found, they may be parents of former pupils, or of any child of school age. Parents so appointed can be removed from their positions by a majority vote of the governing body.

''Associate members'' may be appointed by the governing body as members of committees, and may include pupils, school staff, or anyone else who the governing body feel could contribute to its work. Their voting rights are decided by the governing body, and are also limited by law to exclude matters concerning the budget, admissions, pupil discipline and the election or appointment of governors.  Associate members are not governors and are not included in the school's instrument of government.

By law, governing bodies meet at least three times every year, as a ''full governing body'', where the ongoing business of committees, the governing body and the school are discussed, reported on and where decisions are taken by a majority vote. Most of the work of governors, however, is done at committee level.

==={{anchor|Chair of Governing Body}}Chair===
The governing body is led by the ''chair'', elected by the governing body from within its membership, though anyone who works at the school cannot stand for the office. Since 1 September 2003, the term of office for the chair can be set to more than one year.

The chair is supported in their work by one or more vice chairs, who may be delegated certain tasks or responsibilities. Certain tasks, including signing-off the school budget, can only be done by the chair.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The process for election of chair and vice-chair and their term of office should be laid down in the governing body's standing orders.

The full governing body can remove the chair or any vice chairs by a majority vote of no confidence.

==={{anchor|Clerk to the Governing Body}}Clerk===
The governors are supported in their work by a clerk to the governing body. In many schools this role is combined with that of [[bursar]] or administrative officer, although they may also be employed solely in a clerking role. In some areas clerking services may be provided by the [[local education authority]]. The clerk is remunerated for their work.

The clerk is usually considered an integral part of the governing body, giving advice whilst not entitled to vote. Their role is primarily one of providing advice and interpretation on the regulatory and administrative framework in which governors work, preparing and distributing minutes and agendas, keeping records and dealing with correspondence.

===Responsibilities===
The headteacher of the school is responsible for day-to-day management of the school. The role of the governing body is to provide strategic management, and to act as a "critical friend", supporting the work of the headteacher and other staff.

Schools generally have a delegated budget to cover salaries, running costs, maintenance and equipment; the governing body is responsible for managing this budget. They can decide how many and what types of staff to employ, which equipment to upgrade or replace and what the priorities are for implementing new strategies and initiatives.

Governors must appoint the headteacher, and may be involved in the appointment of other staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/2680/regulation/15/made | title = The School Staffing (England) Regulations 2009 | publisher = [[legislation.gov.uk]] | accessdate = 2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governors also have a role in monitoring the school's progress, and in setting annual targets for the school's performance and for the headteacher (and ensuring that the headteacher sets targets for other staff).

Governors must review school [[Expulsion (academia)|exclusions]] in certain circumstances, and have the power to reinstate an excluded pupil or reduce the term of the exclusion (although not to increase it).

[[Foundation school]]s, [[voluntary aided school]]s and [[academy (English school)|academies]] act as their own admissions authorities. In such schools, the governing body sets the admissions policy, makes admissions decisions and defends admissions appeals.

===Committees===
Most governing bodies use a committee structure to undertake their monitoring and evaluation roles. Membership and terms of reference of committees must be determined annually. Finance, staffing, admissions, health and safety, curriculum and premises committees are very common. Other areas covered by committees may include marketing, discipline and management. Many governing bodies form [[working group]]s to tackle specific problems.

Since 1 September 2003, particular committees can be given delegated powers to make decisions about the school that do not then require any approval by the full governing body

===Training===
Governors and clerks can be offered training and support either by the local authority, by central government or by other organisations.

===Support organisations===
There are a number of organisations, websites and resources that support governors and governing bodies in England and Wales.

The [[National Governors' Association]] is a representative body for school governors in England. The NGA is an independent charity. Governors can join the NGA as individuals, as members of a governing body, or through their local governors' association.

[[Governor Wales]] is the voice of governors of schools in Wales. Governor Wales is funded by the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]].

SGOSS – Governors for Schools is a government funded charity tasked with recruiting governors for governing bodies in England. SGOSS also receives support from business organisations. The SGOSS service is free to local education authorities, volunteers, employers and schools. In 2012 SGOSS began a partnership with the University of Manchester to ensure local schools have access to skilled governors.&lt;ref&gt;http://goodnewsshared.com/national-education-charity-calls-universities-support-school-governance/ Partnership Brings School Governor Recruitment Success Good News Shared&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GovernorLine]] offers free, confidential advice, information and support to school governors, clerks and individuals involved directly in the governance of maintained schools in England. GovernorLine is a free service delivered by an organisation called WorkLife Support under contract to the UK government.

GovernorNet.co.uk was a UK government website with information for school governors. It was closed by the Department for Education in April 2011, with a recommendation to governors to use the variety of forums that are available including UK Governors and TES Connect.

=={{anchor|Governing Bodies (Public Schools)}}Independent schools==
[[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent schools]], and public schools in particular, generally have governing bodies, although by their very nature, such schools usually decide on their own requirements for their composition.

=={{anchor|Research on Governing Bodies}}Research==

A study published in 1995 examined whether they were bodies of 'active citizens' providing opportunities for democratic participation in the governance of schools or unpaid volunteers doing the bidding of the state. It also found that the composition and functioning of governing bodies was shaped by the social divisions of class, race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Active citizenship and the Governing of Schools|last1= Deem|first1= R.|last2= Brehony|first2= K.J.|last3= Heath|first3= S.|year= 1995|publisher= Open University Press|location= Buckingham|isbn= 0-335-19184-3}}

'''''Sex Education''''' is a 1995 book by the American author Jenny Davis. It was written for readers in grades 9-12 and tells the story of two teens who, working together on a term project for their sex education class, are instructed to care for someone else for the semester. They choose a lonely, pregnant neighbor, a task that proves more difficult than they anticipated.

The book has been the subject of many legal challenges, according to the [[American Library Association]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''Smarthinking''' is an academic [[online tutoring]] service, provided by [[Pearson Education]]. The service provides on-demand support from tutors in over 25 subjects. Smarthinking uses a [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach along with whiteboard interface technology to connect students and tutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pearsoned.com/news/pearson-announces-smarthinking-online-tutoring-service-enhancements-to-improve-institutional-and-learner-outcomes/#.VGuyuPldWSq |title=Pearson Announces Smarthinking Online Tutoring Service Enhancements to Improve Institutional and Learner Outcomes &amp;#124; Pearson News |website=Pearsoned.com |date=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smarthinking launched in 1999 to provide real-time assistance for students in postsecondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsoned.com/higher-education/products-and-services/smarthinking/about-us/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; Smarthinking &amp;#124; Pearson |website=Pearsoned.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Smarthinking was honored with the Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA) CODie award for Best Instruction Solutions for Students at Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brighthub.com/education/online-learning/reviews/25812.aspx |title=Need an Online Tutoring Program and Writing Service? Think About Smarthinking! |website=Brighthub.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In an effort to expand its offerings, Pearson Education acquired Smarthinking in February 2011. December 1, 2011 Smarthinking launched its new discipline of support for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/373682 |title=Smarthinking Launches Reading Tutoring Support Services |website=PR.com |date=2011-12-03 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutors could perform live sessions in core areas of vocabulary,  reading and comprehension. In 2012, Pearson reported the addition of Liberal Arts Math to its Math services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pearsoned.com/news/smarthinking-launches-liberal-arts-math-online-tutoring-support-services/ |title=Smarthinking Launches Liberal Arts Math Online Tutoring Support Services &amp;#124; Pearson News |website=Pearsoned.com |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date Smarthinking has over 1500 tutors, and has completed between  6 and 7 million tutoring sessions. It's headquartered in 1919 M. St., NW Suite 600 Washington, DC 20036.

==Leadership==
Smarthinking leadership team is composed of former college professors and experts in their disciplines.

Christa Ehmann Powers, Ph.D. has served as Vice President &amp; Chief Education Officer since Smarthinking’s launch in 1999, and heads the development of online tutoring and instructional services in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsoned.com/higher-education/products-and-services/smarthinking/about-us/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; Smarthinking &amp;#124; Pearson |website=Pearsoned.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Pearson- conducted efficacy studies on the effectiveness of Smarthinking have shown the impact of usage, including:

• Students using Smarthinking at Volunteer State Community College were eight times more likely to successfully complete their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/results/files/CCR_WEB_FINAL.pdf#page=34 |title=Smarthinking : Case study |website=Pearsonmylabandmastering.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''StreetLITES Africa''' is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] working with schools in [[Ghana]], [[Africa]] to help educate and care for [[street children]].

The "LITES" is an acronym of: ''L''earning, ''I''nformation, ''T''echnology, ''E''mpowerment and ''S''upport to street children in [[Africa]] and [[India]].

== Established goals ==

The charity describes their work as empowering agencies to provide computer resources alongside their existing outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetlites.org/ StreetLITES Africa], accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They collect redundant IT hardware and other educational goods with the aim to place them with agencies who are working to help abolish poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charity Commission|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1114913&amp;subid=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Funding and partners ==

Funding is provided mainly by donations from the public, the charity also works with partners in the UK and Ghana, for example [[Refurbit]] Hull,&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetlites.org/Supporters.html StreetLITES Africa, Our supporters], accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK and the [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic Church]] in Ghana.&lt;ref name="streetlites.org"&gt;[http://streetlites.org/Easter%202006.html StreetLITES Africa, Easter 2006 visit], accessed 25 January 2007 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122341/http://streetlites.org/Easter%202006.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the project is the [[Microsoft]] "Fresh start initiative" which provides the windows licences for the computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetlites.org/kit.html StreetLITES Africa, kit], accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The charity was started in 2004 after a visit to Ghana by a group, four of that group now form the trustees of the charity.
On their return they decided they could do something to help the needy in Ghana, they observed the abundance of computers and software discarded in the west, and the lack of this provision in Ghana. They contacted local companies and discovered that it was viable to ship computers to Ghana, as a charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetlites.org/Who.html StreetLITES Africa, Who.], accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early days many visits have been made to and from Ghana and the UK, the most significant as a charity occurred at Easter 2006, when a delegation visited the various agencies they had partnered with provided with computers.&lt;ref name="streetlites.org"/&gt;

== Future projects ==

The charity is currently working on a sponsorship project where members of the public may sponsor children associated with the agencies the charity is partnered with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetlites.org/Orphan%20Sponsorship.html StreetLITES Africa, Orphan Sponsorship], accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lottery''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] about the controversy surrounding [[State school|public]] and [[Charter school|charter schools in the United States]], directed by [[Madeleine Sackler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2153450/  
|title=Madeleine Sackler  
|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;

|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced by Blake Ashman-Kipervaser, James Lawler, and Madeleine Sackler. The cinematographer was Wolfgang Held (''[[Brüno]]'', ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]'', ''[[Children Underground]]'').

==Synopsis==
{{more plot|date=November 2015}}
The film follows four families from [[Harlem]] and [[Bronx|the Bronx]] in the months leading up to the [[Charter school (New York)#Admission lottery|lottery]] for one of the [[Success Academy Charter Schools]] (then known as Harlem Success Academy), one of the most successful charter schools in [[New York City]]. The film explores the debate surrounding the [[education reform]] movement. The film highlights the opposition from the teachers' unions to charter schools (as they are usually not unionized), and the contest between charter and public schools for building space.&lt;ref name="NYPost-20100428-star"/&gt;

==Participants==
* [[Geoffrey Canada]]: the President and CEO of [[Harlem Children's Zone]], which [[The New York Times Magazine]] called "one of the most ambitious social experiments of our time."
* [[Cory Booker]]: the mayor of [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He is a member of numerous boards and advisory committees that are committed to education.
* Candice Fryer: a teacher at Harlem Success Academy 2 (now known as Success Academy Harlem 2).
* [[Betsy Gotbaum]]: [[New York City Public Advocate]] from 2001 to 2009.

* Jim Manly: the Principal of Harlem Success Academy 2.
* [[Eva Moskowitz]]: the founder and CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools (then known as Success Charter Network), which runs the Success Academies Harlem.
* Jessica Reid: a teacher at Harlem Success Academy 2 (now known as Success Academy Harlem 2).
* [[Susan L. Taylor|Susan Taylor]]: editor in chief of ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence Magazine]]'' from 1981 to 2000. She founded the National CARES Mentoring Movement, whose goal is to recruit one million adult [[Mentorship|mentors]].

* [[Paul Tough]]: an editor at ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and the author of ''Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America''.

==Production==
Sackler, a 27-year-old graduate of [[Duke University]], said she was inspired to make the film by news footage of a charter-school lottery at the Harlem Armory in 2008. This is her first film project.&lt;ref name="NYPost-20100428-star"/&gt;

==Distribution==
It was shown at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2010, as part of the "Tribeca Talks" panel.&lt;ref name="NYPost-20100428-star"&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/charter_kids_star_R2cC5LBohezWjVJzYrIEYJ ''Charter Kids Star: True Story of Lottery Hits Tribeca Fest'', by Yoav Gonen (educ. rptr.)

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
Frank Scheck of the ''Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the film is "hardly objective in its stance", but said that it would be "of vital interest to anyone interested in the topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A0F820100611|title=Top marks to schools documentary "The Lottery"|last=Scheck|first=Frank|date=10 June 2010|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errol Louis in the ''New York Daily News'' compared it to ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', arguing that it "will create and energize charter supporters by the thousands."&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews-20100429-docu"/&gt;

The term '''Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings''' refers to rankings published jointly between 2004 and 2009 by ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' and [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] (QS). After QS and ''Times Higher Education'' had ended their collaboration, the methodology for these rankings continues to be used by its developer Quacquarelli Symonds. Since 2010 these rankings are known as the [[QS World University Rankings]] when ''Times Higher Education'' started publishing another ranking with methodology developed in partnership with [[Thomson Reuters]] in 2010, known as the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]].

==Criticism==

The old iterations of the rankings produced collaboratively by THE and QS Quacquarelli Symonds received a number of criticisms. Some critics expressed concern about the manner in which the peer review conducted by THE-QS was carried out.&lt;ref name="UniversityRankingWatch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes |first=Richard |url=http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2006/09/so-thats-how-they-did-it-for-some-time.html |title=So That's how They Did It |publisher=Rankingwatch.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report,&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080406192737/http://www.aus.ac.nz/branches/auckland/akld06/AUS-SP.pdf Response to Review of Strategic Plan by Peter Wills]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wills from the University of Auckland, New Zealand wrote of the ''Times Higher Education''-QS World University Rankings:

{{quote|But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.}}

Ian Diamond, former chief executive of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] and now vice-chancellor of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' in 2007, saying:&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=311132 |title=Social sciences lose 1 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as the natural sciences. Hence the low position of the [[London School of Economics]], caused primarily by its citations score, is a result not of the output of an outstanding institution but the database and the fact that the LSE does not have the counterweight of a large natural science base.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3075">'''Tuition insurance''' is an [[insurance]] protecting [[student]]s attending cost-intensive educational institutions - [[school]]s, [[college]]s or [[university|universities]] - from the financial loss that may result from the student’s involuntary withdrawal from his or her studies. It usually covers withdrawals due to medical reasons and the death of the student’s [[legal guardian|legal guardian(s)]]&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.boston.com/business/personalfinance/managingyourmoney/archives/2010/06/is_tuition_insu.html Is tuition insurance a good idea?]”.  Jill Boynton, The Boston Globe, June 16, 2010. Retrieved on June 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/insurance/tuition-insurance-101?page=2 Tuition Insurance 101]”. Dave Carpenter, Mainstreet (originally AP), August 29, 2009.

Tyler Hill, Smart Money, August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by either refunding or covering the costs associated with attending the student’s institution. Tuition insurance may also cover [[student loan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/pamela-yip/20100228-Tuition-refund-insurance-can-protect-college-7255.ece Tuition refund insurance can protect college investment]”. Pamela Yip, Dallas News, February 28, 2010. Retrieved on June 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuition insurance can be obtained through educational institutions or directly from an insurance provider.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, August 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be obtained as part of a student loan.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2011/07/11/sallie-mae-starts-insurance-business.html Sallie Mae To Offer Suite Of Insurance Products For Students]”. Jeff Clabaugh, The Washington Business Journal, July 11, 2011. Retrieved July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most tuition insurance policies cover the cost of [[tuition fees|tuition]] in whole or partly if a student has to withdraw from his or her studies due to medical reasons; however, this may be limited to the first weeks of the semester. If the withdrawal is due to mental health reasons the reimbursement rarely exceeds 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, August 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109632474431329384 The Latest Campus Accessory: Tuition Insurance.

Anne Marie Chaker, The Wall Street Journal, September 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuition insurance has existed since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Yip, February 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It benefits both students and educational institutions since it may cover the money a student owes an educational institution in case the tuition payer can no longer cover these costs.

'''Uddaka Rāmaputta''' was a meditator and a teacher of meditation. Uddaka Rāmaputta, as his name implied, was a son of Rāma. Uddaka, who was one of the teachers of [[Gautama Buddha]] is considered to be a Jain and taught refined states of meditation known as the immaterial attainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Armstrong |first= Karen |title= Buddha |year= 2004 |publisher= Penguin Books |location= New York, USA |isbn= 978-0143034360 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eliade |first= Mircea |title= Yoga: Immortality and Freedom |year= 2009 |publisher= Princeton University Press |location= New Jersey, USA |isbn= 978-0691142036 |page= 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumedho|first=Rewata Dhamma.

At this time Ālāra had nothing else to teach Gautama. But Gautama was eager to learn more, so he started to search for another teacher. He found Uddaka Rāmaputta and accepted him as teacher.

The '''University of Liège''' ('''ULiège'''), in [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Wallonia]], [[Belgium]], is a major [[public university]] in the [[French Community of Belgium]]. Its official language is [[French (language)|French]]. As of 2016, ULiège is ranked in the #251–300 category worldwide according to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/search|title=Search|author=|date=|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 265nd by ''[[QS World University Rankings]]'',&lt;ref name="topuniversities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2014|title=QS Top Universities Ranking 2014-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between the 205th and 300th place by the  ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]''.&lt;ref name="arwu2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119210953/http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html |archivedate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2000 people, academics, scientists and technicians, are involved in research of a wide variety of subjects from basic research to applied research.

==History==
The University was founded in 1817 by [[William I of the Netherlands]], then King of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and by his Minister of Education, [[Anton Reinhard Falck]]. The foundation of the university was the result of a long intellectual tradition which dates back to the origins of the [[Bishopric of Liège]]. Beginning in the eleventh century, the influence of the [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishops]] of [[Liège]] attracted students and prominent scientists and philosophers, such as [[Petrarch]], to study in its libraries. The reputation of its medieval schools gave the city the reputation as [[Athens#Cities nicknamed "Athens"|a new Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ulg.ac.be/cms/a_16257/en/history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006070628/https://www.ulg.ac.be/cms/a_16257/en/history |archive-date=2016-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 17 March 1808 decree by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] concerning the organization of an imperial university indicated Liège as the site of a new academy to be composed of a Faculty of Arts and a Faculty of Science—the first university charter for Liège. Ultimately, Liège owes its university to William I of the Netherlands, who remembered the city's prestigious legacy of teaching and culture when he decided to establish a new university on [[Wallonia|Walloon]] soil.

Nearly 200 years later, settled to some extent in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Sart-Tilman|fr}} district of Liège, the University of Liège depends on the French community of Belgium. The University is located at the edge of the [[Meuse River|River Meuse]], in the center of "the Island," the Latin Quarter of Liège. By 2009, the Agronomical University College of Gembloux (FUSAGx) is part of ULiège. It has adopted a new name for academics as well as research, namely 'Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech'.

The '''University of Zaragoza Library (BUZ)''' is the library system of the [[University of Zaragoza]]. They  are responsible for the management of information resources and the associated activities of learning, instruction, research, and continuing education. Their primary purpose is to work toward the growth, preservation, dissemination, and accessibility of information resources as a participant in the knowledge creation process.&lt;ref group=&gt;Definition found in [http://www.unizar.es/institucion/estatutos-de-la-universidad Estatutos de la Universidad de Zaragoza], 2004, art.1 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Their structure, function, values, and objectives are defined in their Policies&lt;ref group=&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091213032643/http://biblioteca.unizar.es/documentos/6_2_Reglamento_BUZ.pdf Reglamento de la Biblioteca de la Universidad de Zaragoza]&lt;/ref&gt; and Services Manual as well as in their Strategic Plan, the most recent being for 2013-2016.&lt;ref group=&gt;

The BUZ is composed of 19 central and campus libraries in addition to the administrative headquarters, and other additional libraries included through agreements with separate institutions.
 
==History==
While the official inauguration of the University of Zaragoza Library is marked by its formal opening to the public on November 17, 1796, the efforts behind its creation were a product of the enlightenment and the educational policy of [[Charles III of Spain|King Carlos III]], whose Royal Order of March 14, 1759 ordered the establishment of libraries at all universities in the kingdom.

Unfortunately, all initial development was terminated as a result of the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]]. On August 4, 1809, during the second [[Second Siege of Zaragoza|siege]] of the city by French troops, the building was destroyed.  Reconstruction begins after the war, but the requirement of substantial funding made this process a lengthy one. This began the development of the itinerant nature of the library, which has become part of its identity.  The library was without a permanent home for all of the 19th century and much of the 20th century.

The library officially reopened in 1849. Towards the end of the 19th century, the library divided into three sections: the Main/University Library, the Medicine and Science Library, and the Historical Archive. The collections were further subdivided in the beginnings of the 20th century.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], many traditional library functions were supplanted by the establishment of [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|pro-Franco ideology]] and cultural repression. Replacement activities included providing troops with books and other materials (Servicio de Lectura al Soldado) and organizing the Commission for the Purification of Libraries in the University of Zaragoza District to remove works banned by the Fascist state.  During Franco’s regime, the construction of the Ciudad Universitaria (University City) area required the gradual relocation of several departments. The Colleges of Letters and Philosophy, Sciences, Law, and Medicine, and their respective libraries were moved to the new campus. Most of the archives and historical materials were relocated to the Letters and Philosophy building, but part of the collection was still inside the  16th century Cerbuna Chapel when it collapsed on May 6, 1973; the collapse was attributed to structural deterioration and institutional neglect.

Following the approval of the Law of University Reform in 1984, the library began to reestablish itself after the approval of new democratic bylaws.  This marked the beginning of a period of change that included a significant increase of staff and the construction of new library buildings for the College of Economics and Business (1996) and the College of Letters and Philosophy/Arts and Letters (2003).  The BUZ began a progressive reorganization of its collections that moved away from its traditional fragmented nature, while maintaining the decentralization of individual colleges.  The process of catalog automation and the development of the digital library took place from 1995 to the beginning of the 21st century.

In 1984, the year of the university’s 400th anniversary, the Main Library was relocated to the newly restored and modified building designed by Ricardo Magdalena (an architect and designer native to Zaragoza) that had been built to house the Colleges of Medicine and Science.  In 2011, the Main Library, its associated services, and the European Documentation Center returned to the main hall. The old reading room now serves as an exhibition space for the BUZ collection. This move followed a full restoration of the space that began in 2006.

==Structure==
The BUZ is a single library system spread through many institutions and managed by the library commission.&lt;ref group=&gt;Any information about the individual branches of the BUZ can be found in the [http://biblioteca.unizar.es/bibliotecas.php/ Nuestras Bibliotecas] section of the website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holdings and Collections==

===Holdings of the University of Zaragoza Library===
The University of Zaragoza Library is home to the most important bibliographic holdings in all of Aragon.  It contains more than 1 million volumes in different formats and mediums, and provides access to over 20,000 online journals and databases corresponding to areas of study at the university; the online resources are accessible from 24 access points in academic buildings on campus.  Through Roble, the online catalog, users can discover what is available in the library and sign up to receive updates on newly acquired titles.  Since 2013, the search tool Alcorze has allowed users to search the library’s catalog, digital repository, and subscription databases simultaneously.

===Preservation===
As a part of its dedication to the preservation of knowledge, the University maintains collections containing materials of significant intrinsic or historical value. The majority of this collection is located in the Main library.  Because of their uniqueness, these materials are kept in a special collections unit with additional restrictions. Many of these materials are accessible through the University of Zaragoza Digital Archives.&lt;ref group=&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071130200355/http://biblioteca.unizar.es/fondoantiguo.php Biblioteca Digital de Fondo Antiguo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The highlights of the collection include 416 manuscripts dated from the 15th-19th century, 406 [[incunable]]s, and an important collection of printed works from the 16th-18th century. Additionally, there is a broad spectrum of publications from research-oriented and cultural institutions throughout Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;Moralejo Álvarez, 1998, pp.281—322&lt;/ref&gt;

The BIVIDA project (Digital Library of Aragonian Law) provides digitized copies of many of the works on Aragonian law held by the University of Zaragoza Library.

The '''Western Cape Education Department''' (abbreviated '''WCED''') is the [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of the Western Cape]] responsible for [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] [[education]] within the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. The political leader of the department is the [[Minister of Education (Western Cape)|Provincial Minister of Education]]; {{as of|2009|lc=on}} this is [[Donald Grant (politician)|Donald Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/news/2009/may/180702 |title=Appointment of the Western Cape Provincial Cabinet |date=8 May 2009 |work=Cape Gateway |publisher=Provincial Government of the Western Cape |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[apartheid]] era, education in South Africa was segregated according to race, with different government departments administering schools for the different races. What is now the Western Cape was at that time part of the [[Cape Province]], and schools for [[White South African|white]] students were run by the Education Department of the [[Cape Provincial Administration]]. Schools for [[coloured]] students were run by the [[House of Representatives (South Africa)|House of Representatives]] Education Department, while schools for [[black people|black]] students were run by the [[Bantu Education Department|Department of Education and Training]]. Some integration of these schools had occurred during the last years of apartheid, but the administrations remained divided.

On 27 April 1994, the date of the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]], the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa]] came into effect, abolishing the old provinces and establishing the [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]]. The new Western Cape Education Department inherited those schools of the previous departments that were located within the Western Cape.

==Structure==
The administrative head of the department, subordinate to the Minister, is the Superintendent-General of Education (also known as the Head of Education); {{as of|2009|11|lc=on}} this is Penny Vinjevold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wced.wcape.gov.za/head/sg.html |title=Office of the Superintendent-General of Education |publisher=Western Cape Education Department |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010/11 financial year the department had 40,181 employees and a budget of [[South African rand|R]]11,845,691,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/other/2010/3/vote_05a.pdf |chapter=Vote 5: Department of Education |title=Budget 2010: Estimates of Provincial Expenditure |isbn=978-0-621-39119-0 |publisher=Western Cape Provincial Treasury |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is responsible for all primary and secondary education in the province, including the provision of [[government school]]s, [[Further Education and Training]] colleges and [[Adult Basic Education]], and the oversight of [[independent school]]s.

[[File:Western Cape rural education districts.svg|thumb|Rural education districts of the Western Cape.]]
[[File:Western Cape urban education districts.svg|thumb|Urban education districts of Cape Town.]]
The Western Cape is divided into eight education districts; four are "rural" districts which correspond to one or more [[district municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]], while the other four are "urban" or "Metro" districts within the [[City of Cape Town]]. The districts are:
* Metro Central
* Metro East
* Metro North
* Metro South
* [[Cape Winelands District Municipality|Cape Winelands]]
* [[Eden District Municipality|Eden]] &amp; [[Central Karoo District Municipality|Central Karoo]]
* [[Overberg District Municipality|Overberg]]
* [[West Coast District Municipality|West Coast]]
The districts are responsible for the management of education, with policy and planning being handled by the head office. Each district is also divided into a number of "circuits", which provide advice, support, and specialised facilities to a smaller collection of schools.

The department also supervises the six [[Further Education]] and [[Training]] colleges in the province. These are:
* [[College of Cape Town]]
* [[False Bay College]]
* [[Northlink College]]
* [[West Coast College]]
* [[Boland College]]
* [[South Cape College]]

'''Working class education''' is the [[education]] of [[working-class]] people.

==History==
Prior to the 19th century, education for most members of society was [[elementary education|elementary]] and only an [[elite]] received advanced education.  This was intended to provide members of each social class with an education befitting their expected future status—toil or leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA221 |title=Encyclopedia of social history |author=Peter N. Stearns |chapter=Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of the [[working class]] have a different educational experience than children of the middle and upper [[Social class|classes]].  Because of this, working class children can start out life at a disadvantage.  Their educational experience may be hindered for several reasons, including influences from their parents, the schools they attend, and their expectations and attitudes, all of which are strongly affected by previous generations

==Schools==
The schools in the lower income districts are characterized by overcrowding and lack of resources.  This is because the funding of American [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] comes mostly from their district's [[property taxes]].&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; [[Residential segregation]] occurs when people segregate themselves based on [[Social class|class]] and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].  This leaves schools in the low income school districts with little because those who are capable of paying higher property taxes move to districts where there are higher taxes and schools are receiving more.&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; For example, in [[New York City]], where efforts are being made to level the playing field, students in the wealthiest school districts are given almost twice as much as students in the poorest district, an annual amount of $13,974 compared to $7,457.&lt;ref name="Shipler"/&gt; When schools lack funding, programs such as special education classes and [[extracurricular activities]] are cut back. This causes some working class children to not get the attention and help they require.  When schools and teachers are not receiving the goods required to fulfill their duty, students cannot be expected to display the motivation to learn in a flawed system.&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt;

==Parental influences==
The way parents act in the home and raise their children has a large effect on how children will interact in social institutions.  Many social scientists claim that [[middle class]] parents practice [[concerted cultivation]], meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults.  Due to the extent of their interactions outside of the home, the children of concerted cultivation develop a greater mastery of language and are instilled with a sense of entitlement, both of which allows them to become more comfortable when interacting with institutions.&lt;ref name="Lareau"&gt;Lareau, Annette. Unequal Childhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, many working class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt; These children are usually left to occupy themselves with activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or playing outside. Working-class parents put less emphasis on planned activities, than their middle class counterparts, because they are less likely to have the funds to pay for them.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;Doob, Christopher Bates. "Working-Class Development." Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2013. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem that comes with these differences in [[parenting practices]] is that schools, along with other institutions, are more harmonious with concerted cultivation, the parenting practice of the [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="Lareau"/&gt; Teachers want parents and children to engage and be proactive, but parents and children of the working class feel a sense of constraint that leaves them confused on how to "[[work the system]]" and often causes them to become hostile towards schooling.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;Russo, John and Sherry Linkon. New Working-Class Studies. Ithaca: ILR Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because working class parents are often uncomfortable around authority figures, they are less likely to communicate with their child's teacher or become involved in the school.  As a result of this, low income school districts have lower involvement in parent teacher conferences.&lt;ref name="Shipler"&gt;Shipler, David. The Working Poor. New York: Knopf, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This could also be attributed to the fact that working class parents often have to hold down more than one job and do not have very much time to help their children with homework or attend school functions. As a consequence, working-class children mature in narrow social settings, receive fewer resources, and feel less entitlement.&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;

==Attitudes==
The children of the working class approach school with a different attitude than those of higher class.  This is because their [[non-possession#Sense of Entitlement|sense of entitlement]] is lower than that of their middle class counterparts. Working-class students sometimes feel unentitled or that they do not belong in affluent high schools or colleges.&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;  Instead of viewing [[education]] as a way up in the world, the working class views it as valuable but not as a reality for them.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, Ruby. Framework for Understanding Poverty. Highlands, TX: Aha Process Inc, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; For working class parents, they are more consumed with the tasks of simply getting by and providing for their children than they are with good grades and higher education.  Parents pass this survival mentality onto their children and cause a cycle where working class children do not have the same aspirations instilled in them that the middle class does.  Only 54% of students whose parents only received their high school diploma go on to pursue their [[bachelor's degree]].  This statistic is compared to the 82% of students whose parents received their bachelor's degree that go on to college.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt; First generation students who do on go to college experience a culture shock once they get there because they are not as comfortable and sure of themselves as those that have come from a family that has received [[higher education]]. A 2012 review&lt;ref&gt;Rubin,M. (2012). [https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research.] Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, 5, 22-38. doi: 10.1037/a0026162&lt;/ref&gt; of the literature has shown that working-class students have a greater risk of being excluded from social life at universities, including formal activities such as campus-based clubs, societies, and organizations and informal activities such as parties and nonclassroom conversations. This is an important problem because social integration predicts student retention, and working class students are twice as likely as middle class students to drop out before their second year of college because they lack the persistence they need to face challenges and succeed in college.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt;

The attitude of children born into the working class strongly reflects the way their parents raise them. The outlook and importance of education is not the same as families with wealth. [[Inheritance]] plays a strong role in the way parents and children view and value education.

==Solving the problem==
There are some ways that this may be changed.  In order to break this cycle, working class students might be taught the values of the middle class or the schooling system develop programs that help those students that are not receiving the support and guidance they need from home.  The middle class values are the same values that are felt by the authority figures at school; therefore, through teaching working class students to value education and be more involved they will be able to navigate [[social institutions]] with greater purpose and poise.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The problem could be that working class parents did not have these values instilled in them; therefore, they are less likely to pass these values on to their children.  Schools have been left with the responsibility of being the only places for some children to learn the rules and values that are present in most institutions.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

Solving the problem of racism within these institutions, causing perpetual problems and nearly impossible change, would take large steps towards rectifying problems within the education system. As long as [[institutionalized racism]] exists, problems within the educational system will continue to exist.

Due to the lack of resources in needy schools, educational facilities are forced to develop support systems that do not have any additional costs.  Programs that have been introduced into lower income schools include the following:&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

* A specified amount of time set aside everyday for homework can help the child better understand.  Often working class parents have neither the time nor the knowledge to help their children with their homework.  By providing time for homework during the school day, students who are not receiving the help they need at home are able to receive supplemental instruction.
* Keeping the same teachers for a few years or having separate schools within schools can strengthen relationships.  This program allows children and parents to become more familiar with teachers and to form stronger bonds.  By strengthening the student and teacher relationship, students are able to receive more guidance from their teachers and grow more comfortable, which may be a lacking opportunity in the home.
* The setting of daily goals can help children learn how to face challenges and deadlines.  By setting the goals in writing at the beginning of every day or week, children learn how to manage and prioritize tasks in order to feel a sense of achievement when the goals are met.
