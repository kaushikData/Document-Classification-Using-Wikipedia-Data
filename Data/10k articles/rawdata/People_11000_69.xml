'''Lorena Marquez''' is one of several fictional characters to use the codename [[Aquagirl]]. She is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Lorena debuted in ''[[Aquaman]]'' vol. 6 #16 (May 2004), and was created by [[Will Pfeifer]] and [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Lorena Marquez''' is on a date at the [[San Diego Zoo]] when an earthquake shakes [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands—including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as "[[Sub Diego]]." When [[Ocean Master]] switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume. After Aquaman exposes Ocean Master's scheme, Lorena keeps her Aquagirl costume and identity, and the two carry on protecting Sub Diego.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 6 #16 (May 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; When a string of homicides begin to emerge in Sub Diego, Lorena was one of the first to discover that it was former police officer Chandra Abbot who was guilty. The two fight and Chandra admits she did not understand why Aquaman would allow Lorena to help him but she at that moment she understood, she is a good detective.

==="One Year Later"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In ''Teen Titans'' Volume 3 #34 (May 2006), Lorena is shown at [[Titans Tower]] arguing with [[Holly Granger]] during a flashback. Lorena is also a member of the Teen Titans during the events of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. She assists [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] in launching an attack on [[LexCorp]] when [[Natasha Irons]] is captured by [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #17–19 (December 2004&amp;nbsp;– February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; She later resurfaces as supporting character of the new Aquaman, [[Aquaman (Arthur Joseph Curry)|Arthur Joseph Curry]], in ''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis''. Apparently, as one of the last Sub Diegoans able to breathe water, she is left in the seas, mourning Koryak's death in the rubble of Poseidonis. She then joins Curry, [[Cal Durham]], Tempest, and the new [[Topo (DC Comics)|Topo]] in their voyage to Sub Diego. Aquagirl appears up in ''[[Terror Titans]]'' #1 and is kidnapped (along with a group of other teen superheroes) by the Terror Titans. While her teammate [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]] is slain by the new [[Persuader (comics)#Elise Kimble|Persuader]], Lorena is taken alive, to be [[mindwiped]] and forced to fight in the [[Dark Side Club]] at the behest of the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] Gods on Earth. She is defeated twice, once by [[Rose Wilson]] after being stabbed, and again by a brainwashed [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], who crushes Lorena with a pair of boulders. Aquagirl and the others are eventually freed by [[Miss Martian]], and Lorena joins the survivors in a trek to Titans Tower in order to recover.

===Rejoining the Titans===
While resting in the tower, Lorena meets and befriends [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], telling him that she enjoyed her past experience as a member of the Teen Titans. After realizing that she has nowhere to go and no family, Lorena accepts [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]]'s offer to rejoin the team, taking up permanent residence in Titans Tower.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #69 (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining close friends with Static, Lorena also begins flirting in Spanish with her teammate [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]], despite him already dating teen superheroine and Titan reserve member, [[Traci 13]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #72–74 (August–October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; She also quickly gains an enemy in [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], finding her to be rude. Despite her apparent concern for both Static and Blue Beetle, Aquagirl begins flirting with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] after she witnesses a fight between him and Wonder Girl.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol.3 #83 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

During a mission to rescue [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] from an extradimensional being called Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are swallowed by massive sea monster mutated from Wyld's energy.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #85&lt;/ref&gt; After Static destroys Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are left missing at sea with their fates uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #87&lt;/ref&gt; In the following issue, it is mentioned that both Bombshell and Aquagirl had been rescued by their teammates, but were removed from the Titans due to Wonder Girl no longer wishing to endanger "inexperienced" teen heroes by allowing them membership.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #88&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brightest Day''===
In the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover, Lorena is approached by [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] who had come searching for help against her sister and her Death Squad.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; She and Mera subsequently reappear when Siren and her army attack [[Miami, Florida]] as the opening salvo of an invasion. During the battle, Lorena rescues the new [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] by kicking [[Black Manta]] in the face just as he is about to stab the youth to death. After Mera and Aqualad successfully trap the invaders inside the [[Bermuda Triangle]], Lorena tells Aqualad not to "get any ideas" as the two teens watch Aquaman and Mera passionately kiss.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #20 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bengali Hindus''' ({{lang-bn|বাঙালি হিন্দু}}) are an ethnic, linguistic, and religious population who make up the majority in the [[Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]]. In [[Bangladesh]] they form the largest minority. They are [[Bengalis]] adherents of [[Hinduism]], and are native to the [[Bengal]] region of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Bengali Hindus speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which belongs to the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] language family and adhere to the [[Shakta]] and [[Vaishnava]] traditions of their native religion, Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Hinduism?", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Home and the World", by Rabindranath Tagore, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant numbers of [[States of India by Bengali speakers|Bengali-speaking Hindus in different Indian states]].&lt;ref name="BPSR_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestatesman.com/news/opinion/bengal-s-topsy-turvy-population-growth/93152.html |title=Bengal's topsy-turvy population growth |author=B.P.

Around the 8th century, the Bengali language branched off from [[Magadhi Prakrit]], a derivative of [[Sanskrit]] that was prevalent in the eastern region of the Indian Subcontinent at that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis", p. 351, by Kunal Chakrabarti, Shubhra Chakrabarti&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sena dynasty|Sena]] period (11th – 12th century) the Bengali culture developed into a distinct culture within the [[Hindu]] civilisation. Bengali Hindus were at the forefront of the [[Bengal Renaissance]] in the 19th century. The Bengal region was noted for its participation in struggle for the independence from the [[British Raj|British rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim freedom martyrs of India|url=http://twocircles.net/2009oct01/muslim_freedom_martyrs_india.html|publisher=Two Circles|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of Muslims in the Freedom Movement-II|url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/268/7501/the-arab-autumn/2011-08-21/independence-day/story-detail/role-of-muslims-in-thefreedom-movement-ii.html|work=Radiance Weekly|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of independence of India in 1947, the province of Bengal was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned]] between [[India]] and [[East Pakistan]], part of the Muslim-majority state of [[Pakistan]].

The Hindus are a religious group,&lt;ref name="tagore1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabindra-rachanabali.nltr.org/node/14858 |title=Atmaparichay |last=Tagore |first=Rabindranath |publisher=Society for Natural Language Technology Research |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indopedia.org/index.php?title=Hindu_%28ethnicity%29 |title=Hindu (ethnicity) |publisher=Indopedia |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hindu+%28ethnic+group%29 |title= |work=The Hindu |publisher=Fairlex |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; native to the [[Indian subcontinent]], speaking a broad range of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages]] and adhering to the native belief systems, rooted in the [[Veda]]s. The word Hindu is popularly believed to be a [[Persian language|Persian]] [[exonym]] for the people native to the Indian subcontinent. The word is derived from [[Sindhu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world (Volume I) |last=Garg |first=Ganga Ram |year=1992 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=81-7022-374-1 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sanskrit]] name for the river [[Indus]] and it initially referred to the people residing to the east of the river. The Hindus are constituted into various [[ethno-linguistic]] subgroups, which in spite of being culturally diverse, share a common bond of unity.

The word Bengali is derived from the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word ''bangali''. The English word Bengali denoting the people as well as the language is derived from the English word [[Bengal]] denoting the region, which itself is derived ultimately from the Bengali word [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] which was one of the five historical kingdoms of Eastern India. According to [[Harivamsa]], [[Mahabali|Bali]], the king of the [[asura]]s had five sons from his wife Sudeshna through sage Dirghatama. The five sons namely [[Anga]], Vanga, [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Pundra]] and [[Suhma Kingdom|Sumha]] went on to found five kingdoms of the same name in the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. In ancient times Vanga proper consisted of the deltaic region between [[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi]], [[Padma River|Padma]] and [[Madhumati River|Madhumati]], but later on extended to include the regions which now roughly comprise the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]].

In [[India]], they tend to identify themselves as [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Apu's World |author=Sandipan Deb |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?224925 |newspaper=Outlook |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Bangladesh they tend to identify themselves as [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ইছামতীর মশা (Ichhamatir Masha) |last=Ghosh |first=Shankha |year=2002 |publisher=Swarnakshar Prakashani |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the global context, the terms Indian Bengali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmhc.ca/en/inpr/graw/upload/Sutama_Eng.pdf |title="We Are Not All the Same":The Differential Migration, Settlement Patterns and Housing Trajectories of Indian Bengalis and Bangladeshis in Toronto |first=Sutama |last=Ghosh |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |year=2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bangladeshi Hindu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banglastories.org/about-the-project/the-interviews/bengali-hindu-migrant-ashim-sen---bradford.html |title=Bengali Hindu Migrant: Ashim Sen – Bradford

== Ethnology ==
The Bengali Hindus constitute of numerous [[endogamy|endogamous]] [[caste]]s, which are sometimes further subdivided into endogamous subgroups. The [[Caste system in India|caste system]] evolved over centuries and became more and more complex with time. In the medieval period, several castes were [[boycott]]ed by the ruling classes from time to time and this isolation continued till the 19th century. These social boycotts were somewhat discriminatory in nature. After the [[Bengal Renaissance|Renaissance]], the rigidity of the caste system ceased to a great extent, so much so that the first celebrated intercaste marriage took place as early as in 1925.

The Bengali Hindu families are [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] as well as [[patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] and traditionally follow a joint family system. However, due to the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition]] and subsequent urbanisation, the [[Hindu joint family|joint families]] have given way to the [[nuclear family|nuclear families]]. The Bengali Hindus were traditionally governed by the [[Dāyabhāga]] school of law, as opposed to the [[Mitākṣarā]] school of law, which governed the other Hindu ethno-linguistic groups. In [[India]], after the promulgation of the [[Hindu code bills]], the Bengali Hindus along with other Hindus are being governed by a uniform [[Modern Hindu law|Hindu law]].

There are two major social subgroups among the Bengali Hindus – the [[ghotis]] and the [[bangal]]s. The Bengali Hindus who emigrated from East Bengal (Bangladesh) at the wake of the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition]] and settled in West Bengal, came to known as the bangals, while the native Bengali Hindus of West Bengal came to known as ghotis. For several decades after partition, these two social subgroups possessed marked difference in their accents and their rivalry was manifested in many spheres of life, most notably in the support for the football clubs of [[Kingfisher East Bengal FC|East Bengal]] and [[Mohun Bagan AC|Mohun Bagan]] respectively. Several such differences have eased with passing years.

=== Ancient period ===
[[File:Ganesh (musée d'art asiatique de Berlin).jpg|thumb|Dancing [[Ganesha]] sculpture from [[North Bengal]], 11th century CE, [[Museum of Asian Art|Asian Art Museum]] of Berlin ([[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]]).]]
In the ancient times, some of the Bengali Hindus were [[seafaring]] people as evident from Vijay Singha's naval conquest of [[Lanka]],&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Dinesh Chandra (1999). ''Brihatbanga Volume I''. [[Deys Publishing]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bangali Charitabhidhan Volume I''. Sansad, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; the tales of merchants like [[Chand Sadagar]] and Dhanapati Saudagor whose ships sailed to far off places for trade and establishment of colonies in [[South East Asia]]. By the 3rd century B.C.E. they were united into a powerful state, known to the [[Ancient Greek|Greeks]] as [[Gangaridai]], whose military prowess demoralised [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] from further expedition to the east.&lt;ref&gt;"When he (Alexander) moved forward with his forces certain men came to inform him that Porus, the king of the country, who was the nephew of that Porus whom he had defeated, had left his kingdom and fled to the nation of '''Gandaridai'''... He had obtained from Phegeus a description of the country beyond the Indus: First came a desert which it would take twelve days to traverse; beyond this was the river called the Ganges which had a width of thirty two stadia, and a greater depth than any other Indian river; beyond this again were situated the dominions of the nation of the Prasioi and the Gandaridai, whose king, Xandrammes, had an army of 20,000 horse 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war".... "Now this (Ganges) river, which is 30 stadia broad, flows from north to south, and empties its water into the ocean forming the eastern boundary of the '''Gandaridai''', a nation which possesses the greatest number of elephants and the largest in size." –Diodorus Siculus (c.90 BC – c.30 BC). Quoted from The Classical Accounts of India, Dr [[R.C. Majumdar]], p. 170-72/234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gangaridai#During Alexander's invasion]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the region of Bengal came under [[Maurya]], [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] rule. In the 7th century, [[Shashanka]] became the independent Hindu ruler of [[Gauḍa region|Gauda]]. He successfully fought against his adversaries [[Harshavardhana]] and [[Bhaskaravarman]]a and protected the [[sovereignty]] of the people.

=== Medieval period ===
[[File:Chaitanya-Mahabrabhu-at-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], the founder of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]]]]
In the middle of the 8th century, the Bengali Hindu nobility democratically elected [[Gopala]] as the ruler of [[Gauḍa region|Gauda]], ushering in an era of peace and prosperity in [[Bengal]], ending almost a century of chaos and confusion. The Buddhist [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rulers unified Bengal into a single political entity and expanded it into an empire, conquering a major portion of [[North India]]. During this time, the Bengali Hindus excelled in art, literature, philosophy, mathematics, sciences and statecraft. The first scriptures in Bengali ''Charyapada'' was composed during the Pala rule. The Pala were followed by the Senas who made far reaching changes in the social structure of Bengali Hindus, introducing 36 new [[Caste system in India|castes]] and orthodox institutions like kulinism.

The literary progress of the Pala and Sena period came to a halt after the Turkish conquest in the early 13th century. Except for Haridas Datta's ''Manasar Bhasan'' no significant literary work was composed for about a century after the conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jagadish Narayan |last=Sarkar |url= |title=Banglay Hindu-Musalman Samparka (Madhyayuga) |publisher=Bangiya Sahitya Parishad |year=1981 |page=53 |location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the ruling classes resisted the invaders, Gauda, the centre of Bengal polity, fell to the Islamic invaders. During this period hundreds of temples and monasteries were desecrated. The next attack on the society came from the Islamic [[missionary|missionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;"When the Islamic missionaries arrived they found in several instances that the conquering armies had destroyed both the temples of revived Hinduism and the monasteries of the older Buddhism; in their place—often on the same sites—they built new shrines. Moreover, they very frequently transferred ancient Hindu and Buddhist stories of mir. Quoted in [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part1_09.html ''The Interaction of Islam and Hinduism'']. Retrieved 9 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Local chieftains like [[Akananda and Bakananda|Akananda]], Dakshin Ray and Mukut Ray, resisted the missionary activities.

The [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] occupation of Bengal was limited to the region of Gauda, the rest of which was held in sway by different Bengali Hindu rulers. Islam religion gradually spread throughout the Bengal region, and many Bengali Hindus were forcefully converted to Islam. In the early 15th century, the Pathan rule of Gauda was overthrown by the Bengali Hindu nobility under the leadership of [[Raja Ganesha|Ganesha]]. When the Delhi-based [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] tried to bring Bengal under their direct rule, the Bengali Hindu chiefs along with some Bengali Muslims consolidated themselves into confederacies and resisted the Mughals. After the fall of the confederacies, the Mughals brought a major part of Bengal under their control, and constituted a ''subah''.

=== Early modern period ===
During the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Nawabs of Bengal]] (who were Muslim) ruled a large part of Bengal. During the reign of [[Alivardi Khan]]. a Nawab, the severe taxation and frequent raids made the life miserable for the ordinary Bengali people.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, B.B. (2008). ''Peasant history of late pre-colonial and colonial India''. Pearson Education India, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A section of the Bengali Hindu nobility helped the [[British East India Company]] in overthrowing the Nawab [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] regime. After obtaining the revenue rights, the [[East India Company]] imposed more oppressive taxation that led to the famine of 1770, in which approximately one third of the Bengali &lt;!--A third of Bengali population or a third of Bengali Hindu? --&gt;population died of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kumar |editor1-first=Dharma |editor2-last=Desai |editor2-first=Meghnad |year=1983 |title=The Cambridge Economic History of India |volume=Volume 2: c. 1757—c. 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=299 |isbn=978-0-521-22802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[East India Company|British]] began to face stiff resistance in conquering the semi-independent Bengali Hindu kingdoms outside the pale of Muslim occupied Bengal. In some cases, even when their rulers have been captured or killed, the ordinary people began to carry on the fight.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} These resistances took the form of ''Bhumij'' (Chuar is a deragatory term used by the English to denote the Bhumij) and [[Paik Rebellion]]. These warring people were later listed as [[Denotified tribes of India|criminal tribes]]{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and barred from recruitment in the Indian army. In 1766, the British troops were completely routed by the ''sanyasi''s and ''fakir''s or the warrior monks at [[Dinhata]], where the latter resorted [[guerilla warfare]]. [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra]]'s ''[[Anandamath]]'' is based on the [[Bengal famine of 1770|Famine]] and consequential [[Sannyasi Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bangali Charitabhidhan Volume I''. Sansad, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British rule, Renaissance, struggle for Independence ===
According to author James Jeremiah Novak, as British rulers took power from Bengal's ruling Muslim class, they strategically catered to Bengali Hindus (a majority in Bengal region at that time).&lt;ref name="Novak1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=James Jeremiah|title=Bangladesh: Reflections on the Water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmIEqWSjZ7gC&amp;pg=PA140|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34121-1|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British rule destroyed the bases of Bengali Muslim society.&lt;ref name="Novak1993"/&gt; Bengali Hindus got favours from the British rulers, and experienced development in education and social mobility. In the 19th century, the elite class of Bengali Hindu people underwent radical [[social reform]]s and rapid modernisation; the phenomenon came to be known as the [[Bengal Renaissance]].
[[File:Swami vivekanand old archive.jpg|right|thumb|[[Swami Vivekananda]] was a leading figure of the Renaissance who [[Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893)|promoted India and Hinduism to the world]]]]
Public media like [[News media|press]] and [[Bengali theatre|theatres]] became vents of nationalist sentiments, apolitical organisations had given way to political platforms, secret revolutionary societies emerged and the society at large became restive.

With rising nationalism among Bengali Hindus, the British rulers applied [[Divide and rule#Indian subcontinent|divide and rule]] policy, and started to make favours to Bengali Muslims.&lt;ref name="Novak1993"/&gt; To keep the rising Bengali Hindu aspirations at bay, the [[British Raj|British]] partitioned the province in 1905 and along with some additional restructuring came up with two provinces – Eastern Bengal &amp; Assam and Bengal itself, in each of which the Bengali Hindus were reduced to minorities. The Bengali Hindus, however, opposed to the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition]] tooth and nail, embarked on a political movement of [[Swadeshi]], boycott and revolutionary nationalism. On 28 September 1905, the day of [[Mahalaya]], 50,000 Bengali Hindus resolved before the [[Kali|Mother]] at [[Kalighat]] to boycott foreign goods and stop employing foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Das, S.N.(ed). ''The Bengalis: The People, their History and Culture''. Genesis Publishing, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Sanderson. ''Ethics of Civilization Volume 20: South Asia 1800–1950''. World Peace Communications&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Raj]] finally annulled the Partition in 1911. The Raj, however, carried out some restructuring, and carved out Bengali Hindu majority districts like [[Manbhum]], Singbhum, Santal Pargana and [[Purnia]] awarding them to [[Bihar]] and others like [[Cachar]] that were awarded to [[Assam]], which effectively made the Bengali Hindus a minority in the united province of Bengal. The Britishers also transferred the capital from [[Calcutta]] to New Delhi.

The revolutionary movement gained momentum after the Partition. Bengali revolutionaries [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|collaborated with the Germans]] during the [[World War I|War]] to liberate [[British India]]. Later the revolutionaries defeated the British army in the Battle of Jalalabad and liberated [[Chittagong]]. During the [[Quit India Movement]], the revolutionaries liberated the [[Tamluk]] and [[Contai]] subdivision of [[Midnapore]] district from [[British India|British rule]] and established the Tamralipta National Government.

[[File:Communal Award in Bengal 1932.png|thumb|300px|left|Bengali Hindus who constituted 44% of the province, were awarded less than a third of the representation in the legislature.]]
The British, unable to control the revolutionary activities, decided to hinder the Bengali Hindu people through administrative reforms. The [[Government of India Act 1919]] introduced in the 144 member Bengal Legislative Assembly, 46 seats for the Muslims, 59 for the institutions, Europeans &amp; others and left the rest 39 as General,&lt;ref group="N"&gt;There were no separate electorates for Hindus, in spite of them being minorities in the province.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Bengali Hindus were to scramble for a representation. The situation worsened with the [[Communal Award]] of 1932, where in the 250 member Bengal Legislative Assembly a disproportionate 119 seats were reserved for the Muslims, 17 for Europeans, [[Anglo-Indian]]s &amp; [[Indian Christian]]s, 34 for the institutions, and the rest 80 were left as General.&lt;ref name="goiact1935"&gt;''Government of India Act, 1935'', 26 GEO. 5. CH. 2., Fifth Schedule, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The Communal Award further divided the Hindus into Scheduled Caste Hindus and Caste Hindus.&lt;ref name="goiact1935"/&gt; Out of the 80 General seats, 10 were reserved for the [[Scheduled Caste]]s.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The Caste Hindus were supposed to contest in the 70 General seats. However as per the [[Poona Pact]] between [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]], 20 General seats were reserved for Scheduled Castes.&lt;/ref&gt; In response the leading Bengali Hindu [[landholder]]s, lawyers and professionals signed the Bengal Hindu Manifesto on 23 April 1932 rejecting the justification of reservation of separate electorates for Muslims in the Bengal Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, N.N.(ed), ''Indian Annual Register'', Volume I, Jan–Jun 1932, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] supporters started a series of violent attacks against Hindus in [[Kolkata]] in the name of [[Direct Action Day]], which escalated into the bloodiest communal riots between Hindus and Muslims of modern India. After the initial attacks, rapes and killings by Muslims, Bengali Hindus joined hands with Sikhs and non-Bengali Hindus in attacking Muslims and ultimately it turned out to be a violent [[reprisal]] that resulted in heavy casualties of Muslims, finally forcing the government to stop the mayhem. Later in the year, the Muslim League government orchestrated the infamous [[Noakhali genocide]].&lt;ref name="sd218"&gt;{{cite book |title=1946: The Great Calcutta Killings and Noakhali Genocide |last1=Sinha |first1=Dinesh Chandra |last2=Dasgupta |first2=Ashok |year=2011 |publisher=Himangshu Maity |location=Kolkata |pages=218 |isbn=978-81-922464-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Direct Action Day and the Noakhali genocide prompted the Bengali Hindu leadership to move for the creation of a Bengali Hindu majority province by partitioning Bengal. At that time, the movement for creation of [[Pakistan]] was in full swing and Bengal was supposed to form one of its constituent provinces. After the failure of [[United Bengal]] plan when it became evident that all of Bengal would go to Pakistan, the Bengali Hindus voted for the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Bashabi and Sengupta, Sheila (ed). ''Bengal Partition Stories: An Unclosed Chapter''. Anthem Press, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 1947, the [[Amrita Bazar Patrika]] published the results of an opinion poll, in which 98.3% of the Bengali Hindus favoured the creation of a separate homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Haimanti (2009). ''A Partition of Contingency? Public Discourse in Bengal, 1946–47''. Cambridge University Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Tathagata. ''My People, Uprooted''. Ratna Prakashan, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for the Partition of Bengal was moved in the Legislative Assembly on 20 June 1947, where the Hindu members voted 58–21 in favour of the Partition with two members abstaining.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Rup Narayan Roy and [[Jyoti Basu]], the two Communist Party MLAs abstained.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boundary Commission awarded the Bengali Hindus a territory far less in proportion to their population which was around 46% of the population of the province, awarding the Bengali Hindu majority district of Khulna to Pakistan. However, some Bengali Muslim majority districts such as [[Murshidabad]] and [[Malda district|Malda]] were handed to India.

=== Post-partition period ===
After the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition]], the majority of the urban upper class and middle class Bengali Hindu population of East Bengal immigrated to West Bengal. The ones who stayed back were the ones who had significant landed property and believed that they will be able to live peacefully in an Islamic state. However, after the [[1950 East Pakistan genocide|genocide of 1950]], Bengali Hindus fled East Bengal in thousands and settled in West Bengal. In 1964, tens of thousands of [[1964 East-Pakistan riots|Bengali Hindus were massacred]] in East Pakistan and most of the Bengali Hindu owned businesses and properties of [[Dhaka]] were permanently destroyed&lt;ref name="sgd131-134"&gt;{{cite book |title=Empire's Last Casualty: Indian Subcontinent's vanishing Hindu and other Minorities |last=Ghosh Dastidar |first=Sachi |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Firma KLM |location=Kolkata |isbn=81-7102-151-4 |pages=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war of Bangladesh]], an estimated 2.4&amp;nbsp;million Bengali Hindus were massacred in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="gumaste"/&gt; The Enemy Property Act of the Pakistan regime which is still in force in the new incarnation of [[Vested Property Act]], has been used by successive Bangladeshi governments to seize the properties of the Hindu minorities who left the country during the [[Partition of India]] and [[Bangladesh liberation war]]. According to Professor Abul Barkat of [[Dhaka University]], the Act has been used to misappropriate {{convert|2100000|acre|km2}} of land from the Bengali Hindus, roughly equivalent to the 45% of the total landed area owned by them.&lt;ref name="barkat73-74"&gt;{{cite book |title=Deprivation of Hindu Minority in Bangladesh: Living With Vested Property |last1=Barkat |first1=Abul |last2=Zaman |first2=Shafique uz |last3=Khan |first3=Md.

The [[refugee]] rehabilitation became an acute crisis and hundreds of refugees were rehabilitated in the inhabitable terrains of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andamans]]. Apart from that thousands of Bengali Hindus had also immigrated to Assam, Tripura and other regions of the [[Northeast India|North East]]. In the [[Barak Valley]] region of Assam, where the Bengali Hindus were in a majority because of the inclusion of Sylhet into Pakistan, and subsequent immigration of Bengali Hindus from [[Sylhet]] into [[Cachar]], an impasse was arrived at on the question of language. The government of Assam had unilaterally imposed [[Assamese language|Assamese]] as the sole medium of education. In response, the Bengali Hindus began peaceful demonstrations demanding Bengali as the optional medium of primary education in the Barak Valley region. The situation took an ugly turn on 19 May 1961, when eleven Bengali Hindu protesters including a minor girl were gunned down by the police at the [[Silchar]] railway station.&lt;ref name="silchar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-09/guwahati/28188207_1_railway-ministry-station-meter-gauge-line |title=Silchar rly station to be renamed soon |work=The Times of India |location=Silchar |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=M. |last=Ganguly |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090520/jsp/jharkhand/story_10993189.jsp |title=All for love of language |work=The Telegraph |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010 |location=Ranchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Sanjib. "India against itself: Assam and the Politics of Nationality". University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Assam]] government allowed Bengali as the medium of education in Barak Valley.&lt;ref name="silchar"/&gt; However, the rise of ethnic militancy in the eighties and nineties once again made the Bengali Hindus vulnerable in the North East. The [[United Liberation Front of Asom]], [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]], [[Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam]] and [[National Liberation Front of Tripura]] [[militant]]s have selectively targeted the Bengali Hindu people, prompting the latter to form the Bengali Tiger Force.&lt;ref name="ie1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/Storyold/47285/ |title=Now Bengali militants raise heads in Assam |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=18 August 1998 |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination against Bengali Hindu population is not limited to the [[Northeast India|North East]]. In [[Jharkhand]], the Bengali Hindu demand of making Bengali the second official language has not been met, in spite of the fact that the Bengali Hindu population forms the second largest linguistic group in the state. They constitute almost 40 percent of the population in Jharkhand.Most of the Bengalis of Jharkhand are the Bhumiputras or the original settlers in the region.In [[Bihar]], many Bengali Hindu refugees are denied land owning rights and caste certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Madhuri |last=Kumar |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-26/patna/28219961_1_bengalis-bangla-language-caste-certificates |title=JD(U) Bangla bait for Bengalis in Bihar |work=The Times of India |location=Patna |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focusorissa.org.in/people.aspx |title=The Other Side of Kindness |publisher=Focus Orissa |first=Sudarshan |last=Chhotoray |accessdate=1 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220180037/http://www.focusorissa.org.in/people.aspx |archivedate=20 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Indians-Bangladeshis-in-same-Orissa-family/416529/ |title=Indians, Bangladeshis in same Orissa family! |work=The Indian Express |location=Kendrapara |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113210306/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Indians-Bangladeshis-in-same-Orissa-family/416529/ |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, massive infiltration from Bangladesh has substantially altered the demography in West Bengal so much so that Bengal Hindus have been reduced to minorities in the border regions and occasionally, there have been violent clashes between [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] mobs in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bhavna |last=Vij-Aurora |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080213/jsp/frontpage/story_8896931.jsp |title=Demography survey on eastern border  |work=The Telegraph |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2010 |location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Bengali Hindus constitute a minority [[ethnic group]] of the total population in both [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]],&lt;ref name="togawa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Togawa |first1=Masahiko |year=2008 |title=Hindu Minority in Bangladesh – Migration, Marginalization and Minority Politics in Postcolonial South Asia |journal=Discussion Paper Series |volume=6 |pages=2 |publisher=Hiroshima University |url=http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/hipec/HipecHPmoto/ja/products/DP6%20small.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722071535/http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/hipec/HipecHPmoto/ja/products/DP6%20small.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming less than 10% of the population in both countries. From the sixties onward, like many other ethnic groups of India, many Bengali Hindus began to emigrate outside India, mostly to pursue higher studies or in search of lucrative careers. This gave rise to a sizeable [[expatriate]] Bengali Hindu population in many parts of the world.

Bengali Hindus form a majority in [[West Bengal]], with a population of 64,385,546 (70.54%), while in [[Bangladesh]], Bengali Hindus are the second largest community with a population of 14,112,218 (8.03%).

Before India [[Indian independence movement|became independent]], the city of [[Dhaka]] (present capital of [[Bangladesh]]) had a significant number of Bengali Hindus, but their numbers have since considerably dwindled, being outnumbered by [[Bengali Muslims]]. Bengali Hindus are at present the second largest community after Muslims in [[Dhaka]] at 1,476,184 (7%).

===Indian States other than West Bengal===
Bengali Hindus are the second largest community in [[Assam]] with a population of 3 million (9.12%). They are concentrated in the [[Barak Valley]] region.As per 2011 census Bengali speaking population of Assam is a little above 91 lakhs, which is about 29% of the total population of Assam. About 31% of the Bengali speaking people are Hindus.
In [[Jharkhand]] the Bengali Hindu population is 2.5&amp;nbsp;million (8.09%).

In Tripura, Bengali hindus form the majority due to immigration of  from neighbouring East Pakistan during 1971 as a result Tripura become a Bengali majority state. Bengalis comprise nearly 59.81% of the state population which is around 2.19 million respectively whereas tribals are 40.92% of the state population which is around 1.63 million as of 2011.  

There is also a significant number of Bengali Hindus residing in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], estimated approximately 100,000 comprising 26% of the population. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is also the most widely spoken language in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, despite it lacking official status.

===Outside Indian Subcontinent===
[[UK]] has a huge portion of Bengali Hindu population. Former [[England women's cricket team|Cricketer]] [[Isa Guha]] and [[Rhona Mitra]] are prominent descendants of Bengali Hindu diaspora.

=== Economy ===
Bengali Hindu society used to be caste-oriented throughout centuries and the professional status of men depended exclusively on the hierarchical caste divisions. Some professions such as weaving, pottery, carpentry, blacksmithing etc. have always been carried out by special Hindu caste groups in Bengal. In traditional Bengali Hindu society, nearly every occupation is carried on by a ranked hierarchy of specialised caste groups- not only artisan occupations but also personal and domestic service functions such as barbering, laundering, latrine cleaning as well as non-menial tasks such as priesthood. However, with the introduction of British rule and appearance of urban civilisation, the former rural agrarian and artisan economy gradually crumbled and gave way to modern middle class economy. However, agriculture, land tenure, farming and fishing form the predominant economic activity in most of the rural area till now. A small but significant section of rural people carry out small trades and businesses. In urban and semi-urban areas, most of the people are engaged in business, industry, government and private service sectors, self-employing works and intellectual pursuits. Unemployment has persisted in a certain minuscule section of the community.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Kalighat Savitri begs Yama not to take Satyaban.jpg|thumb|right|Savitri-Satyavan story on Kalighat Painting, 3rd quarter of the 19th century.]]
The proper Bengali literary history begins with the early [[Vaishnava]] literature like the [[Shreekrishna Kirtana]] and the [[Vaishnava padavali]]s followed by translation literatures like [[Ramayana]] and Srikrishna Vijaya. In the medieval period literary works on the life and teachings of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] were composed. This period saw the emergence of [[History of Bengali literature#Shakta Padavali|Shakta padavalis]]. The characteristic feature of Bengali Hindu literature in the middle age are the [[mangalkavya]]s, that glorify various Hindu gods and goddesses often using folkloristic backgrounds.

The [[early modern period]] saw a flurry in the literary activity especially after the emergence of the Bengali press. The first Bengali prose ''Raja Pratapaditya Charitra'' was written during this time. The [[Bengal Renaissance|Renaissance]] saw a rapid development in modern Bengali literature. Most of the epics, poems, novels, short stories and dramas of the modern classical literature were written during this period. The Bengal Literary Society that later came to be known as [[Bangiya Sahitya Parishad]] was founded. The literary development during the Renaissance culminated in [[Rabindranath Tagore|Rabindranath's]] [[Nobel prize]] for literature.

In the Post-Partition period, the Bengali Hindus pioneered the [[Hungry generation]], ''Natun Kabita'' and the [[Little magazine movement#Bengali little magazine movement|little magazine]] movements. Of late, some of them have made their mark in contemporary English literature.

=== Art ===
The [[Kalighat painting|Kalighat school of painting]] flourished in Bengal in the early modern period, and especially after the first paper mill was set up in 1809. During the rise of [[Hindu nationalism|nationalism]] in the early 20th century, the Bengali Hindus pioneered the [[Bengal school of art]]. It provided the artistic medium of expression to the Hindu nationalist movement. Though the Bengal school later gave way to [[modernist]] ideas, it left an enduring legacy. In the post-liberalisation phase of India, modern art acquired a new dimension as young artists like [[Devajyoti Ray]], Sudip Roy and [[Paresh Maity]] started gaining international recognition. Devajyoti Ray is known for introducing [[Pseudorealism]], which is one of the most original genres of Indian art today.

[[File:Dakshineshwar.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Dakshineshwar Kali Temple, Kolkata: a spiritual centre of Bengali Hindus]]
[[File:Shiva Temple, Puthia, Rajshahi NK (2).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Shiva Temple, Puthia, Rajshahi.]]
The Bengali Hindus generally follow the beliefs and practices that fall under the broad umbrella of [[Hinduism]]. Majority of them follow either the [[Shakta]] or the [[Vaishnava]] traditions, and some follow a synthesis of the two. The minor traditions include [[Shaiva]] etc. A significant minority is [[atheist]] who do not follow any rituals. [[Brahmoism]] is also found among Bengali Hindus.

Apart of the parent tradition, the Bengali Hindus usually affiliate themselves to one of the many sects that have come to be established as institutionalised forms of the ancient [[guru-shishya tradition]]s. Major amongst them include the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Bharat Sevashram Sangha]], [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]], [[Thakur Anukulchandra|Anukul Thakur]], [[Matua Mahasangha|Matua]], [[ISKCON]], [[Gaudiya Math]], [[Ananda Marga]], [[Ram Thakur]] etc.

=== Festivals ===
According to a famous Bengali proverb, there are thirteen festivals in twelve months. Bengali Hindus celebrate all major Indian festivals. The year begins with the Bengali New Year's Day or [[Pohela Boishakh]] which usually falls on 15 April. Traditional business establishment commence their fiscal year on this day, with the worship of [[Lakshmi]] and [[Ganesha]] and inauguration of the halkhata (ledger). People dress in ethnic wear and enjoy ethnic food. Poila Baishakh is followed by [[Rabindra Jayanti]], [[Rath Yatra]] and [[Janmashtami]] before the commencement of the Pujas.

The puja season begins with the [[Vishwakarma Puja]] and is followed up by [[Durga Puja]], the greatest and largest Bengali Hindu festival. It is commemoration of the victory of the good over the evil. According to Chandi Purana, goddess [[Durga]] killed [[Mahishasura]], the evil demon and saved the devas. [[Rama]] the prince of [[Ayodhya]] invoked the blessings of goddess Durga in a battle against [[Ravana]] of Lanka. Durga Puja is the commemoration of Rama's victory over Ravana and it ends in [[Vijayadashami|Bijoya Dashami]]. Durga Puja is followed by [[Kojagari Lakshmi Puja]], [[Kali Puja]], [[Bhai phonta]], [[Jagaddhatri|Jagaddhatri Puja]].

The winter solstice is celebrated a [[Makar Sankranti|Paush Sankranti]] in mid January, followed by Netaji Jayanti and [[Saraswati Puja]]. The spring is celebrated in the form of Dolyatra or [[Holi]]. The year ends with [[Charak Puja]] and [[Gajan (festival)|Gajan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">[[Image:Tombe Biton Coulibaly.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grave of Biton Mamary Coulibaly (1712-1755), near [[Ségou]], [[Mali]].]]
'''Bitòn Coulibaly''' (also '''Mamary Coulibaly''', 1689?&amp;ndash;1755) founded the [[Bambara Empire]] in what is now [[Mali]]'s [[Ségou Region]] and [[Mopti Region]].  

Great-grandson of former [[Ségou]] [[monarch|king]] [[Kaladian Coulibaly]], Mamary Coulibaly settled in Ségou in his youth and soon became head of the Tòn, a voluntary organization for young men, taking the title of "Bitòn."  Under Coulibaly's leadership, the Tòn transformed from an egalitarian society into an army of "Tondions."  Prompted by popular up rise against the king of Ségou, the populace suggested he take over the leadership of the Bambara kingdom. Coulibaly quickly subdued rival chiefs of Ségou through a vote a cloture of the Chiefs and used the city as a capital for his new Bambara Empire.

Fortifying himself with defensive techniques from the [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] tradition, Coulibaly created a thousand-man army and a navy of war [[canoe]]s to patrol the [[Niger River]], staffing both with men already captured in his conquests.  Coulibaly then proceeded to launch successful assaults against his neighbors, the [[Fula people|Fula]]ni, the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and the [[Mossi people|Mossi]]; he also attacked [[Tomboctou]], though he held the city only briefly.  During this time he also founded the city of [[Bla, Mali|Bla]] as an outpost and armory.  

Coulibaly's new empire thrived on trade with the Berber to the north due to the Islamic influence, including that of local [[slavery|slaves]] captured in its many wars. The slaves were drafted in the army, used for labor and or resold to African local traders to the south and west (not European Slave trade);  the demand for slaves then fueled the empire on to further wars. Note: Slaves had the right to property and could win their way to nobility as [[Ngolo Diarra]] did.

Bitòn Coulibaly was succeeded by [[Dinkoro Coulibaly]] following his death in 1755 and Ali Coulibaly.  However, the Coulibalys failed to keep control of the empire, and it fell into anarchy until [[Ngolo Diarra]] a slave or servant of Biton Coulibaly seized the throne in 1766.

'''Boban and Molly''' ([[Malayalam]]: &lt;big&gt;ബോബനും മോളിയും&lt;/big&gt;) are the characters of a political satiric [[India]]n weekly comic series created by [[Toms (cartoonist)|VT Thomas]] (known by the pen name Toms) and is one of the longest uninterruptedly running comic series of the world. It was first published in 1962 and has been in print ever since. Boban and Molly, twin brother and sister from the rural environs of central [[Travancore]] became popular in [[Kerala]] through the [[Malayala Manorama|Malayala Manorama weekly]], which published the strip for almost four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/16/stories/2006071611920400.htm |title=Kerala / Pathanamthitta News : Now, they promise a laugh riot on TV |publisher=The Hindu |date=2006-07-16 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a controversial legal battle between Malayala Manorama and Thomas, ''Boban and Molly'' began to appear as a comic magazine called "Tom's Magazine".

Toms achieved enormous success and fame through Boban and Molly, and became one of the most influential comic artists in Kerala.&lt;ref name="cartoonistsindia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonistsindia.com/htm/pr_thomas.htm |title=Indian Institute of Cartoonist |publisher=Cartoonistsindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Toms, the prototypes of Boban and Molly were two naughty kids who stayed next door to his ancestral home in [[Kuttanad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-they-promise-a-laugh-riot-on-tv/article3105820.ece |title=NATIONAL / KERALA : Now, they promise a laugh riot on TV |publisher=The Hindu |date=2006-07-16 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes appear in the comics varies from childish adventures and pranks to contemporary social and political satires.

Though, over the years, I have created many characters, he has remained the most endearing of them all,” says Toms, revealing that idea for the character came from his elder daughter Molly’s son whose nickname is Unnikkuttan. “My grandson was a prankster, who used to threaten his mother that he would divorce her if she scolded him,” recollects artist Toms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parvathy Nambidi |url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/article605099.ece?service=print |title=The cartoon that charmed us all |publisher=Newindianexpress.com |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal battle with Malayala Manorama ==

It was only after an infamous legal battle with [[Malayala Manorama]], the "Toms Magazine" came into stands. The controversy became a debating point in the local media and later attracted the attention of the national media.

Toms joined Malayala Manorama, the most popular daily in Kerala, as a cartoonist in 1961, and worked there till retiring as an assistant editor in June 1987. After leaving the Malayala Manorama, he started publishing the strip in the magazine [[Kalakaumudi]], against which the Manorama went to court. A local court temporarily restrained Toms and permitted Manorama to continue publication of the Boban and Molly. However, on an appeal, the [[Kerala High Court|High Court of Kerala]] ruled that pursuant to the [[Copyright law of India|Indian Copyright Act, 1957]], while the ownership of the strips drawn during Toms’ employment with Manorama would continue to be with the publication, Toms was free to own the characters Boban and Molly and could continue to create cartoon strips featuring them and publish them at his will.&lt;ref name="cartoonistsindia1"/&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
It is said that Toms even influenced the way a Malayali read a magazine — from back to front— thanks to his strip which appeared in the back pages of the Malayala Manorama weekly.&lt;ref name="cartoonistsindia1"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''The Skeptic: Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience'', Phil Molé says "Caroline Myss offers no tangible evidence to support any of her claims. Her hypothetical energy system cannot be detected, her intuitive diagnostic abilities are unproven, and her holistic philosophy is riddled with inconsistencies and unsubstantiated judgments."&lt;ref name="Skeptic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=The Skeptic: Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=1-57607-653-9|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]], a paranormal investigator, says, "Myss provides no proof of her alleged abilities. She intuits, of course, her intuitive power, offers only hearsay testimonials and anecdotal evidence as support."&lt;ref name="Unproven Claims of Caroline Myss"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Joe Nickell Book Review|url=http://myss.com/news/media/adetail.asp?i=28|work=Unproven Claims of Caroline Myss|publisher=CSI|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also described Myss as having "many of the traits associated with a fantasy prone personality."&lt;ref name=Adventures&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Adventures in Paranormal Investigation|year=2007|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2467-4|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecilia''' is a [[Crossover (music)|classical crossover]] singer, originally from [[Norwegian people|Norway]], who is known for her rendition of "[[Amazing Grace]]". She has released seven albums, two via [[Universal Music]], and performed worldwide, selling several hundred thousand albums with virtually no mainstream publicity.

== Early life ==

Cecilia grew up in the small town of [[Harstad]], in Norway in the [[Arctic Circle]], the 'land of the [[midnight sun]]'. She wanted to become an opera singer after seeing a television broadcast of the  opera [[Aida]], when she was 9 years old. Her graduation marks from the [[Conservatory of Music]] in [[Oslo, Norway]], were  (extremely rare) perfect scores. She studied  for 6 years in conservatories in Norway, Denmark and Germany.

She then moved to [[New York City]] to study with [[Oren Brown]], a vocal coach renowned to help a singer 'discover their natural voice'. In April 2002, upon [[Luciano Pavarotti]]'s suggestion and referral, she began to study with Dr. William Riley, coach of [[Celine Dion]], and worked with [[Pavarotti]] and [[Andrea Bocelli]], and even [[Bill Clinton]].

== Career ==
Cecilia has toured with [[Hay House]] [[published]] [[authors]], such as [[Wayne Dyer|Dr. Wayne Dyer]], [[Deepak Chopra|Dr. Deepak Chopra]], [[Louise Hay]], [[Marianne Williamson]] and [[Stuart Wilde]], and performed in Norway, Japan, England, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the United States. She has performed at large venues including the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles and the [[Miami Arena]], [[Miami, Florida]].

She was discovered in 1994 by the British writer [[Stuart Wilde]], who was behind her first two albums, ''Voice of the Feminine Spirit'' and ''Voice of Violet 19''.

Cecilia opened the new [[millennium]] by singing at the [[Deepak Chopra]] [[Millennium]] event, where the [[Dalai Lama]] gave a speech. She sang at the 2002 [[Salt Lake City]] [[Winter Olympics]], where she also performed a [[concert]] at the World of Ice, and sang for the [[Crown Prince Haakon|Crown Prince]], [[Mette Marit|Crown Princess]] and [[King of Norway]].

Norwegian National TV ([[NRK]]) made a music video of a song Cecilia co-wrote, titled "My Beloved". It was filmed at the top of the [[Olympic Mountains]].

== Other activities ==

Cecilia supports [[Plan International]], personally sponsoring a child in [[Nepal]]. She supports the Norwegian Federation for Animal Protection. She has also performed for the benefit of the [[Linda McCartney]] Cancer Foundation. Her activities with the charity stem from her own experiences, as she lost her mother to the disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Annie Leary''' (b. 1832 - d. 1919) was an American Papal countess, prominent society figure, and philanthropist in late nineteenth and early twentieth century [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nobility.org/2016/09/29/annie-leary/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Annie was the daughter of the hatter James Leary who  was a childhood friend of [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]], then, later bought many beaver pelts from William's  father [[John Jacob Astor]] and operated a shop in the basement of the original [[Astor House]] Hotel across from [[New York City Hall]].  She had three brothers Arthur, Daniel, and George who made a fortune in shipping during the [[U.S. Civil War]].  Arthur was a bachelor who Annie accompanied to society functions in New York City as well as [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/02/24/109694164.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that James friendship with the Astors is what led to Arthur and in turn Annie's being the only Catholics to be included on [[Caroline Astor]]'s "The 400".  When Arthur died she inherited his fortune as well as his social prominence and recognition via the aforementioned 400 list.&lt;ref&gt;http://thisculturalchristian.blogspot.com/2014/09/90-fifth-avenue-nyc-arthur-and-countess.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming into large sums of money Annie Leary soon became an ardent philanthropist.  Among her notable bequests was the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament at [[Bellevue Hospital]] (dedicated 1897 - razed 1938 in order to make way for a Bellevue administration building which encompasses a new chapel where the original stained glass panels including nine made in [[Munich]] remain today)  the first Catholic chapel at Bellevue. It was dedicated in memory of her late brother Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/BellevueHospChapels.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=8kc8AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=countess+annie+leary+columbus+monument&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WVlF-gUELY&amp;sig=lAj5VhEgCJdCFViRLmWlUm5KyFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQlNTxrc3WAhVor1QKHVBOB8EQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=countess%20annie%20leary%20columbus%20monument&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nyulangone.org/files/publication_issues/NewsViews_March_April_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 [[Pope Leo XIII]] created her a Papal Countess, the first such title to have been bestowed upon a woman in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/mcnamarasblog/2011/08/%E2%80%9Cthe-church-would-look-foolish-without-them%E2%80%9D-countess-annie-leary-new-york-new-york.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Annie Leary died in 1919 and in her will she allotted $200,000 to the [[Archbishop of New York]] for the erection of a [[sacristy]] for New York City's new [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] as well as a vault for eight (the Countess and her family) to be placed beneath the altar. It turned out however that the management of her will was delegated to a niece of hers who was not fond of the departed philanthropist and the money was never given to the aforementioned clergyman. Legal action therefore followed, and by the time the will was resolved in 1926 there was no money left to pay for the vault. Subsequently the Countess's final resting place is in the [[old St. Patrick's Cathedral#cathedral complex|catacombs]] of the [[Old St. Patrick's Cathedral]] where she continues to rest in peace today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/opinion/editorial-notebook-who-was-countess-annie-leary-readers-were-happy-supply-answer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dana Hill''' (born '''Dana Lynne Goetz'''; May 6, 1964 – July 15, 1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[actress]]. Hill is best known for having played Audrey Griswold in ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation|National Lampoon’s European Vacation]]'', and also known for her roles in ''[[Shoot the Moon]]'' and ''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''.

==Early life and health issues==
Dana Lynne Goetz was born in 1964 in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California]], to Sandy Hill and Theodore Arthur "Ted" Goetz, a director of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=158727170&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis of Type I [[diabetes]] at an early age ended her athletic career; a 1982 article in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Doris Klein. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081624,00.html "Diabetes Has Slowed Her Growth but Not Her Talent — Dana Hill Is Big Enough to ''Shoot the Moon''"] ''People''. March 8, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Hill, at age 10, had placed third nationwide in the 880-yard run and fourth in the mile run. A few weeks later, she collapsed on the track, which resulted in her medical diagnosis. The diabetes affected her growth and caused lifelong health complications.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Michael A. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20142000,00.html "Fighting Spirit"] ''People''. August 12, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teen years==
Despite her father's strong discouragement, Hill’s initial work was in commercials (her first job was a 1973 commercial for the [[YMCA]], spinning a basketball on her finger with [[Boston Celtics]] center [[Dave Cowens]]). However, to avoid the appearance of [[nepotism]], she used her mother's maiden name and devoted herself to acting as a career. She appeared in guest roles on such programs as ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' before landing a major role on the 1981–1982 CBS series ''[[The Two of Us (1981 TV series)|The Two of Us]]'' as Gabrielle "Gabby" Gallagher. While filming this series, the 17-year-old Hill would sometimes be pulled over by the police while driving to the studio because she looked too young to drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081624,00.html "Diabetes Has Slowed Her Growth but Not Her Talent — Dana Hill Is Big Enough to ''Shoot the Moon''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her breakthrough role was in the 1981 made-for-TV movie ''[[Fallen Angel (1981 film)|Fallen Angel]]''. The 17-year-old Hill played 12-year-old molestation victim Jennifer Phillips, a role which earned her a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Young Actress in a Television Special.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms3.htm Young Artist Award website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Hill played Sherry Dunlap in ''[[Shoot the Moon]]''. The same year, she played Frankie Addams, the lead character in the made-for-TV adaptation of ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]'', co-starring with [[Pearl Bailey]]. In 1983, she starred with [[Rip Torn]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]] in the film ''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]'', a semi-biographical story about [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]], author of ''[[The Yearling]]''.

In 1982 and 1983, Hill made two guest appearances in the TV series ''[[The Fall Guy]]''. In season 1, episode 18 "Child's Play", she played a young girl called Libby. In season 2, episode 20 "P.S. I Love You" she had the role of 21-year-old stuntwoman Cassie Farraday. In 1983, she made a guest appearance on ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' in the episode "Basket Case".  She played Willie, a 13-year-old foster child who joined Magnum's youth basketball team.

At age 19, she starred in a 1984 ''[[CBS Schoolbreak Special]]'' titled ''[[Welcome Home, Jellybean]]'', playing Geraldine "Jellybean" Oxley, a 12-year-old developmentally disabled girl whose parents take her out of an institution so she can experience a normal home life. The same year, she appeared in [[Shelley Duvall]]'s 1980s children's TV series ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', playing the princess in an episode titled "The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers".

In 1986, she had another role in the TV series ''The Fall Guy''. She appeared in the episode "Tag Team".

==Film roles==
In 1985, the producers of the 1983 movie ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' were planning a sequel, but [[Anthony Michael Hall]] declined to reprise his role as son Rusty Griswold, choosing instead to do the film ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]''. The producers decided to recast the roles of both Griswold children, and so for ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'', Hill was chosen to replace [[Dana Barron]], the original actress who portrayed Audrey.

Hill appeared as Sergeant Andrea Pritchett with [[George Clooney]] in ''[[Combat High|Combat Academy]]'' (also known as ''Combat High''), a 1986 film from the producers of ''[[Police Academy (film series)|Police Academy]]''.

==Voice acting==
Beginning in 1987, she provided the voice for Scrappy, the orphan mouse, on eight episodes of ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0161170/ Mighty Mouse, the New Adventures (TV Series 1987–1988) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She also provided the voice of Toots in the episode "The Bright Eyes Mob" for ''[[Pound Puppies]]''. She was Teddy-2 in ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' (1990);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099878/ Jetsons: The Movie (1990) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1989-1991 she voiced Buddy on the animated children's television show ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088528/ Adventures of the Gummi Bears (TV Series 1985–1991) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991 was the voice of Tank Muddlefoot on ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' and in 1992-1993 was the voice of [[Max Goof|Max]] on ''[[Goof Troop]]''. She was also the speaking voice of Tim (Tom's proclaimed twin brother) in ''[[Tom and Jerry Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103428/ Goof Troop (TV Series 1992–1993) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice was featured as [[Jerry Mouse]] in ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105616/ Tom and Jerry: The Movie (1992) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Norton in the DIC cartoon ''[[What-a-Mess]]'', [[Charles and Mambo|Charles Duckman]] in ''[[Duckman]]'' until her death in 1996. Following Hill's passing, [[Pat Musick]] replaced her as Charles&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639626 "Magnum, P.I." Basket Case (TV episode 1983) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous characters in the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] show ''[[Rugrats]]''. She was also a semi-regular panelist on the 1990s version of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.

==Death==
Hill slipped into a [[diabetic coma]] in May 1996 and suffered a massive paralytic [[stroke]] the following month. On July 15, 1996, Hill died at age 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dlife.com/diabetes/famous_people/actors_actresses/dana-hill-biography|title = Dana Hill Biography|date = December 30, 2013|accessdate = Dec 29, 2014|website = dLife|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1980s, Berthiaume travelled throughout [[Quebec]] with various groups, playing more than 400 concerts featuring covers of Supertramp, Genesis, U2, etc. and original compositions. It was during this period that he produced a first record entitled ''Yellow Street'' (Dance music) that was carried out in collaboration with DJ M.C. Mario. He also worked at that time with Allen McCartey ([[Men Without Hats]]), Steve Tracey (Loni Gamble, [[Céline Dion]]), Luc Phaneuf (Starmania), Yvan Payeur ([[Cirque du Soleil]]) and several other performers from Montreal.

He also wrote several music and sound tracks for corporate and advertising films. In the beginning of the 1990s, he was attracted by Ambient Music and quickly became prominent in this style. During this period, he produced seven albums&amp;mdash;all nominated for the [[ADISQ]] award. He is now the lead singer and the lead guitarist with The Bluegators, featuring French drummer René Guérin and Kérassios Varipatis on doublebass.

Between 1994 and 1998, he led and organised a team from the flat tropical island nation to the top of Everest. Sustaining an injury on the summit push, he did not make the summit himself though two other team members succeeded in making the top on May 25, 1998. A week after his return, and not related to the climb, he was stricken with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], a rare nerve disorder where the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. Paralysed from eyes down, he spent six months in hospitals, and emerged partially disabled in both legs.

He returned to mountaineering, and since 1999, has led more than 15 expeditions, including the first all-Singapore ascent of [[Argentina]]'s [[Aconcagua]] (6962m), and the world's third solo of [[Ojos del Salado]], the highest [[volcano]] in the world (6893m). In summer 2005, he led the first [[Southeast Asia]]n team to climb virgin peaks in the [[Tien Shan]] mountain range on the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]]-[[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] border. The team summitted three peaks, now officially recognised as [[Temasek]], [[Singapore|Singapura]], and [[Ong Teng Cheong]] peaks. In 2009, he formed another team for the Tien Shan, summitting three more virgin peak, the highest and hardest being Majulah Peak (5152m). His last virgin peaks expedition was to the Qinghai region of China. Lim and his fellow mountaineer partner, Mohammed Rozani bin Maarof, summitted a 6000-metre virgin peak and named it Sangay Ri. In 2016, he attempted a 4km ridge traverse encompassing two virgin peaks in the Manang region in Nepal; and continues to climbs and ski worldwide

Lim has a B.A. in Law from Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everestmotivation.com/?page_id=6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225162226/http://www.everestmotivation.com/?page_id=6 |archivedate=2012-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also authored two books, ''Mountain to Climb: The Quest for Everest and Beyond'' and ''Against Giants: The Life and Climbs of a Disabled Mountaineer'', both published by [[Epigram Books]]. His third book, ''How Leaders Lead: 71 Lessons in Leading Yourself &amp; Others'' is self-published.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everestmotivation.com/?page_id=623&amp;shopp_pid=19&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim is owner of a leadership and coaching consultancy (Everest Motivation Team Pte Ltd) and has delivered programmes and keynote presentations in 75 cities and 33 countries, combining experiences in leadership in the mountains with corporate models; and delivering presentations and workshops around the world. His leadership and team simulation, [http://www.everestchallenger.com Everest Challenger® - .]® has been licensed in 13 countries, and is the first tabletop simulation of climbing Mt Everest, designed for adult learning outcomes. He earned the Certified Speaking Professional (CSP) credential in 2009, making him the first Singaporean to acquire this amongst the 600 CSPs in the 6000-strong Global Speaker Federation.  In 2013, together with 30 leading global speakers, he received the designation of  CSPGlobal (now known as the Global Speaking Fellow)

'''Emily Lau Wai-hing''', [[Justice of Peace|JP]] ({{zh-t|劉慧卿}}; born 21 January 1952) is a politician in Hong Kong who champions press freedom and [[human rights in Hong Kong|human rights]]. A former journalist, she became the first woman directly elected to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 LegCo elections]]. She served as Legislative Councillor for the [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East]] throughout the 1990s and 2000s until she stepped down in 2016. She was also the chairperson of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=Chair&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1106843/emily-lau-wai-hing-elected-democratic-party-chairwoman|title=Emily Lau Wai-hing elected Democratic Party chairwoman|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lau was born on 21 January 1952. Her family moved to Hong Kong from the [[Guangdong]] in 1948 during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1962, her family transferred her to the then new English-language [[Marymount Primary School|Maryknoll Sisters' School]] in [[Happy Valley, Hong Kong|Happy Valley]], where she studied until 1972. When she was in primary school, she was given the English name Emily by her aunt.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{cite book|pages=290–292|title=Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women, Volume 2|editor1-first=Lily Xiao Hong|editor1-last=Lee|editor2-first=A. D.|editor2-last=Stefanowska|editor3-first=Sue|editor3-last=Wiles|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lau travelled to the United States to study journalism studies at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1973 to 1976 and graduated with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism. She later cited the [[Watergate scandal]] and investigative journalism having had a major formative effect on her views on the role and potential of the press.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

==Journalist career==
[[File:Friends of LSE in Hong Kong- Forum on the 1987 Green Paper, 1987 (3982884225).jpg|thumb|250px|Emily Lau at the forum on the [[1988 Hong Kong electoral reform|1987 Green Paper: Review of Developments in Representative Government]].]]
After returning Hong Kong, Lau worked between 1976 and 1978 as a reporter for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', the major English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. She then moved into television journalism when she joined the [[Television Broadcasts]] (TVB) and promoted to senior producer in 1981. She furthered her studies in the early 1980s at the [[London School of Economics]] and completed an MSc in International Relations in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/members/yr08-12/lwh.htm |title=Hon Emily LAU Wai-hing, JP |work=Legislative Council of Hong Kong |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206190134/http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/members/yr08-12/lwh.htm |archivedate=6 December 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; then followed a position as an assistant producer within the [[BBC]] from 1982 to 1984, while concurrently working as the London correspondent of Hong Kong TVB News.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

It was the time the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom discussed over the fate of Hong Kong after 1997. She later noted, "My passion for politics began to develop in 1982, when China told Britain that it would impose a settlement on Hong Kong if the two sides could not reach an agreement by 1984. From that moment, politics began to matter."&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

Emily Lau returned to Hong Kong as Hong Kong correspondent of the Hong Kong-based ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' in 1984. The position allowed her access and insights into the politics of the colonial Hong Kong. During the time Lau took up position at the Journalism and Communication Department of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) in 1987 and subsequently at the Extra-Mural Department of the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU).&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

In December 1984, after signing the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] flew to Hong Kong to give a press conference. Lau questioned Thatcher, "Prime Minister two days ago you signed an agreement with China promising to deliver over 5 million people into the hands of a communist dictatorship. Is that morally defensible, or is it really true that in international politics the highest form of morality is one's own national interest?" Thatcher replied by saying that everyone in Hong Kong was happy with the agreement, and Lau may be a solitary exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/internationalrelations/2013/03/20/featured-alumni-emily-lau-msc-in-international-relations-1982/|title=Featured Alumni: Emily Lau (MSc in International Relations, 1982)|work=Department of International Relations blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also involved with the [[Hong Kong Journalists Association]] during this period, serving as an executive committee member, vice-chair and later on chairperson from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

When the direct elections for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) were first introduced in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 elections]], Lau resigned from her posts and ran for office in the [[New Territories East (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|New Territories East]] [[geographical constituency]] (GC). She campaigned for five months as a new breed of populist politicians in Hong Kong who can appeal wide range of Hong Kong populace. The elections saw with a liberal [[landslide victory]], she became the first woman elected in direct elections along with other pro-democracy politicians of the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK), largely due to the fear of Hong Kong populace towards Beijing after the [[Tiananmen massacre]] in early June 1989.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

In this period, Lau became a household name in Hong Kong and the legislator came to be both a champion of her constituents and a perceived thorn in the side of the Hong Kong administration. She was equally a critic of Britain and Beijing. The last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British Governor]] [[Chris Patten]] aimed at a faster pace of democratisation. Governor Patten carried out the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|reform packages]] which enfranchised millions electorates in the [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] indirect elections. Although the reform packages were ferociously criticised by Beijing government for violating the Sino-British agreements, she introduced a private member's bill which would even allow all 60 Legislative Council seats to be directly elected in 1995. The bill was beaten by only one vote.

In 1993, Lau tabled a motion to seek assurances of [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in Britain]] for the [[British National (Overseas)]] passport holders if expelled from Hong Kong after 1997. The motion was supported by 36 legislators but was rejected by the [[Secretary for Security]] Alistair Asprey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other Hong Kong Report 1994|first=Donald H.|last=McMillen|year=1994|publisher=Chinese University Press|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1994, Lau led legislators in urging Britain to grant full citizenship to 3.5&amp;nbsp;million native Hong Kong [[British Overseas Territories citizen|British Dependent Territories Citizens]] (BDTC). As the situation intensified, she led a cross-party delegation of Hong Kong legislators to Britain to lobby government and opposition politicians ahead of the LegCo debate. The five councillors met the [[British Foreign Secretary]] and other senior officials, but achieved little.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1995|1995 Legislative Council elections]], Lau was re-elected to the legislature by popular vote, winning with 58.51 percent of votes cast, the highest figure among all the geographical constituencies.&lt;ref name=women/&gt; Growing disillusionment with the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], the pro-democracy party formed and succeeded the United Democrats of Hong Kong in 1994, and other liberal forces, Lau founded a new political grouping, [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]], in August 1996 which took a more aggressively pro-democracy, pro-human rights and anti-Communist Party stances and left wing positions on economic matters. Lau became the Convenor of the party, having five legislators and becoming the fourth largest political grouping in the legislature in the run up to handover. Lau remained in the Legislative Council until it was disbanded by the PRC following the handover on 1 July 1997.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

Lau also participated in street protests, and in December 1996 scuffled with riot police outside the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] with [[Andrew Cheng]], [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] while demonstrating outside the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 1996|closed-door election]] for the post-handover [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief executive]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Ming K. [1997] (1997). The Challenge of Hong Kong's Reintegration With China. Hong Kong University Press. Hong Kong (China). {{ISBN|962-209-441-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested within 29 other pro-democracy activists. Over the following several months leading up to the [[handover of Hong Kong|July 1997 handover]], Lau urged the Chief executive-designate [[Tung Chee-hwa]] to stand up against Beijing, following his "unreserved support" for the Beijing-hand-picked [[Provisional Legislative Council]] abolishing or modifying some Hong Kong laws covering human rights and civil liberties. In March, Lau called for boycott of Hong Kong's future first election under PRC rule if the voting system was unfair and the [[proportional representation]] favoured [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] candidates.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

===Early post-handover era===
She was required to relinquish her British passport and adopt Chinese citizenship in order to be eligible to run for the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1998|first Legislative Council elections]] after the handover in 1998. The pro-democracy camp won 63 percent of the popular vote and Lau was returned again to the Legislative Council through New Territories East which she remained in until her retirement.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

[[File:The Frontier 2005 07-01.jpg|thumb|250px|Emily Lau at the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches|1 July protest]] in 2005.]]
Lau led The Frontier at the forefront of pressure on the government for early democratisation and was an outspoken critic on human rights and a number of other policy areas in the HKSAR; she was sceptical of the functioning of the "[[One country, two systems]]" principle. Beside pushing for tightened human rights protection, greater efforts on [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]], and the establishment of a statutory right to access to information, she demanded a redraft of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]], Hong Kong's constitutional document, and [[Chinese democracy movement|democratisation in China]]. On the economy she supported legislation on fair trading, oppose importation of foreign labour, and called for a [[minimum wage]]. Lau received the [[Bruno Kreisky Award]] for her human rights work in 1998.

In 1998, Lau sued the Hong Kong branch of the [[Xinhua News Agency]] over its slow response to her queries for personal information. She lost the case and was ordered by the court to pay legal fees of HK$1.6&amp;nbsp;million. Claiming that her lawsuit was in the public interest, she attempted to raise funds from the public to repay the debt. In December 2000, with over $1&amp;nbsp;million still outstanding, the agency (now the Central People's Government Liaison Office) applied to the court for her bankruptcy.

In the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2002|2002 Chief executive election]], Lau was against supporting an alternative candidate as some pro-democracy allies argued: "As it is not a fair, open and democratic election, we should not participate in it and give it any legitimacy." Lau co-founded the Coalition Against Second Term (CAST) to draw attention to the flawed process of choosing the Chief executive, the lack of competition and the need for real democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promise of Democratization in Hong Kong: The 2002 Chief Executive Election and the Transition Five Years after Reversion|publisher=National Democratic Institute|year=2002|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/1366_hk_rpt_031102_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On international issues, Lau is supportive of self-determination for Taiwan. In 2003, she and another legislator, [[James To]] of the Democratic Party, attended a seminar entitled "Hong Kong Under One Country, Two Systems" organised by a pro-[[Taiwan independence]] group headed by former ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]]. Lau stated that "Taiwan's future should be determined by the Taiwan people themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.article23.org.hk/english/newsupdate/sep03/0902e.htm|title=Do not show toleration of Emily Lau's Offence|newspaper=China Daily|date=2 September 2003|first=Xiao|last=Ping}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent refusal to explicitly recognise Taiwan as a part of the PRC during an interview again drew criticism from more conservative sectors of the Hong Kong society, including attacks from pro-Beijing politician [[Leung Chun-ying]], who became Chief executive in 2012.

Beside her legal problems, Lau has been the victim of several criminal nuisance cases, including telephone nuisance to her office in January and October 2003, and two cases where food and/or faeces were splashed outside her office in [[Shatin]] in July and September 2003. A woman and an old man were arrested and fined in connection with some of these cases. Most notably, an arson attack against Lau's office took place on 21 June 2004. Posters outside her office, about an upcoming rally, were burned. Words were left saying "All Chinese traitors must die."

She fiercely opposed to the controversial [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security bill]] in 2002 and 2003 to meet requirements of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]]. After the [[2003 July 1 march]] in 2003, she was listed second on the joint-candidate list with other pro-democrats in the New Territories East and was elected to the Legislative Council elections in [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2004|2004 Legislative Council elections]]. She was elected chairwoman of the Legislative Council Finance Committee and had chaired for occasions until 2012.

In the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2005|Chief executive election]] held in 2005 after unpopular Tung Chee-hwa stepped down, Lau announced her interest in running for the post to raise the discussion over Hong Kong's democratic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20050325/4762391|title=參與特首選舉推動民主運動|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=25 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the opposition from secretary-general [[Andrew To]] and other members of the Frontier, Lau did not run in the election. Democratic Party chairman [[Lee Wing-tat]] became the only pro-democratic candidate in the election, but did not secure the threshold of 100 nominations.

===Joining the Democratic Party and 2012 reform package===
[[File:Emily Lau Wai Hing 2010 Enlarged.jpg|thumb|180px|Emily Lau at the ''City Forum'' in April 2010.]]
At the time of her election to LegCo in 1991, Lau was generally considered to be the most radical legislator.&lt;ref name=2014radical217&gt;Cheng, Joseph Yu-shek (p.217). [http://www.bath.ac.uk/polis/documents/events/joseph-yu-shek-cheng-emergence-of-radical-politics.pdf "The Emergence of Radical Politics in Hong Kong: Causes and Impact"]. ''China Review'', Vol. 14, No. 1, Special Issue: Urban and Regional Governance in China (Spring 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; However her radical image was overshadowed by activist [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and other radicals with her popular votes continuously declined. After the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 LegCo elections]] in September which saw Emily Lau was re-elected in New Territories East with the fewest votes, the Frontier merged into the more mainstream Democratic Party in November and Lau immediately became one of its two vice-chairpersons. After The Frontier merged into the Democratic Party, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government and opposition to pro-Beijing supporters mellowed somewhat, and was seen by some even to have been compromised.&lt;ref name="moderate"&gt;[http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/05/28/FYTX-1264310.htm "Democratic Party becomes moderate but no wiser"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Ta Kung Po'', 28 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2010, Emily Lau and Democratic Party chairman [[Albert Ho]] and veteran [[Cheung Man-kwong]] met with Beijing representatives headed by Li Gang, the deputy director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong]] – the first meeting between Democratic Party leaders and senior officials from the central government since the Tiananmen protests of 1989 – for negotiations over [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform package]]. In June 2010, as vice-chairperson of Democratic Party, she voted with her party in favour of the government's reform package, which included the party's late amendment – accepted by Beijing – to hold a popular vote for five new [[District Council (second)]] functional constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary; Wong, Albert; Fung, Fanny WY. (25 June 2010). "Cheers and jeers for political reform vote", ''[[South China Morning Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She has been surpassed by the radical democrats, such as [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]], and is the main target for attacks by Wong and [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]].&lt;ref name=2014radical217/&gt;

===Chairperson of the Democratic Party===
In September 2012, the Democratic Party suffered the worst defeat in party's history in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2012|2012 Legislative Council election]]. Chairman Albert Ho resigned as chairman and Lau became acting Chairperson of the party for three months.&lt;ref name=Chair/&gt; In the [[Democratic Party (HK) leadership election, 2012|party leadership election]] on 16 December 2012, she was elected chairperson, narrowly defeating vice-chairman [[Sin Chung-kai]], by 149 votes to 133, becoming the first female leader of the party since its formation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=21&amp;art_id=129330&amp;sid=38492840&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20121217&amp;fc=10 Lau makes political history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005002136/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=21&amp;art_id=129330&amp;sid=38492840&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20121217&amp;fc=10 |date=5 October 2013 }}, [[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]], 17 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lau and other Democratic Party members supported the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]] by taking a supporting role. On 11 December 2014, Lau was arrested by the police with a group of about a hundred demonstrators staging a final sit-in which included other prominent democratic legislators including [[Martin Lee]] and [[Alan Leong]], putting an end to a 75-day street occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2014/12/11/hong-kongs-main-democracy-protest-camp-falls-with-leading-protest-figures-arrested/|title=Hong Kong's main democracy protest camp falls with leading protest figures arrested|date=11 December 2014|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2014, she was re-elected chairperson in the [[Democratic Party (HK) leadership election, 2014|party leadership election]], beating three rivals in the party's 20-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Re-elected Democratic Party head Emily Lau calls for party to focus on younger Hong Kong generation|first=Joyce|last=Ng|date=15 December 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1662672/re-elected-democratic-party-head-emily-lau-calls-party-focus-younger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2016, she announced that she would not seek for an eighth term in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|September election]] after 25 years service on the Legislative Council as she did not field her nomination in the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong) primaries, 2016|party primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emily Lau reflects on ‘glorious days’ in Hong Kong legislature, but rules out standing for chief executive in a ‘fake election’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1897038/emily-lau-reflects-glorious-days-hong-kong-legislature-rules|date=1 January 2016|first=Jeffie|last=Lam|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran as a second candidate on his younger colleague, [[Lam Cheuk-ting]]'s candidate list, and helped him to get elected with nearly 40,000 votes.

Lau announced her retirement from the party chair in December 2016 and was succeeded by legislator [[Wu Chi-wai]]. She also relinquished all the party position afterward. She remained hosting her interview programme after her retirement, inviting different political heavyweights on her shows occasionally.

==Images==
Lau has been considered politician with strong conviction on promotion of democracy human rights and equal opportunities in Hong Kong. She was considered by the Hong Kong government as "radical", "outside mainstream public opinion" and a "solitary exception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women at the Top: Powerful Leaders Tell Us How to Combine Work and Family|first1=Diane F.|last1=Halpern|first2=Fanny M.|last2=Cheung|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was among the most popular legislators throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other Hong Kong Report 1994|first=Donald H.|last=McMillen|year=1994|publisher=Chinese University Press|pages=120–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British Governor]] [[Chris Patten]] regarded Lau as a "professional politician, handsome, well informed and dashingly eloquent, who would have got to the top in any Western political system" and an "exponent of the incisive soundbite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=East and West|first=Chris|last=Patten|page=104|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since she joined the Democratic Party, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government was seen by some even to have been compromised.&lt;ref name="moderate"/&gt; After she met with the mainland officials and for negotiations over [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform package]] and voted with her party in favour of the reform package, she was under ferocious attacks from the radical democrats for the compromise.

==Personal life and family==
Lau married John Ball, a British journalist from the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', in 1983. The marriage lasted two years. She remarried to a Hong Kong lawyer, Winston Poon, QC in 1989 after they met in London during her visit to discuss the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] with the members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=women/&gt; In 2006, she changed her marital status to unmarried with the Legislative Council office.

Stephen Lau Sing-hung, Emily Lau's brother was a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Guangzhou committee member in the 1980s, chairman of [[Ernst &amp; Young]]'s tax service before he left in 2006 and chief executive of China Timber Resources Group from 2007 to 2010. Despite her sister's political stance, he sued [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace|Occupy Central]] organiser [[Benny Tai]] in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]] for HK$314.60 in the [[Small Claims Tribunal]] as he had to spend HK$320 for a taxi ride on 6 October instead of just HK$5.40 for bus fare from his home in Wong Nai Chung Gap Road to Central because of the occupation movement. Emily Lau said she was not aware of her brother's action but insisted the family is not affected by the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy taxi claim splits Lau brother and sister |newspaper=The Standard |date=19 November 2014 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=151521&amp;con_type=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526031648/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=151521&amp;con_type=3 |archivedate=26 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola Gómez''' (1917-1978) was a Spanish scholar and a [[Carlist]] politician. He is considered one of top intellectuals of the Francoist era, though not necessarily of [[Francoism]]. As [[Theory of law|theorist of law]] he represented the school known as ''[[Natural law|iusnaturalismo]]'', as [[History of political thought|historian of political ideas]] he focused mostly on [[Hispanidad]], and as [[Philosophy of Politics|theorist of politics]] he pursued a [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] approach. As a Carlist he remained an ideologue rather than a political protagonist.

==Academic career==
[[File:ClaustrodelaMercedMurcia.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|[[University of Murcia|Murcia]], Law Faculty]]
Already in 1935 Tejada was nominated [[Assistant professor|Profesor Ayudant]]e de Derecho Político in Madrid, an assignment held shortly as he soon left for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When in the Nationalist army he was giving lectures at letters and philosophy courses&lt;ref&gt;titled ''El pensamiento jurídico-político español en nuestros clásicos de los siglos XVI y XVII'', Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; organized by Universidad de Sevilla,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' (Sevilla) 17.10.37, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1937/10/17/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939 publishing his first works.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' (Sevilla) 18.01.39, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1939/01/18/020.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Having obtained PhD laurels thanks to a thesis on [[:es:Jerónimo Castillo de Bobadilla|Jerónimo Castillo de Bobadilla]], in 1939 Tejada returned to Madrid as Professor Ayudante&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to assist [[Nicolás Pérez Serrano]]&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; at Derecho Político.&lt;ref&gt;Brocos Fernández 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he applied for chair of philosophy of law in Seville and [[Oviedo]], but during the [[:es:Oposición (examen)|routine contest]] he was defeated by counter-candidates; referees described him as erudite and brilliant speaker, but also disoriented, immature, not adhering to the point, lacking reflexive spirit, excessively lyrical and repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;there were 4 candidates for 2 chairs vacant, see Yolanda Blasco Gil, Jorge Correa Ballester, ''Primeras oposiciones y concursos de Filsofía del Derecho tras la Guerra Civil (1940-1941)'', [in:] ''Facultades y grados. X Congreso Internacional de Historia de las universidades hispánicas'', vol. 1, Valencia 2010. Tejada came with the most imposing publishing record, but referees noted that he „no responde a las cuestiones de la filosofía del derecho”, suffers from "falta de reflexión" and "exceso de transcripción" (264), is too much sociology oriented and not adhering to the point (265), disoriented, with some "inexactitudes" and lyrical divagations (266), and finally, immature (267)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1940&lt;ref&gt;exact sequence of the events is not clear&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada left to pursue research abroad,&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; having the unique opportunity to compare the early wartime realm in Berlin and in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Fernandez Serrano, ''Francisco Elias de Tejada y Spínola, extremeño universal'', [in:] ''Alcantara'' 191 (1978), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1941 Tejada won the contest for chair of Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho in [[University of Murcia|Murcia]];&lt;ref&gt;Brocos Fernández 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in 1942 he moved to [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], having been the only contender.&lt;ref&gt;Brocos Fernández 2005, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he swapped chairs with [[Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez|Joaquín Ruiz Giménez Cortés]]&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and left for [[University of Seville|Seville]], where he headed philosophy of law for the next 26 years, periodically chairing also the history of ideas. However, except the 1960-1961 course he spent the 1956-1964 period mostly pursuing research in Naples, with massive admin gimmicks on part of the University to find a legal framework for such a lengthy stay.&lt;ref&gt;the University was initially unwilling to concede such a long leave, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1964 he worked under the dedicación exclusiva contract.&lt;ref&gt;according to the Spanish system of the time, it limited Tejada right to teach to one institution, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 nominated consejero honorario del Consejo Nacional de Educación,&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; though his academic relations with the Francoist education authorities remained thorny.&lt;ref&gt;described as "isolated sniper" waging war against the regime, in the 1970s Tejada protested official designs aiming at curtailing academic liberties, Alberto Carrillo-Linares, ''Subversivos y malditos en la Universidad de Sevilla (1965-1977)'', Sevilla 2008, {{ISBN|9788461273522}}, pp. 264, 495, 520. For conflicting views on his stance towards students see Carrillo-Linare 2008, p. 343 (defending students' participation in academic life) and Vallejo 2015 (authoritarian policeman)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sevila19.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[University of Seville|Seville]], Recorate]]
Since the early 1970s Tejada intended to move to Madrid, but his 1971&lt;ref&gt;bid for Filosofía del Derecho at [[Universidad Complutense]]; he withdrew, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974&lt;ref&gt;for the post of Profesor Agregado de Historia del Pensamiento Político Español de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociología de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid; it appears that the contes was an obligatory procedure for certain category of scholars, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; bids for Complutense failed. His 1975 bid for [[Autonomous University of Madrid|Universidad Autónoma]]&lt;ref&gt;for cátedra de Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho de la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid&lt;/ref&gt; took an awkward turn, when Tejada challenged the referees appointed as linguistically incompetent.&lt;ref&gt;according to Tejada, the works he produced as references required knowledge of Akkadian, Agni, Akikuyu, Arab, Ashanti, Baoule, Bete, Czech, Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Finnish, Gouro, modern Greek, Hebrew, Dutch, Icelandic, Japanese, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Sanskrit, Senoufo, Swedish, Swahili, Basque, Vietnamese and Zulu&lt;/ref&gt; His protest was dismissed and in 1976 he lost to [[:es:Elías Díaz|Elías Díaz García]],&lt;ref&gt;allegedly his defeat produced a sigh of relief among the Madrid staff; opinion of his rival Elías Díaz, see Elías Díaz, ''Autobiografia intelectual'', [in:] ''Anthropos. Revista de Documentacion Cientifica de la Cultura'' 62 (1986), pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; appealing the decision; the issue was not settled before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1977 he was appointed with no contest to cátedra de Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho at Complutense; death interrupted his first course in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015; according to some scholars he died when delivering a lecture, see Jacek Bartyzel, ''Franciszek Elías de Tejada y Spínola - hidalgo, filozof, karlista'', [in:] ''haggard'' service, available [http://haggard.w.interiowo.pl/tejada.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though member of a number of scientific institutions around the world,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Brazilian Academy of Social Sciences and the Argentine National University of Buenos Aires&lt;/ref&gt; recipient of a few [[doctor honoris causa]] titles,&lt;ref&gt;also outside Europe, Bartyzel 2015, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; a vastly prolific author and during his lifetime himself subject of 4 PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada did not make it to the top elite of Spanish law scholars and did not enter [[Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación]]. There are conflicting accounts of his standing in the academic realm. Some claim that he was universally highly regarded as doctrinally intransigent but pro-student&lt;ref&gt;he defended students’ participation in academic governance bodies against the official schemes, Carrillo-Linares 2008, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; open-minded, tolerant scholar,&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Franciszek Elías de Tejada y Spínola - hidalgo, filozof, karlista''&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by his supervision of PhD bid of [[Enrique Tierno Galván]], the future key [[PSOE]] politician.&lt;ref&gt;also later mayor of Madrid and co-author of the 1978 constitution, César Alonso de los Ríos, ''El viejo profesor'', [in:] ''El Mundo'' 121, available [http://www.elmundo.es/larevista/num121/textos/profe1.htmlothers here]. For a sample of PhD thesis written under Tejada guidandce see Vicente Marrero Suárez, ''La fundamentación filosófica de una filosofía jurídico-social en la obra del P. Ramírez'' [PhD Universidad de Sevilla, 1970], available [http://fondosdigitales.us.es/tesis/tesis/699/la-fundamentacion-filosofica-de-una-filosofia-juridico-social-en-la-obra-del-p-ramirez/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Others present him as a feared „inquisidor”,&lt;ref&gt;Elías Díaz 1986, pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; extremely quarrelsome hypocrite pursuing private goals&lt;ref&gt;which consisted mostly of embarking on voyages around the world, posed as scientific research missions, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and eager to call security when dealing with manifestations of student dissent towards him.&lt;ref&gt;students voiced their disgust with de Tejada by interrupting his lectures with [[charivari]] demonstrations, Vallejo 2015; the case is dubbed "banal" and his complaints to university authorities are deemed "illustrative of his character and ideas"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorist of law==
[[File:Franciscus Suarez, S.I. (1548-1617).jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Francisco Suarez]]]]
Tejada is considered member of the natural law school and its key representative during the Franco era,&lt;ref&gt;Antonio-Enrique Pérez Luño, ''Natural Law Theory in Spain and Portugal'', [in:] ''The Age of Human Rights Journal'' 1 (2013), pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by early modern Spanish jurists like Francisco Suarez&lt;ref&gt;also Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto, Samuele Cecotti, ''F. Elías de Tejada: Europa, Tradizione, Liberta'' [review], [in:] ''Rassegna Bibliografica Mensile'' 3 (2005), p. 209, also Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''Francisco Elías de Tejada en la ciencia jurídico-política'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 3 (1997), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but mostly following the [[Aquinas]]; he regarded own work merely a gloss to the opus of St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, within iusnaturalismo he is classified as representative of [[Neo-Scholasticism|Neo-Scholastic school]], as opposed&lt;ref&gt;he claimed supremacy of "prudencia iuris" over what he considered technical or scientific threads, Ayuso 2008, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; to Axiological, Neo-Kantian and Innovative Natural Law schools.&lt;ref&gt;compare Pérez Luño 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[:fr:Michel Villey|Michel Villey]] deemed a renovator of classical European iusnaturalismo of the mid-20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada clearly distinguished own vision&lt;ref&gt;see his ''El Derecho Natural, fundamento de la civilización'', [in:] ''Revista chilena de derecho'' 1 (1974), pp. 287-303&lt;/ref&gt; from "iusnaturalismo racionalista".&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Within this framework, he agreed that the role of [[jurisprudence]] was discovering rather than inventing.&lt;ref&gt;Goytisolo 1981, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Tejada's work consisted of systematizing concepts falling into [[ontology]], [[anthropology]], [[logic]] and [[axiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Cigoña 1986, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; His original contribution was merging them into a complete system&lt;ref&gt;falling into 4 sections: saber jurídico común (commonly shared knowledge), saber técnico (juridical formulas), saber científico (systematic, specialized and verifiable knowledge) and saber filosófico (ultimate, permanent, invariable principles), Goytisolo 1981, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and introducing a set of own concepts. He is considered not a mere follower but a scholar who developed Thomist juridical philosophy, credited for attempting a synthesis with [[Existentialism|existentialist school]];&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 22, also Luis Legaz y Lacambra, ''Die Tendenzen der Rechtsphilosophie in Spanien in den letzten zehn Jahren'', [in:] ''Archiv fur Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie'' 45/4 (1959), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; some even view him as representative of legal [[Existentialist Christianity|Catholic Existentialism]], a definition not accepted universally.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Luño 2013, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted as the moving spirit behind emergence of Asociación Internacional de Iusnaturalistas Hispánicos "Felipe II".&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 20; now the institution is transformed into Consejo de Estudios Hispánicos "Felipe II", see its website available [https://consejofelipesegundo.wordpress.com/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, Tejada is acknowledged as the one who inspired a number of scholars, both in Spain and in wider Hispanic realm, though not all his proposals have been accepted by his followers.&lt;ref&gt;for discussion of controversies see Fernandez de la Cigoña 1986, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tejada the law resulted from God assuming a decisive role, but rendering it possible to find acceptable reasons for an objective-value-based human agency;&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Luño 2013, p. 8; the author classifies this view as Catholic Existentialism, though Tejada himself did not use the term&lt;/ref&gt; natural law stemmed from conjunction of divine power and human liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Goytisolo 1981, p. 113, Auso 2008, p. 16, Ayuso 1997, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was twofold: salvation and vocation,&lt;ref&gt;Estanislao Cantero, ''Sobre una interpretación de la definición del derecho de Elías de Tejada'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Elías de Tejada'' 2 (1996), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to justice in relations to God and security in relations to other people.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1996, p. 152-3&lt;/ref&gt; Though some scholars point to some confusion as to the terms used,&lt;ref&gt;for his ambiguous distinction if not indeed confusion of a law, a right and a norm see Cantero 1996, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; most agree that for Tejada law was "la norma política con contenido justo", colloquially described as where politics and ethics overlapped,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 21. According to Tejada, a law is political norm with ethical content, a 3-dimensional definition covering formal (norm), factual (politics) and axiologic (ethics) dimensions, Fernandez de la Cigoña 1986, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; a sovereign normative system related but clearly separate from religion.&lt;ref&gt;see opinions of Mariano Hurtado Bautista referred after Fernandez de la Cigoña 1986, pp. 197-205&lt;/ref&gt; Some students conclude that Tejada was close to normativism,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Puy, referred after Ayuso 2008, p. 16, Cantero 1996, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; others&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1996, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; find this suggestion too restrictive&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1996, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and claim that for him, law was far more than a norm.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1996, pp. 150-1, 157&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctive thread of his jurisprudential discourse was its application to vastly distinct cultural realms,&lt;ref&gt;starting with Spain, but covering also major European entities like Germany and England, smaller countries like Romania, Finland or Norway, Asian civilisations like Japan, Thailand or the Borneo tribes, and even the Soviet Union&lt;/ref&gt; though he attempted to sublimate a specific Hispanic natural law.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars flag lingering questions as to how general principles of law should be substituted by hispanic natural law, see Cantero 1996, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Tejada kept writing on theory of law throughout all of his academic career; his first contribution was published in 1942&lt;ref&gt;''Introducción al estudio de la ontología jurídica''&lt;/ref&gt; and his new pieces are being published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Relaciones entre política y derecho'', [in:] ''Verbo'', 461-462 (2008), pp. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt; Except two volumes of ''Historia de la filosofía del derecho y del Estado'' (1946), until the very late of his life Tejada’s works were mostly articles in specialized reviews, lectures delivered at jurisprudential conferences or compendium-like textbooks intended for students. Tejada's vastly erudite&lt;ref&gt;discussing over 800 authors, referred after Fernandez de la Mora 1989, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; opus magnum,&lt;ref&gt;considered also his single most important work of all, Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic in-depth lecture gathering all his ideas on law theory was ''Tratado de filosofia del derecho'', published in Seville in two volumes respectively in 1974 and 1977.&lt;ref&gt;its 4 main areas were ontologia jurídica, sociología jurídica, lógica jurídica and derecho natural, Ayuso 2008, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how many of his almost 400 works&lt;ref&gt;according to a dedicated bibliographical study - Consuelo Caballero Baruque, ''Francisco Elias de Tejada: bibliografia'', Perugia 1984 - Tejada wrote 278 books (libros, opúscolos y monografías) and authored or co-authored 374 works including minor ones, referred after Ayuso 1997, p. 15, also Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''La filosofía jurídica y política de Francisco Elías de Tejada'', Madrid 1994, {{ISBN|8460495728}}, p. 40.

As historian of political ideas Tejada clearly focused on broad Hispanic realm: he published studies on [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gerónimo Castillo de Bovadilla'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;''Las doctrinas políticas en la Cataluña medieval'' (1950), ''Historia del pensamiento político catalán'' (co-authored with Gabriella Pèrcopo, 1963-1965), ''Balmes en la tradición política de Cataluña'', [in:] ''El otro Balmes'', Sevilla 1974&lt;/ref&gt; [[Navarre]],&lt;ref&gt;''Navarra-España en los escritores navarros medievales'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 5/17 (1944), ''La literatura política en la Navarra medieval'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 17/63 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Señorío de Vizcaya hasta 1812'' (1963), ''La provincia de Guipúzcoa'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Extremadura,&lt;ref&gt;''Tres escritores extremeños: Micael de Carvajal, José Cascales Muñoz, José López Prudencio'' (1950), ''El concepto de lo extremeño. En la filosofia y en el arte'' (1949), ''Para una intepretación extremeña de Donoso Cortes'' (1944), ''José Cascales Muñoz, sociólogo extremeño del 98'', [in:] ''Revista de la Facultad de Derecho de Madrid'' 17 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]]&lt;ref&gt;''El concepto del Reino de Valencia'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;''La tradición gallega'' (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; produced works intended as synthetic accounts for Spain&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de la literatura política en las Españas'' (I-III, 1991), ''Las Españas. Formación histórica, tradiciones regionale''s (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;''Las doctrinas políticas en Portugal. Edad Media'' (1943), ''La Tradición portuguesa. Los orígenes 1140-1521'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated separate works to [[Franche-Comté]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Franco-Contado hispánico'' (1975), ''La Franche-Comté hispanique'', (1977), ''El pensamiento político del Franco-Contado de Borgoña'', [in:] ''Anales de la Universidad Hispalense'' 27 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sardinia]],&lt;ref&gt;''Cerdeña hispánica'' (1960), ''El pensamiento político del reino hispánico de Cerdeña'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Naples,&lt;ref&gt;''Nápoles hispánico'' (I-V, 1958-1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sicily]], [[Flanders]] and [[Malta]]&lt;ref&gt;referred after Cantero 1995, p. 145, Ayuso 2008, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on Hispanic [[Florida]], [[Texas]] and [[California]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese holdings in Africa and Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Philippines]], [[Chile]], [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;''As doctrinas políticas de Farías Bito'' (1952); ''Las doctrinas políticas de Raimundo Farías Bito'' (1953), ''José Pedro Galvão de Sousa en la cultura brasileña'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 221-222 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]]&lt;ref&gt;''El pensamiento político de los fundadores de Nueva Granada'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Latin America]] in general. However, his comparatistic zeal made him discuss history of political thought also beyond the [[Lusitanic]] and Hispanic realm, e.g. in [[England]], [[Arabic]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] traditions, [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Borneo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Tejada strove to reconstruct and define a Hispanic political tradition&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Bernardino Montejano, ''Las Españas Americanas seguñ Elías de Tejada'' (pp. 109-119), Clovis Lema García, ''As Espanhas Luso-Brasileiras'' (pp. 121-126), Silvio Vitale, ''La Napoli Ispanica'' (pp. 127-133), [all in:] Angel Sanchez de la Torre (ed.), ''Francisco Elías de Tejada. Figura y pensamiento'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|8486926890}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vacillated between the role of historian and theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of Hispanidad was based on the concept of Las Españas, seen as embodied in confederal political shape&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, pp. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; but its essence having been pre-state commonality.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on the [[unity in diversity]] recipé&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporating local traditions, including the [[fueros]],&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanic tradition consisted of two features: Catholic vision of life combined with missionary universalist spirit pursued by a federative monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, pp. 129, 141&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tejada Hispanidad was born in the Middle Ages, climaxed during the early [[Habsburg Spain|España de los Austrias]]&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, pp. 143, 145&lt;/ref&gt; and declined due to centralist French tradition imported by the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Borbones]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; His recurring subject&lt;ref&gt;more in Consuelo Martínez-Sicluna y Sepúlveda, ''La antinomia Europa-España según Elías de Tejada'', [in:] Angel Sanchez de la Torre (ed.), ''Francisco Elías de Tejada. Figura y pensamiento'', Madrid 1995 {{ISBN|8486926890}}, pp. 75-93&lt;/ref&gt; was confronting Hispanic and European traditions, the latter born out of anti-Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionary, modernist thought&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately responsible for breaking the Hispanic community by force.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, pp. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amtrack-82.jpg|thumbnail|160px|''Hispanidad: fighting the British'', [[Falkland Islands|11,600 km from Madrid]]]]
Tejada understood political thought as a vehicle of sustaining tradition&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and ignored the imperial and ethnic dimensions of Hispanidad. He viewed the Hispanic political community as forged by will of the people forming its components, not as a result of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, pp. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic features were merely means of transmitting heritage and a nation was defined as commonality of tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to positivist definitions focusing on features like language, geography, regime etc.;&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; it enabled implantation of Hispanidad in vastly different settings of the Philippines, [[Uruguay]] or Franche-Comté. Tejada saw the Hispanic tradition against a decisively [[Providentialism|providential]] background, e.g. when confronting [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]] or the [[New World]];&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; scholars saw this approach as indebted to the vision of [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, p. 147, Goytisolo 1981, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequently applied personal comparison was that to [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo]]: the two shared passion for Hispanic patrimony,&lt;ref&gt;Cuenca Toribio 1994, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; massive erudition, reconstructive profile and Traditionalist leaning;&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1995, pp. 123-4, Fernandez de la Mora 1989, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada’s approach is dubbed "menéndezpelayismo".&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 23. Indeed Tejada started reading Menendez at the age of 13, Cantero 1995, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Tejada's first work on history of political thought appeared in 1937&lt;ref&gt;''Notas para una teoría del Estado según nuestros autores clásicos, siglos XVI y XVII'' (1937), ''Ideas políticas de Ángel Ganivet'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; and the last ones in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''La Franche-Comté hispanique'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in case of theory of law, he did not produce a synthesis which would stand out; his thought is scattered across countless books, articles or minor opuscolos. Single works to be listed first are perhaps [[Case study|case studies]], the monumental&lt;ref&gt;and considered – after ''Tratado de Derecho'' – Tejada's second most important work, Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nápoles hispánico'' (1958-1964)&lt;ref&gt;spanning across 5 volumes and 2300 pages, co-authored with his wife and the result of 7 years spent on research mission in Naples&lt;/ref&gt; and an unfinished ''Historia del pensamiento político catalán'' (1963-1965).&lt;ref&gt;it was intended to cover 11 volumes; only 3 were published, 2 of them co-authored with his wife&lt;/ref&gt; Publications attempting more general overview to be named are ''La causa diferenciadora de las comunidades políticas'' (1943), ''Las Españas'' (1948) and ''Historia de la literatura política en las Españas'' (1952, published 1991).

Initially Tejada developed a Hispanidad-oriented&lt;ref&gt;a contemporary scholar notes that the young Tejada seemed determined to prove that even the works of Aristotle led straight to the caudillaje theory, though he paid particula attention to mounting it within a Hispanic tradition, Bartyzel 2015, pp. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caudillo|leadership theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Authoritarian leadership style|authoritarian state]];&lt;ref&gt;''La figura del Caudillo'' (1939), contributed to theoretical basis of Francoism and placed de Tejada in line with Juan Beneyto Pérez, Francisco Javier Conde García and Luis Legaz Lacambra, key law theorists of the early regime, Bartyzel 2015, p. 253, also Sergio Fernández Riquelme, ''Sociología, corporativismo y política social en España.

In the second stage (1941–1955), starting from a distinction between dictatorship and caudillaje, now equated only with rightful and traditional monarchy, he became a radical and intransigent opponent of General Franco’s personal dictatorship, calling it scornfully “Caudiland” and seeing the authoritarian regime as one of the forms of political modernism and totalitarianism, contrary to the Spanish and Catholic tradition. In the third stage (from 1955 to Franco’s death), while not changing his critical opinion of the regime and its leader, he tended to pursue a “possibilistic cultural policy” within the regime", Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] Marek Maciejewski, Tomasz Scheffler (eds.), ''Studia nad Autorytaryzmem i Totalitaryzmem'' 36/2 (2014), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and some advance rambling summaries.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "enmarcado dentro de la ideologia carlista, tradicional-conservadora y defensora del regimen del general Franco", ''Elías de Tejada, Francisco'' entry [in:] Gran Enciclopedia de España vol. 8, Madrid 1992, {{ISBN|8487544088}}, p. 3520&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars highlight 1938-1940 works and consider him „superfascista”,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Caballé, Arcadi Espada, ''Entrevista a Alonso de los Rios'', [in:] ''Boletin de la Unidad de Estudios Biograficos'' 3 (1998), p. 78; this opinion has also filtered out to popular discourse abroad, compare "Übereinstimmend mit ihren faschistischen Vorbildern, herrschte auch in der Falange das Führerprinzip. Die Partei verkörperte den Willen des Volkes, Franco brachte ihn zum Ausdruck. Seine Entscheidungen waren als "Quell der Souveränität" und "Wurzel irdischer Macht" unanfechtbar, wie der Rechtsphilosoph Francisco Elías de Tejada 1939 pathetisch ausführte", Carlos Collado Seidel, ''Der General, der Krieg und die Kirche'', [in:] ''Die Zeit'' 27.08.13&lt;/ref&gt; most students tend to downplay caudillaje-related writings&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. a theory that the caudillaje period of Tejada was brief and ambiguous, hence he can not be named theorist of caudillaje or nacional-sindicalismo, Ayuso 1997, p. 32; notably, starting early 1940s Tejada in private ironically referred to the Francoist Spain as "caudillandia", see Bartyzel 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing on the 1942-1978 period see Tejada as a Traditionalist;&lt;ref&gt;or more specifically, as a „Carlist Traditionalist”, Ayuso 1997, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; few advance an in-between option of "franquismo neotradicionalista".&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Novella, ''El pensamiento reaccionario español, 1812-1975: tradición y contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788497425483}}, pp. 248-9, esp. the chapter ''El franquismo tradicionalista: Elías de Tejada y Fernández de la Mora''&lt;/ref&gt; Among those supporting the Traditionalist tag many consider him "maximo representante del pensamiento tradicionalista español en la segunda mitad del siglo XX"&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Ramírez Jerez, ''La Biblioteca de D. Francisco Elías de Tejada'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 19 (2013), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; or at least one of the key ones,&lt;ref&gt;along Gambra, d’Ors and Canals, who elevated the Carlist doctrine to its highest levels just when the Carlist movement started to fall into profound crisis, Miguel Ayuso, ''El Carlismo y su signo'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 14 (2008) [furtherly referred as Ayuso 2008 (2)], p. 125; some commentators noticed that "[https://de.wikiquote.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel die Eule der Minerva beginnt erst mit der einbrechenden Dämmerung ihren Flug]"; there are scholars who think that "among the Carlist thinkers of the post-war period, the first place goes to Rafael Gambra", Adam Wielomski, ''Hiszpania Franco'', Biała Podlaska 2008, {{ISBN|8392158695}}, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; though some present him as a second-rank theorist.&lt;ref&gt;in a recent, 6,000-word encyclopaedic entry on Traditionalism, Elías de Tejada is treated marginally; paragraphs dedicated to the Francoist period highlight rather Rafael Calvo Serrer and other Juanista intellectuals. De Tejada is named representative of "tradicionalismo carlista", presented as a secondary thread accommodated within a broad scope of Calvo Serrer’s project. Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, pp. 1171-1172; similar perspective in Pedro Carlos Gonzalez Cuevas, ''El pensamiento político de la derecha española an el siglo XX'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9788430942237}}; Tejada is noted 4 times, Calvo Serrer is noted 8 times and Gonzalo Fernandez de la Mora 18 times&lt;/ref&gt;

Tejada perceived Traditionalism as a unique Spanish response&lt;ref&gt;other Catholic countries capable of developing own response failed to do so, Germany falling into Romantic speculativism, France disintegrating into post-revolutionary schemes and Poland pursuing independentist political illusion. Tejada clearly distinguished between Spanish traditionalism, rooted in history and religion, and European neotraditionalisms, as speculative and deprived of the godly and monarchical ingredient,Ayuso 2008 (2), p. 129-130, Ayuso 1997, pp. 26-27. European quasi-Traditionalism was created with anti-revolutionary intention, but deprived of religious and onthological ingredient and was a strategy rather than a system of thought, Joaquim Veríssimo Serrão, Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, ''La contrarrevolución legitimista, 1688-1876'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788489365155}}, pp 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1515-1648 rupture in European political thought;&lt;ref&gt;the rupture took place on 5 levels: the religious one of Luther, the moral one of Machiavelli, the political one of Bodin, the juridical one of Grocio and Hobbes and the administrative one of the Westphalia Treaty, Ayuso 2008 (2), p. 129, Ayuso 1997, p. 25, Cantero 1995, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; the latter afterwards degenerated into [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]], [[liberalism]], [[totalitarism]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently into secular, parliamentarian, free-market, nation-state&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 208; Tejada despised nation-states as born out of nationalisms, new movements not rooted in traditions, Ayuso 2008, pp. 17-18, 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal democracy|democracies]]. Traditionalism itself was politically best embodied&lt;ref&gt;Tejada clearly differentiated Traditionalism from Carlism, Ayuso 2008 (2), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; in Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;he considered Carlism the guardian and depositary of the Spanish tradition if not Traditionalism itself, Cantero 1995, p. 154. He also noted that "un tradicinalismo español sin carlismo se mueve en el orden de una consideración de la esencia sin la existencia", quoted after Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; Its essence was threefold. First, it consisted of Catholic unity;&lt;ref&gt;he deemed religion the key unifying factor of Hispanic realm, though unlike Gambra, d’Ors or Canals, he did not make it the primary and decisive topic, see Ayuso 2008 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars claim that Tejada was opposed to religious liberty,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; others maintain that he was opposed to equality of faiths and advocated a state-endorsed Catholic orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Elías de Tejada y Spinola Francisco'', [in:] ''legitymizm'' service, available [http://www.legitymizm.org/pef-elias-de-tejada-y-spinola here]. As a Catholic he remained deeply conservative, very uneasy with the Second Vatican Council and never reconciled with its outcome (Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 8, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Franciszek Elías de Tejada y Spínola - hidalgo, filozof, karlista''). Profoundly religious but not clerical, he commenced to assume anti-clerical shape following increasingly democratic and progressive stand of the Church – both global and Spanish (see his pun "Pablo Sexto – Mao Sexto", Bartyzel 2015, p. 241), or kept referring to Paul VI as "Montini" (Aquilino Duque, ''Menéndez Pelayo y la Universidad Internacional de Verano'', [in:] ''Fundacion Nacional Francisco Franco'' service, available [http://www.fnff.es/Menendez_Pelayo_y_la_Universidad_Internacional_de_Verano_795_c.htm here]). Invitation for him to join the Second Vatican Council has been issued, but for unclear reason has never reached him (Brocos Fernández 2005). Tejada was particularly hostile to the Christian-Democratic format of religion-inspired policy making, and allegedly developed hatred for its embodiment, Opus Dei, Javier Lavardin [José Antonio Parilla], ''Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de España'', Paris 1976, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Second, it embraced historical,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. rooted in local traditions and based on common historical identity. He kept claiming that peoples (pueblos) are traditions, not nations, and repeated after [[Enrique Gil Robles]] that there is no life beyond tradition, Ayuso 2008, pp. 17, Ayuso 1997, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[sociedalismo (theory)|social]],&lt;ref&gt;Tejada remained vehemently against the free-market idea, deemed born out of the liberal concept; instead he advocated a Christianity-guided state-exercised control, which would prevent excesses of exploitation and injustice, Cecotti 2005, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; accountable,&lt;ref&gt;by no means absolutist, monarchical rights were limited by traditionalist bodies and the laws of God, permitting deposition of a monarch who does not obey, Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 12, Ayuso 1997, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political representation|representative]],&lt;ref&gt;representation is to be channeled via traditional bodies and not by means of universal suffrage; all individuals were entitled to representation, but not as equals, Ayuso 1997, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuero|foral]],&lt;ref&gt;a fuero was considered an intrincic element of political order, embodying all traditional rights and forming organic part of the totality, as opposed to allegedly invented anthropologic abstractions and mechanicist politics fuelling revolutionary thought, Ayuso 1997, p. 27, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federation|federative]],&lt;ref&gt;distinctive pueblos are to be self-governed, united by the same faith and same monarch, Ayuso 2008 (2), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apostle (Christian)|missionary]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008 (2), p. 131; it is also referred to as "apostolic", i.e. exercising a mission with respect to other political entities&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organicism|organic]]&lt;ref&gt;i.e. society of societies, all separate components united in one integrity which does not infringe their plurality, commonality, autonomy, decentralisation, natural hierarchy, localisation and personalization, Ayuso 1997, p. 29; other scholars consider Tejada'a organicism a smoke-screen formula intended to disguise dictatorial nature of the Francoist regime, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 30, Evaristo Palomar Maldonado, ''La Monarquía Tradicional en el pensamiento de Elías de Tejada'', [in:] Angel Sanchez de la Torre (ed.), ''Francisco Elías de Tejada. Figura y pensamiento'', Madrid 1995 {{ISBN|8486926890}}, pp. 177-196, also Fernandez de la Cigoña 1996, p. 193; also "partidario de una Monarquia tradicional, [...] catolica, social, representativa y federativa, como alternativa al totalitarismo franquista", Gonzalez Cuevas 2005, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Third, it was based on a [[Subsidiarity|subsidiary state model]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Elías de Tejada y Spinola Francisco'', [in:] ''legitymizm'' service&lt;/ref&gt; The latter marked total reversal from original Tejada's penchant for omnipotent leadership&lt;ref&gt;he later lambasted "estatolatría hegeliana", Cuenca Toribio 1994, p. 371; in 1954 he criticised fascism and falangism as "modernist movement, confronting liberalism and marxism by means adopted from Renan, Sorel and finally, Hegel", quoted after Wielomski 2006, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected the Traditionalist logic of state serving society, society serving man, and man serving God. A de-centralized&lt;ref&gt;allegedly rooted in Catholic, Thomist and foralist inspirations, pitted against regalist, ontology-based and centralised designs, in theory of politics, see ''Fundación Elías de Tejada'' service available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/ here], Ayuso 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; withdrawn state,&lt;ref&gt;there is even a theory for Tejada state was a historic (i.e. not primordial, emergent in specific circumstances) concept with no given ideological content, Ayuso 1997, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; with is functions reduced, is to provide merely a framework for communities making it up, developed historically and safeguarded by separate legal establishments;&lt;ref&gt;far beyond a juridical concept, the fueros constituted a basis of organicismo and stod for de-centralization, self-government (named "autarquía"), and "less state more society" recipé, Ayuso 1997, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The communities in question are to be governed by autonomous intermediary bodies&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 207, Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 12, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; and should participate in state politics represented in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by delegates of various "gremios, hermandades, agrupaciones, cámaras, comunidades y cofradías";&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Mora 1989, p. 12, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada juxtaposed Spanish communitarian fueros&lt;ref&gt;by no means reducible to "regionalism", Ayuso 1997, p. 29; the question whether fuero was a law or a norm seems left open, see Cantero 1996, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; against the French individual liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the proposal advanced by Tejada was intended as a discussion how Spain should look like after Franco.&lt;ref&gt;Cuenca Toribio 1994, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RequeteViladot.JPG|thumbnail|160px]]
Tejada's works on theory of politics are visibly less numerous than those on theory of law or on history of political thought; moreover, some of them resemble political manifestos rather than scholarly writings. Preceded by caudillaje-oriented brochures of the late 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''La figura del Caudillo. Contribución al derecho público nacional-sindicalista'' (1939), ''El nuevo Estado nacional-sindicalista. Antecedentes y teoría, con un esbozo de una nueva teoría del Estado'' (1938), ''El pensamiento político de Falange Española y de las J.O.N.S.'' (1939, 1940)&lt;/ref&gt; the main body of his Traditionalism was laid out mostly in the 1950s, following activity in Academia Vazquez de Mella; its most complete and straightforward lecture was ''La monarquía tradicional'' (1954),&lt;ref&gt;published in Italy as ''La monarchia tradizionale'' (1966, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; though some, like ''El tradicionalismo político español'', remained in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;another title to be noted is ''Sacrum Imperium und überstaatliche Ordnung'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; The vision was further refined in details in the 1960s, especially during Congresses of Traditionalist Studies&lt;ref&gt;''Discurso inaugural del Primer Congreso de Estudios Tradicionalistas'' (1964), ''Discurso inaugural del Segundo Congreso de Estudios Tradicionalistas'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and systematically revisited in the early 1970s, mostly as result of political struggle taking place within Carlism: a lengthy manuscript was reduced into a manual-styled script - officially co-authored with [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad]] and [[:gl:Francisco Puy Muñoz|Francisco Puy Muñoz]]&lt;ref&gt;actual contribution of all 3 authors is not clear; some scholars claim that the document was written mostly by Tejada&lt;/ref&gt; - ''¿Qué es el carlismo?'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;co-athored with Gambra and Puy Muñoz (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; with late re-workings and compilations published either shortly before death or posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;''Decálogo del tradicionalismo español'' (manuscript, 1977), ''Europa, tradizione, libertà. Saggi di filosofia politica'' (2005), ''Poder y libertad. Una visión desde el tradicionalismo hispánico'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors maintain that there were no Carlist antecedents in the Tejada family;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Gambra, ''Elías de Tejada en el tradicionalismo político español'', [in:] Angel Sanchez de la Torre (ed.), ''Francisco Elías de Tejada. Figura y pensamiento'', Madrid 1995 {{ISBN|8486926890}}, p. 5, Bartyzel 2015, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; however, records reveal that a Justiniano Elías de Tejada,&lt;ref&gt;exact relation is unclear; he was probably either Francisco’s paternal grandfather or Francisco’s paternal grandfather’s brother&lt;/ref&gt; though initially opposing [[:es:Neocatólico|neo-Catholic]] designs in the 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;''La Discusión'' 24.04.64, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002308350&amp;page=3 here]; Tejada graduated in 1865, ''Datos Estadísticos'' 1865-1866, available [http://gredos.usal.es/jspui/bitstream/10366/84138/1/bg_revistas_1178_1-12_9.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1870s turned president of Junta Carlista de Castuera&lt;ref&gt;''La Esperanza'' 14.05.70, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002514931&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was even subject to jokes because of that.&lt;ref&gt;''El Solfeo'' 25.07.75, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004041841&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco himself claimed he had joined [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]] at the age of 15, remained a Carlist during his adolescence&lt;ref&gt;e.g. taking part in the massive Quintillo gathering of Andalusian Carlists, see also his ''Por qué fuí a Requete y porqué voy a Quintillo'', [in:] ''Fundación Ignacio Larramendi'' service, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/consulta/registro.cmd?id=1464 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1936 returned from Germany to enlist to the Nationalist army responding to the call of his king, [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]],&lt;ref&gt;according to himself "desde 1932, contando apenas quince años, milité en una de las dos organizaciones inspiradoras del Movimiento Nacional, la Comunión Tradicionalista, tomando parte activa en todas las luchas estudiantiles contra la Anti-España", quoted after Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; though he provided also conflicting or confusing accounts.&lt;ref&gt;which suggest that he had little to do with Carlism prior to 1936. Asked why he joined the Carlists, Tejada allegedly responded: "porque en el mapa político de España en 1936 el Requeté era la sola encarnación completa de la savia patria: el único movimiento que enarbolaba la bandera de las edades de oro de nuestros pueblos: las aspas rojas de sangre sobre el blanco teológico de la verdad católica. El Requeté era a secas España y yo soy español. Porque la amenaza europea y protestante contra las Españas sigue en pie: ejemplo, la vergonzosa actitud de las Europas "yankees" contra el hermano Portugal. Porque 1936 no fue más que un eslabón más en la larguísima cadena de nuestras luchas defendiendo la Cristiandad contra Europa: Pavía, Mühlberg, la Invencible, Nordlingen, Rocroy, el reparto de Utrecht, la ayuda inglesa al separatismo americano, el filibusterismo anglosajón del 98, la ayuda franco-inglesa a Negrín... Porque mientras las Españas sean el postrer reducto de la Cristiandad, los carlistas estaremos montando la guardia contra sus seculares enemigos", quoted after ''¿Por qué fue carlista Francisco Elías de Tejada?'', [in:] ''Reino Granada'' service 22.06.15, available [http://reinodegranada.blogspot.com/2015/06/por-que-fue-carlista-francisco-elias-de.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known about Tejada political activity during the Civil War and soon afterwards; though seconded to a [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangist]] unit,&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; he is not mentioned as engaged in Carlist, Falangist or other party structures until the early 1940s. However, his writings published in 1938-1939 clearly identified him as enthusiast of [[national syndicalism]] and the [[Caudillo|caudillaje]] system;&lt;ref&gt;''La figura del Caudillo. Contribución al derecho público nacional-sindicalista'' (1939), ''El nuevo Estado nacional-sindicalista. Antecedentes y teoría, con un esbozo de una nueva teoría del Estado'' (1938), ''El pensamiento político de Falange Española y de las J.O.N.S.'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; some consider him concerned primarily with justifying the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Caballé, Arcadi Espada, ''Entrevista a Alonso de los Rios'', [in:] ''Boletin de la Unidad de Estudios Biograficos'' 3 (1998), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted great juvenile admiration for [[Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;which he admitted himself many years afterwards as an error, Cecotti 2005, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second stay in Germany in 1940 that got him disillusioned with omnipotent state and [[One-party state|single party]]; his 1940 article discussing caudillaje was notably tuned down and introduced a cautious tone.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''Monarquía y caudillaje'', [in:] ''Revista de la Facultad de Derecho de Madrid'' 6-7 (1941), pp. 69-88, discussed at length in Bartyzel 2015, pp. 257-258&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s he was assuming an increasingly dissenting stance. In 1942 he referred to "misería" of the Francoist system;&lt;ref&gt;confronted with "grandeza" of its heroic origins; he advoated a new "alzamiento moral", Bartyzel 2015, p. 249; his authorship is not clear and attributed by Galarreta, see Manuel de Santa Cruz (ed.), ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español (1939-1966)'', vol. 4, Sevilla 1979, pp. 135-139&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he was briefly detained for opposing subscriptions to [[División Azul]].&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had no chance to publish writings lambasting the system as anti-Catholic tyranny,&lt;ref&gt;''Los principados carismáticos según los clásicos españoles'', ''El caudillaje es la tiranía anticatólica'' and ''Tríptico sobre las dictaduras'', Bartyzel 2015, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada made little secret of his views and in the Salamanca law faculty he voted against granting Franco doctorado honoris causa.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falangist]] hit-squad stormed into his house, dragged him to the nearby [[Retiro Park|Retiro park]] and left him beaten unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] ''Legitymizm'' service, available [http://www.legitymizm.org/tradycjonalizm-dyktatura here], also Idoia Estornes Zubizarreta, ''Francisco Elías de Tejada'', [in:] ''Aunamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/38106 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Duarte Nuno de Braganza.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Dom Duarte Nuno]]. 1945]]
In the mid 1940s Tejada again neared Carlism, at that time with no king, divided into few factions and politically bewildered. First commencing co-operation with their periodicals,&lt;ref&gt;in 1942 with ''La Misión''. Bartyzel 2015, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; in the Madrid cafes he mixed with Carlists of different persuasions, including the pro-collaborationist [[Carloctavismo|Carloctavistas]]&lt;ref&gt;Brocos Fernández 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the intransigent orthodox [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Javieristas]]; he also took part in their minor public manifestations against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;with the three Hernando Larramendi brothers, two Zabala brothers, Rafael Gambra, Fernando Polo, Pueyo Alvarez, González Quevedo, Amancio Portabales, Luis Ortiz y Estrada, Luis Alonso, Rafael Lluys and others; their demonstrations included e.g. not raising a hand in the Francoist salute when standing in the crowd saluting Franco during football matches in Madrid, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In unspecified circumstances, though most likely acting in agreement if not on request of the then Carlist political leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]], Tejada ventured to co-organize a semi-official Traditionalist cultural network, which materialized as the Madrid Academia Vázquez de Mella; in the late 1940s he was among its most active lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; Now openly confronting the regime and in 1947 advocating a "no" vote in the [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|Ley de Sucesión referendum]],&lt;ref&gt;Tejada ridiculed the referendum it in his mock ''Hoja Oficial del Lunes'', referred after Manuel de Santa Cruz (ed.), ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español (1939-1966)'', vol. 9, Sevilla 1981, pp. 124-129, referred after Bartyzel 2015, pp. 261-2&lt;/ref&gt; politically Tejada avoided clear identification with any of the Carlist groupings. He seemed closest to supporters of [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Dom Duarte Nuño de Braganza]] as a potential Carlist heir;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias: el carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997, {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, p. 13. One of possible readings of the Carlist succession theory was that in case all male descendant branches are either extinguished or excluded from the throne, hereditary rights might be passed to the oldest daughter of the last king. While some Carlists applied this reading to the oldest daughter of Carlos VII, the others - including Tejada - applied it to the oldest daughter of Felipe V as the last king ruling all Spains, and successively to her last legitimate male descendant, Don Duarte, [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. XXX, Sevilla 1979, pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; according to other sources he merely considered the Portuguese claimant a viable candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The period of vacillation ended in 1950, when Tejada aligned with the Javieristas&lt;ref&gt;though Tejada claimed he was not a politician and did not make politics, Cantero 1995, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted seat in their national executive, in 1951 nominated by Don Javier commissioner of Comunión Tradicionalista external affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist: ''Javierista'' (1950-1962)==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
In the early 1950s Tejada got firmly engaged in mainstream Carlism and demonstrated an uncompromising political stand. He lambasted the dissenting Carloctavistas,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in his manifesto intended for Frente Nacional Carlista, in which using his erudition he argued against dynastical claim of Carlos Pio, styled as Carlos VIII, Ayuso 1994, p. 335, Bartyzel 2015, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; complained to Fal about permissive, increasingly [[Christian democracy|Christian-Democratic]] profile of a semi-official Carlist daily ''Informaciones'',&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated that Don Javier goes bold by terminating the long overdue [[regency]]. He co-drafted ''Declaración de Barcelona'', the statement which was issued by Don Javier in 1952 and which indeed announced his own claim to the Carlist throne,&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''El papel del carlismo navarro en el inicio de la fragmentación definitiva de la comunión tradicionalista (1957-1960)'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 72 (2011), p. 395, Lavardin 1976, pp. 145-6&lt;/ref&gt; though the episode is not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim he did not father the ''Declaración'', Bartyzel 2015, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; With the 1954 publication of ''La monarquía tradicional'' Tejada became the top Carlist theorist; the same year within the party top body, Junta Nacional, he formed part of Comisión de Cultura y Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;the comisión was led by José María Valiente and was divided into 2 sub-commissions; Tejada led the one of culture, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he was considered among key politicians of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;according to Gambra, Fernandez de la Cigoña 1996, p. 191. Similar impression might be gained in Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1955 Fal Conde was released from Jefatura and when Carlism abandoned intransigent opposition to the regime in favor of cautious co-operation, Tejada was left puzzled.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim that in mid-1950s Tejada considered intransigent position of Fal a mistake and advocated cautious opening towards Francoism, Bartyzel 2015, p. 263; others note that he voiced against collaborationist stand of Valiente, Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''El nuevo rumbo político del carlismo hacia la colaboración con el régimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 69 (2009), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He did not hesitate to voice his doubts about collaboratice strategy advocated by the new leader [[José María Valiente Soriano|Jose Maria Valiente]],&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2009, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; yet he decided to comply and accepted appointment to the newly formed Secretariat;&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, at one point he suggested that the body be dissolved as ineffective and replaced by Valiente's personal jefatura.&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Executing the rapprochement policy&lt;ref&gt;he advocated traditionalist monarchy as the only viable longtime option using his personal contacts, e.g. in 1956 talking with Jesús Salas, then vice-secretary of Movimiento, Vázquez de Prada 2009, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; he did not believe in its success and was getting increasingly frustrated by [[Francisco Franco|Franco’s]] rejection of the Carlist offer.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 432. In 1959 he was fined 30,000 ptas by the civil governor of Huelva for organizing a conference deemed hostile to the regime, Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, he readily engaged in new formats of activity, now permitted by the regime: Tejada was active in the Carlist publishing house&lt;ref&gt;''El profesor Francisco Elias de Tejada y Spinola'', [in:] ''Fundacion Elias de Tejada'' service, available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ediciones Montejurra&lt;ref&gt;some claim that he co-founded Ediciones Montejurra, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] ''Legitymizm service'', available [http://www.legitymizm.org/tradycjonalizm-dyktatura here], the same opinion in Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and became its director,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he is listed as such in Melchor Ferrer, ''Breve historia del legitimismo español'', issued by Ediciones Montejurra in 1958, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; animated the elitist Traditionalist periodical ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref&gt;''El profesor Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spinola'', [in:] ''Fundación Elias de Tejada'' service, available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to new periodicals like ''Azada y Asta''&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and especially threw himself into organizing Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist institutional network.&lt;ref&gt;see Manuel de Santa Cruz (ed.), ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español (1939-1966)'', vol. 20, Madrid 1989, pp. 119-124, 274-284; de Tejada soon developed doubts about perceived Opus Dei influence in the Circulos, which led some Carlists politicians, e.g. Zamanillo, to believe that he was biased against the network, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 he entered Comision de Cultura of the Carlist executive&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated setting up an "Instituto de Estudios Jurídicos".&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]], 1960]]
Having moved on longtime scientific research mission to Italy, at the turn of the decades Tejada was getting increasingly detached from daily Carlist politics. Within the Secretariat and numerous cultural outposts&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the early 1960s taking part in Semanas de Estudios Tradicionalistas, organized by Sección Universitaria of AET, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; he was somewhat sidetracked by a new breed of young activists forming the entourage of prince [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Though he knew some, especially their leader [[Ramón Massó Tarruella|Ramón Massó]], from the Academia Vázquez de Mella years of the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 382, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos.: La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada developed grave doubts about Carlist orthodoxy and genuine intentions of the hugocarlistas,&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Hugo and his supporters from the onset – though only among themselves - considered Tejada a rotten reactionary, admitting that only the fuerista thread in his writings was worth considering, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 412, Martorell Pérez 2014, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; suspecting them of pursuing a hidden agenda.&lt;ref&gt;though initially Tejada could have not properly identified their political profile; in 1961 he issued a warning against Christian-Democratic opusdeistas (Massó was engaged in Opus Dei), subversively active in Traditionalism, Bartyzel 2015, p. 251; for his doubts about Opus and Masso see also Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 121-123&lt;/ref&gt; Co-operation deteriorated into crisis and then open conflict in the early 1960s, when Don Carlos Hugo started to sidetrack most hard-line Traditionalists. Tejada did not illude himself about Don Javier potentially confronting his progressist son,&lt;ref&gt;in the late 1950s Tejada had some hope in Don Javier, e.g. he addressed him with a letter, pointing that a semi-official Carlist daily ''Informaciones'' was promoting men of the Left; by that he meant Chrtistian-Democrats aligned with the Paul Lesourd; some scholars claim that the ''Informaciónes'' issues largely contributed to Tejada leaving Don Javier in the early 1960s, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 1962&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to break with the Borbón-Parmas;&lt;ref&gt;some say that after expulsion of Zamanillo, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 187, Bartyzel 2015, p. 265. One author claims that the key motive behind de Tejada's departure was not his suspicion of socialist, subversive leanings of Carlos Hugo, but rather suspicions that he and Don Javier became pawns of the Opus Dei, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; some authors claim that he was expulsed.&lt;ref&gt;in December 1962, see Lavardin 1976, p. 145; other claim that following de Tejadas venomous press articles aimed against "monsieur Hugues de Bourbon-Busset" Masso and his entourage indeed intended to expulse de Tejada, but they do not specify whether the expulsion indeed took place, Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; He declared to Don Carlos Hugo that he could not make him king, but could prevent him from becoming one.&lt;ref&gt;"yo no tengo poder para hacerle Rey de Espańa, pero puedo hacer que no lo sea", quoted after Brocos Fernández 2005; the same author underlines a personal thread, suggesting that Tejada turned against Don Carlos Hugo during gear-up to his audience with Franco; allegedly Tejada felt offended that though he was initially to accompany the prince, he was eventually replaced by Alvaro d’Ors. The same version is repeated in Lavardin 1976, p. 146; the author presents Tejada as highly extravagant and unpredictable figure. Similar, though not bold portrait presenting Tejada as "apasionamente impulsivo" in Francisco de las Heras y Borreo, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Tejada already referred to Don Carlos Hugo as "este aventurero francés de sangre bastarda".&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 184. The insult is related to a long-standing controversy related to aristocratic standing of the Bourbon-Busset family, it is the family of Don Carlos Hugo's mother. According to a long-repeated version, the branch was set up by illegitimate child of [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the breakup Tejada did not join any Carlist faction, though he was reportedly sympathetic to [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|RENACE]]: he liked its format of depositary of Traditionalist values with no support for any specific claimant.&lt;ref&gt;José Fermín Garralda Arizcun, ''Miguel Ayuso Torres, La filosofía jurídica y política de Francisco Elías de Tejada'' [review], [in:] Verbo 5 (1995), p. 197, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo. Dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788420639475}}, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked on building a network of institutions marketing orthodox Traditionalism. In 1963 he co-founded the Madrid-based Centro de Estudios Históricos y Políticos General Zumalacárregui;&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 176, Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; though officially affiliated with Secretariado General de Movimiento Nacional,&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] ''Legitymizm'' service&lt;/ref&gt; it was intended as a Carlist think-tank.&lt;ref&gt;''El profesor Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spinola'', [in:] ''Fundación Elias de Tejada'' service, available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/ here], Ayuso 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Its activity climaxed in two Congresos de Estudios Tradicionalistas, staged in 1964 and 1968;&lt;ref&gt;''El profesor Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spinola'', [in:] ''Fundación Elias de Tejada'' service, Ayuso 2008, p. 20, Brocos Fernández 2005, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] ''Legitymizm'' service&lt;/ref&gt; Centro issued also periodicals and organized so-called Jornadas Forales across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 1960s Tejada emerged as chief ideologue of [[Juntas de Defensa del Carlismo]], network mushrooming across the country and united by opposition to hugocarlismo;&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 172, Canal 2000, p. 364, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; he also contributed to launch of a new periodical, ''Siempre''.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1960s Tejada was firmly established among leaders of loosely organized&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; followers of orthodox Traditionalism;&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; his activity was increasingly leaning towards vague dynastical compromise,&lt;ref&gt;sort of a new "compromiso de Caspe", Bartyzel 2015, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; intended to block the Borbón-Parmas;&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy led him close to Carloctavistas and [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Sivattistas]].&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he supported [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|referendum on Ley Organica]], considering it a stepping stone towards a Traditionalist ideal;&lt;ref&gt;and closing the door on French constitutionalism, Santa Cruz 1989, pp. 119-124, 274-284, referred after Bartyzel 2015, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; despite this, some scholars dub him "isolated anti-regime sniper".&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo-Linares 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Franco, always keen to exploit differences, received Tejada to discuss the monarchical question; during their only personal meeting,&lt;ref&gt;though Tejada also met the dictator during larger receptions, e.g. on February 22, 1961, when Franco received Junta Nacional of Circulos Culturales Vazquez de Mella, Lavardin 1976, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; the dictator was treated to legitimist discourse reverting to the Braganza solution.&lt;ref&gt;"lo que como carlista y como jurista sostengo, tuve el honor de exponerlo de palabra a S.E. el Jefé del Estado el 20 marzo de 1968, única ocasión en que mereci hablar a solo con S.E. Puesto que entonces lo razoné ante tan altísima autoridad, no voy a repetir aquá mi tesis de que jurídicamente la legitimidad española paréceme ir per S.M. el señor duque de Braganza y sus descendientes", ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' 01.03.73, quoted after Heras y Borreo 2004, p. 42, also Bartyzel 2015, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The turn of the decades spelled a political disaster for Tejada: the [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Alfonsist pretender]] was nominated as the future king and Carlism was firmly taken over by the hugocarlistas. On the official front, in 1972 he was trialed for anti-government remarks.&lt;ref&gt;stating that "autoridad que se aparta de la ley no merece consideración de autoridad", Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On the Carlist front, his 1971 last-minute doctrinal summary, ''¿Qué es el carlismo?'',&lt;ref&gt;published jointly with Rafael Gambra and Francisco Puy Muñoz, full digital version available [http://www.carlismo.es/librosElectronicos/queeselcarlismo.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; made the Traditionalist position crystal clear, but failed to prevent transformation of Javierismo into the socialist-dominated [[Partido Carlista]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; During last years of Francoism he witnessed and indeed contributed to increasing decomposition of Traditionalism. In 1972 he was skeptical about launching an anti-hugocarlista organization on the [[Requeté]] basis&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 231-2, the organization materialized as Hermandad de Maestrazgo&lt;/ref&gt; and ridiculed its leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Tejada mocked Ramón Forcadell as "ridiculo tigre", an ironic reference to Cabrera as "Tigre de Maestrazgo", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; attracting some criticism in return.&lt;ref&gt;some Traditionalists did not like Tejada as the one who "sabe tirar la piedra y esconder la mano", a reference to him not appearing at a meeting intended to launch organization which later materialized as Hermandad de Maestrazgo&lt;/ref&gt; However, he engaged in another anti-hugocarlista initiative, Real Tercio de Requetés de Castilla, and neared the youngest of the Borbón-Parmas, [[Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Don Sixto]], considered even his intellectual mentor.&lt;ref&gt;opinion of Fal Conde, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 he accepted Don Sixto as royal leader, though neither as a claimant nor regent but as a vaguely styled "abanderado de la Tradición".&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:ULL.19.84.11.jpg|thumbnail|left|Fundación Elías de Tejada logo]]
In the post-war Spain Tejada gained prominence principally as a theorist of law; present day scholars either suggest that Francoist setting provided a favorable background for domination of iusnaturalismo against other schools,&lt;ref&gt;"it would clearly be an overstatement to sustain that the political regime established in Spain by Franco after the Civil War pretended to support a “revival” of the Spanish Natural Law Classics. It is obvious that the so-called Movimiento Nacional (National Movement) had to address more urgent issues, culture not being among their primary concerns. Nevertheless, peculiar circumstances explain a favourable context for an invocation and manipulation of the Salamanca School as it had never been known before", Pérez Luño 2013, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; or bluntly claim that Neoescolástica was the regime’s means of auto-legitimization,&lt;ref&gt;by claiming that freedom is "una opción subjetiva entre premisas puestas objetivamente por Dios para cada caso concreto" it presented the Francoist regime and its limitations as determined by supreme order, Josefa Dolores Ruiz Resa, ''Los derechos de los trabajadores en el franquismo'', Madrid 2015, {{ISBN|9788490852064}}, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; enforced and disguised as "pluralism".&lt;ref&gt;the only systems allowed were Neoescolástica, pursuing a dogmatic Catholic line, and Existentialism, which might or might have not contained a Catholic thread, Ruiz Resa 2015, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; His writings on history of political thought were appreciated if could have been presented as picturing the regime as ultimate climax of Hispanic tradition, while Traditionalist theory of politics – acceptable in the 1950s – when assuming a decisively Carlist flavor was clearly unwelcome in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1972 Tejada was trialed for arguing that "autoridad que se aparta de la ley no merece consideración de autoridad", Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the [[Spanish transition to democracy|Second Restoration]]&lt;ref&gt;Tejada preferred this name to "transición", Ferrnandez de la Mora 1989, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Tejada's opus went dramatically out of fashion; already by the end of his life he was invoked in the press as a ridiculous fanatic who did not even merit a response,&lt;ref&gt;see the letter of Juan Cabre Cires, ''La Vanguardia'' 05.10.76, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1976/11/02/pagina-34/33620510/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; while later – among occasional courteous references&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 20.04.84, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1982/04/20/044.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; – he was venomously denounced as "distinguida personalidad del franquismo".&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 06.06.97, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1995/05/06/pagina-45/34635826/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Gabriella Pèrcopo co-founded Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada,&lt;ref&gt;''Quiénes somos'', [in:] ''Fundación Elías de Tejada'' service, available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/quienes-somos/la-fundacion/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; which pays tribute&lt;ref&gt;by means of reprinting his works, publishing related books, issuing annuals and irregularly conferring Premio Francisco Elías de Tejada, awarded e.g. to Estanislao Cantero, ''Francisco José Fernández de la Cigoña, Antonio de Capmany (1742-1812).

In principle RACMYP accepts only full donations; as Tejada's widow was unwilling to cede ownership, it took complex negotiations to get the deal closed, Ramírez Jerez 2013, pp. 207-210&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1977 Tejada lamented that Spanish universities were becoming mimetic replicas of the European ones;&lt;ref&gt;he noted that "nuestra universidad es la que corresponde a unas gentes que han perdido su identidad de patria", ''ABC'' 27.07.77, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/blanco.y.negro/1977/07/27/067.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; some claim that indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s Traditionalism as scientific school was almost entirely eradicated from Spanish academic realm,&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 1995, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; though they also point to a number of active scholars&lt;ref&gt;brief list of PhD hopefuls he supervised in Salamanca and currently active in José Barrientos García, ''Francisco de Vitoria y la facultad de teología de la Universidad de Salamanca'', [in:] Vinvent S.

The key one is a monograph by [[:es:Miguel Ayuso|Miguel Ayuso]] (1994);&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''La filosofía jurídica y política de Francisco Elías de Tejada'', Madrid 1994, {{ISBN|9788460495727}}; by some reviewers the book is considered "la obra definitiva sobre la obra de Francisco Elías de Tejada", Cristián Garay Vera, ''Miguel Ayuso Torres, La filosofía jurídica y política de Francisco Elías de Tejada'' [review], [in:] ''Revista chilena de derecho'' 21/1 (1994), p. 210; other reviewers, though also enthusiastic remain a bit more restrained, praising "elevado valor científico", Cuenca Toribio 1994, p. 375 or claiming that "la investigadón que el dr. Ayuso nos presenta es digna de aplauso", Garralda Arizcun 1995, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; apart from three other volumes,&lt;ref&gt;a bibliography - Consuelo Caballero Baruque, ''Francisco Elias de Tejada: bibliografia'', Perugia 1984, and two joint works, ''Francisco Elías de Tejada (1917-1977 [sic!]). El hombre y la Obra'', Madrid 1989; and Angel Sanchez de la Torre (ed.), ''Francisco Elias de Tejada. Figura y pensamiento'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|8486926890}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining titles are articles fathered mostly by his followers and published in specialized reviews.&lt;ref&gt;by, among others, Julieta Amaro Marques, Miguel Ayuso Torres, Pablo Badillo O’Farrel, Jacek Bartyzel, Consuelo Caballero Baruque, Estanislao Cantero Núñez, Daniela Capaccio, Samuele Cecotti, Julio Cienfuegos Linares, José Manuel Cuenca Toribio, Gonzalo Díaz Díaz,  Idoia Estornes Zubizarreta, Giovanni Ferracuti, Manuel Fernández de Escalante, Rafael Gambra, Francesco M.

General assessment of Tejada's scholarly standing seems far from agreed. Some point to his massive production&lt;ref&gt;at times published in distant places, mostly in Latin America, Ayuso 1997, p. 15, Ayuso 1994, p. 40, Ayuso 1997, pp. 15-16; apart from Italian, few translations were recorded&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that having been among greatest intellectuals of his time&lt;ref&gt;"one of the leading figures of university and cultural life of Spain in the 20th century" - Cuenca Toribio 1994, p. 375, "más preclara inteligencia de la Filosofía española del Derecho en este siglo, y una de las cumbres del pensamiento iusfilosóficq en toda la historia de la península" - Gonzalo Ibáñez Santamaría, ''El Mercurio dé Santiago de Chile'' 02.04.78, quoted after Goytisolo 1981, p. 105, "una de las figuras más eminentes del iusnaturalismo europeo del pasado siglo" - Vázquez de Prada 2011, p. 395, great humanist, moving spirit of an entire school, mecenas and inspirator - Garralda Arizcun 1995, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; he led a school of his own,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; building a holistic "sistema tejadiano"&lt;ref&gt;Cecotti 2005, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; or "pensamiento tejadiano".&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Cigoña 1996,p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider him either mostly a law theorist&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez de la Cigoña 1996, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; or mostly a student of Hispanidad.&lt;ref&gt;Cantero 1996, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; His followers point also to his charming personality&lt;ref&gt;according to Gambra he was a combination of Athene and Dionisos, referred after Bartyzel 2015, p. 241. The list of his features includes "descuidado, bohemio, torrencial, extrovertido, abierto, vehemente, generoso, inexorable, radical, noble, agresivo, despreocupado, alegre, religioso, creyente, austero, enciclopédico, cáustico, atrabiliario, original, fogoso, ingenuo, portentoso viajero, polígloto asombroso, involvidable narrador, magnánimo, dispuesto, apasionado, cordial, vital, español, terco, infatigable trabajdor, intransigente, talentoso, bondadoso por encima de las cóleras y de un cieto humor grueso, limpio de ánimo, estudioso, curioso, sensible, agudo, firme, indoblegable, patriota. En resumen, un monstruo, un genio, un superman", Ayuso 1997, p. 15, similar comments in Fernandez de la Mora 1989, pp. 7-8, Goytisolo 1981, p. 107. His only addictions were travelling - ''El profesor Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spinola'', [in:] ''Fundación Elias de Tejada'' service – and languages, as Tejada mastered 12 tongues and learnt to some extent further 26, Bartyzel 2015, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledging massive erudition, call him a genius monster.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 1997, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that he was a little-minded, vindictive,&lt;ref&gt;the point advanced by Eusebio Fernández García, ''Las tareas y la Filosofía del Derecho de Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola'', [in:] Adela Mora Cañada (ed.), ''La enseñanza del derecho en el siglo XX'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|849772318X}}, pp. 192-205; the author presents Tejada as biased servant of the regime, persecuting his own colleagues; "una de las personas que fueron víctimas de la persecución de Francisco Elías de Tejada fue Elías Díaz" (pp. 194-5), the opinion based on Elías Díaz, ''Un itinerario intelectual de filosofía jurídica y política'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788497421485}}, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; impossible to deal with bigot of an overgrown ego,&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo 2015&lt;/ref&gt; his career enabled by anti-democratic nature of the Francoist regime,&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz Resa 2015, pp. 415, 436; Anna Caballé, Arcadi Espada, ''Entrevista a Alonso de los Rios'', [in:] ''Boletin de la Unidad de Estudios Biograficos'' 3 (1998), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; dubbed "reaccionario"&lt;ref&gt;"autor reaccionario" - Antoni Jutglar, ''Introducción al "Manifiesto del Partido Comunista", y otros escritos'', Madrid 1984, {{ISBN|9788485887460}}, p. 93, "pensamiento reaccionario" - Ramón Cotarelo, ''Las ciencias sociales en España: historia inmediata, crítica y perspectivas'', Madrid 1992, {{ISBN|9788474914887}}, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and the passion of his life, "tradición española", referred to as "ni es tradición ni es española".&lt;ref&gt;Manuel-Reyes Mate Rupérez, ''Pensamientos a media luz'', [in:] ''El País'' 16.07.88&lt;/ref&gt; In the compromise version, he is either presented as notable but second-rate representative of Traditionalism&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas 2008, pp. 1171-1172&lt;/ref&gt; or as an erudite eminent for some of his case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1998, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of ''Oncogenes, Aneuploidy, and AIDS'' ({{ISBN|1556435312}}), a book about the scientific life of fellow molecular biologist and AIDS sceptic [[Peter Duesberg]], with special emphasis on Duesberg's version of the [[aneuploidy]] theory of cancer, on Duesberg's HIV/AIDS scepticism, and on the politics of modern science.

==Later career==
Bialy's CV indicates that he was the co-recipient of a grant from the Charles Merill Trust to study [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] pathogens in Nigeria in 1978. He received a [[World Health Organization]] grant to study the [[epidemiology]] and genetics of antibiotic resistant enteric pathogens in Nigeria in 1982. He worked as a visiting researcher or research fellow at several universities in the United States and Africa throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He was advisor to the Center for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering in Havana, Cuba from 1986–1996.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/&gt;

The '''Indian spin quartet''' is the collective name given to the [[India national cricket team|Indian]] [[spin bowler]]s of the 1960s and 1970s: [[E. A. S. Prasanna|Erapalli Prasanna]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]] (both [[off spin]]ners), [[Bhagwat Chandrasekhar]] (a [[leg spin]]ner), and [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] (a [[left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm spinner]]). Between them, they played 231 [[Test cricket|Test matches]], taking 853 wickets. They were one of the most deadly combinations in world cricket, especially on the dusty subcontinental pitches.

The spin quartet was instrumental in producing many Indian [[Test cricket|Test]] victories. There was only one match in which all four of them were in the starting XI: usually one of the off spinners, Prasanna or Venkataraghavan, was left out. However, these four men made important contributions to some of India's greatest triumphs, including Test series victories in the West Indies and [[England cricket team|England]], as well as Test victories in [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].

In 2004, the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] conferred on them the [[CK Nayudu]] award, named after India's first Test captain.

==Beginnings==
By the 1966-67 season, the interest in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain [[Nawab of Pataudi, jun|Nawab of Pataudi]] thought that it would be a good idea to introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The birth of a spin quartet, ESPNCricinfo: http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/122156.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Scorecard, 3rd Test, India vs England, Birmingham, 1967: http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63006.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.

==Successes==
Over the years, the spin quartet played vital roles in several memorable victories for the Indian team, starting with an overseas series win against New Zealand in 1967-68. Some of the major Test successes spin quartet were a part, are as follows
* [[Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 1967–68|Away series victory against New Zealand, 1967-68]]
* [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1970–71|Away series victory against West Indies, 1970-71]]
* [[Indian cricket team in England in 1971|Away series victory against England, 1971]]
* [[English cricket team in India in 1972–73|Home series victory against England, 1972-73]]
* [[New Zealand cricket team in India in 1976–77|Home series victory against New Zealand, 1976-77]]
* [[West Indian cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1978–79|Home series victory against West Indies, 1978–79]]
* [[Australian cricket team in India in 1979-80|Home series victory against Australia, 1979-80]]
* [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 1979-80|Home series victory against Pakistan, 1979-80]]
* [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1980–81|Drawn away series against Australia, 1980-81]]
* [[English cricket team in India in 1981-82|Home series victory against England, 1981-82]]
Out of the four, only Venkataraghavan and Bedi played regular one-day cricket for India. Prasanna never played [[One Day International|ODIs]], and Chandrasekhar played just one game, against New Zealand in 1976. Bedi and Venkatarghavan played in 10 ODIs together, which included the World Cups of [[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]] and [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]].

==Statistics==
The spin quartet played a combined 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls.&lt;ref&gt;Hall of Fame- The Spin Quartet, Indian Cricket Fever:  http://www.cricketnetwork.co.uk/main/s119/st25857.php&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this success can be attributed to the different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler whereas Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This way, they could target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were the leaders of the attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling records, Test matches- Bishen Bedi and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar: http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;player_involve=1219;player_involve=1290;player_involve_type=all;template=results;type=bowling&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">[[Engineer's degree|Ing]] '''Jaroslav Mareš''' (born 28 December 1937 in [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) is a Czech [[biologist]], [[wiktionary:traveller|traveller]] and [[writer]].

He graduated from The University of Economics in [[Prague]], getting a degree of Ing (he studied international business). He worked for [[Czech Airlines|ČSA]] in [[Iran]] and later in [[Canada]]. He has visited 85 countries and organised several expeditions for research of [[cryptids]], such as [[Kongamato]] (for this he was offered the membership of the [[International Society for Cryptozoology]] which he accepted), [[Nandi Bear]], [[Megalania prisca]], [[Bigfoot]], [[Yeti]], [[Nessie]], [[Ogopogo]], [[Champ (cryptozoology)|Champ]], [[Megalodon]], [[Lusca]], Ambazombi and others. In 1978 he organised an expedition to the [[tepui]] which probably inspired [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] for writing [[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]] (a book based on stories told to Doyle by [[Colonel]] [[Percy Fawcett]]).

He also studies [[dinosaur]]s (he visited most of the famous [[fossil]] sites, such as [[Nemegt Formation|Nemegt]] in [[Mongolia]], [[Tendaguru]] in [[Tanzania]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] in [[Alberta]], and other localities in [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Montana]] and [[Patagonia]]) and corresponds with the world-leading [[palaeontologists]]. Another field of his interest is [[shamanism]].

In 1976 he discovered and later scientifically described the world's strongest [[carnivorous]] [[beetle]], ''Manticora imperator'', of the [[tiger beetle]] group. He became a specialist in this group of beetles and later described three more [[species]].

He has published seventeen [[books]] and numerous [[magazine]] [[Article (publishing)|articles]].

'''Judith Munk''' (April 10, 1925 – May 19, 2006) was an American artist and designer associated with [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. She was inducted into the [[San Diego Women's Hall of Fame]] posthumously, in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Judith Kendall Horton was born in 1925, in [[San Gabriel, California]]. Her parents were Winter Davis Horton and Edith Kendall Horton. The actor [[Edward Everett Horton]] was her uncle.&lt;ref&gt;"'Brazil' Booked Two Days at Geitner" ''Dunkirk Evening Observer'' (February 17, 1945): 5. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton attended [[Bennington College]] and earned degrees in art and architecture, with [[Richard Neutra]] as a mentor. She had just begun graduate studies at [[Harvard University]] School of Design when she became ill with [[poliomyelitis]], and left to recover at the home of her maternal grandmother in San Diego. She studied with sculptor [[Donal Hord]] instead of returning to Harvard.&lt;ref name="Aguilera"&gt;Mario Aguilera, [http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/general/jmunkobit.asp "Obituary Notice: Judith Munk, Friend and Artistic Influence"] ''UCSD News'' (May 24, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; She used a wheelchair for much of her adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Williams, [http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20060525/news_1m25munk.html "Judith Munk, 81, Influenced Scripps Campus Planning"] ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' (May 25, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Judith Horton worked as an illustrator and model builder at the Scripps Aquarium as a young woman.&lt;ref&gt;J. Baylor Roberts, [http://vintagenational.tumblr.com/post/30390966755/ektachrome-by-j-baylor-roberts-from-la-jolla "An Artist Fashions Replicas of Strange Sea Dwellers"] a photograph accompanying "La Jolla, a Gem of the California Coast" ''National Geographic'' (December 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; After marriage, she worked mainly in sculpture and architectural design in the nearby community.&lt;ref&gt;Helen M. Rozwadowski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0sCBGo1DEC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;ots=_tHi2E0Hod&amp;dq=Mrs.%20Munk%20Scripps&amp;pg=PA338#v=onepage "Engineering, Imagination, and Industry: Scripps Island and Dreams for Ocean Science in the 1960s"] in Helen M.

Van Keuren, eds., ''The Machine in Neptune's Garden: Historical Perspectives on Technology and the Marine Environment'' (Science History Publications 2004): 338. {{ISBN|9780881353723}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked on several buildings on the campus of Scripps, including The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP, a 1962 building of redwood and glass, overlooking the ocean from cliffs), Scripps Seaside Forum, and the Scripps Crossing, a cable footbridge linking two parts of campus. She was also active in the restoration of the 1913 "Director's House."&lt;ref&gt;Adriane Tillman, [http://www.sdnews.com/view/full_story/299184/article-Judith-Munk--81--artist--designer "Judith Munk, 81, Artist, Designer"] ''SDNews.com'' (June 22, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; She was responsible for bringing a Donal Hord statue to campus, now located outside the Munk Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sandiegohistory.org/collection/photographs/hordtour/ "Donal Hord Self-Guided Outdoor Tour"] San Diego History Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with her husband,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Yam, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ox5Y6EYctQC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=I6HhTKll0b&amp;dq=Judith%20Munk&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q=Judith%20Munk&amp;f=false "The Man Who Would Hear Ocean Temperatures"] ''Scientific American'' (January 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; she traveled to Italy, China, the Soviet Union, and American Samoa. During 1963 she and Walter lived at the village of [[Vailoatai, American Samoa|Vailoatai]] on [[Tutuila]] in American Samoa. They were both working on a documentary film, ''Waves Across the Pacific'' (1967).&lt;ref name="Dutton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee S. Dutton|title=Anthropological Resources: A Guide to Archival, Library, and Museum Collections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcbIgOCqreIC&amp;pg=PA77|date=May 13, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-81893-9|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; She co-founded the International Center to host guests at the [[University of California at San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Aguilera" /&gt;

Horton also served on the La Jolla Town Council. She won a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to design an amphitheater for the town, but the project failed. She was an honorary member of the San Diego chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref name="Aguilera" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Judith Horton married oceanographer [[Walter Munk]] as his second wife, in 1953, and had two daughters, Kendall and Edie. The Munks designed their home in La Jolla, "Seiche," and frequently hosted campus social gatherings there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/19-3_munk.pdf "Judith Munk, 1925–2006: A Friend of Oceanography"]  ''Oceanography'' 19(3)(September 2006): 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith died in 2006, age 81, from pneumonia. In 2008, she was posthumously inducted into the San Diego Women's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womensmuseumca.org/hall-of-fame/judith-munk Judith K. Munk], San Diego Women's Hall of Fame, 2008 inductee.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGPP laboratory Munk helped to design was renamed for Walter and Judith Munk in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Hasselmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L05XT9zIcvsC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=wXeZG9V5qk&amp;dq=Walter%20and%20Judith%20Munk%20Laboratory&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=Walter%20and%20Judith%20Munk%20Laboratory&amp;f=false ''Seventy Years of Exploration in Oceanography: A Prolonged Weekend Discussion with Walter Munk''] (Spring Science and Business Media 2010): 85. {{ISBN|9783642120879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laird Maurice Wilcox''' is an American researcher specializing in the study of [[political fringe movements]]. He is the founder of the "Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://voluntaryist.com/backissues/027.pdf |title=What Is Political Extremism? |last=Wilcox |first=Laird  |date=August 1987 |editor-last=Watner |editor-first=Carl |publisher=The Voluntaryists |location=Gramling, South Carolina |pages=3–4 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010144918/http://www.voluntaryist.com/articles/027a.php |archive-date=October 10, 2003 |access-date=December 2, 2016 |volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to be one of the largest collections of American political material in the United States. It is housed in the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name=freespeech&gt;[http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/wilcox/ Free Speech and the Wilcox Collection: Forty Years of Collecting Political Documents] Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements, Kansas Collection, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, [[University of Kansas]].&lt;/ref&gt; Wilcox worked as carpenter, investigator and writer while living in [[Olathe, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="NewsKU"&gt;[http://www.news.ku.edu/2005/october/12/wilcox.shtml KU News Release] article ''Wilcox Collection of political literature to celebrate 40 years at KU'' by University of Kansas published October 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Wilcox signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements==
The Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements, in the Kansas Collection of Kenneth Spencer Research Library, [[University of Kansas]], includes coverage of "more than 10,000 individuals and organizations. The bulk of the collection covers 1960 to the present and comprises nearly 10,000 books, pamphlets and periodicals, 800 audio tapes, {{convert|73|ft|m}} of manuscript materials and more than 100,000 pieces of ephemera including flyers, brochures, mailings, clippings and bumper stickers." Wilcox continues to make regular donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/kc/wilcox.shtml University of Kansas] Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements, Kansas Collection, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, University of Kansas&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection began in 1963-1964, when Wilcox, then a student at the University of Kansas, kept a scrapbook while he was chair of the Student Union Association Minority Opinions Forum. According to its website, the forum was very active that year, with speakers invited to discuss civil liberties, freedom of expression,  [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]], [[communism]], the [[American Nazi Party]], and the [[Socialist Labor Party]]. In 1965, the university purchased a number of books, serials, and pamphlets from Wilcox, and the Wilcox Collection began.&lt;ref name=freespeech/&gt;

In 1989, Wilcox received the "Kansas City Area Archivists Award of Excellence" for his role in founding and maintaining the Wilcox Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umkc.edu/kcaa/Awards/recipients.htm KCAA Award of Excellence Recipient].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was awarded the Myers Center Award for the Study of Human Rights in the United States. In 1994, he was awarded the Freedom of Information Award of the Kansas Library Association/SIRS "For outstanding commitment to intellectual freedom."

In 1995, he received the [[Mencken Award]] of the [[Free Press Association]] "For outstanding journalism in defense of liberty."{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 2005, the University of Kansas honored Wilcox, then 63, in the Spencer library's North Gallery for his role in founding the collection.&lt;ref name="NewsKU"/&gt; He has been a member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] since 1961 and a member of [[Amnesty International]] since 1970.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Criticism of "Watchdog" groups==
In his 1997 self-published book, ''The Watchdogs'',&lt;ref name=Watchdogs&gt;''The Watchdogs'', self-published through "Editorial Research Service,"  [http://www.lairdwilcox.com/publish/watchdogs.html available at lairdwilcox.com]; extensively footnoted.  ({{ISBN|0-933592-89-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; Wilcox criticized an "industry" of such groups "whose identity and livelihood depend upon growth and expansion of their particular kind of victimization." He holds such groups use "links and ties" to imply connections between individuals and groups. And they collect millions of dollars by greatly exaggerating the size and danger of such groups, becoming "a massive extortion racket."

He names groups like the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[Political Research Associates]], and the [[Center for Democratic Renewal]]. Mark Potok of Southern Poverty Law Center told a reporter that Wilcox "had an ax to grind for a great many years" and engaged in name calling against others doing anti-racist work. [[Chip Berlet]] of Political Research Associates told a reporter that "Laird Wilcox is not an accurate or ethical reporter… He simply can't tolerate people who are his competition in this field."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stacy McCain|McCain, Robert Stacy]].

'''Laurie Goldrich Wolf''' (born {{circa}} 1956&lt;ref name=Pollack2015/&gt;) is an American [[food writing|food writer]] and entrepreneur. Her husband since 1984, Bruce Wolf, who is a professional photographer,&lt;ref name=NYT1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton1998/&gt; sometimes collaborates with her.&lt;ref name=Butler2012/&gt;

==Education and early career==
Wolf graduated from the [[Calhoun School]] in Manhattan&lt;ref name=NYT1984/&gt; and [[The Culinary Institute of America]], worked as a chef and caterer, and as food editor for ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' and ''[[Child (magazine)|Child]]'' for 18 years.&lt;ref name=Onstad2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=OPB2012/&gt; Wolf and her husband moved from New York to Portland in 2008.&lt;ref name=OPB2012/&gt;

==Book writing==
Wolf has written several [[children's books]]. ''Candy 1 to 20'' (photography by her husband Bruce), which teaches children to read and count numbers with photographs of candy, received a ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' writeup that noted its "transformation of the familiar into the sweetly surprising",&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; and a review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' that called it an "especially kid-friendly approach to counting".&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

Her 2014 ''Portland, Oregon Chef's Table'' was described as "both as a cookbook and a restaurant guide",&lt;ref name=OPB2012/&gt; and a "powerful tour of Portland's current [[Portland, Oregon#Cuisine and breweries|restaurant scene]]".&lt;ref name=Onstad2012/&gt; The book contains a full chapter on [[brunch]],&lt;ref name=Williams2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler2012/&gt; a uniquely prominent facet of Portland's restaurant scene.&lt;ref name=brunch/&gt;

Her [[Crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] 2015 cookbook ''Herb: Mastering the Art of Cooking with Cannabis'' was coauthored with Melissa Parks, a graduate of [[Le Cordon Bleu]] in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=Bull2015/&gt; It has been noted as one of the first pertaining to cooking with cannabis after legalization in several U.S. states. A ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' review said it rose to the challenge of improving on existing edibles lore that "just doesn't taste very good",&lt;ref name=Rupp2016/&gt; and a ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' review, while calling it an "ambitious attempt to bring together the weed brownie set and the dinner party set" that "aims to do for weed what [[Julia Child]] did for French cuisine" was somewhat critical of its "murky positioning somewhere between 'basics' and 'cuisine'", with short [[wikt:headnote|headnotes]] and a lack of focus on kitchen fundamentals for novice chefs.&lt;ref name=Bull2015/&gt;

Since 2014, she has been the food writer for ''[[The Cannabist]]''.&lt;ref name=Cannabist2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough2015/&gt;

==Business==
Laurie and Bruce Wolf's Portland business Laurie &amp; MaryJane produces sweet and savory [[cannabis edibles]].&lt;ref name=Sevcenko2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rillos2016/&gt;

==Personal life==
Wolf is a member of Portland's Jewish community.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt; Laurie and Bruce Wolf have two children.&lt;ref name=Hamilton1998/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9906">'''Leon Jay "Lee" Schipper''' (April 7, 1947 – August 16, 2011) was a physicist and energy efficiency expert who authored more than 100 technical papers and a number of books on energy economics and transportation. He was "often a critic of the conventional wisdom."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Schipper attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]].  He earned Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Music in 1968, and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.

==Career==
Schipper worked at the [http://www.lbl.gov Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)] for more than 20 years. In addition, he worked at the [http://erg.berkeley.edu Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley],  [http://www.shell.com Shell International] in London, as well as being [[Fulbright Scholar]] at the [http://www.beijer.kva.se Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics] in Stockholm. He was a guest researcher at the [[World Bank]], VVS Tekniska Foereningen, the [http://www.oecd.org/ OECD], and the [http://www.sei-international.org Stockholm Environment Institute]. He worked closely with the [[Global Business Network]] and [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]].

He served on the editorial boards of five major journals and was a member of the Swedish Board for Transportation and Communications Research. For four years he was a member of the U.S. [[National Academy of Science]]’s [http://www.trb.org/Main/Home.aspx Transportation Research Board]’s Committee on Sustainable Transport and Committee on Developing Countries. 

At the time of his death, Schipper was a senior research scientist at both [http://metrostudies.berkeley.edu University of California Berkeley’s Global Metropolitan Studies] and at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141207091745/http://peec.stanford.edu/index.php Precourt Institute of Energy Efficiency at Stanford University] conducting research and policy analysis on efficient energy use in transportation systems. 

===Energy Efficient Housing===
Schipper's first seminal contribution came in 1976, when he published an influential paper in ''Science'' pointing out that Sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the United States did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Schipper testified before Congress on this subject in March 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/pur1.32754066853353?urlappend=%3Bseq=457 Review of federal policies and building standards affecting energy conservation in housing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
Schipper shifted his primary attention to transport in the 1980s and started the Berkeley Lab’s International Energy Studies group with [[Jayant Sathaye]], and the two co-led the group for many years. 

He was co-founder of [https://web.archive.org/web/20090219000211/http://www.embarq.org/ EMBARQ], the World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport, and remained as a senior associate emeritus. 

===Climate Change===
From 1995 to 2001, he was a senior scientist at the [http://www.iea.org [[International Energy Agency]]] in Paris. 

He contributed to the Second and Third Assessment Reports of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], which was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007. He was due to act as Review Editor for the chapter on Transport in Working Group III's contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, released in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/press-releases/ipcc-wg3-ar5-authors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[John Holdren]], later to become Science Advisor to President [[Barack Obama]], was the first person to hire Schipper as an energy specialist, at Berkeley in the early 1970s. He said ‘‘Lee was one of the first people to point out that people don’t want to consume energy, but they want to consume energy services, like transportation, comfortable rooms, cold beer and so forth. And that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services.’’&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Mark Levine, who was Schipper’s superviser for most his career at LBNL, said: "Lee was the founding father of a school of energy analysts, a tradition carried on with vigor in the Energy Analysis Department at LBNL.... The work he did has been carried on here. He created an important tradition of understanding energy by studying it from the bottom up, which means by end user."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Personal==
He was described as being an irrepressible iconoclast&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; with a wonderful knack of turning a phrase to excellent effect. Evidence for this was publishing 15 letters to the editor in the ''New York Times'' on energy efficiency. For example, in his view the "cash for clunkers" program—which offered rebates to people who bought a new car with better mileage than their old one—did little to save energy, although it may have reduced air pollution. In many cases, buyers used the rebate to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise. "The effect is inverse of what we were hoping for" he said.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Schipper was also an accomplished musician. He was the leader of the University of California Jazz Quintet in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.archives.gov/description/130296 "Lee Schipper, leader of the University of California Jazz Quintet"] interview, 27 May 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; As a UC Berkeley student and vibraphonist, he led his jazz group to victory at the Notre Dame Jazz Festival in 1967.  In 1969 Danish saxophonist Carsten Meinert invited him to record on his album "C.M. Musictrain" in Denmark (Spectator Records).  In 1973 he recorded "The Phunky Physicist" with Swedish guitar player Janne Schaffer.  He would reprise the role as band leader with an ad hoc jazz group, Lee Schipper and the Mitigators, who performed primarily in conjunction with energy-related conferences.

He was also one of the world’s experts on [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|Wilhelm Furtwangler]], a 20th century symphonic and operatic conductor, and collected one of the most complete sets of his recordings.

'''Moses ha-Levi Alkabetz''' was a prominent rabbi of the first half of the sixteenth century. In around 1530 he officiated as ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]]'' at [[Safed]]. He seems also to have studied the [[Kabbalah]], since [[Isaac ibn Shoshan]] of Safed wrote a kabbalistic work for him. His son was [[Solomon Alkabetz]] of Safed.

A '''Nigerian Brazilian''' ({{lang-pt|Nigeriano-brasileiro}}) is a Brazilian person of full, partial, or predominantly [[Nigerian]] ancestry, or a Nigerian-born person residing in [[Brazil]]. 

Over 2,000 Nigerians living illegally in Brazil without proper documentation before 9 February 2009 and are to be benefited from amnesty offers by the Brazilian Government. The Nigerian Ambassador to Brazil, Kayode Garrick, made this known to the [[News Agency of Nigeria]] (NAN) in [[Brasília]]. Garrick, said that over 2,000 Nigerian potential beneficiaries of the Brazilian amnesty proclamation were among the 5,000 Nigerians currently living in the country. In September 2008, the Nigerian government opened the ''Casa da Nigéria'' or "Nigerian Culture House" in the historic [[Historic Centre (Salvador, Bahia)|Pelourinho]] neighborhood of [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], Bahia, with the support of the governments of Bahia and Brazil.

[[File:Beijing - Huimin Xiaoxue - CIMG3664.JPG|thumb|Niujie]]

'''Niujie''' ({{zh|c=牛街|p=Niú jiē|w=Niu-chieh}} "Oxen Street"&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp112&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a neighborhood at [[Guang'anmen]],&lt;ref name=China.org.cn&gt;"[http://china.org.cn/travel/where_to_go/2008-04/21/content_14989563.htm Culinary delights: Beijing's Muslim cuisine]." ([https://archive.is/NvFbL Archive]) [[China Internet Information Center]] (China.org.cn). Retrieved on 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Xicheng District]] in southwest [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The name "Niujie" can refer to the street ''Niujie'' or to the neighborhood ''Niujie''.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The community was previously in [[Xuanwu District, Beijing|Xuanwu District]] before the district was merged into Xicheng in 2010.

The Niujie district is administered by the Niujie Street Administrative Office. The core area of this district is along the street Niujie.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp112/&gt; The Niujie core area, a [[Hui people]] neighborhood,&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp104&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; has Beijing's largest concentration of Muslim people.&lt;ref name=China.org.cn/&gt; As of 2013 there is a Muslim-oriented hospital as well as social services, cafés, shops, restaurants, and schools catering to the Muslim population.&lt;ref name=WuWeipingGaubatzp254&gt;Wu, Weiping and Gaubatz. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EcPEykizV3gC&amp;pg=PA254 254].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of "Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing," wrote that Niujie "continues to thrive as a major residential area of the Hui people in Beijing and as a prominent supplier of [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|Hui foods]] and services for the entire city."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp104/&gt; The neighborhood has the [[Niujie Mosque]], which according to Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan, "mark[s] the
identity of Niujie" and has an element of centrality in the community.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Most larger Hui neighborhoods in Beijing have their own mosques.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Beijing-Niujie-Minzu-Tuanjie-Da-Jiating-3660.JPG|thumb|left|A fence in Niujie depicting the ethnicities in China, including the Hui (回族)]]
At up to the [[Tang Dynasty]], what is now Niujie would have been on the city's periphery according to archival research and historical documents.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp112113&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 112-113. "Historical documents and archival research indicate that from as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907), the location of today’s Niujie had been on the periphery of the city of Beijing"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Niujie Mosque]] was built between 916 and 1125. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that the establishment of the Hui settlement "probably" was related to Muslims joining the army of [[Genghis Khan]], who had conquered Beijing, and that based on some gravestones of imams encountered at the Niujie Mosque, a significant community of Hui people had lived in the Niujie area dating back to the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. During that dynasty many Muslims moved to Beijing.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt; Therefore, soldiers were the first Hui people in Niujie.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp115&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Yuan Dynasty Niujie was located in proximity to and outside of the main [[Beijing city wall]], and it had the name Willow River Village.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt; [[Dru C. Gladney]], author of ''Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic'', wrote that according to stories from that Dynasty, Han people rarely walked in the neighborhood alone. In addition, the stories state that during the dynasty, 2,953 households resided on Niujie.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp175&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney|Gladney]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA175 175].&lt;/ref&gt; Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that "peripheral location reflected separation between the Hui people living there and the Mongolian residents living within the city wall."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt; In 1544 an outer city wall was established and Willow River Village was within this outer city wall. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that wrote that the community "was still considered peripheral to the city proper where most Han Chinese lived."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt;

According to the [[China Internet Information Center]], a legend stated that the street Niujie was originally named "Pomegranate Street" or '''Liujie''' ({{zh|c=榴街|p=liú jiē|w=Liu-chieh}}) because the Muslims in the community grew pomegranate trees.&lt;ref name=China.org.cn/&gt; Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated the ''Liu'' meant "[[willow]]" (C: 柳, P: ''Liǔ'', W: ''Liu'') and that the similarity between ''liu'' and ''niu'' "might have given rise to the name change."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt; Gladney wrote that the name may have originated from a concentration of beef butchers during the Qing Dynasty or from the homophonic similarity to the Liu River, where pomegranate and willow trees grew.&lt;ref name="Gladneyp175"/&gt; The name change of the community to Niujie occurred during the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113/&gt; The China Internet Information Center stated that the street name changed when members of the began specializing in beef.&lt;ref name=China.org.cn/&gt; At that time, [[imam]]s had butchered both mutton and beef.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp113114&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that the Niujie Hui community continued to be distinct from the Manchu community in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s the neighborhood underwent a renovation and the majority of the 3,000 families living there relocated on a temporary basis as the renovations occurred.&lt;ref name=WuWeipingGaubatzp254/&gt; Reza Hasmath, author of "The Identification, Settlement, and Representation of Ethnic Minorities in Beijing," wrote that this "perhaps" was a reaction to the per capita GDP and economic growth rate of [[Xuanwu District, Beijing|Xuanwu District]] trailing that of [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]] and [[Xicheng District]].&lt;ref name=Hasmathp95&gt;Hasmath, "The Identification, Settlement, and Representation of Ethnic Minorities in Beijing," p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0KlgRzs_RoC&amp;pg=PA95 95].&lt;/ref&gt; The renovations of a {{convert|36|ha|acre|adj=on}} area in the district began in 1997, 26,000 residents in about 7,500 households were affected by the renovations. The completion of the first phase occurred by the end of 2000.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117/&gt; New apartment buildings had been constructed,&lt;ref name=Hasmathp95/&gt; and a government policy stated that displaced residents of Niujie only needed to pay a small price in order to move into the new buildings. At the end of phase one, 3,000 people moved into the new apartment buildings. The majority of residents who decided not to return were Han Chinese.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117/&gt; Overall the non-Muslims had a tendency to remain out of the neighborhood. Almost all of the Muslim families returned after renovations ended.&lt;ref name=WuWeipingGaubatzp254/&gt; Overall 90% of the displaced families from the first phase of the renovation had returned.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117/&gt;

In 2002, Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie "continues to be a thriving enclave, with a high concentration of Hui residents and economic activities".&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp116&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage of the renovation was scheduled to be completed that year.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117/&gt;

==Demographics==
Niujie district had 64,059 residents, 21.9% of them being Hui, in 2000. As of 2000 24,088 people lived in the Niujie core area, 54.1% being Hui. This gives it a higher percentage of Hui population than other areas of the district.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp112/&gt; The core area is one of Beijing's largest ethnic enclaves&lt;!--The 24,088 figure in Hasmath's book comes from 2000--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasmathp95/&gt; Reza Hasmath, author of ''A Comparative Study of Minority Development in China and Canada'', wrote that since the ethnic attractions of many areas in Beijing are not located in areas that have strong minority demographics, the fact that Niujie still is strongly Hui is "more remarkable".&lt;ref name=Hasmathstudyp37&gt;Hasmath, ''A Comparative Study of Minority Development in China and Canada'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ_IAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 37].&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1996 the district had 55,722 residents, with 13,755, or 24.7% of the total population, being ethnic minorities. Of the minorities, 13,307, or 96.6%, were Hui. In the core area itself, there were 2,446 residents and 649 households resident. Of the individuals, 1,763 were Hui, making up 70.2% of the population. Of the households 475 were Hui, making up 69.3%, and the Manchu and Mongolian ethnic groups each had two households.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp176&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney|Gladney]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA176 176].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the neighborhoods on both sides of the core area, as of 1996 about 50% of the residents were Han and 50% were Hui.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp176/&gt; In the Tang Fang neighborhood in the Niujie District, as of the 1982 Census, there were 3,107 individuals. Of them, there were 1,814 Hui, making up 58.38% of the population, 1,272 Han, making up 40.94% of the population, and 21 Manchu, making up .68% of the population.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp179&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney|Gladney]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA179 179].&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1996 the communities closer to the core area have higher Hui populations than those further from the core area.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp176/&gt;

As of 2007, according to Nimrod Baranovich, author of "Inverted Exile: Uyghur Writers and Artists in Beijing and the Political Implications of Their Work," he had been informed that many [[Uyghur people]] live in Niujie.&lt;ref name=Baranovitchp497&gt;Baranovitch, Nimrod ([[University of Haifa]]). "[http://mcx.sagepub.com/content/33/4/462.refs Inverted Exile: Uyghur Writers and Artists in Beijing and the Political Implications of Their Work]." ''[[Modern China]]''. [[Sage Publications]]. October 2007 33: 462-504, doi: 10.1177/0097700407304803 - Cited: p. 497. "[...]and that many Uyghurs live today in the Hui Muslim quarter on Niujie (Ox Street)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cityscape==
As of 2011 the Niujie core area features various buildings decorated in an Islamic Chinese style, including the post office and apartment blocks. The apartments were painted in the Islamic-associated colors white and green and decorated with Islamic symbols&lt;!--Relevant to the Hui character of the neighborhood--&gt;. The core area includes a Hui primary school, a supermarket carrying [[halal]] products, and several Muslim restaurants.&lt;ref name=Hasmathp95/&gt; As of 1996 there were There were 51 Islamic meatshops, 51 Islamic restaurants, and several Islamic foodstuff stores in all of Xuanwu district. On Niujie Street at that time there were Hui ''getihu'' who sold fruit and pastries, 8 Islamic noodle and pastry shops, and 2 small Islamic restaurants.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp175/&gt;

The Chinese Islamic Association building, located southeast of the Mosque, has Arab architectural flourishes such as parapets and large green domes. It was built in the 1950s. The ''Huimin Yiyuan'' (S: 回民医院, P: ''Huímín Yīyuàn''), the Hui hospital, is at the south end of the Niujie street.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp175/&gt; The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has erected various signs stating that the local government had helped improve the delivery of electricity, gas, and water to Niujie discussing the historic achievements of the Niujie community.&lt;ref name=Hasmathp95/&gt;

The Tang Fang neighborhood is west of Niujie Street on Beiruilu.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp176/&gt;

==Government and infrastructure==
The Niujie Street Administrative Office governs the area in the community. In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan concluded that based on the re-development plans stating that the Niujie Mosque would remain in its current location with its "centrality" in the community, the administrative office "has played an important role in preserving the Hui character of the enclave, making it possible for the Hui residents to return and live in a setting they are highly identified with, despite urban renovation and redevelopment."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp117/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Niujie - halal supermarket - CIMG3720.JPG|thumb|left|A [[halal]] supermarket in Niujie&lt;!--清真 means "Halal" and 超市 means "supermarket"--&gt;]]
Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan explained that the economy of the community is focused on "ethnic-specific activities" such as Jade processing, meat trading, and Islamic restaurants.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp118&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism, including visits to the [[Niujie Mosque]], is a part of the economy of Niujie. A survey conducted by Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan in January 2002 concluded that the market and shops on Nanhengxi Street sold about {{convert|6000|kg|lbs}} of beef and mutton daily. The same survey counted over 30 Islamic restaurants on Nanhengxi Street. In addition, around 2002, there had been an increase in contractors, miscellaneous repair shops, and other services.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp118/&gt;

Reza Hasmath wrote that Niujie was "one of the last surviving, important ethnic enclaves in Beijing" because the rapid growth of Beijing had caused many ethnic enclaves to vanish.&lt;ref name=Hasmathstudyp37/&gt; Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie has remained to be an [[ethnic enclave]] because it continued to be "peripheral to the city’s core area of economic growth" with much of the expansion occurring in north Beijing instead of the portion of Beijing where Niujie resides.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114/&gt; In an interview in August 2000 the head of a resident committee in the [[Madian, Beijing|Madian]] neighborhood in [[Haidian District]], which historically was a Hui community but faced a decline due to development, stated that even though going to Niujie from Madian meant a lengthy commute, many Madian Hui now preferred to travel there to purchase beef and mutton.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp118119&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that "This is evidence that Niujie’s role as a large enclave and major supplier for the Hui people in Beijing has been enhanced as the ethnic economy of Madian gradually declined."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp119&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie served in a wider ethnic Hui economy across Beijing as well as providing a local ethnic enclave economy in the period from the [[Ming Dynasty]] until 1949.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114/&gt; In the pre-1949 period 75%&lt;!--three quarters--&gt; of the jade trade enterprises in the city were located in Niujie. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that in this period a central component of Niujie was the food service sector, which consisted of beef and button stands, [[Hui cuisine|Hui food]] wagons and stands, and Hui&lt;!--stated in the source as "qingzhen" which can refer to Hui people--&gt; restaurants.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114/&gt; They stated that residents of Niujie "gained a reputation for operating meat delicatessens in other parts of Beijing."&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114/&gt; Niujie was also adjacent to a major vegetable market, ''[[Caishikou]]''.&lt;ref name=WangZhouFanp114/&gt;

==Education==
One school in Niujie, the Beijing Xuanwu Huimin Elementary School (S: 北京市宣武回民小学, P: ''Běijīng Shì Xuānwǔ Huímín Xiǎoxué'', "Beijing Xuanwu Hui People Elementary School"), serves the [[Hui people]] living in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xwhmxx.cn/index.aspx Home page] ([https://archive.is/psEQG Archive]). Beijing Xuanwu Huimin Elementary School. Retrieved on January 10, 2014. "学校地址：北京市西城区牛街西里一区5号(北京市宣武回民小学)"&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011 a principal of a Hui school in Niujie had stated that the students are taught in the Chinese educational scheme and are given a supplementary Islamic education, but that "our first priority is to ensure that the Teaching Scheme is taught, as it is the case for all students in Beijing, so our students are not left behind."&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, Reza. "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2011.553238#.Usgm4vsSPOs The education of ethnic minorities in Beijing]." ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]''. 2011. Volume 34, Issue 11.

'''Dr Pandora Louise Elizabeth Braithwaite''' is a fictional character in the [[Adrian Mole|''Adrian Mole'' series]] of books by [[Sue Townsend]]. In the books, Pandora is the love of Adrian's life. Pandora is beautiful (Adrian especially loves her 'treacle-coloured' hair) and intelligent, and in the first books, she and Adrian Mole are happy together. In the later books, Pandora resists Adrian's advances in favour of physically and intellectually powerful men, although Adrian remains attached to her.

==Character==
As a youth she is precocious and outspoken with firm feminist and hard-left views.  As she ages she becomes successful but also manipulative and devious, she is portrayed as being somewhat a champagne socialist.

== Life ==
Pandora's parents were called Ivan and Tania. She came to [[Leicester]] at the age of 13 and sat with [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] during [[Geography]] classes, and soon became the most popular girl in their class. She started dating Nigel, but they soon broke up. A few weeks later, on Wednesday (June 10, 1981), Adrian and Pandora started dating together. They had many short break-ups, until they finally ended their relationship in ''True Confessions''.

She attended the [[University of Oxford]], studying [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbo-Croat language|Serbo-Croat]]. She graduated and married her first husband, Julian Twyselton-Fife, who was openly gay, as a "favour" done by Julian. They cemented their love at London's Astoria [[G-A-Y]] nightclub after he drove for hours to pick her up. Her aversion to germs meant that she was unable to take a train. She had several liaisons and drifted apart from Adrian. Eventually she cohabited with Jack Cavendish, an old professor of linguistics. After many years they split up, with Jack revealing many of her secrets.

Later, she entered politics in the [[New Labour]] era under [[Tony Blair]] and became a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], [[Leicestershire]]. She referred to herself as '''''Pan National''''' and '''''The Shiniest Star in Blair's Sky''''', nicknames that the media picked up and subsequently used. However, she vocally opposed the [[Iraq War]] and was seen to be one of the Labour Party's most left-wing MPs.  As an MP she is criticised for her expensive French wardrobe and shows little concern for her constituents; declaring that 'democracy is wasted on them'.

'''Paul Cramer''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]''. Paul was originated on October 3, 2003, by [[Brock Cuchna]], who played the role until March 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="IMDb Cuchna"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1492446/ Brock Cuchna - IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;[http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/paul.php Paul Cramer profile - SoapCentral.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The character was then recast with [[David Tom]] on March 11, 2004&lt;ref name="IMDb Tom"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005495/ David Tom - IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, the role was temporarily played by [[Shane McRae]].&lt;ref name="IMDb McRae"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574460/ Shane McRae - IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul crossed over to ABC's ''[[All My Children]]'' multiple times from December 30, 2003, to October 27, 2004, during a "baby switch" storyline involving both series. The character of Paul was killed off as part of a murder mystery storyline in October 2004,&lt;ref name="OLTL 2004-10-27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2004-05/20041027.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (10/27/04)|publisher=ABC.com ([[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=April 23, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423055357/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2004-05/20041027.html |archivedate = April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OLTL 2004-11-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2004-05/20041102.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (11/2/04) |publisher=ABC.com (Internet Archive) |accessdate=April 23, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423055428/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2004-05/20041102.html |archivedate = April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lingered in newly created [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s and other characters' dreams and hallucinations until May 2005.

Tom is the real-life brother of [[Heather Tom]], who played Paul's half-sister [[Kelly Cramer]].

==Storyline==

===Beginnings===
Paul Cramer first appears in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] in late 2003 at the re-opening Crossroads, the bar formerly owned by [[Ben Davidson (One Life to Live)|Ben Davidson]]. In search of [[Sarah Roberts]], the daughter of [[Tina Lord]] and [[Cord Roberts]], Paul says he had known Sarah's brother [[C.J. Roberts|C.J.]] while serving as a pilot in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and that he had made "the biggest mistake of his life."  The nature of this mistake is never revealed as Paul never shares any scenes with Sarah and instead becomes embroiled in a storyline with [[Dorian Lord]] and the [[Cramer family]].

A local society maven, Dorian is shocked as Paul arrives on her doorstep and claims to be the son of Dorian's mentally disturbed younger sister [[Melinda Cramer|Melinda]] (who had recently confessed to Dorian that she had given birth to another child during her years in [[Europe]]) and therefore [[Kelly Cramer|Kelly]]'s brother.  Paul was raised by an upstanding foster family and has only just recently learned of his true heritage.  Dorian soon worries that this heretofore unknown Cramer could be the heir to her aging [[Betsy Cramer|Aunt Betsy]]'s fortune.  Aunt Betsy, an eccentric old spinster, has very specific ideas on what a "real Cramer" should be and feels that almost all the women in the family have abdicated their power and self-esteem to men.  Dorian and her other niece [[Blair Cramer|Blair]] are desperate to get their hands on Aunt Betsy's inheritance, and the matriarchal family is shocked when man-hating Betsy's favor turns to the dark horse: Paul, the newcomer, who also happens to be a man.

A seemingly agreeable young man with his life in order, Paul is soon targeted for ruin by Dorian and her partner in crime [[David Vickers]].  Determined to get Aunt Betsy's inheritance, Dorian and David seek any information they can use against Paul to force him out of Betsy's good graces.  They find just that in the discovery of Paul's connection to schemer [[Babe Carey]] from [[Pine Valley (All My Children)|Pine Valley]], and Paul and Babe's outrageous marriage from the recent past.  With Paul out of Betsy's favor, Dorian and David are free and clear to use [[Carlotta Vega]]'s ward [[Adriana Cramer|Adriana Colón]] to gain control of the Cramer wealth once and for all.  Paul, meanwhile, begins exhibiting shadier behavior, like working with Dr. William Long, then-Chief of Staff of Llanview Hospital, to sell organs on the black market, and [[blackmail]]ing [[Jennifer Rappaport]] for sex using a tape of [[Rex Balsom]] and Jen's mother [[Lindsay Rappaport|Lindsay]] in bed.

=== Crossover to ''All My Children'' ===
Paul's December 30, 2003 visit to his estranged secret wife [[Babe Carey]] on ''All My Children''&lt;ref name="SC 2003-01-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2003/1117-crossovers.php|title=''AMC'' News: ABC Plans ''AMC'', ''OLTL'' Crossovers|last=Kroll|first=Dan J.|date=November 12, 2003|publisher=[[Soapcentral]]|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately leads to an extensive  "baby switch" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline in 2004. Paul finds himself delivering the babies of both Babe and her friend [[Bianca Montgomery]] during a rainstorm in nearby [[Pine Valley (All My Children)|Pine Valley]] on March 24, 2004. Paul stages a crash with his [[MEDEVAC]] helicopter and takes [[Adam Chandler III|Babe's son]] for Kelly, who is desperate for a child to save her marriage after miscarrying her own. Paul initially tells Babe that her child had died in the accident; threatened at the scene by the powerful family of the child's father, Paul quickly changes his plan, giving [[Miranda Montgomery|Bianca's daughter]] to Babe and telling Bianca that her baby had died instead. Unaware of the child's origins, Kelly brings Babe's infant back to Llanview, passing him off as her child with Kevin. Kevin and Kelly name the baby [[Ace Buchanan|Asa "Ace" Buchanan II]] after Kevin's grandfather. Babe discovers that "her daughter" is really Bianca's, but remains silent for months and allows Paul to manipulate her and Bianca. Meanwhile, a devastated Kelly discovers that Paul had stolen Ace from his mother; Paul, desperate for cash, blackmails Kelly by threatening to reveal the secret to Kevin and Llanview. Armed with the truth, Kelly realizes they must return the child to his parents; though broken-hearted, they do. Bianca's family resents Babe for the baby switch, seemingly forgetting Paul's role in the incident.&lt;ref name="SOD Switch 34-08"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Babes 'N' Switch: Double Trouble (''AMC/OLTL'' 2004-2005) |title=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |first=Naomi |last=Rabinowitz |pages=72–75 |date=February 24, 2009 |publisher=(Vol. 34, No. 8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demise ===
After alienating nearly everyone in town, Paul has a mysterious meeting in a cemetery on 27 October 2004;&lt;ref name="OLTL 2004-10-27"/&gt; his corpse is later revealed in an open grave, shot to death.&lt;ref name="OLTL 2004-11-02"/&gt; A murder mystery plays out, and in 2005 the killer is revealed to be respectable [[District Attorney]] [[Daniel Colson]], new husband of [[Nora Hanen|Nora Buchanan]]. Paul had been blackmailing Daniel, who is secretly [[gay]] and carrying on a torrid affair with local college student [[Mark Solomon (One Life to Live)|Mark Solomon]].  When Paul learned the truth about Daniel's extramarital activities, Daniel eliminated him and attempted to pin the crime on Jennifer Rappaport.  During the course of the storyline, Paul appeared to Daniel as a ghoulish hallucination, warning him that he would be exposed.

[[File:Ramón de la Cruz 01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Bust of Ramón de la Cruz in Madrid ([[Lorenzo Coullaut Valera|L. Coullaut]], 1913)]]

'''Ramón de la Cruz''' (28 March 1731 – 5 March 1794) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Enlightenment literature|neoclassical]] [[dramatist]].

Born in [[Madrid]], he was a clerk in the ministry of finance. He is the author of three hundred ''[[sainete]]s'', little farcical sketches of city life, written to be played between the acts of a longer play. He published a selection in ten volumes (Madrid, 1786–1791). The best of his pieces, such as ''Las Tertulias de Madrid'', are specimens of satiric observation.

'''Roberto Jorge Payró''' ([[Mercedes, Buenos Aires|Mercedes]], April 19, 1867&amp;ndash;[[Lomas de Zamora]], April 8, 1928) was an [[Argentine]] writer and journalist.

Payró founded the newspaper ''La Tribuna'' in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], where he published his first newspaper articles. He then moved to the city of [[Buenos Aires]] where he worked as an editor at the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]''. During this time he had the opportunity of frequently traveling both inside and outside of Argentina.

In 1895, he published a compilation of his articles in the book  ''Los italianos en la Argentina'' (''The Italians in Argentina''). His diaries of travel and impressions gave rise to his novels:  ''La Australia Argentina (Excursión periodística a las costas patagónicas)'' (''Southern Argentina – a Journalist’s Excursion to the Shores of Patagonia'');  ''Tierra del Fuego e Islas de los Estados'' (''The Land of Fire and Islands of the States''); and ''En las tierras del Inti'' (''In the Lands of the Inti'').   He also wrote for ''Caras y Caretas'', the literary Journal of [[Fray mocho]].

Payró was a correspondent in Europe during the [[First World War]].  
He participated fervently in meetings with other [[socialist]] writers including [[Leopoldo Lugones]],  [[José Ingenieros]] and [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]].

Payró was also the grandparent of Brayan and Maria.

In Payró's novels one can appreciate the unique ironic language style of the period.  He utilized typical people and related common situations, showing the lives of the [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants ('the feisty [[Creole peoples|creole]]s').  In his ''Divertidas aventuras del nieto de Juan Moreira'' (''Amusing Adventures of the Grandson of [[Juan Moreira]]'') he tells the story of a provincial and his political career.
He also wrote historical novels such as ''El falso Inca, una serie de cuentos publicados bajo el nombre de Pago Chico'' (''The False Inca, a series of accounts published under the name of Pago Chico''). A posthumous work, ''Nuevos cuentos de Pago Chico'' (''New Tales of Pago Chico''), was published the year following his death.

==Arrest, trial and release==
On May 29, 2011 Feriani was arrested in [[Tunis]],&lt;ref name=humnew/&gt; for allegedly "harming the external security of the state", "releasing and distributing information likely to harm public order", and "accusing, without proof, a public agent of violating law".&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"/&gt; Before his arrest Feriani sent two letters to Tunisia's internal minister, [[Habib Essid]], in which he named several senior officials, whom he alleged had committed human rights abuses during the [[Tunisian revolution]], and had since then been destroying the evidence.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=humnew/&gt; His accusations were reported in two independent Tunisian newspapers, [[El Khabir]] and [[l'Audace]], days before his arrest.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

In response to his arrest, Tunisian activists organized a series of protests, many of them online (using [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]).&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=humnew/&gt; Feriani's arrest was condemned by the [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

On September 22, Feriani was released by a military court.&lt;ref name=humnew2&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark L Goldberg, USA |url=http://globalvoices.org/2011/09/24/tunisia-whistleblower-samir-feriani-set-free/ |title=Tunisia: Whistleblower Samir Feriani Set Free|publisher=Globalvoices.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 he was acquitted of major charges, but fined for "accusing a public employee of violating law without proof".&lt;ref name=aaf&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghribi |first=Asma |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203271129.html |title=Tunisia: Whistleblower Samir Feriani Acquitted of Major Charges |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feriani was satisfied with the outcome, expressing his hopes that it will mark the start of a deeper investigation into the Ministry of Interior's corruption, and that he will be reappointed to his position with the Ministry.&lt;ref name=aaf/&gt;

'''Sean Michael Carroll''' (born October 5, 1966) is a [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]] and physics professor specializing in [[dark energy]] and [[general relativity]]. He is a research professor in the Department of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/people/faculty |title=Caltech Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics Faculty Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a contributor to the physics blog [[Cosmic Variance (blog)|Cosmic Variance]], and has published in scientific journals such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] as well as other publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'', and ''[[New Scientist]]''.

He has appeared on the History Channel's [[The Universe (TV series)|''The Universe'']], Science Channel's [[Through the Wormhole|''Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman'']], ''[[Closer to Truth]]'' (broadcast on [[PBS]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.closertotruth.com/contributor/sean-carroll/profile|title=Sean Carroll - Closer to Truth|website=www.closertotruth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Comedy Central's ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.  Carroll is the author of ''Spacetime And Geometry'', a graduate-level textbook in general relativity, and has also recorded lectures for [[the Teaching Company|The Great Courses]] on cosmology, the physics of time, and the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=339|title=Professor Bio Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the author of three popular books: one on the [[arrow of time]] entitled ''From Eternity to Here'', one on the [[Higgs boson]] entitled ''The Particle at the End of the Universe'', and one on science and philosophy entitled ''The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself''. He began a podcast in 2018 called ''Mindscape,'' in which he interviews other experts and intellectuals on a variety of science-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/ |title=Mindscape podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Carroll received his PhD in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] in 1993 from [[Harvard University]], where his advisor was [[George B. Field]]. His [[dissertation]]'s title is "Cosmological Consequences of Topological and Geometric Phenomena in Field Theories". He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/cv/ |title=Sean M. Carroll CV |date= |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an assistant professor at the [[University of Chicago]] until 2006 when he was denied tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/03/30/how-to-get-tenure-at-a-major-research-university |title=How To Get Tenure at a Major Research University &amp;#124; Cosmic Variance &amp;#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now a research professor at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]].

His most-cited work, "Is Cosmic Speed-Up Due To New Gravitational Physics?" was written with Vikram Duvvuri, [[Mark Trodden]], and [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]]. With over 1,900 citations, it helped pioneer the study of [[f(R) gravity]] in cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspirehep.net/record/621682/citations inSPIRE High-Energy Physics Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Carroll was elected as a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], for "contributions to a wide variety of subjects in [[cosmology]], [[Theory of Relativity|relativity]], and [[quantum field theory]], especially ideas for [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|cosmic acceleration]], as well as contributions to undergraduate, graduate, and public science education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/fellowships/archive-all.cfm?initial=&amp;year=2010&amp;unit_id=DPF&amp;institution=California%20Institute%20of%20Technology|title=APS Fellow Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he was awarded the [[Andrew Gemant Award]], a prize given by the [[American Institute of Physics]] for "significant contributions to the cultural, artistic or humanistic dimension of physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/news/2014/outspoken-caltech-scientist-wins-2014-gemant-award |title="Outspoken" Caltech Scientist Wins 2014 Gemant Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caltech.edu/news/sean-carroll-awarded-guggenheim-fellowship-46621 |title=Sean Carroll Awarded Guggenheim Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Carroll is married to [[Jennifer Ouellette]], a [[science writer]] and the former director of the [[Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Dreifus, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/science/20conv.html?_r=1 "Sean Carroll Talks School Science and Time Travel"], The New York Times, April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Carroll has worked on a number of areas of theoretical cosmology, field theory and gravitation theory. His research papers include models of, and experimental constraints on, violations of [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]]; the appearance of [[closed timelike curve]]s in general relativity; varieties of [[topological defect]]s in field theory; and cosmological dynamics of [[Kaluza–Klein theory|extra spacetime dimensions]]. In recent years he has written extensively on models of [[dark energy]] and its interactions with ordinary matter and [[dark matter]], as well as modifications of [[general relativity]] in cosmology.

Carroll has also worked on the [[arrow of time]] problem. He and Jennifer Chen posit that the [[Big Bang]] is not a unique occurrence as a result of all of the matter and energy in the universe originating in a singularity at the beginning of time, but rather one of many [[cosmic inflation]] events resulting from [[quantum fluctuation]]s of [[vacuum energy]] in a cold [[de Sitter space]]. They claim that the universe is infinitely old, but never reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] as entropy increases continuously without limit due to the decreasing matter and energy density attributable to recurrent cosmic inflation. They assert that the universe is "statistically time-symmetric" insofar as it contains equal progressions of time "both forward and backward".&lt;ref&gt;Sean M. Carroll, Jennifer Chen, [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0410270 "Spontaneous Inflation and the Origin of the Arrow of Time"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Frank, [http://discovermagazine.com/2008/apr/25-3-theories-that-might-blow-up-the-big-bang/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C= "3 Theories That Might Blow Up the Big Bang"], Discover, April 2008, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Harold |last=Henderson |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/pdf/050812/050812_scientists.pdf |title=The Cosmic Jiggle |publisher=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=August 12, 2005 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his work has been on violations of fundamental symmetries, the physics of dark energy, modifications of general relativity, and the arrow of time. Recently he started focusing on issues at the foundations of cosmology, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and complexity.

Sean Carroll and Alan Wallace on The Nature of Reality&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he and [[Shadi Bartsch]] taught an undergraduate course title at the University of Chicago on the history of atheism. In 2012 he organized the workshop "Moving Naturalism Forward", which brought together scientists and philosophers to discuss issues associated with a [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic]] worldview.  His article "Does the Universe Need God?" in ''[[The Blackwell Companion to Science and Christianity]]'' develops the claim that science no longer needs to posit a divine being to explain the existence of the universe.  The article generated significant attention when it was discussed on ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walchover, Natalie.

Huffington Post. Retrieved 2012-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; His 2016 book ''[[The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning and the Universe Itself]] ''develops the philosophy of [[poetic naturalism]].

Carroll occasionally takes part in formal debates or discussions with theists. In 2012, he teamed up with [[Michael Shermer]] to debate with Ian Hutchinson of MIT and author [[Dinesh D'Souza]] at Caltech in an event titled "The Great Debate: Has Science Refuted Religion?"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Sean M.

The topic of debate was "The Existence of God in Light of Contemporary Cosmology." Carroll received an "Emperor Has No Clothes" award at the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] Annual National Convention in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/outreach/convention/2014-convention|title=2014 National Convention - Los Angeles - Freedom From Religion Foundation|date=June 26, 2014|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626035855/http://ffrf.org/outreach/convention/2014-convention|archivedate=June 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommy David Morrison''' (January 2, 1969 – September 1, 2013) was an American [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1988 to 1996, and held the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[heavyweight]] title in 1993. He retired from boxing in 1996 when he tested positive for [[HIV]], but returned for two more fights in 2007 and 2008. Morrison is also known for his acting role when he starred alongside [[Sylvester Stallone]] in the 1990 film ''[[Rocky V]]''.

Morrison had previously attempted a comeback to boxing in 2006, claiming he had tested negative for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2850518 |title=Morrison's blood tests negative for second time – boxing |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, Morrison's mother announced that her son was in the final stages of [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1136426/tommy-morrison-ex-world-champion-dies-at-44 |title=Tommy Morrison: Ex-World Champion Dies At 44 |publisher=Sky News |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he died on September 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/10/tommy_morrison_aids_death_hiv_denialism_victims_in_south_africa_and_the.html|title=Deadly Disbelief: The myth that HIV does not cause AIDS seems to have claimed another victim|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and amateur career==
Morrison was born in [[Gravette, Arkansas]]. His mother, Diana, was of Native American descent, while his father's side was of majority [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Morrison obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/11/tommy-morrison|accessdate=4 January 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison was raised in [[Delaware County, Oklahoma]], spending most of his teenage years in [[Jay, Oklahoma|Jay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecruelestsport.com/2013/09/03/soon-youll-see-stars-fevered-tommy-morrison-1969-2013/] Retrieved 2014-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison's nickname, "The Duke", is based on the claim that he was related to Hollywood star [[John Wayne]] (né Marion Morrison).&lt;ref name="Doom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Doom Comes Whipping Down Plain|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=February 14, 1996|first= Vic|last=Ziegel|authorlink=Vic Ziegel }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison's older brother Tim Jr boxed and his father urged him to take up the sport at the age of ten. At the age of 13, Morrison claimed he used a fake ID and entered fifteen "toughman" contests (the minimum age for contestants was 21). He later told ''The [[New York Times]]'' that he lost only one of these matches.&lt;ref name=NYTNotebook&gt;{{cite news|title=Cayton's Corner Attracts Rising Heavyweight Puncher|publisher=New York Times|date=May 3, 1989|first=Phil|last=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Morrison won the Regional Heavyweight Title – Kansas City Golden Gloves from Donald Ellis and advanced to the National Golden Gloves in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where he lost a split decision to Derek Isaman. Two weeks later, Morrison took part in the Western Olympic trials in [[Houston, Texas]] winning the Heavyweight Title and garnering the "Most Outstanding Fighter" of the tournament. Two weeks after that at the Olympic Trials in [[Concord, California]], Morrison lost a split decision to [[Ray Mercer]], who later won the gold medal at the [[Seoul Olympics]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt; His combined professional and amateur record is 343–24–1, with 315 wins by knockout.

==Professional career==
{{further|Ray Mercer vs. Tommy Morrison|George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison|Tommy Morrison vs. Michael Bentt|Lennox Lewis vs. Tommy Morrison}}
Morrison started his professional boxing career on November 10, 1988,&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat Putnam|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138531/index.htm|title=Tommy Morrison – 06.21.93|publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com|date=1993-06-21|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a first-round knockout of William Muhammad in New York City. Three weeks later, he scored another first-round knockout. In 1989, Morrison had 19 wins and no losses, 15 by [[knockout]]. In 1989, actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] observed one of Morrison's bouts. Stallone arranged a script reading and cast Morrison in the movie ''[[Rocky V]]'' as [[Tommy Gunn (character)|Tommy "The Machine" Gunn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rocky V' Has Drama Coaches in Its Corner : Film: Acting teachers are traditionally barred from movie sets. But for Stallone's latest boxing epic, a Studio City couple was allowed to show newcomer Tommy Morrison the ropes, scene by scene and blow by blow.|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=November 16, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-16/entertainment/ca-4790_1_tommy-morrison|accessdate=2010-10-29|first=Gary|last=Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; a young and talented protege of the retired [[Rocky Balboa]]. He took a six-month break from boxing to work on the movie in 1990.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

In 1991, Morrison won fights against opponents [[James Tillis]] and former world champion [[Pinklon Thomas]]. He was given an opportunity to face fellow undefeated fighter [[Ray Mercer]], the WBO title holder in a [[Pay Per View]] card held on October 18, 1991. Morrison suffered the first loss of his career, losing by 5th-round knockout.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

He had six wins in 1992, including fights with [[Art Tucker]] and [[Joe Hipp]], who later became the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to challenge for the world heavyweight title. In the Hipp fight, held June 19, 1992, Morrison was suffering from what was later discovered to be a broken hand and broken jaw, but rallied to score a knockout in the ninth round. After two wins in 1993, including one over two-time world title challenger [[Carl Williams (boxer)|Carl "The Truth" Williams]], Morrison found himself fighting for the [[WBO]] title again, against heavyweight boxing legend [[George Foreman]], who was himself making a comeback.

Morrison chose to avoid brawling with Foreman and spent the fight boxing from long range. He was able to hit and move effectively in this manner, and after a closely contested bout he won a unanimous 12-round decision and the [[WBO]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TOM FRIEND|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/08/sports/boxing-morrison-defeats-foreman-by-decision.html?src=pm|title=BOXING; Morrison Defeats Foreman By Decision|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=1993-06-08|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison's first title defense was scheduled against [[Mike Williams (boxer)|Mike Williams]], but when Williams withdrew on the night of the fight, Tim Tomashek stood in as a replacement. Although Tomashek had been prepared to fight as a backup plan, some news reports created the impression that he had just been pulled out of the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Newman/Newman020404.htm Doghouse Boxing (2004-02-04)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231045549/http://doghouseboxing.com/Newman/Newman020404.htm |date=2009-12-31 }}; retrieved December 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The WBO later rescinded their sanctioning of this fight due to Tomashek's lack of experience. Almost immediately, talks of a fight with [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Lennox Lewis]] began, but were halted when virtually unknown [[Michael Bentt]] upset Morrison in his next bout. Bentt knocked Morrison down three times, and the fight was stopped in the first round in front of a live [[HBO Boxing]] audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/30/sports/boxing-morrison-loses-fight-7.5-million.html?src=pm|title=BOXING; Morrison Loses Fight, $7.5 Million|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=1993-10-30|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison recovered by winning three bouts in a row in 1994, but his last fight of the year, against [[Ross Puritty]], ended with a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=GERALD ESKENAZI|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/29/sports/boxing-morrison-and-mercer-it-s-2-fights-2-draws.html|title=BOXING;Morrison and Mercer: It's 2 Fights, 2 Draws|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=1994-07-29|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison won three fights in 1995 before meeting former #1 contender [[Donovan Ruddock|Razor Ruddock]]. Ruddock dropped Morrison to his knees in the first round, but Morrison recovered to force a standing count in round two and compete on even terms for five rounds. In the sixth round, Ruddock hurt Morrison with a quick combination, but just as it seemed Morrison was in trouble, he countered with a tremendous hook that put Ruddock on the canvas. Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF3F2C8185DDC1&amp;p_field_direct-0=d|title=MORRISON'S WIN OVER RUDDOCK A CAREER BOOST|work=Palm Beach Post|date=June 12, 1995|page=2C|via=Nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The much-anticipated fight with Lewis, who had also lost his world championship, finally took place following the Ruddock match. Morrison was knocked out in the sixth round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CLIFTON BROWN|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/08/sports/boxing-lewis-back-in-picture-with-morrison-tko.html?src=pm|title=BOXING;Lewis Back in Picture With Morrison T.K.O.|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=1995-10-08|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At one point in 1996 Morrison was married to two women at the same time, Dawn Freeman and Dawn Gilbert. Morrison had two children by age 19.&lt;ref&gt;''ESPN'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/magazine/archives/news/story?page=magazine-20030331-article28 That Was Then], July 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy and Trisha Morrison were married in 2011. They had no children. He has two sons who are also professional boxers, Trey Lippe Morrison and James McKenzie Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fighthype.com/news/article30425.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/17548218/heavyweight-prospect-trey-lippe-morrison-making-tv-debut-month&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
In 1996, Morrison was scheduled to fight against Arthur Weathers. The [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] determined that Morrison had tested positive for [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=lat021696&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-16/sports/sp-36635_1_tommy-morrison|title=A New Fight: After Second HIV Test Is Positive, Reflective Morrison Takes Blame|work=The Los Angeles Times|first=Steve|last=Springer|date=February 16, 1996|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission suspended Morrison from boxing in Nevada.&lt;ref name=nyt092096&gt;{{cite news|title=Morrison Plans One More Fight Despite His H.I.V. Diagnosis|work=The New York Times|first=Selena|last=Roberts|date=September 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, Morrison's physician administered a test, which was also positive.&lt;ref name=lat021696/&gt; At a news conference on February 15, 1996, Morrison said he had contracted HIV because of a "permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle".&lt;ref name=lat021696/&gt; Morrison stated that he would "absolutely" never fight again.&lt;ref name=nyt092096/&gt;

At another news conference on September 19, 1996, in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Morrison announced he wished to fight "one last time" when he could find an opponent, the proceeds of which would benefit his KnockOut AIDS Foundation.&lt;ref name=nyt092096/&gt; A spokesman for the Oklahoma Professional Boxing Advisory Board said Morrison would probably not be permitted to fight in [[Oklahoma]] because of his Nevada suspension.&lt;ref name=ts092096&gt;{{cite news |title=Morrison wants final fight to help children with AIDS|work=The Toronto Star|date=September 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; To treat his infection, Morrison said he took [[antiretroviral]] medication, which reduced his [[viral load]] to almost undetectable levels.&lt;ref name=nydn110701&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-11-07/sports/18356893_1_hiv-boxer-tommy-morrison-wbo-heavyweight-title|title=For Tommy, Life Has Been Rocky Stands Tall After Virus Scores Tko|work=The New York Daily News|first=Tim|last=Smith|date=November 7, 2001|accessdate=June 9, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028134534/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-11-07/sports/18356893_1_hiv-boxer-tommy-morrison-wbo-heavyweight-title|archivedate=October 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Morrison said his HIV tests had been [[false positive]]s.&lt;ref name=ESPNJune2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2899260|title=Morrison faces new allegations from former associate|work=ESPN Boxing|date=June 10, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nevada commission's medical advisory board reviewed Morrison's 1996 test results and concluded they were "ironclad and unequivocal."&lt;ref name="HIVTest2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2007-06-21-Morrison_N.htm|title=Morrison fights claims of recent positive HIV test|work=USA Today|date=June 22, 2007|first=Chuck|last=Johnson|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison said he tried to get a copy of the original test result but was unable to do so, adding: "I don't think it ever existed." The Commission said Morrison could "contact the laboratory, and they would immediately release the results to him."&lt;ref name="HIVTest2007"/&gt;
 
Morrison tested negative for HIV four times in January 2007.&lt;ref name=boxing011507&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/index.php?m=show&amp;id=6947|title=Morrison tests negative for HIV, fight delayed|work=BoxingScene|date=January 15, 2007|first=Mark|last=Vester|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he began fighting again.&lt;ref name=guardian022307&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/02/23/the_great_white_hope_climbs_ba.html|title=The Great White Hope climbs back between the ropes|publisher=The Guardian|date=February 23, 2007|first=Oliver|last=Irish|accessdate=2009-07-01|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN2772386&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2772386|title=Morrison medically cleared to fight Thursday|work=ESPN Boxing|first=Dan|last=Rafael|date=February 20, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN2775863&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2775863|title=Morrison begins comeback bid with KO|work=ESPN Boxing |first=Dan|last=Rafael|date=February 23, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing medical tests in [[Texas]], [[West Virginia]] licensed Morrison to fight in that state. In February 2007 he fought and beat John Castle.&lt;ref name=guardian022307/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN2772386/&gt; In June, Morrison's former agent, Randy Lang, alleged that Morrison had tested positive in January and that the boxer had tampered with blood samples. Morrison responded that he had fired Lang when he discovered that Lang was not a lawyer.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Elizabeth|title=Morrison faces new allegations from former associate|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2899260|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2007, the ''New York Times'' reported that Morrison took two HIV tests in 2007 and a third specifically for the ''Times''.&lt;ref name=nyt072207&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/sports/othersports/22boxing.html?pagewanted=all|title=Morrison Says Error in H.I.V.

But ringside doctors, including Nevada's chief ringside physician, expressed doubt. They implied that the negative results were not in fact based on Morrison's blood. The experts agreed that no one is ever cured of HIV; if the negative tests from 2007 were performed on Morrison's blood, then he had never been infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=nyt072207/&gt;

The ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' described his early 2009 fight in [[Wyoming]] as a "staged" event and a "fake fight."&lt;ref name=StarFeb2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Morrison insists he can box and doesn't have HIV|work=Kansas City Star|first=Sam|last=Mellinger|date=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the RACJ, the boxing commission for the province of [[Quebec]], required that Morrison take a supervised HIV test in advance of a scheduled 2011 fight. Morrison declined to take the test because he said it would be the same kind of test administered by Nevada in 1996. Instead, Morrison invited the Quebec commission to attend a public test, but the commission did not come. Morrison stated that if Quebec refused to license him, he would "take the dog and pony show somewhere else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/morrison-says-no-to-testing-72730|title=Morrison says no to testing|work=Fightnews.com|first=Dave|last=Spencer|date=January 19, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123070228/http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/morrison-says-no-to-testing-72730|archivedate=January 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
In December 1993, Morrison was charged with assault and public intoxication when he allegedly punched a [[University of Iowa]] student. Morrison said that the student had been staring at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morrison KOs student in restaurant |work=Baltimore Sun |agency=Associated Press |date=December 8, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison pleaded guilty and paid a $310 fine, but said he was innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morrison pleads guilty to assault |work=Tulsa World |date=January 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1996, Morrison pleaded guilty to transporting a loaded firearm in [[Jay, Oklahoma]]; he received a 6-month suspended sentence and a $100 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More Boxing |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=October 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, an Oklahoma jury convicted him of [[DUI]] in an accident that left three people injured; the court ordered Morrison to spend time in treatment.&lt;ref name=cbs021109&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/26/sports/main71883.shtml|title=T. Morrison In Trouble Again|work=CBS News|date=February 11, 2009|accessdate=June 10, 2012|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, an Oklahoma court gave a two-year suspended sentence for a DUI elevated to felony level by his previous DUI conviction. On September 16, 1999, the police stopped Morrison for driving erratically and found drugs and weapons in his car, which resulted in various drugs and firearms charges. While awaiting trial on the September 16 charges, Morrison was again arrested on charges of intoxication and possessing a weapon while a felon in November 1999.&lt;ref name=cbs021109/&gt; On January 14, 2000, Morrison was sentenced to two years in prison on the September 16 charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Morrison's release delayed because of discipline problem|work=AP Online|first=Melissa|last=Nelson|date=January 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, 2002, he was sentenced to another year in prison after violating parole in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], but was given credit for time previously served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Events in Tommy Morrison's boxing career|work=Kansas City Star|date=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In August 2013, Elizabeth Merrill of [[ESPN]].com reported that Morrison's mother Diana disclosed that Tommy had "full-blown [[AIDS]]" and was "in his final days." She also stated that Morrison had been bedridden for over a year. The same article also stated that Morrison's wife, Trisha, did not believe Morrison had AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9588582/tommy-morrison-latest-big-fight|title=Tommy Morrison's latest big fight|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2013-08-23|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/9626860/ex-heavyweight-champ-tommy-morrison-dies-44|title=Tommy Morrison dies at 44|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2008-01-01|accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2013, Morrison died at the [[Nebraska Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] at the age of 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skretta|first=Dave|title=Ex-heavyweight champion Tommy Morrison dies at 44|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/09/02/boxer-tommy-morrison-dies-at-44/2755083/|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Nebraska Department of Health &amp; Human Services]], Morrison's cause of death was cardiac arrest, resulting from [[multiorgan failure]] due to [[septic shock]] caused by a ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morrison death certificate: No Mention Of AIDS|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/05/tommy-morrison-death-certificate-blood-infection-aids-hiv|publisher=TMZ|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In [[Polynesian mythology|mythology]] of [[Mangaia]] and the [[southern Cook Islands]], '''Vatea''' is the father of gods and men. His mother is [[Varima-te-takere]], who lives deep in [[Avaiki]], the underworld. She plucks off a piece from her right side and it becomes Vatea or [[Avatea]]. 

In Mangaian myth, a beautiful woman visits Vatea in his dreams, and he is certain that she ascends from the [[underworld]] to his side, but when he wakes he can never find her. He strews scraped [[coconut]] about, and, at last, watchers see a slender hand reach for the delicious food. Vatea catches her and discovers that her name is [[Papa (mythology)|Papa]], and marries her. [[Tangaroa]] and [[Rongo]] are their twin sons. Rongo's wife bears a daughter named Tavake. Tavake gives birth to Rangi, Mokoiro, and to Akatauira. Rangi pulls up Mangaia from the underworld, and becomes the first king of the island. His wife's name is Te-po-tatango (Tregear 1891:392).

'''Émile Peynaud''' (June 29, 1912 – July 18, 2004) was a French [[oenologist]] and researcher who has been credited with revolutionizing [[winemaking]] in the latter half of the 20th century, and has been called "the forefather of modern oenology".&lt;ref name=decaobit&gt;{{Cite web|last= Styles| first= Oliver, ''Decanter'' |title= Emile Peynaud dies at 92 |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/56475.html  |date=  2004-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Peynaud entered the wine trade at the age of fifteen with the négociant [[Maison Calvet]].&lt;ref name=decaobit/&gt; At Calvet he worked under the chemical engineer [[Jean Ribéreau-Gayon]], and they developed methods of analysing the wines that were to be purchased. In 1946, Peynaud completed his Doctorate at the [[University of Bordeaux]] and joined its faculty as a lecturer. Ribéreau-Gayon at this time was also teaching at the University, and the two shifted their previous focus of problems faced by Calvet to the problems faced by the winemakers themselves.

While at the University of Bordeaux, where he became a [[professor]] of oenology, Peynaud worked at providing scientific explanations for many problems encountered in the process of winemaking. He convinced the [[winery|wineries]] to begin picking of grapes at [[vineyard]]s up to two weeks later than usual, and to complete the picking as quickly as possible. The practice of also picking underripe or rotten grapes was abandoned, so that the selected fruit arriving at the winery was of the best possible quality.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

Peynaud introduced crushing and [[fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] fruit in separate batches based on vine age, vineyard location, or any other factor that resulted in fruit of differing qualities in order to control tannin extraction. He then applied the cool fermentations used in [[Champagne]] to still white [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] in order to control fermentation temperatures.

Proposing methods that ran counter to many traditions, in the 1950s and 1960s skeptics would use the term "Peynaudization" of Bordeaux, but as his advice usually produced superior wines, criticism came to an end.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

Peynaud considered the control of [[malolactic fermentation]] to be one of his most important contributions to winemaking. It was commonly believed that malolactic fermentation was a sickness. He helped the wineries realize that they needed to encourage and control malolactic fermentation. He also stated, "Using only the very best grapes is a new phenomenon," considering this "the crowning achievement of [his] work."&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{Cite web|last= Steinberger| first= Mike, ''Slate'' |title= The distorted legacy of Émile Peynaud |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2104553/|date=  2004-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peynaud was the ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]'' Man of the Year in 1990.&lt;ref name=decaobit/&gt; [[Michel Rolland]] is one of his pupils.
