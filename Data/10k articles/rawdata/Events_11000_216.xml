'''Aeschylus''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|iː|s|k|ɪ|l|ə|s}},&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel; Roach, Peter, James Hartman and Jane Setter, eds. ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary''. 17th edition. Cambridge UP, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɛ|s|k|ɪ|l|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/aeschylus "Aeschylus"]. ''[[Webster's New World College Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Αἰσχύλος}} ''Aiskhylos'', {{IPA-el|ai̯s.kʰý.los|pron}}; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an [[Greek tragedy|ancient Greek tragedian]]. He is often described as the father of tragedy.&lt;ref name="F243"&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel, August Wilhelm von]] |page=121 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7148 |title=Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature|date=December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work,&lt;ref&gt;R. Lattimore, ''Aeschylus I: Oresteia'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cropp, 'Lost Tragedies: A Survey'; ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], he expanded the number of characters in the theater and allowed conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The remnant of a commemorative inscription, dated to the 3rd century BC, lists four, possibly eight, dramatic poets (probably including Choerilus, Phrynichus, and Pratinas) who had won tragic victories at the Dionysia before Aeschylus had. [[Thespis]] was traditionally regarded the inventor of tragedy. According to another tradition, tragedy was established in Athens in the late 530s BC, but that may simply reflect an absence of records. Major innovations in dramatic form, credited to Aeschylus by Aristotle and the anonymous source ''The Life of Aeschylus'', may be exaggerations and should be viewed with caution (Martin Cropp (2006), "Lost Tragedies: A Survey" in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', pp. 272–74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived, and there is a long-standing [[Prometheus Bound#Debate over authenticity|debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which some believe his son [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] actually wrote. Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotations and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian [[papyrus]], often giving us surprising insights into his work.&lt;ref&gt;P. Levi, ''Greek Drama'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy; his ''[[Oresteia]]'' is the only ancient example of the form to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Aeschylean Tragedy'', 215&lt;/ref&gt; At least one of his plays was influenced by the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persians' second invasion of Greece]] (480–479 BC). This work, ''[[The Persians]]'', is the only surviving classical Greek tragedy concerned with contemporary events (very few of that kind were ever written),&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Aeschylean Tragedy'', 221&lt;/ref&gt; and a useful source of information about its period. The significance of war in Ancient Greek culture was so great that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus's work – particularly the ''Oresteia'' ''–'' is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.

==Life==
[[File:Aeschylus Bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Aeschylus at [[North Carolina Museum of Art]]]]

Aeschylus was born in c.&amp;nbsp;525 BC in [[Eleusis]], a small town about 27&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of [[Athens]], which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western [[Attica]],&lt;ref name="S33"&gt;{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996 |p=33}}{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established; his father, Euphorion, was a member of the [[Eupatridae]], the ancient nobility of Attica,&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{harvnb |Bates |1906 |pp=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this might be a fiction that the ancients invented to account for the grandeur of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Eschylean tragedy'', 217&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, he worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the god [[Dionysus]] visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499&amp;nbsp;BC, when he was only 26 years old.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; He won his first victory at the [[City Dionysia]] in 484&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt;&lt;ref name="F241"&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 510 BC, when Aeschylus was 15 years old, [[Cleomenes I]] expelled the sons of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]] from Athens, and [[Cleisthenes]] came to power. Cleisthenes' reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the [[deme]] over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of [[Eleusis]].&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"&gt;Kopff 1997 pp. 1–472&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Persian Wars]] played a large role in the playwright's life and career. In 490&amp;nbsp;BC, Aeschylus and his brother [[Cynegeirus]] fought to defend Athens against the invading army of [[Darius I of Persia]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; The Athenians emerged triumphant, a victory celebrated across the city-states of Greece.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; Cynegeirus, however, died in the battle, receiving a mortal wound while trying to prevent a Persian ship retreating from the shore, for which his countrymen extolled him as a hero.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

In 480 BC, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes&amp;nbsp;I]]'s invading forces at the [[Battle of Salamis]], and perhaps, too, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479 BC.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; [[Ion of Chios]] was a witness for Aeschylus's war record and his contribution in Salamis.&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472" /&gt; Salamis holds a prominent place in ''The Persians'', his oldest surviving [[Play (theatre)|play]], which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the [[Dionysia]].&lt;ref name="S34"&gt;{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996 |p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who were initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], an ancient cult of [[Demeter]] based in his home town of Eleusis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Martin |2000 |loc=§10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites, likely concerning the afterlife. Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to [[Aristotle]], Aeschylus was accused of revealing some of the cult's secrets on stage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1111a8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. [[Heracleides of Pontus]] asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]] helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472" /&gt;

Aeschylus travelled to [[Sicily]] once or twice in the 470s&amp;nbsp;BC, having been invited by [[Hiero&amp;nbsp;I of Syracuse]], a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island; and during one of these trips he produced ''The Women of Aetna'' (in honor of the city founded by Hieron) and restaged his ''Persians''.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; By 473&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]], one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; In 472&amp;nbsp;BC, Aeschylus staged the production that included the ''Persians'', with [[Pericles]] serving as ''[[choregos]]''.&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death of Aeschylus in Florentine Picture Chronicle.jpg|thumb|The death of Aeschylus illustrated in the 15th century ''Florentine Picture Chronicle'' by [[Maso Finiguerra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Meditation in Solitude |author=Ursula Hoff |journal=Journal of the Warburg Institute |volume=1 |year=1938 |pages=292–294 |jstor=749994 |issue=44 |doi=10.2307/749994}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of [[Gela]] where he died in 456 or 455&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Valerius Maximus]] wrote that he was killed outside the city by a [[tortoise]] dropped by an eagle (possibly a [[lammergeier]] or [[Cinereous vulture]], which do feed on tortoises by dropping them on hard objects&lt;ref&gt;del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J., eds. (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. 2. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions. p. 107. {{ISBN|84-87334-15-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) which had mistaken his bald head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile.&lt;ref name=CGC/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiæ]]'', adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy that he would be killed by a falling object.&lt;ref name=CGC&gt;{{citation |page=136 |quote=The unusual nature of Aeschylus's death&amp;nbsp;... |title=A Cabinet of Greek Curiosities: Strange Tales and Surprising Facts from the Cradle of Western Civilization |author =J. C. McKeown |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-998210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Critchley 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;

The inscription on Aeschylus's gravestone makes no mention of his [[Theatre|theatrical]] renown, commemorating only his military achievements:

|}
According to Castoriadis, the inscription on his grave signifies the primary importance of "belonging to the City" ([[polis]]), of the solidarity that existed within the collective body of citizen-soldiers.

==Personal life==
Aeschylus married and had two sons, [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] and Euaeon, both of whom became tragic poets. Euphorion won first prize in 431 BC in competition against both [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The complete idiot's guide to classical mythology|author1=Osborn, K.  |author2=Burges, D.|page=|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-02-862385-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His nephew, [[Philocles]] (his sister's son), was also a tragic poet, and won first prize in the competition against [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{harvnb |Smith |2005 |p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus had at least two brothers, [[Cynegeirus]] and [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]].

==Works==
[[Image:Athen Dionysos-Theater.JPG|thumb|250px|Modern picture of the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], where many of Aeschylus's plays were performed]]
[[File:Tragediae septem.tif|thumb|''Tragoediae septem'' (1552)]]
The roots of Greek drama are in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; During Aeschylus's lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the [[City Dionysia]] in the spring.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; The festival opened with a procession, followed with a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions.&lt;ref name="F242"&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in, consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic [[satyr play]].&lt;ref name=F242/&gt; A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.&lt;ref name=F242/&gt;

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him.&lt;ref name="F243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P222"/&gt; Only seven tragedies have survived intact: ''[[The Persians]]'', ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'', ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'', the trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[The Eumenides#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', together with ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (whose authorship is disputed). With the exception of this last play&amp;nbsp;– the success of which is uncertain&amp;nbsp;– all of Aeschylus's [[Extant literature|extant]] tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia.

The Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'' claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays.

===Trilogies===
One hallmark of Aeschylean [[dramaturgy]] appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Oresteia]]'' is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.

For example, the ''Oresteia'''s satyr play ''[[Proteus]]'' treated the story of Menelaus'  detour in Egypt on his way home from the [[Trojan War]]. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, [[scholia]], and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: ''Seven against Thebes'' being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and ''The Suppliants'' and ''Prometheus Bound'' each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)|Achilleis]]'', comprised the titles ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately, ''The Ransoming of Hector'').

Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (''Memnon'' and ''The Weighing of Souls'' being two components of the trilogy); ''The Award of the Arms'', ''The Phrygian Women'', and ''The Salaminian Women'' suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero [[Ajax the great|Ajax]]; Aeschylus also seems to have written about [[Odysseus]]' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife [[Penelope]]'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of ''The Soul-raisers'', ''Penelope'' and ''The Bone-gatherers''. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (''Argô'', ''Lemnian Women'', ''Hypsipylê''); the life of Perseus (''The Net-draggers'', ''Polydektês'', ''Phorkides''); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (''Semele'', ''Bacchae'', ''Pentheus''); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in ''Seven against Thebes'' (''Eleusinians'', ''Argives'' (or ''Argive Women''), ''Sons of the Seven'').&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving plays==
===''The Persians''===
{{Main|The Persians}}
[[File:Dariuslarge.jpg|thumb|right|''The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa'', drawing by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].]]
The earliest of his plays to survive is ''The Persians'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name="F244"&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event.&lt;ref name=F243/&gt; ''The Persians'' focuses on the popular Greek theme of ''[[hubris]]'' by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt;

It opens with the arrival of a messenger in [[Susa]], the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to [[Atossa]], the mother of the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the [[Hellespont]], an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.&lt;ref name="Vellacott"&gt;Vellacott: 7–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seven against Thebes''===
{{Main|Seven against Thebes}}
''Seven against Thebes'' (''Hepta epi Thebas''), which was performed in 467 BC, has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; It also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus's work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the [[polis]] (the city) being a key development of human civilization.&lt;ref name="F244246"&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |pp=244–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play tells the story of [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]], the sons of the shamed King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]]. The sons agree to alternate in the throne of the city, but after the first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown. The brothers kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers.&lt;ref name="Aeschylus pp.7–19"&gt;Aeschylus. "Prometheus Bound, The Suppliants, Seven Against Thebes, The Persians." Philip Vellacott's Introduction, pp. 7–19. Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices; and finally, Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict.&lt;ref name="Aeschylus pp.7–19"/&gt; The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy; the first two plays were ''Laius'' and ''Oedipus''. The concluding [[satyr play]] was ''The Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Suppliants''===
{{Main|The Suppliants (Aeschylus)}}
[[Image:Danaïdes tuant leurs maris BnF Français 874 fol. 170v.jpg|thumb|left|Miniature by [[Robinet Testard]] showing the [[Danaids]] murdering their husbands]]
Aeschylus continued his emphasis on the polis with ''The Suppliants'' in 463 BC (''Hiketides''), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens in advance of the establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the [[Danaids]], the fifty daughters of [[Danaus]], founder of [[Argos]], flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King [[Pelasgus]] of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.&lt;ref name="F246"&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 publication of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2256 fr. 3 confirmed a long-assumed (because of ''The Suppliants''' cliffhanger ending) Danaid trilogy, whose constituent plays are generally agreed to be ''The Suppliants'', ''The Egyptians'' and ''The Danaids''. A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy's last two-thirds runs thus:&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Sommerstein 1996, 141–51; Turner 2001, 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Egyptians'', the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos. He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder their husbands on their wedding night. His daughters agree. ''The Danaids'' would open the day after the wedding.&lt;ref name="Sommerstein 2002, 89"&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape. Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution. In the trilogy's climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle). He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled ''Amymone'', after one of the Danaids.&lt;ref name="Sommerstein 2002, 89"/&gt;

===''The Oresteia''===
{{Main|Oresteia}}
The only complete [[trilogy]] of Greek plays by any playwright still extant (save a few missing lines in several spots) is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC), although the satyr play that originally followed it, ''[[Proteus]]'', is lost except for some fragments.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; The trilogy consists of ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], King of [[Argos]].

====''Agamemnon''====
[[Image:Gérin Clytemnestre hésitant avant de frapper Agamemnon endormi Louvre 5185.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Murder of Agamemnon'' by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]] (1817)]]

Aeschylus begins in Greece describing the return of King [[Agamemnon]] from his victory in the [[Trojan War]], from the perspective of the towns people (the Chorus) and his wife, [[Clytemnestra]]. However, dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter [[Iphigenia]], who was killed so that the gods would restore the winds and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess [[Cassandra]] as a concubine. Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon, and of herself, to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified. She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;''

====''The Libation Bearers''====
''The Libation Bearers'' continues the tale, opening with Orestes's arrival at Agamemnon's tomb. At the tomb, Electra meets [[Orestes]], who has returned from exile in [[Phocis]], and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthus]].  Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order [[Electra]], her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the [[Erinyes|Furies]], who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;

====''The Eumenides''====
The final play of ''The Oresteia'' addresses the question of Orestes' guilt.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder. The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide.&lt;ref name=F246/&gt;

The Furies track him down, and the goddess [[Athena]], patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes' case and, after the judges, including Athena deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies  ''The Eumenides'' (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in ''The Suppliants'', the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.&lt;ref name=F246/&gt;

===''Prometheus Bound''===
{{Main|Prometheus Bound}}
[[File:Dirck van Baburen - Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan Rijksmuseum SK-A-1606.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1623)]]

In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, ''Prometheus Bound'', is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Griffith |1983 |pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] is bound to a rock as punishment from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Zeus]] for providing fire to humans. The god [[Hephaestus]], the Titan [[Oceanus]], and the [[greek chorus|chorus]] of [[Oceanids]] all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight. Prometheus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could prove Zeus' downfall.&lt;ref name=Vellacott/&gt;

The ''Prometheus Bound'' appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the ''[[Prometheia]]''. In the second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'', Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the [[Titanomachy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;For a discussion of the trilogy's reconstruction, see (e.g.) Conacher 1980, 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'', it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph [[Thetis]], for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Lost plays==
Only the titles and assorted fragments of Aeschylus's other plays have come down to us.  We have enough fragments of some plays (along with comments made by later authors and scholiasts) to produce rough synopses of their plots.

===''Myrmidons''===
This play was based on books 9 and 16 in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon's hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile him to [[Agamemnon]], but he yields only to his friend [[Patroclus]], who then battles the Trojans in Achilles' armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger's speech, which is followed by mourning.&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

===''Nereids''===
This play was based on books 18, 19, and 22 of the ''Iliad''; it follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, who lament Patroclus' death. In the play, a messenger tells how Achilles, perhaps reconciled to Agamemnon and the Greeks, slew [[Hector]].&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

===''Phrygians'', or ''Hector's Ransom''===
In this play, Achilles sits in silent mourning over Patroclus, after a brief discussion with [[Hermes]]. Hermes then brings in [[Priam|King Priam of Troy]], who wins over Achilles and ransoms his son's body in a spectacular [[wikt:coup de théâtre|coup de théâtre]]. A scale is brought on stage and Hector's body is placed in one scale and gold in the other. The dynamic dancing of the chorus of Trojans when they enter with Priam is reported by [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

===''Niobe''===
The children of [[Niobe]], the heroine, have been slain by [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]] because Niobe had gloated that she had more children than their mother, [[Leto]]. Niobe sits in silent mourning on stage during most of the play. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] quotes the line "God plants a fault in mortals when he wills to destroy a house utterly."&lt;ref name="Kopff 1997 pp.1-472"/&gt;

==Influence==
===Influence on Greek drama and culture===
[[Image:Mosaic Orestes Iphigenia Musei Capitolini MC4948.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], main character in Aeschylus's only surviving trilogy, ''[[The Oresteia]]'']]
When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like [[Thespis]] had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].&lt;ref name="P222"&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role.&lt;ref name=P222/&gt; He is sometimes credited with introducing ''skenographia'', or scene-decoration,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Vitruvius]]. See Summers 2007, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (''cothurni'') to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aeschylus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His plays were written in verse, no violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in far-away locales.&lt;ref name="P223"&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis.&lt;ref name=P223/&gt; The ''Oresteia'' trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] gives him in ''[[The Frogs]]'', produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his ''Seven against Thebes'' "made everyone watching it to love being warlike"; with his ''Persians'', Aeschylus claims at lines 1026–7 that he "taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies." Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff. that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.

===Influence outside Greek culture===
Aeschylus's works were influential beyond his own time. [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] draws attention to [[Richard Wagner]]'s reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his ''Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia'' (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's ''Ring'' and Aeschylus's ''Oresteia''. A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Furness, Raymond |title=The Modern Language Review |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=79 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages= 239–40 |jstor=3730399 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/3730399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[J. T. Sheppard]] argues in the second half of his ''Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence'' that Aeschylus, along with [[Sophocles]], have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aeschylus and Sophocles: their Work and Influence |journal=[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=265 |year=1927 |doi=10.2307/625177 |last=Sheppard |first=J. T. |authorlink=J. T. Sheppard |jstor=625177 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene O'Neill]]'s [[Mourning Becomes Electra]] (1931), a trilogy of three plays set in America after the Civil War, is modeled after the ''Oresteia''. Prior to writing his acclaimed trilogy, O'Neill had been developing a play about Aeschylus himself, and he noted that Aeschylus "so changed the system of the tragic stage that he has more claim than anyone else to be regarded as the founder (Father) of Tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Virginia, ed. ''Eugene O'Neill at Work''. New York: Frederick Ungar, 1981, p. 213. {{ISBN|0-8044-2205-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidential campaign in 1968, Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] quoted the [[Edith Hamilton]] translation of Aeschylus on the night of the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Kennedy was notified of King's murder before a campaign stop in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] and was warned not to attend the event due to fears of [[riot]]ing from the mostly [[African-American]] crowd. Kennedy insisted on attending and delivered an [[Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|impromptu speech]] that delivered news of King's death to the crowd.&lt;ref name="flickr.com"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3645184605/ Virginia&amp;nbsp;– Arlington National Cemetery: Robert F. Kennedy Gravesite]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}

Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy referred to his own grief at the murder of his brother, President [[John F. Kennedy]] and, quoting a passage from the play ''Agamemnon'' (in translation), said: "My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black&amp;nbsp;... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world." The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.&lt;ref name="flickr.com"/&gt;{{better source|date=February 2017}}

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
The '''Battle of al-Babein''' took place on March 18, 1167, during the third [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|Crusader invasion of Egypt]]. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], and a [[Zengid]] army under [[Shirkuh]], both hoped to take the control of [[Egypt]] over from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. [[Saladin]] served as Shirkuh’s highest-ranking officer in the battle. The result was a tactical draw between the forces.

==Background==

After the death of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], his son, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]] came to power in [[Aleppo]]. In 1154, he gained control of [[Damascus]] when there was no one in power over the city.  He became the first [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] leader since the 1090s to unite north and south [[Syria]]. Nur al-Din embraced jihad ideals when battling against the Franks and was a crucial figure in the recovery of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizier [[Shawar]] had full authority over the [[Fatimids]] and was the advisor to the [[caliph]].  Shawar required the support of Nur al-Din’s generals to gain control.  Shawar turned to Shirkuh for assistance.  After Shawar found out Shirkuh’s price for fighting for him was higher than he was willing to pay, Shawar turned to Amalric.  Shirkuh was almost ready to establish territory of his own in Egypt when Amalric I invaded.  After several months of campaigning, Shrikuh was forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, Andrew.  Crusading and the Crusader States.  (Edinburgh Gate, Pearson Education Limited, 2004), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirkuh had the ability to conduct politics and aspired to become Nur al-Din’s right-hand man.   Shirkuh fought in the [[Battle of Inab]] in 1149.   He had killed [[Raymond of Antioch]] in the battle fighting one on one with him.  After that battle, he gained his reputation for his attention to detail and his excellence with tactics.  When Nur al-Din captured Damascus in 1154, he sent Shirkuh before the ambassadors to negotiate the terms for the border lines between Damascus and Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;Hindley 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalric I was the king of Jerusalem, and held power from 1163 to 1174.   Amalric had been an ally and nominal protector for the Fatimid government.  In 1167, Amalric wanted to destroy the Zengid army sent by Nur al-Din from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, R.C. Crusading Warfare (1097-1193). (New York, The Cambridge University Press, 1956), 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amalric depended on his [[Military order (society)|Military Orders]] for his invasion of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Orders is a Christian order of Knighthood. The Military Orders were set down for the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[the Knights Templar]] to go against pagans or Muslims, or in the Holy Lands, to anyone who persecuted the Christian beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amalric’s obsession was to take over Egypt, after first trying to befriend the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;    Later on, he decided to serve under Saladin after he declared himself sultan in 1171.&lt;ref&gt;Tyerman, Christopher. Fighting for Christendom: Holy War and the Crusades. (New York, Oxford University Press, 2004), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key participant in the battle of al-Babein was [[Saladin]].  Saladin entered the army at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;Hindley, Geoffrey. (New York, Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc.), 149&lt;/ref&gt;   At age of 18, he was promoted as personal officer to Nur al-Din. At first Saladin was reluctant to go with his uncle, Shirkuh, to take over Egypt.  Saladin only agreed to this because Shirkuh was family.  He took thousands of troops, his bodyguards, and 200,000 gold pieces to Egypt, to take over the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Hindley, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Amalric was an ally and protector of the Fatimid government, fighting in the Battle of al-Babein was in his best interest.  He invaded Egypt several times during his reign.  These campaigns were not very successful, as they always ran into complications leading to failure each time.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;   Nur al-Din organized the battle strategy on the Muslim side. Nur al-Din was the Muslim leader who unified Syria.&lt;ref name="Tyerman, 49"&gt;Tyerman, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The troops were led by Shirkuh. Since both sides wanted to be in charge of Egypt, whoever won the battle would accomplish that goal.  This contest brought on the Battle of al-Babein in 1167.

==Battle==

King Amalric ordered only his mounted forces to chase Shirkuh and the Muslims out of Egypt at the beginning of the battle. Amalric chased Shirkuh’s troops up the valley of the Nile and across the river to Giza.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, 553.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chase almost worked, but the Muslims turned to fight Amalric where the cultivated ground ended and the desert began.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The steep slopes and soft sand reduced the effectiveness of the Latin army.  King Amalric I’s  army was weakened because he only took a handful of men with him to pursue Shirkuh.  He commanded 374 armed Frankish horsemen along with the mounted archers known as [[Turcopoles]].  The Christian knights also sided with Amalric I in order to go after Shirkuh’s army.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Marshall W. A History of The Crusades. Volume 1. (Madison, The University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), 553.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirkuh came up with a plan to draw the Franks, along with Amalric, away from the battlefield.  Shirkuh’s plan was for the Latin cavalry charge to find no worthy target.   Shirkuh hoped to lessen the severity of the fight. He wanted the Franks to think that all his best men were in the center surrounding him. Among those in the center line was Saladin, Shirkuh’s nephew. Saladin, under Shrikuh’s orders, was to retreat once the Franks moved closer.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin ,553.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalric fell for Shirkuh’s plan. Amalric sent his main attack toward the center of Shirkuh’s troops. Saladin then drew Amalric and the Franks away from the battlefield.  The fight broke off into smaller skirmishes.  Some of the skirmishes were won by the Franks and others by the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Amalric returned from pursuing Saladin, he rallied his troops together.  Amalric lined up his troops and marched straight through the enemy lines, fighting all enemy opposition along the way.  Amalric then marched off the battlefield with his army.  Neither side left with a victory.  The Franks lost one hundred knights and failed to destroy Shrikuh’s army. This also cost Amalric’s chance to become the ruler of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chase's Calendar of Events''''' is an annual American publication, started in 1957 by brothers William (Bill) D. Chase (a [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] from [[Michigan]]), and Harrison V. Chase (a university [[social scientist]] from [[Florida]]).&lt;ref name="nyt-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html | title = Having a Snack?

The brothers gathered information on events and the first edition of 2,000 copies was printed for 1958. "It was 32 pages, contained 364 entries and sold for $1", while recent editions are 752 pages and contain more than 12,000 entries.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; A promotion sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce was added in 1958: a pamphlet listed commercial promotions as Special Days, Weeks and Months, and remained in future editions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Contemporary Books in Chicago, Illinois, took over publication in 1983 and the Chases retired in 1987 from compiling the calendar, which is now handled by an in-house staff of editors and researchers.

The '''Comoedienhaus theater''', first opened on 3 September 1782, and demolished in 1911, was the first [[drama]] [[theater]] and [[opera]] house built in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Frankfurt]]. Designed by renowned [[architect]] [[Johann Andreas Hardt Lieb]], the Frankfurter National-Theater (which in 1842 became the Stadttheater, later renamed Comoedienhaus) became a popular venue for entertainment, particularly among the [[middle-class]] members of Frankfurt's society, and became known, even outside of Frankfurt itself, for its dramas and operas. It remained a centre of entertainment for over 100 years, and by the mid-nineteenth century, the population of the city was so great, and the theater still so popular, that the theater was regularly completely filled, despite the relatively high expense of admission. As the first theater of performing arts in Frankfurt, it was a major contributor to the popularisation of the performing arts in Frankfurt and elsewhere in Germany.

The performances seen within the Comoedienhaus included dramas and related cabarets, operas and concerts, among other novelty performances.

Over the life of the theater, several well-known performers, musicians, and composers worked in the theater or attended its cabarets. These included [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who played several concerts there; [[F.L.Æ. Kunzen]], who was its musical director from 1792 to 1794; [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose [[Intrigue and Love]] was first performed within the theater on 15 April 1784, and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who attended several of the cabarets at the theater. Actor, writer and stage director [[Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Großmann]] also performed and directed several performances and cabarets seen at the Comoedienhaus.

The last cabaret was performed at the Comoedienhaus on 30 October 1902, 120 years after its opening, following the dwindling revenue the theater was gathering toward the end of the nineteenth century. The theater was demolished nine years later, in 1911.

The practice of '''eating live seafood''', such as fish, crab, oysters, young shrimp, or young octopus, is widespread.

| [[File:Drunken shrimp alive.jpg|120px]]
| [[Drunken shrimp]] is a popular dish in parts of China. It is based on fresh-water [[shrimp]] that are placed in a strong liquor, [[baijiu]], and then eaten, often while they are alive. Modified recipes are used in different parts of China. For example, the drunken shrimp can be cooked in boiling water instead of serving them while they are still live. In other recipes, the shrimp are boiled first and then marinated in alcohol.&lt;ref name="Hong Kong Style"&gt;[http://hk.lady.nextmedia.com/articles/art_main.cfm?sec_id=3840163&amp;subsec_id=6748448&amp;art_id=11221716&amp;showdate=20080612&amp;av=NO 醉蝦] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817230524/http://hk.lady.nextmedia.com/articles/art_main.cfm?sec_id=3840163&amp;subsec_id=6748448&amp;art_id=11221716&amp;showdate=20080612&amp;av=NO |date=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Yin Yang fish]], or ''dead-and-alive fish'', originated in Taiwan.  It is a dish which consists of a deep-fried whole fish (usually carp) that remains alive after cooking. The fish's body is cooked while its head is wrapped in a wet cloth to keep it breathing. The fish is then covered in sauce and served live on a plate.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6595481/Chinese-diners-eat-live-fish-in-YouTube-video.html|title=Chinese diners eat live fish in YouTube video|date=18 November 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710021108/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6595481/Chinese-diners-eat-live-fish-in-YouTube-video.html|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chefs say they prepare the fish this way to demonstrate its freshness to the customer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/17/eating-a-deep-fried-fish_n_360576.html|title=Eating A Deep Fried Fish That's Still Alive (VIDEO)|first=ThienVinh|last=Nguyen|date=18 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=Huff Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904192538/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/17/eating-a-deep-fried-fish_n_360576.html|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6595481/Chinese-diners-eat-live-fish-in-YouTube-video.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ben | last=Leach | title=Chinese diners eat live fish in YouTube video | date=18 November 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109063916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6595481/Chinese-diners-eat-live-fish-in-YouTube-video.html | archivedate=9 January 2018 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandcrisis.net/2009/11/fried-living-fish/ http://www.islandcrisis.net/2009/11/fried-living-fish/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220091031/http://www.islandcrisis.net/2009/11/fried-living-fish/ |date=2012-02-20 }} (defunct 28 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Preparation of this dish is now prohibited in Taiwan and illegal in Australia and Germany.

The view that oysters are acceptable to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, has notably been propounded in the seminal 1975 text ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]],'' by philosopher [[Peter Singer]]. However, subsequent editions have reversed this position (advocating ''against'' eating oysters). Singer has stated that he has "gone back and forth on this over the years", and as of 2010 states that "while you could give them the benefit of the doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters".&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">The '''Cameroonian economic crisis''' was a downturn in the [[economy of Cameroon]] from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. The crisis resulted in rising prices in [[Cameroon]], [[balance of trade|trade deficits]], and loss of government revenue.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2009-04-13-voa31-68784732/359653.html|title=Cameroon Hit by Global Economic Crisis|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Cameroon acknowledged the crisis in 1987. Outside observers and critics blamed poor government stewardship of the economy. The government instead placed the blame on the fall of the prices of export commodities, particularly a steep drop in the price of [[petroleum]].&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Africa/Cameroon-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html|title=Cameroon Overview of economy, Information about Overview of economy in Cameroon|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D&amp;D 104"&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 104.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Paul Biya]] announced that "all our export commodities fell at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in DeLancey and DeLancey 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroon's trade partners, particularly [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]], offered to help the country, but Cameroon balked at their condition that the country follow strict cost-cutting suggestions laid out by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Instead, Cameroon formulated its own plan. [[civil service|Civil servants]] lost access to [[subsidy|subsidised]] electricity, housing, and telephones; parts of the government's vehicle fleet were sold; older civil servants were forced into retirement; the official working schedule was changed; economic missions in foreign embassies from Cameroon were closed; and state and [[para-statals|parastatal]] enterprises were [[privatization|privatised]].&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; The 1987–1988 budget reduced government spending by 18%, the first time in the country's history that the budget decreased.&lt;ref name="D&amp;D 105"&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures met with international approval, but [[violent crime]] rose as a result. Cameroon's plan also failed to rein in [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; By October 1988, the intended effect was less than had been hoped, and Cameroon agreed to an IMF aid package worth $150 million and accepted a [[structural adjustment]] program (SAP) loan from the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]. The [[African Development Bank]], France, Germany, and the [[United Kingdom]] loaned the government further funds. Cameroon has since focused on paying off its international debt and further restricting public salaries and pay rises to civil servants.

However, the consensus among Cameroonians both at home and overseas is that the economic hardship is as a result of public funds theft by the Biya administration. Members of his regime constantly steel public funds and build mega structures in other countries such as France without any serious legal action being taken by the Biya administration. Biya himself is known to have resorts in Europe where he spends more time enjoying the proceeds of his theft than he does in his own country.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

{{too few opinions|date=December 2015}}
The '''Feast of Fools''' ({{lang-la|festum fatuorum, festum stultorum}}) is the name given to a specific [[feast day]] celebrated by the [[clergy]] in Europe, initially in Northern France, but later more widely. The passage of time has considerably obscured modern understandings of the nature and meaning of this celebration, which originated in proper liturgical observance, and has more to do with other examples of medieval [[liturgical drama]] than with either the earlier pagan (Roman) feasts of [[Saturnalia]] and [[Kalends]] or the later bourgeois lay [[sotie]].&lt;ref&gt;See Harris, Max, 2011. ''Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools''. (Ithaca, N.Y. and London: [[Cornell University Press]]). {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4956-7}}, 239-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The central idea appears to have been a brief social revolution, in which power, dignity and impunity is briefly conferred on those in a subordinate position. In the views of later commentators, this makes the medieval festival a successor to the Roman [[Kalends|Kalends of January]], although there is no continuity between the two celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Max, 2011.

Many of the most colourful descriptions of the medieval festival are a result of centuries of misunderstandings and unscholarly conflations of events widely dispersed in time and place; many rely on the condemnations of later writers, which either exaggerate or deliberately misreport what was effectively an orderly, if not always fully scripted, liturgical celebration with some dramatic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Max, 2011.

In the Middle Ages, particularly in France, the Feast of Fools was staged on or about the [[Feast of the Circumcision]], 1 January. It is related to certain other liturgical dramas, such, for example, as the [[Feast of the Ass]], the [[Play of Daniel]], and the [[Office of the Star]]. So far as the Feast of Fools had an independent existence, it seems to have grown out of a special "festival of the subdeacons", which [[John Beleth]], a liturgical writer of the twelfth century sometimes thought to have been an Englishman by birth, assigns to the day of the Circumcision. He is the earliest to draw attention to the fact that, as the deacons had a special celebration on St Stephen's day 26 December, the priests on St John the Evangelist's day 27 December, and again the choristers and mass-servers on the [[Feast of the Holy Innocents]] on 28 December, so the subdeacons were accustomed to hold their feast about the same time of year, but more particularly on the festival of the Circumcision.

==Official condemnation==

The Feast of Fools and the almost blasphemous extravagances in some instances associated with it were constantly the object of sweeping condemnations of the medieval Church. On the other hand, some Catholic writers have thought it necessary to try to deny the existence of such abuses. One interpretation that reconciles this contradiction is that, while there can be no question that Church authorities of the calibre of [[Robert Grosseteste]] repeatedly condemned the licence of the Feast of Fools in the strongest terms, such firmly rooted customs took centuries to eradicate. It is certain that the practice lent itself to serious abuses, whose nature and gravity varied at different epochs. It should be said that among the thousands of European liturgical manuscripts the occurrence of anything which has to do with the Feast of Fools is extraordinarily rare. It never occurs in the principal [[liturgical book]]s, the [[missal]]s and [[canonical hours|breviaries]]. There are traces occasionally in a prose or a trope found in a [[gradual]] or an [[antiphonary]]. It would therefore seem there was little official approval for such extravagances, which were rarely committed to writing.

With a view to checking the abuses committed in the celebration of the Feast of Fools on New Year's Day at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] in the twelfth century, the celebration was not entirely banned, but the part of the "[[Lord of Misrule]]" or "Precentor Stultorum" was restrained, so that he was to be allowed to intone the prose "Laetemur gaudiis", and to wield the precentor's staff, but this before the first Vespers of the feast, not during it. During the second Vespers, it had been the custom that the precentor of the fools should be deprived of his staff when the verse in the [[Magnificat]], ''Deposuit potentes de sede'' ("He has put down the mighty from their seat") was sung. Hence the feast was often known as the "Festum 'Deposuit'". [[Eudes de Sully]] allowed the staff to be taken at that point from the mock precentor, but laid down that the verse "Deposuit" not be repeated more than five times. There was a similar case of a legitimised Feast of Fools at Sens about 1220, where the whole text of the office has survived. There are many proses and interpolations (''farsurae'') added to the ordinary liturgy, but nothing much unseemly. This prose or ''conductus'', was not a part of the office, but only a preliminary to Vespers. In 1245 [[Cardinal Odo]], the papal legate in France, wrote to the Chapter of Sens Cathedral demanding that the feast be celebrated with no un-clerical dress and no wreaths of flowers.

The Feast of Fools was forbidden under the severe penalties by the [[Council of Basel]] in 1431 and a strongly worded document issued by the theological faculty of the [[University of Paris]] in 1444; numerous decrees of provincial councils followed. The Feast of Fools was condemned by early Protestants, and among Catholics it seems that the abuse had largely disappeared by the time of the [[Council of Trent]], though instances of festivals of this kind survived in France as late as 1644.

[[Victor Hugo]] recreated a picturesque account of a Feast of Fools in his 1831 novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', in which it is celebrated on January 6, 1482 and [[Quasimodo]] serves as Pope of Fools. This is shown in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|1996 animated film version of the novel]] through the song "[[Topsy Turvy (song)|Topsy Turvy]]".

{{Italic title}}
'''''Germanico''''' is a [[serenata]] in one act, to a [[libretto]] of unknown authorship, which is ascribed to [[George Frideric Handel]] on the sole source, a copyist's manuscript in the library of the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini in [[Florence]]. The ascription to Handel, "del sig. Hendl", is in the same hand that copied the music, suggesting it was contemporary with the writing of the score. It was discovered in 2007 by the conductor and scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Ottaviano Tenerani|it}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrossignolo.com/discografia/georg-friedrich-handel-germanico/ Georg Friedrich Händel, ''Germanico''], {{Interlanguage link multi|Il Rossignolo|it}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been recorded by [[Deutsche Harmonia Mundi]] (EAN 886978604521). Probably spurious, the work is said by its discoverers to date from the earliest phase of Handel's sojourn in Italy, probably around 1708, leading to claims that it was Handel's first Italian [[opera]].

Despite the division into two acts, the work is described on the manuscript as a serenata, and it lacks the drama of conventional [[opera seria]]. Instead it is a work of rejoicing and prophecy, based around the historical figure of [[Germanicus Caesar]] and his victory over the German chieftain [[Arminius]]. Another character is Germanico's wife [[Agrippina the Elder]] – they were the parents of [[Agrippina the Younger]], who is the central protagonist of Handel's later Italian opera ''[[Agrippina (opera)|Agrippina]]'' of 1710.

The '''Great New Orleans Fire (1788)''' ({{lang-es|Gran Incendio de Nueva Orleans}}) was a fire that destroyed 856 of the 1,100 structures in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)]], on March 21, 1788, spanning the south central [[French Quarter|Vieux Carré]] from Burgundy to Chartres Street, almost to the [[Mississippi River]] front buildings. An additional 212 buildings were destroyed in a [[Great New Orleans Fire (1794)|later citywide fire]], on December 8, 1794.

== History ==
The [[Good Friday]] fire began about 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. at the home of Army Treasurer Don Vincente Jose Nuñez, 619 Chartres Street, corner of Toulouse,&lt;ref name=FQfire&gt;[http://www.frenchquarter.com/history/elements.php ''French Quarter Fire and Flood'']; History page at FrenchQuarter.com; retrieved 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; less than a block from [[Jackson Square, New Orleans, Louisiana|Jackson Square]] (''Plaza de Armas''). Because the fire started on Good Friday, priests refused to allow church bells to be rung as a fire alarm.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury, H., ''The French Quarter'', Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., 1938, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Within five hours it had consumed almost the entire city as it was fed by a strong wind from the southeast. The fire destroyed virtually all major buildings in the then-city (now [[French Quarter]]), including the church, municipal building, army barracks, armory, and jail. [[Governor of Louisiana|Colonial Governor]] [[Esteban Rodríguez Miró]] set up tents for the homeless.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;

The fire area stretched between Dauphine Street and the [[Mississippi River]] and between Conti Street in the south and St. Philip Street in the north. It spared the riverfront buildings including the Customs House, the tobacco warehouses, the Governor's Building, the Royal Hospital, and the [[Old Ursuline Convent, New Orleans|Ursuline Convent]].&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;

Colonial officials were to replace the wooden buildings with masonry structures which had courtyards, thick [[brick]] walls, arcades, and [[wrought iron]] balconies.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;  Among the new buildings were the central New Orleans (now Jackson Square) fixtures of [[St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans|St. Louis Cathedral]], [[the Cabildo]], and [[the Presbytere]].&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt; The funds and supervision for the Cathedral and the Cabildo were provided by Don [[Andres Almonaster y Rojas]]. The Cabildo burned in the 1794 fire and had to be reconstructed. The Presbytere was built on a somewhat later basis, and Almonaster died before it could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Stanley C. ''Old New Orleans: A History of the Vieux Carré, Its Ancient and Historic Buildings''. Westminster, Maryland: Heritage Books; copyrighted 1936, reprinted 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Esteban Rodríguez Miró|Governor Miro's]] report summarized the suffering: 

{{quote|If the imagination could describe what our senses enable us to feel from sight and touch, reason itself would recoil in horror, and it is no easy matter to say whether the sight of an entire city in flames was more horrible to behold than the suffering and pitiable condition in which everyone was involved. Mothers, in search of a sanctuary or refuge for their little ones, and abandoning - their earthly goods to the greed of the relentless enemy, would retire to out-of-the-way places rather than be witnesses of their utter ruin. Fathers and husbands were busy in saving whatever objects the rapidly spreading flames would permit them to bear off, while the general bewilderment was such as to prevent them from finding even for these a place of security. The obscurity of the night coming on threw its mantle for a while over the saddening spectacle; but more horrible still was the sight, when day began to dawn, of entire families pouring forth into the public highways, yielding to their lamentations and despair, who, but a few hours before, had been basking in the enjoyment of more than the ordinary comforts of life. The tears, the heartbreaking sobs and the pallid faces of the wretched people mirrored the dire fatality that had overcome a city, now in ruins, transformed within the space of five hours into an arid and fearful, desert. Such was the sad ending of a work of death, the result of seventy years of industry.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;}}

After six years of rebuilding, on December 8, 1794, another 212 buildings were destroyed in the [[Great New Orleans Fire (1794)|Great New Orleans Fire of 1794]]. Still a colony of Spain, rebuilding continued in Spanish style, and most French-style architecture had disappeared from the city.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;

[[General officer|General]] '''Gregor MacGregor''' (24 December 1786 – 4 December 1845) was a Scottish soldier, adventurer and [[confidence trick]]ster who attempted from 1821 to 1837 to draw British and French investors and settlers to "Poyais", a fictional Central American territory that he claimed to rule as "[[Cacique|Cazique]]". Hundreds invested their savings in supposed Poyaisian [[government bond]]s and land certificates, while about 250 emigrated to MacGregor's invented country in 1822–23 to find only an untouched jungle; more than half of them died. MacGregor's Poyais scheme has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history.

From the [[Clan Gregor]], MacGregor was an officer in the [[British Army]] from 1803 to 1810; he served in the [[Peninsular War]]. He joined the republican side in the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] in 1812, quickly became a general and, over the next four years, operated against the Spanish on behalf of both Venezuela and its neighbour [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]]. His successes included a difficult month-long fighting retreat through northern Venezuela in 1816. He [[Amelia Island affair|captured Amelia Island]] in 1817 under a mandate from revolutionary agents to conquer [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] from the Spanish, and there proclaimed a short-lived "[[Republic of the Floridas]]". He then oversaw two calamitous operations in New Granada during 1819 that each ended with his abandoning [[British Legions|British volunteer troops]] under his command.

On his return to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that [[George Frederic Augustus I|King George Frederic Augustus]] of the [[Mosquito Coast]] in the [[Gulf of Honduras]] had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he described as a developed colony with a community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had put in charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in [[Caracas]] in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in [[Caracas Cathedral]].

Gregor MacGregor was born on Christmas Eve 1786 at his family's ancestral home of Glengyle, on the north shore of [[Loch Katrine]] in [[Stirlingshire]], Scotland, the son of Daniel MacGregor, an [[East India Company]] sea captain, and his wife Ann (''née'' Austin).{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=109}}{{#tag:ref|Some sources, including the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', give MacGregor's place of birth as [[Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Dawson|2004}}{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=32}} A statement prepared by MacGregor himself in 1826, for a French audience, also describes him as born in the Scottish capital.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=343}} Michael Rafter's 1820 biography of MacGregor says he was "born in the Highlands of Scotland";{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=19}} Sinclair, in 2003, specifically identifies the place of birth as "the old MacGregor house of Glengyle" in Stirlingshire.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=109}}|group="n"|name="edinburgh"}} The family was Roman Catholic and part of the [[Clan Gregor]], whose proscription by [[James VI and I|King James VI and I]] in 1604 had been repealed only in 1774.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=25, 111}} During the proscription the MacGregors had been legally ostracised to the extent that they were forbidden to use their own surname—many of them, including Gregor's celebrated great-great-uncle [[Rob Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]], had participated in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=32}} MacGregor would assert in adulthood that a direct ancestor of his had survived the [[Darien scheme]] of 1698, the ill-fated Scottish attempt to colonise the [[Isthmus of Panama]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=323–324}} Gregor's grandfather, also called Gregor and nicknamed "the Beautiful", served with distinction in the [[British Army]] under the surname Drummond, and subsequently played an important role in the clan's restoration and rehabilitation into society.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=109–110}}

Little is recorded of MacGregor's childhood.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=109–110}} After his father's death in 1794, he and his two sisters were raised primarily by his mother with the help of various relatives.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=109–110}} MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=111}}{{#tag:ref|Frank Griffith Dawson, MacGregor's biographer in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', endorses this claim, writing that MacGregor studied chemistry and natural sciences at the University of Edinburgh—but places these studies during MacGregor's time in the British Army, around 1808.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}}|group="n"|name="uniofedinburgh"}}

===British Army===
MacGregor joined the British Army at 16, the youngest age it was possible for him to do so, in April 1803. His family [[Purchase of commissions in the British Army|purchased him a commission]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot]], probably for around [[Pound sterling|£]]450.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=111}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette
|issue=15571|page=369|date=2 April 1803}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacGregor's entrance to the military coincided with the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] following the breakdown of the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. Southern England was [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–05|fortified]] to defend against a [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|possible French invasion]]; the 57th Foot was at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Kent]]. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to [[lieutenant]]—an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in [[Guernsey]] with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=112–114}}

[[File:George Watson Gregor MacGregor.jpg|thumb|upright|MacGregor in the [[British Army]], painted by [[George Watson (painter)|George Watson]], 1804|alt=A young, rosy-cheeked man in the red uniform of the British Army.]]
MacGregor was introduced to Maria Bowater, the daughter of a [[Royal Navy]] admiral, around 1804. Maria commanded a substantial [[dowry]] and, apart from her by-now-deceased father, was related to two [[general officer|generals]], a member of parliament and the botanist [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=114–115}} Gregor and Maria married at [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's Church]], [[Westminster]] in June 1805 and set up home in London, at the residence of the bride's aunt. Two months later, having rejoined the 57th Foot in Gibraltar, MacGregor bought the rank of [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] for about £900, choosing not to wait the seven years such a promotion might take without purchase.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=114–115}} The 57th Foot remained in Gibraltar between 1805 and 1809. During this time MacGregor developed an obsession with dress, rank insignia and medals that made him unpopular in the regiment; he forbade any enlisted man or [[non-commissioned officer]] to leave his quarters in anything less than [[full dress]] uniform.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=116–117}}

In 1809 the 57th Foot was sent to Portugal as reinforcements for the [[Anglo-Portuguese Army]] under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], during his second attempt to drive the French out of Spain during the [[Peninsular War]]. MacGregor's regiment disembarked at Lisbon about three months into the campaign, on 15 July. By September it was garrisoning [[Elvas]], near the frontier with Spain.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=117–120}} Soon thereafter MacGregor was seconded to the 8th Line Battalion of the [[Portuguese Army]], where he served with the rank of [[major]] from October 1809 to April 1810. According to Michael Rafter, author of a highly critical 1820 biography of MacGregor, this secondment came after a disagreement between MacGregor and a superior officer, "originally of a trivial nature", that intensified to such an extent that the young captain was forced to request discharge. This was promptly granted.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=117–120}}{{#tag:ref|MacGregor would assert much later that, as he was a Roman Catholic, the British Army had discriminated against him. There is no evidence to confirm this.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=284}}|group="n"|name="catholic"}} MacGregor formally retired from the British service on 24 May 1810, receiving back the £1,350 he had paid for the ranks of ensign and captain, and returned to Britain.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=117–120}} The 57th Foot's actions at the [[Battle of Albuera]] on 16 May 1811 would earn it considerable prestige and the nickname "the [[Die hard (phrase)|Die-Hards]]"—MacGregor would thereafter make much of his association.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=118, 121}}

===Edinburgh to Caracas===
On his return to Britain the 23-year-old MacGregor and his wife moved into a house rented by his mother in Edinburgh. There he assumed the title of "[[Colonel]]", wore the badge of a Portuguese knightly order and toured the city in an extravagant and brightly-coloured coach. After failing to attain high social status in Edinburgh, MacGregor moved back to London in 1811 and began styling himself "Sir Gregor MacGregor, [[Baronet|Bart.]]", falsely claiming to have succeeded to the MacGregor clan chieftainship; he also alluded to family ties with a selection of dukes, earls and barons. This had little bearing on reality but MacGregor nevertheless created an air of credible respectability for himself in London society.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=121–124}}

In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At a stroke MacGregor lost his main source of income and the support of the influential Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=125}}

MacGregor's interest was aroused by the colonial [[Spanish American wars of independence|revolts against Spanish rule]] in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where seven of the ten provinces had [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared]] themselves an [[First Republic of Venezuela|independent republic]] in July 1811, starting the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]]. The Venezuelan revolutionary General [[Francisco de Miranda]] had been feted in London society during his recent visit,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=125–126}} and may have met MacGregor.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} Noting the treatment London's highest circles gave to Miranda, MacGregor formed the idea that exotic adventures in the New World might earn him similar celebrity on his homecoming.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=125–126}} He sold the small Scottish estate he had inherited from his father and grandfather and sailed for South America in early 1812.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=125–126}} On the way he stopped in Jamaica, where according to Rafter he was tempted to settle among the planters and traders, but "having no introductory letters to that place, he was not received into society".{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=23}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=126–127}} After a comfortable sojourn in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], he sailed for Venezuela and disembarked there in April 1812.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=126–127}}

==South America==

===Venezuela, under Miranda===
[[File:Josefa MacGregor.jpg|thumb|upright|Josefa MacGregor, painted by [[Charles Lees (painter)|Charles Lees]] in 1821|alt=A dark-haired, exotic-looking young lady in a light-coloured dress]]
MacGregor arrived in the Venezuelan capital [[Caracas]] a fortnight after much of the city had been destroyed by [[1812 Caracas earthquake|an earthquake]]. With swathes of the country under the control of advancing royalist armies, the revolutionary government was losing support and starting to fracture.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=128–129}} MacGregor dropped his pretended Scottish baronetcy, reasoning that it might undermine the republican credentials he hoped to establish, but continued to style himself "Sir Gregor" on the basis that he was, he claimed, a knight of the Portuguese [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=126–127}} He offered his services directly to Miranda in Caracas.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=130–133}} As a former British Army officer—from the famous "Die-Hards", no less—he was received with alacrity and given command of a cavalry battalion with the rank of colonel.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=130–133}} In his first action, MacGregor and his cavalry routed a royalist force west of [[Maracay]], between [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]] and Caracas. Subsequent engagements were less successful, but the republican leaders were still pleased with the glamour they perceived this dashing Scottish officer to give their cause.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=133–135}}

MacGregor married [[Doña]] Josefa Antonia Andrea Aristeguieta y Lovera, daughter of a prominent Caracas family and a cousin of the revolutionary [[Simón Bolívar]], in Maracay on 10 June 1812.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=149–151}} By the end of that month Miranda had promoted MacGregor to [[brigadier-general]], but the revolutionary cause was failing; in July, after the royalists took the key port of [[Puerto Cabello]] from Bolívar, the republic capitulated. In the chaos that ensued Miranda was captured by the Spanish while the remnants of the republican leadership, including MacGregor with Josefa in tow, were evacuated to the Dutch island of [[Curaçao]] aboard a British [[brig]], the ''Sapphire''. Bolívar joined them there later in the year.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=135–148}}

===New Granada; defence of Cartagena===
With Miranda imprisoned in Spain, Bolívar emerged as the new leader of the Venezuelan independence movement. He resolved that they would have to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Curaçao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General [[Antonio Nariño]]'s republican armies in Venezuela's western neighbour, [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]]. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nariño's base at [[Tunja]] in the eastern [[Andes]]. Miranda's name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nariño's forces were mainly engaged around [[Popayán]] in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=152–155}} Rafter reports positively on MacGregor's conduct in Socorro, writing that "by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [he] considerably improved the discipline of the troops", but some under his command disliked him.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=152–155}} An official in [[Cúcuta]], the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: "I am sick and tired of this bluffer, or [[Don Quixote|Quixote]], or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=152–155}}

[[File:Sunset-cartagena-tower-Igvir.jpg|thumb|Battlements at [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], where MacGregor took part in the defence against Spanish attackers in 1815|alt=Old, somewhat decayed battlements, with a sunset in the background over the sea.]]
While MacGregor was in the New Granadian service, Bolívar raised a force of Venezuelan exiles and local troops in the port of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and [[Admirable Campaign|captured Caracas]] on 4 August 1813.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=155–156}} The royalists quickly rallied and crushed Bolívar's [[Second Republic of Venezuela|second republic]] in mid-1814. Nariño's New Granadian nationalists surrendered around the same time. MacGregor withdrew to Cartagena, which was still in revolutionary hands,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=155–156}} and at the head of native troops destroyed hamlets, local infrastructure and produce to prevent the Spanish from using them. A Spanish force of about 6,000 landed in late August 1815 and, after repeatedly failing to overcome the 5,000 defenders, deployed to subdue the fortress by [[blockade]]. Sinclair records that MacGregor played an "honourable, though not conspicuous" part in the defence.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=158–159}} By November there remained in Cartagena only a few hundred men capable of fighting. The defenders resolved to use the dozen [[gunboat]]s they had to break through the Spanish fleet to the open sea, abandoning the city to the royalists; MacGregor was chosen as one of the three commanders of this operation. On the night of 5 December 1815 the gunboats sailed out into the bay, blasted their way through the smaller Spanish vessels and, avoiding the frigates, made for Jamaica. All the gunboats escaped.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=158–159}}

===Venezuela, under Bolívar===
The British merchant class in Jamaica that had shunned MacGregor on his first arrival in 1812 now welcomed him as a hero.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=159–160}} The Scotsman entertained many dinner parties with embellished accounts of his part in the Cartagena siege, leading some to understand that he had personally headed the city's defence. One Englishman toasted the "[[Hannibal]] of modern [[Carthage]]".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=159–160}}{{#tag:ref|Among the claims MacGregor made about Cartagena was that he had lost two children during the siege—Sinclair calls this "almost certainly a lie", noting the lack of evidence for any MacGregor children being born at this time, but proposes that Josefa may have suffered miscarriages, which would make her husband "guilty of hyperbole rather than outright lying".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=159–160}} Whatever the truth, Sinclair comments, MacGregor's claim strongly implies that Josefa had left Jamaica at some point between 1812 and 1815 and joined him in New Granada.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=159–160}}|group="n"|name="miscarriages"}} Around New Year 1816, MacGregor and his wife made their way to [[Santo Domingo]] (today the Dominican Republic), where Bolívar was raising a new army. Bolívar received MacGregor back into the [[Venezuelan Army]] with the rank of brigadier-general, and included him in an expeditionary force that left [[Les Cayes|Aux Cayes]] (now Les Cayes) on 30 April 1816.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=160–163}} MacGregor took part in the capture of the port town of [[Carúpano]] as second-in-command of [[Manuel Piar]]'s column, but is not mentioned in the record of the battle prepared by Bolívar's staff.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=160–163}} After the Spanish were driven from many central Venezuelan towns, MacGregor was sent to the coast west of Caracas to recruit native tribesmen in July 1816.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=165–167}} On 18 July, eight days after the numerically superior royalists countered and broke Bolívar's main force at La Cabrera. With Bolívar back in Aux Cayes, MacGregor resolved to retreat hundreds of miles east to [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=165–167}}

Two pursuing royalist armies harried MacGregor constantly as he retreated across country, but failed to break his rearguard. With no carts and only a handful of horses, the Scotsman was forced to leave his wounded where they fell.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=167–169}} Late on 27 July MacGregor's way east was obstructed by a royalist force at [[Chaguaramas, Venezuela|Chaguaramas]], south of Caracas and about a third of the distance to Barcelona. MacGregor led his men in a furious charge that prompted a Spanish retreat back into Chaguaramas, then continued towards Barcelona.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=167–169}} The Spanish remained in the town until 30 July, giving MacGregor two days' head start,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=167–169}} and caught up with him only on 10 August. The Scotsman deployed his 1,200 men, mostly native archers, behind a marsh and a stream—the Spanish cavalry were bogged down in the marsh, while the archers repelled the infantry with volleys of arrows. After three hours MacGregor charged and routed the royalists.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=169–171}} MacGregor's party was helped the rest of the way east to Barcelona by elements of the main revolutionary army. They arrived on 20 August 1816, after 34 days' march.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=169–171}}

In Rafter's view, this marked "the zenith of MacGregor's celebrity" in South America.{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=82}} He had, according to his biographer Frank Griffith Dawson, "led his troops with brilliant success";{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} Sinclair agrees, calling the march a "remarkable feat" demonstrating "genuine military skill".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=169, 173}} With Bolívar back in Aux Cayes, overall command of the republican armies in Venezuela had been given to Piar.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=172–173}} On 26 September, Piar and MacGregor defeated the Spanish army commanded by Francisco Tomás Morales at El Juncal.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|p=178}} But MacGregor and Piar had several disagreements over the strategic conduct of the war{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=172–173}}—according to the American historian [[David Bushnell (historian)|David Bushnell]], the Scottish general probably "r[an] afoul of personal and factional rivalries within the patriot camp".{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=9}} In early October 1816 MacGregor left with Josefa for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]], about {{convert|24|mi}} off eastern Venezuela, where he hoped to enter the service of General [[Juan Bautista Arismendi]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=172–173}} Soon afterwards he received an acclamatory letter from Bolívar: "The retreat which you had the honour to conduct is in my opinion superior to the conquest of an empire&amp;nbsp;... Please accept my congratulations for the prodigious services you have rendered my country".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=172–173}} MacGregor's march to Barcelona would remain prominent in the South American revolutionary narrative for years.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=167–170}}

===Florida republic; Amelia Island affair===
Arismendi proposed to MacGregor that capturing one of the ports in [[East Florida|East]] or [[West Florida]], which were then Spanish colonies, might provide an excellent springboard for republican operations elsewhere in Latin America.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=174–176}} MacGregor liked the idea and, after an abortive attempt to recruit in Haiti, sailed with Josefa to the United States to raise money and volunteers. Soon after he left in early 1817, a further congratulatory letter arrived in Margarita from Bolívar, promoting MacGregor to [[divisional general]], awarding him the ''[[Order of the Liberators|Orden de los Libertadores]]'' (Order of the Liberators), and asking him to return to Venezuela. MacGregor remained ignorant of this for two years.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=174–176}} On 31 March 1817 in [[Philadelphia]], MacGregor received a document from [[Lino de Clemente]], [[Pedro Gual Escandón|Pedro Gual]], and Martin Thompson, each of whom claimed to speak for one or more of the Latin American republics. They called themselves the "deputies of free America" and  called upon MacGregor to take possession of "both the Floridas, East and West" as soon as possible.{{#tag:ref|Clemente was one of Bolívar's agents, Gual signed in the name of New Granada and Mexico, and Thompson, a US citizen, informally represented the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]]. According to Bushnell, none of these governments had specifically instructed any action in Florida.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=9}}|group="n"|name="mandate"}} Florida's proposed fate was not specified; MacGregor presumed that the Floridians would seek US annexation, as they were mostly of non-Spanish origin, and that the US would quickly comply. He thus expected at least covert support from the US government.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=9}}

MacGregor raised several hundred armed men for this enterprise in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], South Carolina, and particularly [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia. He also raised [[United States dollar|$]]160,000 by the sale of "[[scrip]]ts" to investors, promising them fertile acres in Florida or their money back with interest.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=178}}{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=10}} He determined to first attack [[Amelia Island]], an anarchic community of pirates and other criminals containing about 40% of East Florida's population (recorded as 3,729 in 1815).{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=10}} He expected little to no resistance from the tiny Spanish garrison there. MacGregor left [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in a ship with fewer than 80 men,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=179}}{{sfn|Norris|1986|pp=19–21}} mostly US citizens.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=10}} He led the landing party personally on 29 June 1817{{sfn|Norris|1986|pp=19–21}} with the words: "I shall sleep either in hell or Amelia tonight!"{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=179}} The Spanish commander at [[Fort San Carlos]], with 51 men and several cannon, vastly overestimated the size of MacGregor's force and surrendered without either side firing a shot.{{sfn|Norris|1986|pp=19–21}}

Few of Amelia's residents came out to support MacGregor but, at the same time, there was little resistance; most simply left for mainland Florida or Georgia.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=10}} MacGregor raised a flag showing a green cross on a white field—the "Green Cross of Florida"—and issued a proclamation on 30 June urging the island's inhabitants to return and support him. This was largely ignored, as was a second proclamation in which MacGregor congratulated his men on their victory and exhorted them to "free the whole of the Floridas from Tyranny and oppression".{{sfn|Norris|1986|pp=21–22}}

MacGregor announced a "Republic of the Floridas" under a government headed by himself. He attempted to tax the local pirates' booty at an "admiralty court",{{sfn|Owsley|Smith|1997|pp=127–128}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=182}} and tried to raise money by seizing and selling dozens of slaves found on the island.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=11}} Morale among the troops plummeted when he prohibited looting.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=10}} Most of his recruits were still in the US; American authorities prevented most of them from leaving port, and MacGregor was able to muster only 200 on Amelia. His officers clamoured for an invasion of mainland Florida, but he insisted that they did not have enough men, arms, or supplies.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=183}} Bushnell suggests that MacGregor's backers in the US may have promised him more support in these regards than they ultimately provided.{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|p=13}} Eighteen men sent to reconnoitre around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St Augustine]] in late July 1817 were variously killed, wounded, or captured by the Spanish. Discipline disintegrated among MacGregor's troops, who were paid first in "Amelia dollars" that he had printed, and later not at all.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–187}}

Spanish forces congregated on the mainland opposite Amelia, and MacGregor and most of his officers decided on 3 September 1817 that the situation was hopeless and that they would abandon the venture. MacGregor announced to the men that he was leaving, explaining vaguely that he had been "deceived by my friends." He turned over the command to one of his subordinates, a former [[Pennsylvania]] congressman named [[Jared Irwin (Pennsylvania)|Jared Irwin]],{{sfn|Norris|1986|p=28}} and he boarded the ''Morgiana'' with his wife on 4 September 1817 with an angry crowd looking on and hurling insults at him. He waited offshore for a few days,{{sfn|Norris|1986|p=28}} then left on the schooner ''Venus'' on 8 September.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–187}} Two weeks later, the MacGregors arrived at [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the Bahamas, where he arranged to have commemorative medallions struck bearing the Green Cross motif and the Latin inscriptions ''Amalia Veni Vidi Vici'' ("Amelia, I Came, I Saw, I Conquered") and ''Duce Mac Gregorio Libertas Floridarium'' ("Liberty for the Floridas under the leadership of MacGregor").{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–187}} He made no attempt to repay those who had funded the Amelia expedition.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–187}} Irwin's troops defeated two Spanish assaults and were then joined by 300 men under [[Louis-Michel Aury]], who held Amelia for three months before surrendering to American forces, who held the island "in trust for Spain" until the [[Adams–Onís Treaty|Florida Purchase]] in 1819.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–187}}{{sfn|Brown|2015|p=8}}{{sfn|Bushnell|1986|pp=13–17}}

Press reports of the [[Amelia Island affair]] were wildly inaccurate, partly because of misinformation disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=187}} Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=183–184}} The owner of the ''Venus'' was an ex-captain of the British [[Corps of Colonial Marines]] named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the [[British Legions]] being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited by the idea of leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in [[Dublin]] on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=188–189}}

===Porto Bello===
The [[Third Republic of Venezuela|third Venezuelan republic]]'s envoy in the British capital borrowed £1,000 for MacGregor to engage and transport British troops for service in Venezuela, but the Scotsman squandered these funds within a few weeks. A London financier, an old friend of MacGregor's called Thomas Newte,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2006|p=106}}{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=203}} took responsibility for the envoy's debt on the condition that the general instead take troops to New Granada.{{sfn|Vittorino|1990|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=189–192}} MacGregor funded his expedition through the sale of commissions at rates cheaper than those offered by the British Army,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=189–192}} and assembled enlisted men through a network of recruiters across the British Isles, offering volunteers huge financial incentives.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=194–195}} MacGregor sailed for South America on 18 November 1818 aboard a former Royal Navy [[brigantine]], renamed the ''Hero''; 50 officers and over 500 troops, many of them Irish, followed the next month.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=194–195}} They were critically under-equipped, having virtually no arms or munitions.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=194–195}}

The men came close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 [[Spanish dollar|silver dollars]] per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés]], off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=196–198}} Going first to Jamaica to arrange accommodation for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack [[Portobelo, Colón|Porto Bello]] on the New Granadian mainland the following day.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=198–200}}

[[File:Batería de Santiago, Portobelo - Flickr - andrea1victoria (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Part of the fort at Porto Bello, Panama, where MacGregor abandoned his troops led by Colonel William Rafter in April 1819|alt=Battlements and an old cannon, overlooking a harbour.]]
Colonel Rafter disembarked with 200 men near Porto Bello on 9 April, outflanked a roughly equal force of Spanish defenders during the night, and marched into Porto Bello without a fight on 10 April. MacGregor, watching from one of the ships with Woodbine—to whom he had given the rank of colonel—quickly came ashore when he sighted Rafter's signal of victory, and, as usual, issued a flowery proclamation: "Soldiers! Our first conquest has been glorious, it has opened the road to future and additional fame."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=200–202}} Rafter urged MacGregor to march on [[Panama City]], but MacGregor did not make much in the way of plans to continue the campaign.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=202–204}} He devoted most of his attention to the particulars of a new [[chivalric order]] of his design, the emblem of which would be a Green Cross.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=202–204}} The troops became mutinous again after more promised money failed to materialise—MacGregor eventually paid each man $20, but this did little to restore discipline.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}}

The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops allowed the Spanish to march straight into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor was still in bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}} Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned had he not been picked up and brought aboard the ''Hero'' by one of his naval officers.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}} MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the ''Hero'', then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the ''Hero''.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}} Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}}{{#tag:ref|MacGregor had five ships—the ''Hero'' and the four others that had carried the troops from Britain.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=194}}|group="n"|name="fiveships"}} Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army had no choice but to surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=204–208}} Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.{{#tag:ref|Although it soon became public knowledge that MacGregor had suffered a humiliating defeat at Porto Bello, the full story of how he had abandoned his troops emerged only a year later with the publishing of a survivor's account in the press and of the book by William Rafter's brother Michael in June 1820. MacGregor responded in 1821 with a heavily embellished account in which he claimed to have been forced to withdraw after a Latin American officer betrayed him and William Rafter let him down.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=208, 331}}|group="n"|name="mahary"}}

===Rio de la Hacha===
Making his way first to San Andrés, then Haiti, MacGregor conferred invented decorations and titles on his officers and planned an expedition to [[Riohacha|Rio de la Hacha]] in northern New Granada. He was briefly delayed in Haiti by a falling-out with his naval commander, an officer called Hudson.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=208–209}} When the naval officer fell ill, MacGregor had him put ashore, seized the ''Hero''—which Hudson owned—and renamed her ''El MacGregor'', explaining to the Haitian authorities that "drunkenness, insanity and mutiny" by his captain had forced him to take the ship. MacGregor steered the hijacked brigantine to Aux Cayes, then sold her after she was found to be unseaworthy.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=209–211}} Waiting for him in Aux Cayes were 500 officers and enlisted men, courtesy of recruiters in Ireland and London, but he had no ships to carry them and little in the way of equipment.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=209–211}} This was remedied during July and August 1819, first by the arrival of his Irish recruiter Colonel Thomas Eyre with 400 men and two ships—MacGregor gave him the rank of general and the Order of the Green Cross—and then by the appearance of war materiel from London, sent by Thomas Newte on a schooner named ''Amelia''.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2006|p=118}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=210–211}}

MacGregor bombastically announced his intention to liberate New Granada, but then hesitated. The lack of action, rations or pay for weeks prompted most of the British volunteers to go home.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=211–213}} MacGregor's force, which had comprised 900 men at its peak (including officers), had dwindled to no more than 250 by the time he directed the ''Amelia'' and two other vessels to Rio de la Hacha on 29 September 1819.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=213–215}} His remaining officers included Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rafter, who had bought a commission with the hope of rescuing his brother William.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=213–215}} After being driven away from Rio de la Hacha harbour by cannon on 4 October, MacGregor ordered a night landing west of the town and said that he would take personal command once the troops were ashore. Lieutenant-Colonel William Norcott led the men onto the beach and waited there two hours for MacGregor to arrive, but the general failed to appear. Attacked by a larger Spanish force, Norcott countered and captured the town. MacGregor still refused to leave the ships, convinced that the flag flying over the fort must be a trick; even when Norcott rowed out to tell him to come into port, MacGregor would not step ashore for over a day. When he did appear, many of his soldiers swore and spat at him.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=215–217}} He issued another lofty proclamation, recalled by Rafter as an "aberration of human intellect", at the foot of which MacGregor identified himself as "His Majesty the Inca of New Granada".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=215–217}}{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=228}}{{#tag:ref|According to Rafter's book, the basis for this was a story circulated at the time, believed and talked about by MacGregor himself, that the MacGregor emigrant to Darien in 1698 had married a local princess, from whom all subsequent members of the MacGregor line were descended.{{sfn|Rafter|1820|pp=388–389}} Sinclair comments that MacGregor was indeed unusually swarthy for a Scotsman, and that if there was truth in the Darien story "it might go some way towards explaining his behaviour in relation to Poyais".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=323–324}}|group="n"|name="darienancestor"}}

Events went largely as they had done earlier in the year at Porto Bello. MacGregor abstained from command in all but name, and the troops descended into a state of confused drunkenness.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=217–218}} "General MacGregor displayed so palpable a want of the requisite qualities which should distinguish the commander of such an expedition," Rafter wrote, "that universal astonishment prevailed amongst his followers at the reputation he had for some time maintained."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=217–218}} As Spanish forces gathered around the town, Norcott and Rafter decided the situation was hopeless and left on a captured Spanish schooner on 10 October 1819, taking with them five officers and 27 soldiers and sailors.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=219–220}} MacGregor convened his remaining officers the next day and, giving them promotions and Green Cross decorations, exhorted them to help him lead the defence. Immediately afterwards he went to the port, ostensibly to escort Eyre's wife and two children to safety on a ship. After putting the Eyres on the ''Lovely Ann'', he boarded the ''Amelia'' and ordered the ships out to sea just as the Spanish attacked. General Eyre and the troops left behind were all killed.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=219–220}}

MacGregor reached Aux Cayes to find news of this latest debacle had preceded him, and he was shunned. A friend in Jamaica, Thomas Higson, informed him through letters that Josefa and Gregorio had been evicted, and until Higson's intervention had sought sanctuary in a slave's hut.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=220–221}} MacGregor was wanted in Jamaica for piracy and so could not join his family there. He similarly could not go back to Bolívar, who was so outraged by MacGregor's recent conduct that he accused the Scotsman of [[treason]] and ordered his death by [[hanging]] if he ever set foot on the South American mainland again.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=220–221}} MacGregor's whereabouts for the half year following October 1819 are unknown.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=220–221}} Back in London in June 1820, Michael Rafter published his highly censorious account of MacGregor's adventures, ''Memoirs of Gregor M'Gregor'', dedicating the book to his brother Colonel William Rafter and the troops abandoned at Porto Bello and Rio de la Hacha.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=iii}} In his summary Rafter speculated that following the latter episode MacGregor was "politically, though not naturally dead"—"to suppose", he wrote, "that any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects, would be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable".{{sfn|Rafter|1820|p=375}}

MacGregor's next known location is at the court of [[George Frederic Augustus I|King George Frederic Augustus]] of the [[Mosquito Coast]], at [[Cape Gracias a Dios]] on the [[Gulf of Honduras]] in April 1820.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=107, 221–222}} The [[Miskito people|Mosquito people]], descendants of shipwrecked African slaves and indigenous people, shared the historic British antipathy towards Spain, and the British authorities in the region had crowned their most powerful chieftains as "kings" since the 17th century.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} These were kings in little more than name, with no effective control over the country they ostensibly led; Britain crowned and protected them simply so they could declare the area to be under Mosquito sovereignty and thereby obstruct Spanish claims.{{sfn|Naylor|1989|p=219}} There had been a modest [[Black River (settlement)|British settlement]] on the coast around the [[Sico River|Black River]] (now the Río Sico), but this had been evacuated following the [[Convention of London (1786)|Anglo-Spanish Convention]] of 1786. By the 1820s the most visible sign of prior colonisation was a small graveyard overgrown by the jungle.{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=441}}

On 29 April 1820, George Frederic Augustus signed a document granting MacGregor and his heirs a substantial swathe of Mosquito territory—8,000,000 acres (12,500 square miles; 32,375 square kilometres), an area larger than [[Wales]]{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=31–37}}—in exchange for rum and jewellery.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} The land was pleasing to the eye but unfit for cultivation and could sustain little in the way of livestock.{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=441}} Its area was roughly a triangle with corners at Cape Gracias a Dios, [[Cape Camarón]] and the Black River's headwaters.{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=441}} MacGregor dubbed this area "Poyais" after the natives of the highlands around the Black River's source, the [[Paya people|Paya]] or "Poyer" people (today called the Pech),{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=440}}{{sfn|Olson|1991|pp=289–290}} and in mid-1821 appeared back in London calling himself the Cazique of Poyais—"[[Cacique|Cazique]]", a Spanish-American word for a native chief, being equivalent in MacGregor's usage to "Prince".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=8, 32–35}} He claimed to have been created such by the Mosquito king, but in fact both the title and Poyais were of his own invention.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=108, 235}}

Despite Rafter's book, London society remained largely unaware of MacGregor's failures over the past few years, but remembered successes such as his march to Barcelona; similarly his association with the "Die-Hards" of the 57th Foot was recalled, but his dubious early discharge was not.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=26–29}} In this climate of a constantly shifting Latin America, where governments rose, fell, and adopted new names from year to year, it did not seem so implausible that there might be a country called Poyais or that a decorated general like MacGregor might be its leader.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}}{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=289–290}} The Cazique became "a great adornment for the dinner tables and ballrooms of sophisticated London", Sinclair writes{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=26–29}}—rumours abounded that he was partially descended from indigenous royalty.{{#tag:ref||group="n"|name="darienancestor"}} His exotic appeal was enhanced by the arrival of the striking "Princess of Poyais", Josefa, who had given birth to a girl named Josefa Anna Gregoria at MacGregor's sister's home in Ireland.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=29, 36}} The MacGregors received countless social invitations, including an official reception at [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from the [[Lord Mayor of London]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=26–29}}

MacGregor said that he had come to London to attend [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]'s coronation on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=29–36}} To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—"religious and moral instructors&amp;nbsp;... and persons to guide and assist you"—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be "Vice-Cazique" during his absence. "POYERS!", the document concluded, "I now bid you farewell for a while&amp;nbsp;... I trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and yours to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=32–35}} There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast.{{#tag:ref|This so-called "copy" was probably an original, printed in Britain long after the claimed date.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=318}}|group="n"|name="1821proclamation"}}

So began what has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history—the Poyais scheme.{{#tag:ref|Sinclair calls the Poyais scheme "the most audacious fraud in history",{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=i}} while a 2012 analysis by ''[[The Economist]]'' adjudges it "the greatest confidence trick of all time".{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} "It is true that more recent scams have raised more," the ''Economist''{{'}}s reasoning goes—"[[Bernard Madoff|Bernie Madoff]], a New York-based fraudster caught out in 2008 [[Madoff investment scandal|ran a scheme 20 times bigger]], at $65 billion. In cash terms alone Mr Madoff trumps MacGregor. But fraud is about creating false confidence, and making people believe in something that does not exist. For some, like Mr Madoff, it is the belief in the trickster’s shamanic stock-picking skills. For others, like [[Charles Ponzi]], it is a fail-safe [[Ponzi scheme|mathematical scheme]]. MacGregor was far more ambitious: he invented an entire country."{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}|group="n"|name="greatestfraud"}} MacGregor devised a tricameral parliament and other convoluted constitutional arrangements for Poyais, drew up commercial and banking mechanisms, and designed distinctive uniforms for each regiment of the Poyaisian Army.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=319–320}} His imaginary country had an honours system, landed titles, a coat of arms—doubly [[supporter|supported]] by Poyers and unicorns—and the same Green Cross flag he had used in Florida.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=77–78}} By the end of 1821 Major William John Richardson had not only accepted MacGregor's fantasy as true but had become an active ally, providing his attractive estate at Oak Hall, [[Wanstead]] to be a British base for the supposed Poyaisian royal family.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=29–36}} MacGregor gave Richardson the Order of the Green Cross, commissioned him into the Poyaisian "Royal Regiment of Horse Guards" and appointed him ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' of the Poyaisian [[legation]] at Dowgate Hill in the [[City of London]]—the top representative of Poyais in Britain. Richardson's [[letter of credence]] from "Gregor the First, Sovereign Prince of the State of Poyais" was presented to George IV.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=39}} MacGregor had Poyaisian offices set up in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow to sell impressive-looking land certificates—initially hand-written, but later printed—to the general public, and to co-ordinate prospective emigrants.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=64–65}}

===Land of opportunity===
The consensus among MacGregor's biographers is that Britain in the early 1820s could hardly have suited him and his Poyais scheme better.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=63}} Amid a general growth in the British economy following the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the end of the Napoleonic Wars, [[interest rate]]s were dropping and the British [[government bond]], the "[[Consol (bond)|consol]]", offered rates of only 3% per annum on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Those wanting a higher return invested in more risky foreign debt.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} After continental European bonds were popular in the immediate post-Waterloo years, the Latin American revolutions brought a raft of new alternatives to the London market, starting with the £2&amp;nbsp;million loan issued for [[Gran Colombia]] (incorporating both New Granada and Venezuela) in March 1822.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=59–60}} Bonds from Colombia, Peru, Chile and others, offering interest rates as high as 6% per annum, made Latin American securities extremely popular on the London market—a trend on which a nation like the Poyais described by MacGregor would be ideally positioned to capitalise.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}}{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=60–63}}

MacGregor mounted an aggressive sales campaign.

This was almost all fiction,{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|pp=441, 445}} but MacGregor's calculation that official-looking documents and the printed word would convince many people proved correct. The meticulous detail in the leather-bound ''Sketch'', and the cost of having it printed, did much to dispel lingering doubts.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=316–318}} Poyaisian land certificates at two [[shilling]]s and threepence per acre,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=74}} roughly equivalent to a working man's daily wage at the time, were perceived by many as an attractive investment opportunity.{{sfn|Taylor|2013|p=2}}{{#tag:ref|Until the [[pound sterling]] was [[Decimal Day|decimalised]] in 1971, each pound was made up of 240 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]], with 12 pence in a [[shilling]] and 20 shillings in a pound.{{sfn|Robens|Jayaweera|Kiefer|2014|p=74}}|group="n"|name="predecimalmoney"}} There was enough demand for the certificates that MacGregor was able to raise the price to two shillings and sixpence per acre in July 1822, then gradually to four shillings per acre, without diminishing sales;{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=74}} according to MacGregor, about 500 had bought Poyaisian land by early 1823.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=247}} The buyers included many who invested their life savings.{{sfn|Straney|2011|p=33}} MacGregor became, to quote one 21st-century financial analyst, the "founding father of [[securities fraud]]".{{sfn|Straney|2011|p=35}}

Alongside the land certificate sales, MacGregor spent several months organising the issue of a Poyaisian government loan on the London Stock Exchange. As a precursor to this he registered his 1820 land grant at the [[Court of Chancery]] on 14 October 1822. [[Sir John Perring, 1st Baronet|Sir John Perring, Shaw, Barber &amp; Co.]], a London bank with a fine reputation, underwrote a £200,000 loan—secured on "all the revenues of the Government of Poyais" including the sale of land—and offered provisional certificates or "[[scrip]]" for the Poyaisian bonds on 23 October. The bonds were in denominations of £100, £200 and £500, and offered at a marked-down purchase price of 80%. The certificate could be acquired for 15%, with the rest due over two instalments on 17 January and 14 February 1823. The interest rate was 6% per annum.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=78–80}}{{#tag:ref|The bonds were due to [[Maturity (finance)|mature]] in 1852.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=78–80}}|group="n"|name="mature"}} If the Poyaisian issue successfully emulated its Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean counterparts, MacGregor stood to amass a fortune.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=45, 246}}

===Eager settlers===
For settlers, MacGregor deliberately targeted his fellow Scots, assuming that as a Scotsman himself they would be [[Affinity fraud|more likely to trust him]].{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} Their emigration served to reassure potential investors in the Poyaisian bonds and land certificates firstly that the country was real, and secondly that it was being developed and would provide monetary returns.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} In Sinclair's assessment, this aspect of the scheme "turn[ed] what would have been an inspired hoax into a cruel and deadly one".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=322–323}} [[Tamar Frankel]] posits in her analysis that, at least to some degree, MacGregor "probably believed his own story" and genuinely hoped to forge these people into a Poyaisian society.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{refn|Sinclair suggests that the Cazique either was "seduced by his own pretensions" and self-removed from reality while perpetrating the fraud, or simply did not care what happened to the emigrants.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=322–326}}|group="n"|name="seducedbydelusions"}} MacGregor told his would-be colonists that he wished to see Poyais populated with Scots as they possessed the necessary hardiness and character to develop the new country.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} Alluding to the rivalry with England and the Darien episode—which, he stressed, had involved a direct ancestor of his—MacGregor suggested that in Poyais they might right this historic wrong and salvage Scottish pride.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=42}} Skilled tradesmen and [[artisan]]s were promised free passage to Poyais, supplies, and lucrative government contracts.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=80–81}} Hundreds, mostly Scots, signed up to emigrate—enough to fill seven ships.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}} They included a City of London banker named Mauger (who was to head the Bank of Poyais), doctors, civil servants, young men whose families had bought them commissions in the Poyaisian Army and Navy, and an Edinburgh cobbler who accepted the post of Official Shoemaker to the Princess of Poyais.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=76–77, 230}}

MacGregor bartered these worthless notes to his would-be settlers, taking their real British money in exchange.|alt=A piece of paper headed with a coat of arms and the words "One Dollar, Bank of Poyais", with smaller writing beneath.]]
Leadership of the Cazique's first emigration party was given to an ex-British Army officer, Hector Hall, who was commissioned into the Poyaisian "2nd Native Regiment of Foot" with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and created "Baron Tinto" with a supposed 12,800-acre (20-square-mile; 52-square-kilometre) estate.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=76–77}} Hall would sail with 70 emigrants on {{ship||Honduras Packet|1800 ship|2}}, a vessel MacGregor had encountered in South America.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=75}} MacGregor saw them off from London on 10 September 1822, entrusting to Mauger 5,000 Bank of Poyais dollar notes produced by the [[Bank of Scotland]]'s official printer.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=77–78}} "The new world of their dreams suddenly became a very real world as the men accepted the Cazique's dollar notes," Sinclair writes. "The people who had bought land, and who had planned to take their savings with them in coin, were also delighted to exchange their gold for the legal currency of Poyais."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=80–81}} After MacGregor spoke briefly to each of the settlers to wish them luck, he and Hall exchanged salutes and the ''Honduras Packet'' set sail, flying the Green Cross flag.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=77–78}}

A second emigrant ship—{{ship||Kennersley Castle|1811 ship|2}}, a merchantman docked at [[Leith]], near Edinburgh—was hired by MacGregor in October 1822,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=80–81}} and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=3–9}} MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard to see that they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=3–9}} The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=3–9}}

While claiming royal status as Cazique, MacGregor attempted to dissociate himself from the Latin American republican movement and his former comrades there, and from late 1822 made discreet overtures towards the Spanish government regarding co-operation in Central America. The Spanish paid him little notice.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=45–46}} The Poyaisian bonds' price remained fairly steady until they were crippled by developments elsewhere in the market during November and December 1822. Amid the general instability in South America, the Colombian government suggested that its London agent might have exceeded his authority when he arranged the £2&amp;nbsp;million loan. When this representative suddenly died, the frantic buying of South American securities was abruptly replaced by equally restless selling.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=81–84}} The Cazique's cash flow was all but wiped out when most of those who had bought the Poyaisian scrip did not make the payments due in January.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=246–247}} While the price of the Colombian bonds steadied and eventually rose again, the Poyaisian securities never recovered; by late 1823 they were traded for less than 10% of their face value.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}{{refn|MacGregor had thus far grossed about £50,000.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} A scathing review of the ''Sketch'', entitled "The Poyais Bubble", was published in Volume XXVIII of the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' in February 1823.{{sfn|Quarterly Review|1823|pp=158–161}} The author debunked Poyais as a fabrication, identified earlier works reprinted wholesale in the ''Sketch'', and warned investors not to be fooled.{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=445}} A correspondent identified only as "Verax" replied with an [[open letter|open]] "Letter to the Editor of the ''Quarterly Review''",{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|p=445}} in which he corroborated the ''Sketch''{{'}}s claims regarding Poyais and the fertility of its soil, and asserted that the author of "The Poyais Bubble" had greatly misunderstood MacGregor.{{sfn|Verax|1823|pp=3, 7}} MacGregor floated a second £200,000 Poyais loan in early October 1823, again with Sir John Perring underwriting the issue, but failed to sell many bonds.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=248–249}}|group="n"|name="poyaisbubble"}}

===Disappointment===
''Honduras Packet'' reached the Black River in November 1822. Bemused to find a country rather different from the ''Sketch''{{'}}s descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=88–91}}{{#tag:ref|St Joseph had been a real place in the Black River settlement of the 18th century, but had never reached anything close to the level of development described by MacGregor's publicity material.{{sfn|Hasbrouck|1927|pp=441, 445}}|group="n"|name="stjoseph"}} Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=102–104}} A few weeks after their arrival, the captain of the ''Honduras Packet'' abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=88–91}}{{refn|''Honduras Packet'' had remained anchored off the mouth of the river as the emigrants gradually unloaded their supplies.

The ''Kennersley Castle'' having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=98}} The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation,{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=95}} but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=96–97}}

Hall returned to Cape Gracias a Dios several times to seek help, but did not explain his constant absences to the settlers—this exacerbated the general confusion and anger, particularly when he refused to pay the wages promised to those supposedly on Poyaisian government contracts.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=100–102}} With the coming of the [[Wet season|rainy season]] insects infested the camp, diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] took hold, and the emigrants sank into utter despair.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=100–102}} James Hastie, a Scottish [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]] who had brought his wife and three children with him, later wrote: "It seemed to be the will of Providence that every circumstance should combine for our destruction."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=98–100}} The would-be royal shoemaker, who had left a family in Edinburgh, shot himself.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=230}}{{refn|Separately from Hall, a small group of settlers attempted to reach [[British Honduras]], about {{convert|500|nmi}} to the north-west, in canoes.

The schooner ''Mexican Eagle'', from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of [[Belize City|Belize]], Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court, discovered the settlers in early May 1823. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist and that he had never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=232–236}}

Transported aboard the cramped ''Mexican Eagle''—the lack of space necessitated three trips—the emigrants were in miserable shape when they reached Belize, and in most cases had to be carried from the ship. The weather in British Honduras was even worse than that at the Black River, and the colony's authorities and doctors could do little to help the new arrivals. Disease spread rapidly among the settlers and most of them died. The colony's superintendent, Major-General Edward Codd, opened an official investigation to "lay open the true situation of the imaginary State of Poyais and&amp;nbsp;... the unfortunate emigrants", and sent word to Britain of the Poyais settlers' fate.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=236–240}} By the time the warning reached London, MacGregor had five more emigrant ships on the way; the Royal Navy  intercepted them.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=236–240}} A third vessel—{{ship||Skene|1816 ship|2}}, carrying 105 more Scottish emigrants—arrived at the Black River, but on seeing the abandoned colony the master Captain John Wilson sailed on to Belize and disembarked his passengers there.{{sfn|Codd|1824|pp=160–165}} The fourth and last ship to arrive was {{ship||Albion|1800 Whitehaven ship|2}}, which arrived at Belize in November 1823, but which was carrying provisions, arms, and stores and not passengers. The cargo was sold locally at auction.{{sfn|Codd|1824|pp=139–147}} The surviving colonists variously settled in the United States, remained in British Honduras, or sailed for home aboard the ''Ocean'', a British vessel that left Belize on 1 August 1823. Some died during the journey back across the Atlantic. Of the roughly 250 who had sailed on ''Honduras Packet'' and ''Kennersley Castle'', at least 180 had perished. Fewer than 50 ever returned to Britain.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=236–240}}

MacGregor left London shortly before the small party of Poyais survivors arrived home on 12 October 1823—he told Richardson that he was taking Josefa to winter in Italy for the sake of her health, but in fact his destination was Paris.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=240, 248–250}} The London press reported extensively on the Poyais scandal over the following weeks and months, stressing the colonists' travails and charging that MacGregor had orchestrated a massive fraud.{{#tag:ref|The commentators included [[Theodore Hook]], who lampooned the affair in ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' with a song called "The Court of Poyais", supposedly "by the Poyaisian poet laureate".

In Paris, MacGregor persuaded the Compagnie de la Nouvelle Neustrie, a firm of traders that aspired to prominence in South America, to seek investors and settlers for Poyais in France.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=260}} He concurrently intensified his efforts towards [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII of Spain]]—in a November 1823 letter the Cazique proposed to make Poyais a Spanish protectorate.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=46–47}} Four months later he offered to lead a Spanish campaign to reconquer Guatemala, using Poyais as a base.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=46–47}} Spain took no action.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=46–47}} MacGregor's "moment of greatest hubris", Matthew Brown suggests in his biographical portrait, came in December 1824 when, in a letter to the King of Spain, he claimed to be himself "descendent of the ancient Kings of Scotland".{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=46–47}} Around this time Josefa gave birth to the third and final MacGregor child, Constantino, at their home in the [[Champs-Élysées]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=276}} Gustavus Butler Hippisley, a friend of Major Richardson and fellow veteran of the British Legions in Latin America, accepted the Poyais fantasy as true and entered MacGregor's employ in March 1825.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=259}} Hippisley wrote back to Britain refuting "the bare-faced calumnies of a hireling press"; in particular he admonished a journalist who had called MacGregor a "penniless adventurer".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=261–262}} With Hippisley's help, MacGregor negotiated with the Nouvelle Neustrie company, whose managing director was a Frenchman called Lehuby, and agreed to sell the French company up to 500,000 acres (781 square miles; 2,023 square kilometres) in Poyais for its own settlement scheme; "a very clever way of distancing himself", Sinclair comments, as this time he would be able to say honestly that others were responsible and that he had merely made the land available.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=264–266}}

Lehuby's company readied a ship at [[Le Havre]] and began to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 obtained passports to travel to Poyais.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=264–266}} Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives to suggest that the relevant bonds were issued.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=264–266}} The ''Sketch'' was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called ''Some Account of the Poyais Country''.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=291}} French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had never heard of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=264–266}} Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=264–266}}

===1826 acquittal of fraud===
MacGregor went into hiding in the French provinces, while Lehuby fled to the southern Netherlands.

They were taken that evening to [[La Force Prison]].{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=268–270}} MacGregor was arrested after three months and brought to La Force on 7 December 1825.

The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=277–280}} MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=277–280}} The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=277–280}} The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=280–281}}

The fresh trial, scheduled for 20 May, was postponed when the prosecutor announced that he was not ready. The delay gave MacGregor and Merilhou time to prepare an elaborate, largely fictional 5,000-word statement purporting to describe the Scotsman's background, activities in the Americas, and total innocence of any endeavour to defraud.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=283}} When the trial finally began on 10 July 1826, Merilhou was present not as MacGregor's defence counsel but as a witness for the prosecution, having been called as such because of his links with the Nouvelle Neustrie company.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=283–288}} Merilhou entrusted MacGregor's defence to a colleague called Berville, who read the 5,000-word submission in full before the court. "Maître Merilhou, as the author of the address the court had heard, and Maître Berville, as the actor who read the script, had done their work extremely well," Sinclair writes; Lehuby was convicted of making false representations regarding the sale of shares, and sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment, but the Cazique was found not guilty on all charges, while the imputations against Hippisley and Irving were stricken from the record.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=283–288}}

===Return to Britain; lesser Poyais schemes===
[[File:1827-07-02 Poyaisian-Stock-Certificate.jpg|thumb|upright=0.58|One of the bonds issued for the £800,000 Poyaisian loan in 1827|alt=A long, convoluted-looking stock certificate]]
MacGregor quickly moved his family back to London, where the furore following the Poyais survivors' return had died down. In the midst of a serious economic downturn, some investors had subscribed to the £300,000 Poyais loan issued by Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company—apparently believing the assertion of the Cazique's publicists that the previous loans had [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] only because of embezzlement by one of his agents.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=289–292}} MacGregor was arrested soon after his arrival back in Britain, and held at [[Tothill Fields Bridewell]] in Westminster for about a week before being released without charge.{{#tag:ref|It is unclear on what grounds he was detained; no formal charges were brought. Sinclair suggests that his arrest was probably over outstanding debts, and that his quick release may be simply because was able to pay these off.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=292–294}}|group="n"|name="tothill"}} He initiated a new, less ornate version of the Poyais scheme, describing himself simply as the "Cacique of the Republic of Poyais".{{#tag:ref|"Cacique" was the French spelling of "Cazique". The slight change in nomenclature does not seem to have been significant.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=292–294}}|group="n"|name="cacique"}} The new Poyaisian office at 23 Threadneedle Street made none of the claims to diplomatic status the old Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill had done.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=294}}

MacGregor persuaded Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company to act as brokers for an £800,000 loan, issued on 20-year bonds at 3% interest, in mid-1827. The bonds, produced at nominal values of £250, £500 and £1,000, did not become popular.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=294–296}} An anonymous handbill was circulated in the City of London, describing the previous Poyais loans and warning readers to "Take Care of your Pockets—Another Poyais Humbug".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=294–296}} The loan's poor performance compelled MacGregor to pass most of the unsold certificates to a consortium of speculators for a small sum.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=296–297}} Sinclair stresses that the Poyais bonds were perceived as "humbug" not because MacGregor's hoax had been fully unravelled, but simply because the prior securities had failed to deliver profitable returns. "Nobody thought to question the legitimacy of Poyais itself", he elaborates. "Some investors had begun to understand that they were being fleeced, but almost none realised how comprehensively."{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=296–297}}

Other variants on the Poyais scheme were similarly unsuccessful. In 1828 MacGregor began to sell certificates entitling the holders to "land in Poyais Proper" at five shillings per acre. Two years later [[Robert Charles Frederic|King Robert Charles Frederic]], who had succeeded his brother George Frederic Augustus in 1824, issued thousands of certificates covering the same territory and offered them to lumber companies in London, directly competing with MacGregor. When the original investors demanded their long-overdue interest, MacGregor could only pay with more certificates. Other charlatans soon caught on and set up their own rival "Poyaisian offices" in London, offering land debentures in competition with both MacGregor and the Mosquito king.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=297–300}} By 1834 MacGregor was back in Scotland and living in Edinburgh. He paid some unredeemed securities by issuing yet another series of Poyaisian land certificates.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=303–304}} Two years later he published a constitution for a smaller Poyaisian republic, centred on the region surrounding the Black River, and headed by himself as President.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=303–304}} It was clear, however, that "Poyais had had its day," as Sinclair puts it.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=303–304}} An attempt by MacGregor to sell some land certificates in 1837 marks the last record of any Poyais scheme.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=303–304}}{{#tag:ref|Including all iterations of the Poyais fraud, MacGregor issued certificates covering at least half of the 8&amp;nbsp;million acres covered by the 1820 land grant. King Robert Charles Frederic produced enough documents to sell the same land several times over.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=297–300}}|group="n"|name="samelandseveraltimes"}}

==Return to Venezuela and death==
[[File:Joseph Thomas 1839 000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Caracas]], where MacGregor spent his last years, as painted by Joseph Thomas in 1839|alt=An exotic New World city, viewed from atop a nearby hill]]
Josefa MacGregor died at [[Burghmuirhead]], near Edinburgh, on 4 May 1838.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=54–55}} MacGregor almost immediately left for Venezuela, where he resettled in Caracas and in October 1838 applied for citizenship and restoration to his former rank in the Venezuelan Army, with back pay and a pension.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}}{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=54–55}} He stressed his travails on Venezuela's behalf two decades earlier and asserted that Bolívar, who had died in 1830, had effectively deported him; he described several unsuccessful requests to return and being {{nobreak|"[forced}} to] remain outside the Republic&amp;nbsp;... by causes and obstacles out of my control" while losing his wife, two children and "the best years of my life and all my fortune".{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=54–55}}{{#tag:ref|MacGregor's children seem to have stayed in Scotland. His daughter Josefa died there in 1872 leaving two sons, neither of whom had children. No record survives regarding what became of Gregorio and Constantino MacGregor.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|p=308}}|group="n"|name="children"}}

The Defence Minister [[Rafael Urdaneta]], who had served alongside MacGregor during the Aux Cayes expedition of 1816, asked the Senate to look upon the Scotsman's application favourably as he had "enlisted in our ranks from the very start of the War of Independence, and ran the same risks as all the patriots of that disastrous time, meriting promotions and respect because of his excellent personal conduct"—MacGregor's contributions had been "heroic with immense results".{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=54–55}} President [[José Antonio Páez]], another former revolutionary comrade, approved the application in March 1839.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=54–55}}

MacGregor was duly confirmed as a Venezuelan citizen and divisional general in the Venezuelan Army, with a pension of one-third of his salary.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} He settled in the capital and became a respected member of the local community.{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} After his death at home in Caracas on 4 December 1845, he was buried with full military honours in [[Caracas Cathedral]],{{sfn|Dawson|2004}} with President [[Carlos Soublette]], Cabinet ministers and the military chiefs of Venezuela marching behind his coffin.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=328–329}} Obituaries in the Caracas press extolled General MacGregor's "heroic and triumphant retreat" to Barcelona in 1816 and described him as "a valiant champion of independence".{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=328–329}} "There was not a word about Amelia Island, Porto Bello or Rio de la Hacha, and there was no reference to the Cazique of Poyais," Sinclair concludes.{{sfn|Sinclair|2004|pp=328–329}} The part of today's Honduras that was supposedly called Poyais remains undeveloped in the 21st century. Back in Scotland, at the MacGregor graveyard near Loch Katrine, the clan memorial stones make no mention of Gregor MacGregor or the country he invented.{{sfn|The Economist|2012}}

A '''haunted doll''' is a handmade or manufactured [[doll]] or [[stuffed animal]] that is reported to be cursed or possessed in some way. The earliest report of a haunted doll goes back to [[Ancient Egypt]] where the enemies of [[Ramesses III]] attempted to use wax images of his likeness to bring about his death. The dolls used in this ritual were said to be living and would curse anyone who bore their resemblance. The ancient Egyptian poppet, effigy and voodoo dolls are often said to be cursed because of their long history of being used to place curses on other people and their association with the occult.

==Early history==
The earliest haunted dolls were [[poppet]]s, [[effigies]] and [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] objects which were created by early peoples for either religious or ceremonial purposes. These traditional objects were later acquired by various civilizations for mystical purposes or the occult.&lt;ref name="paganwiccan.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/poppetmagic/p/Poppet_History.htm|title=Poppet History - Global Poppet Magic|author=Patti Wigington|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] dolls were used quite often in magical rituals to represent a connection to a god or goddess.&lt;ref name="Magic In Greece and Rome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3672405/An_Examination_of_Ancient_Greek_and_Roman_Witches_throughout_Literature|title=An Examination of Ancient Greek and Roman Witches throughout Literature|author=Debbie Turkilsen|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian priests and magicians often used poppets for ceremonial purposes, to rid the body of evil or to place curses on those who went against the will of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Heka: Magic of Ancient Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/religion/magic.htm|title=Heka, the ancient Egyptian magic|work=reshafim.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poppets have historically been used to place curses on other members of a community for religious or traditional purposes.&lt;ref name="paganwiccan.about.com"/&gt; Some of the earliest effigies were used by African, Native American, and European cultures. The European poppet has its roots in early Germanic and Scandinavian tribes which used them for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="paganwiccan.about.com"/&gt; Modern day [[Wiccans]] have adapted this practice for their own uses. Most Wiccans use a [[poppet]] as a symbolic representation of a person. Spells and other actions are performed on the poppet to transfer whatever might be affecting the targeted individual out of their body in something like a healing ritual.&lt;ref name="paganwiccan.about.com"/&gt; The Kongolese ''[[nkisi]]'' statuettes, and the ''bocio'' figurines used in Vodun traditions of Benin and Togo, are traditional [[effigy]]-like dolls of West and Central Africa believed by their practitioners to be "spirit embodying" forces that can also "heal or protect".&lt;ref name="Bongmba2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias Kifon Bongmba|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to African Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFRRl1vv0kwC&amp;pg=PA118|date=21 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9690-1|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voodoo doll]]s are fairly modern novelty items. Their concept is thought to be based on European poppet dolls.

==Famous haunted dolls==
Although tales of haunted dolls or cursed objects in general have a long history, a number of supposedly haunted dolls have appeared in [[popular culture]] in recent years.&lt;ref name="PulliamFonseca2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=June Pulliam|author2=Anthony Fonseca|title=Ghosts in Popular Culture and Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUfpDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=26 September 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3491-2|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Indian National Rally Championship'''  or ('''INRC''') is a [[rallying]] series organised by the [[Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India]] (FMSCI), which is the Governing Body or ASN of India recognised by [[FIA]] culminating with National Champion Driver and Co-Driver. The driver and co-drivers's championship are based on a point system. The championship first received its National Championship Title status in 1988.

==Rally formats==
Prior to the inception of INRC, Motor Rally in India was run on [[Regularity rally|TSD]] (Time, Speed, and Distance) format. During 70’s the TSD events ran into several states with distances covering several days and distances exceeded over 1000&amp;nbsp;km.

===TSD endurance format===
Up till 1988, the TSD format was modeled on endurance format with Popular Rally starting in [[Cochin]] would have a re-group in [[Coimbatore]] or [[Ooty]], covering a few days and close to 1000&amp;nbsp;km. Same for South India Rally (Chennai), Karnataka 1000 (Bangalore), Scissors Action Rally (Coimbatore) all had routes cris-crossing into each other cities and covered two or more states. Overnight re-grouping was done at different locations and a fresh starting order was issued in a re-group start. Routes were mostly dirt and off-road conditions as well as ghat sections.

===Stage rally===
Since 1988, [[FMSCI]] introduced the Stage rally format for the INRC which was then known as the FMSCI Indian Rally Drivers Championship (FIRDC), which usually covered between {{convert|300|and|400|km|abbr=on}} and Rallies were conducted in low traffic areas in country side. Some events were Day Rallies; others ran in Night only while some had a mix of Day and Night.

Over a period, the Stage Distance became shorter and overall Rally was conducted in a few closed stages, closed to traffic. Since 2000 under [[Motorsports Association of India|MAI]], the Rally ran as per FIA regulations in a format of a one Day Recce, Two Day Rally and the results were announced by the end of the day. Also stage Marshall Training was conducted by hiring FIA nominated personals by both FMSCI and MAI. Spectator and competitor safety became prime factor in event management.
Also during the MAI years night rallies were stopped as well as Two Wheeler rallying.

===Event equipments and communication===

Computers were used since 1988 rallies for tabulating penalty points, while [[Amateur radio|HAM radio]] was the principal form of communication by Rally Headquarters between Time Controls and [[Racing marshall|Marshall]]s while the teams operated between the drivers and their crews in a different frequency as allotted by the INRC and Ham Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ham Radio in INRC| publisher = Zee News India| year = 2011 | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/motorsports/indian-national-rally-championship-from-july-23_720746.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Support of Coimbatore Amateur Radio Club and Kodaikanal Amateur Radio Society| publisher = Times of India| year = 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-19/racing/29789926_1_kms-national-rally-championship-special-stages}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001, standardized electronic Timing equipments were used by all clubs. Also INRC awarded trophies to the clubs for safety and administration, based on a point system audit by FIA and MAI observers. At times a bad event management attracted termination of hosting the INRC round the following year.

==Teams==
The ITC sponsored Scissors Action Rally Team, based out of Coimbatore having strong links to the Coimbatore Auto Sports Club, was the first in establishing a professional rally team in late 80’s, eventually winning the inaugural rally in the INRC year 1988. This team had several top title contenders like L. Gopalakrishnan, DPF Krishnakumar and the two were leading the championship points at times during the 88 and 89 seasons.

[[MRF Tyres]] were one of the major sponsors for some of the leading drivers and two wheelers riders since early 80’s, fielding some of the leading as well as new talents in both Four Wheelers and Two Wheelers. Though the team concept was non-existent then, MRF sponsored competitors had their own tuners. It was not until 1989 [[J. Anand]] and a year later [[N. Leelakrishnan]] would establish the MRF rally units. The Cochin-based Popular Automobiles had the Popular Rally Team and Kirloskar, Veedol Oil and Raymonds used to sponsor drivers from Maharashtra. There were other local Teams like Team Kadur too. Most of these those teams were competing or sponsoring drivers since early eighties. MRF Tyres would also eventually establish a Motorsport division with Anthony Rodricks as its head.

After the introduction of INRC championship title format, several new teams entered into Rallying. The notable entry was by JK Tyres, who in 1992 signed an agreement with S. Karivardhan for Motor Rallying as well as Racing activities. JK Motorsports since then managed by Sanjay Sharma had been in Motor Rallying and Track racing in a major way by sponsoring drivers to international competitions. In 1993 another new team emerged from Irujalakuda, named Team Paarel which also won the 1993 Karnataka-1000 driven by Vinil Varghese. In 1995 Chetinnad Cements sponsored Chettinad Motorsports started competing in the stock Group N category. So did other Teams like Kari Sports, Kumci Sports etc.

There were other private entrants who mostly filled the rest half of the field.

The MRF rally team continued to flourish under the leadership of Antony Rodrigues and Soman Joseph and several of their drivers set many records during the period. The main drivers and navigators where; Karandip Singh/Jaidas Menon, Arjun Balu/Kumar ramswami, LOhit Urs/Chandramouli. Meanwhile, Gaurav Gill of JK tyres joined MRF Tyres co-navigated by Musa Sherif and won many titles.

In recent years, Red Rooster Racing, a new Team based out of Bangalore entered the INRC in 2008 with N. Leelakrishnan as their Technical Director and went on to win the Championship in their debut year. This triggered a fierce battle between Red Rooster Racing and Team MRF Tyres for the next two years and was the highlight of the INRC in recent years. Red Rooster Racing however closed down at the end of 2010 due to financial difficulties but by then, they had won the championship 2 out of the 3 years they entered the INRC.

Two of the Team Drivers, Amittrajit Ghosh &amp; Karna Kadur left to be part of another new outfit, Team RRPM with support from MRF Tyres and went on to win the Group N championship in 2011 and the INRC in 2012 &amp; 2013.

In 2012, another new Team called Slideways Industries joined the INRC with the support of VW and JK Tyres with drivers like [[Karamjit Singh]] and Vikram Mathias.

In 2016, Team Karna Kadur (Driver) and Nikhil Pai (Co-driver) became the INRC Champions. 

In 2017, Gaurav Gill (Driver) and Musa Sherif (Co-driver) of Team Mahindra Adventure became the INRC Champions. 

==Four wheelers==
[[Ambassador]]s and [[Premier Padmini]]s dominated the rallying scene till early '80s. The Group A(II) IND Premier Padminis continued in the INRC years till late '90s. [[Sipani]] [[Reliant Kitten|Dolphins]] was a preferred choice for Vicky Chandhok and others who were dominant between 85 and 88 years. [[Hindustan Contessa]] Classic and Premier 118NE made brief appearances of which the later was driven by K. D. Madan and Kamlesh Patel, winning the 1987 Karnataka K-1000 Rally.
[[File:Farad Bathena and Raj Bagri in MRF Maruti Gypsy in 1989 South India Rally.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Farad Bathena and Raj Bagri in MRF Maruti Gypsy in 1989 South India Rally]]
[[Maruti 800]] also had a significant presence as they were already competing in the Sholavaram 800CC class. The INRC's inaugural rally in 1988, Scissors Master Action Rally in Coimbatore was won by L. Gopalakrishnan and Mahendran, driving a Group A(II)IND Maruti 800 for the Scissors Action Rally Team.

===Maruti Gypsy era===

[[File:Castrol South India Rally 1993 (N. Leela Krishnan).jpg|thumb|right|210px|N. Leelakrishnan and Farooq Ahmed in a Group A(II) IND Maruti Gypsy during the 1993 Castrol South India Rally]]
Post INRC, most top drivers switched to the [[Maruti Gypsy]] for its off-road and [[Four-wheel drive]] capabilities. The highly modified Group A (II) IND category allowed tuners the flexibility to choose between a wide range of cam shafts, tuned exhausts and heavily modified cylinder heads. Till 1992, MRF was the principal choice of tyres for most Maruti Gypsys and twin [[Weber carburetor]]s were the preferred choice for the fully modified class. For the 1994 season [[S. Karivardhan]] opted for computer programmable [[Electronic Fuel Injection]] for Hari Singh's Team JK Gypsy and they were dominant during that period, prompting  N. Leelakrishnan to follow suit in EFI systems for his Rally cars. Alarmed at the high budgets and top speeds of the top runners, [[FMSCI]] for 1996 season finally outlawed the Group A (II) IND category and reverted to Group A (I) IND category which restricted engine modifications and the regular stock Group N category. The loud intake and screaming exhaust note with crackling backfire were missed by many rally fans.

===Maruti Esteem era===
In 1996 [[Maruti Esteem]], became the preferred choice for all top teams and was confined to Group A (I) IND category. The Maruti Esteem also had a high power weight ratio compared to other cars in India. The Rally terrain was split in two formats, Dirt or Tarmac for the entire event. Events like K-1000, South India Rally and Coimbatore rallies mostly ran in Dirt format, while Popular Rally and Rally D’ Endurance opted for tarmac rallies. Hence the choice of tyres and suspension setup for the saloon cars were done well before the rally. Also with restricted engine power and more Tarmac rallies for saloon cars meant suspension tuning for handling by tuners became the deciding factor for a cars performance.

===Maruti Baleno and Honda City era===
[[File:Naren Kumar.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Naren Kumar and Ramkumar in a Group N [[Maruti Baleno]] [[Rally Car]] in [[Mysore]] Safari Rally in 2005.]]
By 2000, with the launch of [[Honda City]] [[VTEC]] and [[Maruti Baleno]]s Team JK and MRF opted for these two cars of which the less powerful Maruti Baleno’s were given for the mid-field contenders. Still [[Maruti Esteem]] remained the favorite among the privateers and novices in the group N category. Also [[Honda City]] cars were more reliable and suspension tuning became the deciding factor for vehicle performance. A few mid-runners opted for the new 16 Valve MPFI Maruti Esteem's for its low running costs.

====Rally Star Cup====
MAI launched a new "Rally Star Cup" for novices as a "Pay and Drive" package deal with service as per MAI's arrangement with a few teams. The cars were the older carburrated Maruti Esteems. This new programme was to encourage new and young drivers into rallying without the burden of spending huge money for cars and service crew.

===Mitsubishi Cedia===
With the introduction of the much powerful Group N &amp; N+ [[Mitsubishi Lancer|Mitsubishi Cedia]] with a power over 230 BHP in Group N+ trim, most top runners switched to it.

The Maruti Gypsy again made appearances in [[INRC]] events as a new Gypsy class was created by FMSCI in 2008.

Currently Mitsubishi Cedia is the most powerful car dominating the Indian Rally Scene. In 2013, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] made its debut and is making its presence felt in the INRC as a strong contender for being the most dominant car.

The FMSCI has in the recent past since 2012 made quite a few changes to the INRC. It stopped the highly modified Group N+ category and followed the FIA Group N regulations for all its classes. The Junior Indian National Rally Championship (JINRC) to promote young talent was also introduced thereby stopping the Rally Star Cup.

The other class that it created is the Indian Rally Championship which is open to foreign nationals as well as Indians in imported cars conforming to the FIA Group N category. With this, Indian rally fans have been able to see cars like the [[Mitsubishi Evo X]] and [[Subaru Impreza]] on Indian rally stages.

In 2012, the Gypsy class was stopped and in 2013, the FMSCI created a SUV class running as per the FIA T1 &amp; T2 regulations. The [[Mahindra XUV 500]] has come out to be the vehicle to beat in this class.

==FMSCI years==
FMSCI was the governing body from 1988 till 1999. During this period Two Wheelers were also included in the Championship. It was then known as [[FIRDC]] Championship and was sponsored by [[Castrol]]. The international sports governing body FIA reverted the governing and sanctioning rights to FMSCI in October 2008, and since 2009 season INRC is governed by FMSCI.

==MAI years==
Between the years 2000 and 2008 MAI (Motorsports Authority Of India) was approved by FIA to administer and govern the National Championship. In 2008, the sanctioning and governing authority was reverted to FMSCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FMSCI gets upper hand in the power struggle| publisher = DNA Newspaper | year = 2008 | url = http://www.toyotabharat.com/inen/news/2012/oct_6.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Mini Meet''' or '''International Mini Meeting''' is a campaign event for [[Mini]] owners and drivers which started in [[Germany]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/news/2017-international-mini-meeting/|title=Thousands of Minis Invade Ireland for 2017 International Meeting {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2017-05-24|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://carbuzz.com/news/minis-meet-in-mugello|title=Minis Meet in Mugello|work=CarBuzz|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://3d-car-shows.com/mugello-to-become-a-hotspot-for-classic-mini-fans/|title=Mugello to become a hotspot for classic Mini fans|date=2013-05-17|work=3D Car Shows|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.craveonline.com/design/859961-2015-international-mini-meet-conquers-lithuania#/slide/1|title=2015 International MINI Meet Conquers Lithuania - CraveOnline|date=2015-05-25|work=CraveOnline|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thenewswheel.com/international-mini-meet-lithuania-draws-european-cars/|title=International MINI Meet in Lithuania Draws Hundreds of European Cars|date=2015-05-27|work=The News Wheel|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meet is organised by a collection of Mini clubs. Its goal is to bring together Mini enthusiasts from around the world.

The event caters to the interests of Mini drivers, as well as those looking to purchase the [[automobile|car]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/motors/mayo-gearing-up-to-host-biggest-mini-festival-in-europe-1.3080154|title=Mayo gearing up to host biggest Mini festival in Europe|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the purely automotive aspect of the meet, participants can also take part in treasure hunts, slalom races, and other Mini-themed events.

==Schedule==
The Meet starts on a Friday afternoon. An official welcome gathering occurs that evening, which includes a presentation of all participating clubs.

On Saturday, the presidents' meeting takes place. During this meeting, individual clubs can make a presentation in hopes of winning the right to host a future event. Saturday evening usually brings a themed party.

On Sunday, a form of [[cavalcade]], featuring various Minis, is held. On Sunday evening, the event is closed by a formal handover of "the event key" to the club organizing it the year after.

==Location==
Every year the event takes place in a different country, usually around the [[Whitsun]] weekend. The club's rules provide also that every 5 years since 1989 (counting from 1959), the event be celebrated in [[England]], the birthplace of the Mini car. These conventions usually take place in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://imm2017.ie/about-the-imm/|title=About the IMM|date=2016-03-08|work=IMM 2017|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnbullas/sets/72157606282185417/|title=International Mini Meeting Logos|last=Bullas|first=John|date=|work=Flickr|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424233715/http://www.internationalminimeeting.org:80/index.php/history|title=IMM History - www.internationalminimeeting.org - Wayback Machine 20100424|last=|first=|date=2010-04-24|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement''' is an international [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] movement with approximately 17 million [[Volunteering|volunteers]], members and staff worldwide&lt;ref name="ARC-understanding"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d229a5f06620c6052b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=6c7695e5ded8e110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=5002af3fbac3b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD|title=Take a Class|publisher=Red Cross|date=|accessdate=2016-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626020853/http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d229a5f06620c6052b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=6c7695e5ded8e110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=5002af3fbac3b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD|archive-date=June 26, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering.

The movement consists of several distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organisations. The movement's parts are:

* The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) is a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, in particular by [[Henry Dunant]] and [[Gustave Moynier]].  Its 25-member committee has a unique authority under [[international humanitarian law]] to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts. The ICRC was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] on three occasions (in 1917, 1944 and 1963).&lt;ref name="NobelFactsorg"/&gt;
*The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) was founded in 1919 and today it coordinates activities between the 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies within the Movement. On an international level, the Federation leads and organizes, in close cooperation with the National Societies, relief assistance missions responding to large-scale emergencies. The International Federation Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1963, the Federation (then known as the League of Red Cross Societies) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the ICRC.&lt;ref name="NobelFactsorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/organizations.html|title=Nobel Laureates Facts&amp;nbsp;— Organizations|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] exist in nearly every country in the world. Currently 190 National Societies are recognized by the ICRC and admitted as full members of the Federation. Each entity works in its home country according to the principles of international humanitarian law and the statutes of the international Movement. Depending on their specific circumstances and capacities, National Societies can take on additional humanitarian tasks that are not directly defined by international humanitarian law or the mandates of the international Movement. In many countries, they are tightly linked to the respective national health care system by providing [[emergency medical services]].

==History==

===International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)===

====Solferino, Jean-Henri Dunant and foundation.====
[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Henri Dunant]], author of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''.]]

Until the middle of the 19th century, there were no organized and/or well-established army nursing systems for casualties and no safe and protected institutions to accommodate and treat those who were wounded on the battlefield.  A devout [[Reformed Christian]], the Swiss businessman [[Jean-Henri Dunant]], in June 1859, traveled to Italy to meet French emperor [[Napoléon III]] with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria, at that time occupied by France.&lt;ref name="YoungHoyland2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=John|last2=Hoyland|first2=Greg|title=Christianity: A Complete Introduction|date=14 July 2016|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|language=English|isbn=9781473615779|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in the small town of [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June after the [[Battle of Solferino]], an engagement in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War]]. In a single day, about 40,000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field. Jean-Henri Dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle, the suffering of the wounded soldiers, and the near-total lack of medical attendance and basic care. He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He took point in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance with the local villagers to aid without discrimination.
[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|left|Original document of the [[First Geneva Convention]], 1864]]

Back in his home in [[Geneva]], he decided to write a book entitled ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'' which he published using his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe, and people he thought could help him make a change. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war, an idea that was inspired by Christian teaching regarding social responsibility, as well as his experience after the battlefield of Solferino.&lt;ref name="SendingPouliot2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sending|first1=Ole Jacob|last2=Pouliot|first2=Vincent|last3=Neumann|first3=Iver B.|title=Diplomacy and the Making of World Politics|date=20 August 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9781316368787|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stefon|first=Matt|title=Christianity: History, Belief, and Practice|year=2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9781615304936|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YoungHoyland2016"/&gt; In addition, he called for the development of an international treaty to guarantee the protection of medics and field hospitals for soldiers wounded on the battlefield.

In 1863, [[Gustave Moynier]], a Geneva lawyer and president of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, received a copy of Dunant's book and introduced it for discussion at a meeting of that society. As a result of this initial discussion the society established an investigatory commission to examine the feasibility of Dunant's suggestions and eventually to organize an international conference about their possible implementation. The members of this committee, which has subsequently been referred to as the "Committee of the Five," aside from Dunant and Moynier were physician [[Louis Appia]], who had significant experience working as a field surgeon; Appia's friend and colleague [[Théodore Maunoir]], from the Geneva Hygiene and Health Commission; and [[Guillaume Henri Dufour|Guillaume-Henri Dufour]], a [[Swiss Army]] general of great renown. Eight days later, the five men decided to rename the committee to the "International Committee for Relief to the Wounded". In October (26–29) 1863, the international conference organized by the committee was held in Geneva to develop possible measures to improve medical services on the battlefield. The conference was attended by 36 individuals: eighteen official delegates from national governments, six delegates from other non-governmental organizations, seven non-official foreign delegates, and the five members of the International Committee. The states and kingdoms represented by official delegates were: [[Austrian Empire]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], [[Second French Empire]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]], [[Spanish Empire]], [[United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Bennett: The Geneva Convention.

[[File:Les 5 fondateurs.jpg|thumb|right|"Committee of the Five": Gustave Moynier, Guillaume-Henri Dufour, Henry Dunant, Louis Appia, Théodore Maunoir]]

Among the proposals written in the final resolutions of the conference, adopted on 29 October 1863, were:

* The foundation of national relief societies for wounded soldiers;
* Neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers;
* The utilization of volunteer forces for relief assistance on the battlefield;
* The organization of additional conferences to enact these concepts;
* The introduction of a common distinctive protection symbol for medical personnel in the field, namely a white armlet bearing a red cross.

Only one year later, the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries, as well as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, to attend an official diplomatic conference. Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty-six delegates to Geneva. On 22 August 1864, the conference adopted the first [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] "for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field". Representatives of 12 states and kingdoms signed the convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=120 |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field.

{{div col end}}

The convention contained ten articles, establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict.

Directly following the establishment of the Geneva Convention, the first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, [[Oldenburg]], Prussia, Spain, and Württemberg. Also in 1864, [[Louis Appia]] and [[Charles William Meredith van de Velde|Charles van de Velde]], a captain of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]], became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first [[International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded]] was convened.

Also in 1867, Jean-Henri Dunant was forced to declare [[bankruptcy]] due to business failures in [[Algeria]], partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the International Committee. Controversy surrounding Dunant's business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion, combined with an ongoing conflict with Gustave Moynier, led to Dunant's expulsion from his position as a member and secretary. He was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Thus, he was forced to leave Geneva and never returned to his home city.

In the following years, national societies were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth-century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dromi|first1=Shai M.|title=For good and country: nationalism and the diffusion of humanitarianism in the late nineteenth century|journal=The Sociological Review|date=2016|volume=64|issue=2|pages=79–97|doi=10.1002/2059-7932.12003|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2059-7932.12003/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, the committee adopted the name "International Committee of the Red Cross" (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the [[American Red Cross]] was founded through the efforts of [[Clara Barton]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7315/ |title = The Story of My Childhood |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1907 |accessdate = 2013-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work.

When the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded in 1901, the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] opted to give it jointly to Jean-Henri Dunant and [[Frédéric Passy]], a leading international pacifist. More significant than the honor of the prize itself, this prize marked the overdue rehabilitation of Jean-Henri Dunant and represented a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of [[Heiden, Switzerland|Heiden]]. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the Committee as its longest-serving president ever.

In 1906, the 1864 Geneva Convention was revised for the first time. One year later, the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention X]], adopted at the Second International Peace Conference in [[The Hague]], extended the scope of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Shortly before the beginning of the [[First World War]] in 1914, 50 years after the foundation of the ICRC and the adoption of the first Geneva Convention, there were already 45 national relief societies throughout the world. The movement had extended itself beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela), Asia (the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, [[Thailand|Siam]]), and Africa ([[Union of South Africa]]).

====World War I====

[[File:War 1914-1918. International Prisoners-of-War Agency.jpg|thumb|War 1914-1918. Geneva, Rath Museum. International Prisoners-of-War Agency. Researches department. German section. Express messages and communications to families.]]

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges that it could handle only by working closely with the national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 August 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War ([[POW]]) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million [[Swiss franc]]s in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational card index of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923. The card index led to the identification of about 2 million POWs and the ability to contact their families. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum]] in Geneva. The right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC.

During the entire war, the ICRC monitored warring parties' compliance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country. When [[chemical weapons]] were used in this war for the first time in history, the ICRC vigorously protested against this new type of warfare. Even without having a mandate from the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations. In territories that were officially designated as "occupied territories", the ICRC could assist the civilian population on the basis of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]'s "Laws and Customs of War on Land" of 1907. This convention was also the legal basis for the ICRC's work for prisoners of war. In addition to the work of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency as described above this included inspection visits to POW camps. A total of 524 camps throughout Europe were visited by 41 delegates from the ICRC until the end of the war.

Between 1916 and 1918, the ICRC published a number of [[postcard]]s with scenes from the POW camps. The pictures showed the prisoners in day-to-day activities such as the distribution of letters from home. The intention of the ICRC was to provide the families of the prisoners with some hope and solace and to alleviate their uncertainties about the fate of their loved ones. After the end of the war, between 1920 and 1922, the ICRC organized the return of about 500,000 prisoners to their home countries. In 1920, the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded [[League of Nations]], which appointed the Norwegian diplomat and scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its "High Commissioner for Repatriation of the War Prisoners". His legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the League of Nations "High Commissioner for Refugees". Nansen, who invented the [[Nansen passport]] for stateless refugees and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922, appointed two delegates from the ICRC as his deputies.
[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|left|Red Cross ambulance from 1917]]
A year before the end of the war, the ICRC received the 1917 Nobel Peace Prize for its outstanding wartime work. It was the only Nobel Peace Prize awarded in the period from 1914 to 1918. In 1923, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] adopted a change in its policy regarding the selection of new members. Until then, only citizens from the city of Geneva could serve in the Committee. This limitation was expanded to include Swiss citizens. As a direct consequence of World War I, a treaty was adopted in 1925 which outlawed the use of suffocating or poisonous gases and biological agents as weapons. Four years later, the original Convention was revised and the second Geneva Convention "relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War" was established. The events of World War I and the respective activities of the ICRC significantly increased the reputation and authority of the Committee among the international community and led to an extension of its competencies.

As early as in 1934, a draft proposal for an additional convention for the protection of the civil population in occupied territories during an armed conflict was adopted by the International Red Cross Conference. Unfortunately, most governments had little interest in implementing this convention, and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of [[World War II]].

====World War II====

The Red Cross' response to the Holocaust has been the subject of significant controversy and criticism. As early as May 1944, the ICRC was criticized for its indifference to Jewish suffering and death—criticism that intensified after the end of the war, when the full extent of the Holocaust became undeniable. One defense to these allegations is that the Red Cross was trying to preserve its reputation as a neutral and impartial organization by not interfering with what was viewed as a German internal matter. The Red Cross also considered its primary focus to be [[prisoners of war]] whose countries had signed the [[Geneva Convention]].{{sfn|Farré|Schubert|2009|p=72}}

The legal basis of the work of the ICRC during World War II were the Geneva Conventions in their 1929 revision. The activities of the Committee were similar to those during World War I: visiting and monitoring POW camps, organizing relief assistance for civilian populations, and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons. By the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (''Agence centrale des prisonniers de guerre'') had a staff of 3,000, the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards, and 120 million messages were exchanged by the Agency. One major obstacle was that the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-controlled [[German Red Cross]] refused to cooperate with the Geneva statutes including blatant violations such as the deportation of [[Jews]] from Germany and the [[The Holocaust|mass murders]] conducted in the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Moreover, two other main parties to the conflict, the [[Soviet Union]] and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions.

During the war, the ICRC was unable to obtain an agreement with Nazi Germany about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps, and it eventually abandoned applying pressure in order to avoid disrupting its work with POWs. The ICRC was also unable to obtain a response to reliable information about the extermination camps and the mass killing of European Jews, Roma, et al. After November 1943, the ICRC achieved permission to send [[Red Cross parcel|parcels]] to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations. Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates, the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105,000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 1.1 million parcels, primarily to the camps [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Ravensbrück]], and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].

[[Maurice Rossel]] was sent to Berlin as a delegate of the International Red Cross; he visited Theresienstadt in 1944. The choice of the inexperienced Rossel for this mission has been interpreted as indicative of his organization's indifference to the "Jewish problem", while his report has been described as "emblematic of the failure of the ICRC" to advocate for Jews during the Holocaust.{{sfn|Farré|Schubert|2009|p=abstract}} Rossel's report was noted for its uncritical acceptance of [[Nazi propaganda]].{{efn|{{unordered list |[[Livia Rothkirchen]]: "In contrast to those of the Danish delegates, Rossel’s  report was phrased in positive  terms,  falling in line with German propaganda."{{sfn |Rothkirchen |2006|p=258}}|[[Lucy Dawidowicz]]: "[Rossel's] acceptance of everything he had seen... and everything he had been told... was total and complacent. The report which he prepared for his superiors in the Red Cross was exactly what the Germans had hoped for... a totally uncritical, even approving affirmation of their propaganda."{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1975|p=138}}}}}} He erroneously stated that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt.{{sfn |Rothkirchen |2006|p=258}} [[Claude Lanzmann]] recorded his experiences in 1979, producing a documentary entitled ''[[A Visitor from the Living]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cine-holocaust.de/cgi-bin/gdq?dfw00fbw002569.gd |title=VIVANT QUI PASSE.

[[File:Marcel Junod-5.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Junod]], delegate of the ICRC, visiting [[Prisoner of War|POWs]] in Germany]]

On 12 March 1945, ICRC president Jacob Burckhardt received a message from SS General [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] allowing ICRC delegates to visit the concentration camps. This agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war. Ten delegates, among them [[Louis Haefliger]] ([[Mauthausen-Gusen]]), [[Paul Dunant]] ([[Theresienstadt]]) and [[Victor Maurer]] ([[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]), accepted the assignment and visited the camps. Louis Haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen-Gusen by alerting American troops.

[[Friedrich Born]] (1903–1963), an ICRC delegate in [[Budapest]] who saved the lives of about 11,000 to 15,000 Jewish people in [[Hungary]]. [[Marcel Junod]] (1904–1961), a physician from Geneva was one of the first foreigners to visit [[Hiroshima]] after the [[Little Boy|atomic bomb]] was dropped.

In 1944, the ICRC received its second Nobel Peace Prize. As in World War I, it received the only Peace Prize awarded during the main period of war, 1939 to 1945. At the end of the war, the ICRC worked with national Red Cross societies to organize relief assistance to those countries most severely affected. In 1948, the Committee published a report reviewing its war-era activities from 1 September 1939 to 30 June 1947. The ICRC opened its archives from World War II in 1996.

====After World War II====
[[File:IKRK Hauptquartier.jpg|thumb|The ICRC Headquarters in Geneva]]

On 12 August 1949, further revisions to the existing two Geneva Conventions were adopted. An additional convention "for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea", now called the second Geneva Convention, was brought under the Geneva Convention umbrella as a successor to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention X]]. The 1929 Geneva convention "relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War" may have been the second Geneva Convention from a historical point of view (because it was actually formulated in Geneva), but after 1949 it came to be called the third Convention because it came later chronologically than the Hague Convention. Reacting to the experience of World War II, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], a new Convention "relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War", was established. Also, the additional protocols of 8 June 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars. Today, the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles, a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention.

In celebration of its centennial in 1963, the ICRC, together with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|League of Red Cross Societies]], received its third Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1993, non-Swiss individuals have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad, a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens. Indeed, since then, the share of staff without Swiss citizenship has increased to about 35%.

On 16 October 1990, the [[UN General Assembly]] decided to grant the ICRC [[observer status]] for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the [[Italy|Italian]] ambassador, [[Vieri Traxler]], in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any possible interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.

At the end of the [[Cold War]], the ICRC's work actually became more dangerous. In the 1990s, more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history, especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts. These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols. Among the slain delegates were:

====Afghanistan War====
ICRC is active in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan conflict]] areas and has set up six physical rehabilitation centers to help [[land mine]] victims. Their support extends to the national and international armed forces, civilians and the armed opposition. They regularly visit detainees under the custody of the Afghan government and the international armed forces, but have also occasionally had access since 2009 to people detained by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/afghanistan-news-151209.htm |title=Afghanistan: first ICRC visit to detainees in Taliban custody |publisher=Icrc.org |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have provided basic first aid training and aid kits to both the Afghan security forces and Taliban members because, according to an ICRC spokesperson, "ICRC's constitution stipulates that all parties harmed by warfare will be treated as fairly as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/10161136.stm |title=Red Cross in Afghanistan gives Taliban first aid help |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)===

====History====
[[File:Henry Davison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Davison]], Founding father of the League of Red Cross societies.]]
In 1919, representatives from the national Red Cross societies of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US came together in Paris to found the "League of Red Cross Societies". The original idea was [[Henry Davison]]'s, then president of the [[American Red Cross]]. This move, led by the American Red Cross, expanded the international activities of the Red Cross movement beyond the strict mission of the ICRC to include relief assistance in response to emergency situations which were not caused by war (such as man-made or natural disasters). The ARC already had great disaster relief mission experience extending back to its foundation.

The formation of the League, as an additional international Red Cross organization alongside the ICRC, was not without controversy for a number of reasons. The ICRC had, to some extent, valid concerns about a possible rivalry between both organizations. The foundation of the League was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the ICRC within the movement and to gradually transfer most of its tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution. In addition to that, all founding members of the League were national societies from countries of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] or from associated partners of the Entente. The original statutes of the League from May 1919 contained further regulations which gave the five founding societies a privileged status and, due to the efforts of Henry P. Davison, the right to permanently exclude the national Red Cross societies from the countries of the [[Central Powers]], namely Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and in addition to that the national Red Cross society of Russia. These rules were contrary to the Red Cross principles of universality and equality among all national societies, a situation which furthered the concerns of the ICRC.

The first relief assistance mission organized by the League was an aid mission for the victims of a famine and subsequent [[typhus]] epidemic in Poland. Only five years after its foundation, the League had already issued 47 donation appeals for missions in 34 countries, an impressive indication of the need for this type of Red Cross work. The total sum raised by these appeals reached 685 million Swiss francs, which were used to bring emergency supplies to the victims of famines in Russia, Germany, and Albania; earthquakes in Chile, [[Iran|Persia]], Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Turkey; and refugee flows in Greece and Turkey. The first large-scale disaster mission of the League came after the 1923 earthquake in Japan which killed about 200,000 people and left countless more wounded and without shelter. Due to the League's coordination, the Red Cross society of Japan received goods from its sister societies reaching a total worth of about $100 million. Another important new field initiated by the League was the creation of youth Red Cross organizations within the national societies.

[[File:Timbre Turquie Croissant rouge 1928.jpg|thumb|left|A stamp from [[Turkey]] to support the Red Crescent, 1938.]]

A joint mission of the ICRC and the League in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 marked the first time the movement was involved in an internal conflict, although still without an explicit mandate from the Geneva Conventions. The League, with support from more than 25 national societies, organized assistance missions and the distribution of food and other aid goods for civil populations affected by hunger and [[disease]]. The ICRC worked with the [[Russian Red Cross]] society and later the society of the [[Soviet Union]], constantly emphasizing the ICRC's neutrality. In 1928, the "International Council" was founded to coordinate cooperation between the ICRC and the League, a task which was later taken over by the "Standing Commission". In the same year, a common statute for the movement was adopted for the first time, defining the respective roles of the ICRC and the League within the movement.

During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian war]] between Ethiopia and Italy from 1935 to 1936, the League contributed aid supplies worth about 1.7 million Swiss francs. Because the Italian fascist regime under [[Benito Mussolini]] refused any cooperation with the Red Cross, these goods were delivered solely to Ethiopia. During the war, an estimated 29 people lost their lives while being under explicit protection of the Red Cross symbol, most of them due to attacks by the Italian Army. During the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War in Spain]] from 1936 to 1939 the League once again joined forces with the ICRC with the support of 41 national societies. In 1939 on the brink of the Second World War, the League relocated its headquarters from Paris to Geneva to take advantage of Swiss neutrality.

In 1952, the 1928 common statute of the movement was revised for the first time. Also, the period of [[decolonization]] from 1960 to 1970 was marked by a huge jump in the number of recognized national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. By the end of the 1960s, there were more than 100 societies around the world. On December 10, 1963, the Federation and the ICRC received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1983, the League was renamed to the "League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies" to reflect the growing number of national societies operating under the Red Crescent symbol. Three years later, the seven basic principles of the movement as adopted in 1965 were incorporated into its statutes. The name of the League was changed again in 1991 to its current official designation the "International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies". In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the [[Seville Agreement]] which further defined the responsibilities of both organizations within the movement. In 2004, the IFRC began its largest mission to date after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami disaster in South Asia]]. More than 40 national societies have worked with more than 22,000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics.

==Activities==

===Organization===
[[File:Schweiz Genf IRK-Museum.jpg|thumb|Entry to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva.]]

Altogether, there are about 97 million people worldwide who serve with the ICRC, the International Federation, and the National Societies, the majority with the latter.

The 1965 International Conference in [[Vienna]] adopted seven basic principles which should be shared by all parts of the Movement, and they were added to the official statutes of the Movement in 1986.

===Fundamental principles===

At the 20th International Conference in Neue Hofburg, [[Vienna]], from 2–9 October 1965, "proclaimed" seven fundamental principles which are shared by all components of the Movement, and they were added to the official statutes of the Movement in 1986. The durability and universal acceptance is a result of the process through which they came into being in the form they have. Rather than an effort to arrive at agreement, it was an attempt to answer the question of what did they have in common, over the past 100 years, those operations and organisational units that were successful? As a result, the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent were not revealed, but ''found'' – through a deliberate and participative process of discovery.

That makes it even more important to note that the text that appears under each "heading" is an integral part of the Principle in question and not an interpretation that can vary with time and place.

'''Humanity'''

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.

'''Impartiality'''

It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.

'''Neutrality'''

In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

'''Independence'''

The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.

'''Voluntary Service'''

It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain. 
 
'''Unity'''

There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.

'''Universality'''

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.

==={{anchor|International Conference|Standing Commission}}Activities and organization of the International Conference and the Standing Commission ===
{{main|Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent}}
The International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which occurs once every four years, is the highest institutional body of the Movement. It gathers delegations from all of the national societies as well as from the ICRC, the IFRC and the signatory states to the Geneva Conventions. In between the conferences, the [[Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent]] acts as the supreme body and supervises implementation of and compliance with the resolutions of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standcom.ch/role-mandate-of-the-standing-commission-2/ |title=Role and Mandate of the Standing Commission |publisher=Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315032535/http://www.standcom.ch/role-mandate-of-the-standing-commission-2/ |archivedate=15 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Standing Commission coordinates the cooperation between the ICRC and the IFRC. It consists of two representatives from the ICRC (including its president), two from the IFRC (including its president), and five individuals who are elected by the International Conference. The Standing Commission convenes every six months on average. Moreover, a convention of the Council of Delegates of the Movement takes place every two years in the course of the conferences of the General Assembly of the International Federation. The Council of Delegates plans and coordinates joint activities for the Movement.

===Activities and organization===
====The mission of the ICRC and its responsibilities within the Movement====
[[File:Flag of the ICRC.svg|thumb|The emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross (French: Comité international de la croix-rouge).]]

The official mission of the ICRC as an impartial, neutral, and independent organization is to stand for the protection of the life and dignity of victims of international and internal armed conflicts. According to the 1997 Seville Agreement, it is the "Lead Agency" of the Movement in conflicts. The core tasks of the Committee, which are derived from the Geneva Conventions and its own statutes, are the following:

* to monitor compliance of warring parties with the Geneva Conventions
* to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield
* to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war
* to help with the search for missing persons in an armed conflict ([[Restoring Family Links|tracing service]])
* to organize protection and care for civil populations
* to arbitrate between warring parties in an armed conflict

====Legal status and organization====
The ICRC is headquartered in the Swiss city of Geneva and has external offices in about 80 countries. It has about 12,000 staff members worldwide, about 800 of them working in its Geneva headquarters, 1,200 expatriates with about half of them serving as delegates managing its international missions and the other half being specialists like doctors, agronomists, engineers or interpreters, and about 10,000 members of individual national societies working on site.

According to Swiss law, the ICRC is defined as a private association. Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a [[non-governmental organization]] in the most common sense of the term, nor is it an international organization. As it limits its members (a process called cooptation) to Swiss nationals only, it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals like other legally defined NGOs. The word "international" in its name does not refer to its membership but to the worldwide scope of its activities as defined by the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries or through agreements between the Committee and respective national governments.

According to its statutes it consists of 15 to 25 Swiss-citizen members, which it coopts for a period of four years. There is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can have although a three-quarters majority of all members is required for re-election after the third term.

The leading organs of the ICRC are the Directorate and the Assembly. The Directorate is the executive body of the Committee. It consists of a general director and five directors in the areas of "Operations", "Human Resources", "Resources and Operational Support", "Communication", and "International Law and Cooperation within the Movement". The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years. The Assembly, consisting of all of the members of the Committee, convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee. The president of the Assembly is also the president of the Committee as a whole. Furthermore, the Assembly elects a five-member Assembly Council which has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters. The Council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for facilitating communication between the Assembly and the Directorate.

Due to Geneva's location in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the ICRC usually acts under its French name ''Comité international de la Croix-Rouge'' (CICR). The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white background with the words "COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE" circling the cross.

====Funding and financial matters====
The 2009 budget of the ICRC amounts to more than 1 billion Swiss francs. Most of that money comes from the States, including Switzerland in its capacity as the depositary state of the Geneva Conventions, from national Red Cross societies, the signatory states of the Geneva Conventions, and from international organizations like the [[European Union]]. All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the Committee: an annual ''Headquarters Appeal'' to cover its internal costs and ''Emergency Appeals'' for its individual missions.

The ICRC is asking donors for more than 1.1 billion Swiss francs to fund its work in 2010. Afghanistan is projected to become the ICRC's biggest humanitarian operation (at 86 million Swiss francs, an 18% increase over the initial 2009 budget), followed by Iraq (85 million francs) and Sudan (76 million francs). The initial 2010 field budget for medical activities of 132 million francs represents an increase of 12 million francs over 2009.

===Activities and organization of the International Federation===

====Mission and responsibilities====
[[File:Emblem of the IFRC.svg|thumb|Emblem of the IFRC]]

The IFRC coordinates cooperation between national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies throughout the world and supports the foundation of new national societies in countries where no official society exists. On the international stage, the IFRC organizes and leads relief assistance missions after emergencies such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, epidemics, mass refugee flights, and other emergencies. As per the 1997 Seville Agreement, the IFRC is the Lead Agency of the Movement in any emergency situation which does not take place as part of an armed conflict. The IFRC cooperates with the national societies of those countries affected&amp;nbsp;– each called the ''Operating National Society'' (ONS)&amp;nbsp;– as well as the national societies of other countries willing to offer assistance&amp;nbsp;– called ''Participating National Societies'' (PNS). Among the 187 national societies admitted to the General Assembly of the International Federation as full members or observers, about 25–30 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active of those are the [[American Red Cross]], the [[British Red Cross]], the [[German Red Cross]], and the Red Cross societies of [[Swedish Red Cross|Sweden]] and [[Norwegian Red Cross|Norway]]. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of [[land mine]]s and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines.

The tasks of the IFRC can therefore be summarized as follows:
* to promote humanitarian principles and values
* to provide relief assistance in emergency situations of large magnitude, such as natural disasters
* to support the national societies with disaster preparedness through the education of voluntary members and the provision of equipment and relief supplies
* to support local health care projects
* to support the national societies with youth-related activities

====Legal status and organization====

The IFRC has its headquarters in Geneva. It also runs five zone offices (Africa, Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East-North Africa), 14 permanent regional offices and has about 350 delegates in more than 60 delegations around the world. The legal basis for the work of the IFRC is its constitution. The executive body of the IFRC is a secretariat, led by a secretary general. The secretariat is supported by five divisions including "Programme Services", "Humanitarian values and humanitarian diplomacy", "National Society and Knowledge Development" and "Governance and Management Services".

The highest decision making body of the IFRC is its General Assembly, which convenes every two years with delegates from all of the national societies. Among other tasks, the General Assembly elects the secretary general. Between the convening of General Assemblies, the Governing Board is the leading body of the IFRC. It has the authority to make decisions for the IFRC in a number of areas. The Governing Board consists of the president and the vice presidents of the IFRC, the chairpersons of the Finance and Youth Commissions, and twenty elected representatives from national societies.

The symbol of the IFRC is the combination of the Red Cross (left) and Red Crescent (right) on a white background surrounded by a red rectangular frame.

====Funding and financial matters====
The main parts of the budget of the IFRC are funded by contributions from the national societies which are members of the IFRC and through revenues from its investments. The exact amount of contributions from each member society is established by the Finance Commission and approved by the General Assembly. Any additional funding, especially for unforeseen expenses for relief assistance missions, is raised by ''"appeals"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/publications-and-reports/appeals/ |title=Appeals |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published by the IFRC and comes for voluntary donations by national societies, governments, other organizations, corporations, and individuals.

===Internal national societies===
====Official recognition====

National Red Cross and Red Crescent societies exist in nearly every country in the world. Within their home country, they take on the duties and responsibilities of a national relief society as defined by [[International Humanitarian Law]]. Within the Movement, the ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. The exact rules for recognition are defined in the statutes of the Movement. Article 4 of these statutes contains the ''"Conditions for recognition of National Societies."''

: ''In order to be recognized in terms of Article 5, paragraph 2 b) as a National Society, the Society shall meet the following conditions:''
#''Be constituted on the territory of an independent State where the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field is in force.''
#''Be the only National Red Cross and-or Red Crescent Society of the said State and be directed by a central body which shall alone be competent to represent it in its dealings with other components of the Movement.''
#''Be duly recognized by the legal government of its country on the basis of the Geneva Conventions and of the national legislation as a voluntary aid society, auxiliary to the public authorities in the humanitarian field.''
#''Have an autonomous status which allows it to operate in conformity with the Fundamental Principles of the Movement.''
#''Use the name and emblem of the Red Cross or Red Crescent in conformity with the Geneva Conventions.''
#''Be so organized as to be able to fulfill the tasks defined in its own statutes, including the preparation in peace time for its statutory tasks in case of armed conflict.''
#''Extend its activities to the entire territory of the State.''
#''Recruit its voluntary members and its staff without consideration of race, sex, class, religion or political opinions.''
#''Adhere to the present Statutes, share in the fellowship which unites the components of the Movement and co-operate with them.''
#''Respect the Fundamental Principles of the Movement and be guided in its work by the principles of international humanitarian law.''

Once a National Society has been recognized by the ICRC as a component of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement), it is in principle admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in accordance with the terms defined in the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of the International Federation.

There are today 190 National Societies recognized within the Movement and which are members of the International Federation.

The most recent National Societies to have been recognized within the Movement are the [[Maldivian Red Crescent|Maldives Red Crescent Society]] (9 November 2011), the [[Cyprus Red Cross|Cyprus Red Cross Society]], the South Sudan Red Cross Society (12 November 2013) and, the last, the Tuvalu Red Cross Society (on 1 March 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/tuvalu/tuvalu-red-cross-society-becomes-190th-member-of-the-ifrc--71977 |title=Tuvalu Red Cross Society becomes 190th member of the IFRC |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activities of national societies on a national and international stage====
Despite formal independence regarding its organizational structure and work, each national society is still bound by the laws of its home country. In many countries, national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies enjoy exceptional privileges due to agreements with their governments or specific "Red Cross Laws" granting full independence as required by the International Movement. The duties and responsibilities of a national society as defined by International Humanitarian Law and the statutes of the Movement include humanitarian aid in armed conflicts and emergency crises such as natural disasters through activities such as [[Restoring Family Links]].

Depending on their respective human, technical, financial, and organizational resources, many national societies take on additional humanitarian tasks within their home countries such as [[blood donation]] services or acting as civilian [[Emergency Medical Service]] (EMS) providers. The ICRC and the International Federation cooperate with the national societies in their international missions, especially with human, material, and financial resources and organizing on-site logistics.

==History of the emblems==
{{details|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement}}

===Emblems in use===
====The Red Cross====
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|frameless|upright=0.45|left|border]]
[[File:Flag of Switzerland (Pantone).svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|The [[flag of Switzerland]] is where the original Red Cross was derived from.]]

The '''Red Cross''' emblem was officially approved in Geneva in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/emblem-history.htm |title=The history of the emblems |publisher=ICRC |date=2007-01-14 |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Cross flag is not to be confused with the [[Saint George's Cross]] which is on the [[flag of England]], [[Flag of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Flag of Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], and several other places. In order to avoid this confusion the protected symbol is sometimes referred to as the "Greek Red Cross" (now [[Hellenic Red Cross]]); that term is also used in [[United States]] law to describe the Red Cross. The red cross of the Saint George cross extends to the edge of the flag, whereas the red cross on the Red Cross flag does not.

The Red Cross flag is the colour-switched version of the [[Flag of Switzerland]]. In 1906, to put an end to the argument of the Ottoman Empire that the flag took its roots from Christianity, it was decided to promote officially the idea that the Red Cross flag had been formed by reversing the federal colours of [[Switzerland]], although no clear evidence of this origin had ever been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pierre Boissier |url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL1955293M/From-Solferino-to-Tsushima |title=From Solferino to Tsushima (1985 edition) |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Red Crescent====
[[File:Flag of the Red Crescent.svg|left|frameless|upright=0.45|border]]
[[File:Flag of the Ottoman Empire.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|Flag of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This is where the original Red Crescent was derived from.]]

The '''Red Crescent''' emblem was first used by ICRC volunteers during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|armed conflict of 1876–8]] between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. The symbol was officially adopted in 1929, and so far 33 states in the Muslim world have recognized it. In common with the official promotion of the red cross symbol as a colour-reversal of the Swiss flag (rather than a religious symbol), the red crescent is similarly presented as being derived from a colour-reversal of the flag of the Ottoman Empire.

====The Red Crystal====
[[File:Flag of the Red Crystal.svg|frameless|left|upright=0.45|border]]
[[File:Red Crystal with Star.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.45|International emblem for [[Magen David Adom]] outside [[Israel]]]]
On 8 December 2005, in response to growing pressure to accommodate [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA), Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service, as a full member of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, a new emblem (officially the '''Third Protocol Emblem''', but more commonly known as the '''Red Crystal''') was adopted by an amendment of the [[Geneva Conventions]] known as [[Protocol III]].

The '''[[Red Lion and Sun Society]] of Iran''' was established in 1922 and admitted to the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcs.ir/en/index.php?page_id%3D2%26menu_id%3D1%26menu_item_id%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110944/http://www.rcs.ir/en/index.php?page_id=2&amp;menu_id=1&amp;menu_item_id=3 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some report the symbol was introduced at Geneva in 1864 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcs.ir/fa/index.php?page_id%3D3%26menu_id%3D1%26menu_item_id%3D33 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404114921/http://www.rcs.ir/fa/index.php?page_id=3&amp;menu_id=1&amp;menu_item_id=33 |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Both "fact" and reference tags are appropriate; even if the Iranian Red Crescent Society claims the Red Lion and Sun was proposed in 1864 (I can't be sure as I can't read Persian, but the URL is theirs per Whois), it is inconsistent with the first recorded use of the Red Crescent in 1876–1878. --&gt; as a counter example to the crescent and cross used by two of Iran's rivals, the Ottoman and the Russian empires.  Although that claim is inconsistent with the Red Crescent's history, that history also suggests that the Red Lion and Sun, like the Red Crescent, may have been conceived during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 war between Russia and Turkey]].

Due to the emblem's association with the Iranian monarchy, the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] replaced the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent in 1980, consistent with two existing Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols. Although the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran has in the past reserved the right to take it up again at any time; the [[Geneva Conventions]] continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by [[Protocol III]] in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/615?OpenDocument|title= Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III), 8 December 2005 Article 1 – Respect for and scope of application of this Protocol|website=Icrc.org|accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Red Star of David (Magen David Adom)====

For over 50 years, Israel requested the addition of a red [[Star of David]], arguing that since Christian and Muslim emblems were recognized, the corresponding Jewish emblem should be as well. This emblem has been used by [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA), or Red Star of David, the national first-aid society of Israel of 1930, but it is not recognized by the Geneva Conventions as a protected symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afmda.org/content/about%20us/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301131336/http://www.afmda.org/content/about%20us/history.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the ″Magen David Adom″ was during the Anglo Boer War in South Africa (1899–1902) when it was used by the Ambulance Corps founded by Ben Zion Aaron in Johannesburg as a first aid corps to assist the Boer forces. Permission was given by President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic for the Star of David to be used as its insignia, rather than the conventional red cross.&lt;ref&gt;South African Jewish year Book 1929, The Jews in South Africa: Saron and Hotz&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Cross and Red Crescent movement repeatedly rejected Israel's request over the years, stating that the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems were not meant to represent Christianity and Islam but were colour reversals of the Swiss and the Ottoman flags, and also that if Jews (or another group) were to be given another emblem, there would be no end to the number of religious or other groups claiming an emblem for themselves. They reasoned that a proliferation of red symbols would detract from the original intention of the Red Cross emblem, which was to be a single emblem to mark vehicles and buildings protected on humanitarian grounds.

Certain Arab nations, such as Syria, also protested against the entry of MDA into the Red Cross movement, making consensus impossible for a time.
However, from 2000 to 2006 the [[American Red Cross]] withheld its dues (a total of $42 million) to the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) because of IFRC's refusal to admit MDA;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ultimately led to the creation of the Red Crystal emblem and the admission of MDA on June 22, 2006.

The Red Star of David is not recognized as a protected symbol outside Israel; instead the MDA uses the Red Crystal emblem during international operations in order to ensure protection.  Depending on the circumstances, it may place the Red Star of David inside the Red Crystal, or use the Red Crystal alone.

==1996 hostage crisis allegations==
The Australian TV network [[ABC Television|ABC]] and the indigenous rights group [[Rettet die Naturvölker ]] released a documentary called ''Blood on the Cross'' in 1999. It alleged the involvement of the Red Cross with the British and Indonesian military in a massacre in the Southern Highlands of [[Western New Guinea]] during the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Mapenduma hostage crisis]] of May 1996, when Western and Indonesian activists were held hostage by separatists.&lt;ref name=fpcnvideos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engagemedia.org/Members/fPcN_interCultural/videos/Blood_on_the_Cross_Xvid_720x576.avi/view |title=Blood On the Cross — EngageMedia |website=Engagemedia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The politics of power: Freeport in Suharto's Indonesia |last=Leith |first=Denise |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8248-2566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the broadcast of the documentary, the Red Cross announced publicly that it would appoint an individual outside the organization to investigate the allegations made in the film and any responsibility on its part. Piotr Obuchowicz was appointed to investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/11/04/icrc-steps-probe-irian-jaya-case.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112152349/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/11/04/icrc-steps-probe-irian-jaya-case.html |archivedate=2015-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report categorically states that the Red Cross personnel accused of involvement were proven not to have been present; that a white helicopter was probably used in a military operation, but the helicopter was not a Red Cross helicopter, and must have been painted by one of several military organizations operating in the region at the time. Perhaps the Red Cross logo itself was also used, although no hard evidence was found for this; that this was part of the military operation to free the hostages, but was clearly intended to achieve surprise by deceiving the local people into thinking that a Red Cross helicopter was landing; and that the Red Cross should have responded more quickly and thoroughly to investigate the allegations than it did.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barber, TAPOL, the Indonesia Human Rights Campaign, ''Irian Jaya: The Record'', April 20–30, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony before congressional committees ===
{{Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy small}}
In May 2007, Comey testified before the [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law|House Judiciary subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law]] on the [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|U.S. Attorney dismissal controversy]].&lt;ref name="doj-2008" /&gt; His testimony contradicted that of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who had said the firings had been due to poor performance on the part of some of the dismissed prosecutors. Comey stressed that the Justice Department had to be perceived as nonpartisan and nonpolitical to function.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

{{quote|The Department of Justice, in my view, is run by political appointees of the President. The U.S. attorneys are political appointees of the President.

=== Supreme Court considerations ===
''[[Politico]]'' reported in May 2009, White House officials pushed for Comey's inclusion on the short list of names to replace [[Associate Justice]] [[David Souter]] on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22488.html "James Comey pushed for Supreme Court"], Politico.com, May 2009. Retrieved May 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Politico'' later reported liberal activists were upset about the possibility of Comey's name being included. John Brittain of the [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law]] stated, "[Comey] came in with the Bushies. What makes you think he'd be just an inch or two more to the center than [[John Roberts|[John] Roberts]]? I'd be greatly disappointed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22604.html "Some on left souring on Obama"], Politico.com, May 2009. Retrieved May 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Comey delivered a speech at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., regarding the relationship between police and the African American community.&lt;ref name="TheHoya"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/rare-move-fbi-head-addresses-race-relations/|title=In Rare Move, FBI Head Addresses Race Relations|date=February 13, 2015|work=The Hoya|last1=Simio|first1=Molly|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/hard-truths-law-enforcement-and-race|title=Hard Truths: Law Enforcement and Race|last=Comey|first=James B.|date=February 12, 2015|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo – a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups", mentioning as an example his own Irish ancestors, who he said had, in the early 20th century, often been regarded by law enforcement as drunks and criminals. He added: "The Irish had some tough times, but little compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans", going on to highlight current societal issues such as lack of opportunities for employment and education which can lead young black men to crime.&lt;ref name="TheHoya" /&gt; Comey stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Police officers on patrol in our nation's cities often work in environments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good will working in that environment. After years of police work, officers often can't help be influenced by the cynicism they feel. A mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible.&lt;ref name="TheHoya" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2015, Comey gave a speech in which he raised concerns that [[body worn video]] results in less effective policing; this opinion contradicted the President's public position.&lt;ref name="comeyBodyCam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asher-Schapiro|first1=Avi|title=The FBI Director Says Cops Are 'Under Siege' From Viral Videos|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-fbi-director-says-cops-are-under-siege-from-viral-videos|accessdate=September 2, 2016|work=Vice News|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, President Obama met with Comey in the Oval Office to address the issue.&lt;ref name="NYTschmidt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmidt|first1=Michael S.|last2=Lichtblau|first2=Eric|title=James Come's Rebuke of Hillary Clinton Fits a 3-Decade Pattern|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/james-comey-fbi-hillary-clinton-email-investigation.html|accessdate=July 6, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 6, 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 23 speech at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], Comey said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember being asked why we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs. My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These are the guys we lock up because they are the predators choking off the life of a community. We did this work because we believed that all lives matter, especially the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Enforcement and the Communities We Serve: Bending the Lines Toward Safety and Justice |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/law-enforcement-and-the-communities-we-serve-bending-the-lines-toward-safety-and-justice |publisher=Fbi.gov. |date=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 12, 2017, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]] announced a formal investigation into whether the FBI followed proper procedures in its investigation of Clinton or whether "improper considerations" were made by FBI personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Adam Goldman]]|last2=[[Eric Lichtblau]]|last3=[[Matt Apuzzo]]|title=COMEY'S HANDLING OF CLINTON EMAILS WILL FACE INQUIRY – Justice Department Acts on Concern That Moves by F.B.I.

On July 27, 2017, the [[House Judiciary Committee]] decided to request documents related to Comey, including the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton, Comey's conduct during the 2016 election, and his release of his memo to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/07/26/house-judiciary-committee-votes-to-probe-comey-and-clintons-2016-campaign/|title=House Judiciary Committee votes to probe Comey and Clinton's 2016 campaign|last=Weigel|first=David|date=July 26, 2017|work=Washington Post|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/344051-house-judiciary-committee-votes-to-request-documents-on-comey-clinton|title=House Judiciary Committee votes to request documents on Comey, Clinton|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=July 26, 2017|work=The Hill|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's Republicans also wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/27/house-republicans-call-for-a-second-special-counsel--to-investigate-clinton-comey-and-lynch.html|title=House Republicans call for a second special counsel - to investigate Clinton, Comey and Lynch|last=Rosenfeld|first=Everett|date=July 27, 2017|work=CNBC|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, [[Chuck Grassley]] and [[Lindsey Graham]], alleged that Comey planned to exonerate Hillary Clinton in her email scandal long before the agency had completed its investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/top-senate-republicans-accuse-comey-of-planning-to-clear-clinton-before-interviewing-her/2017/09/01/7518088e-8f22-11e7-84c0-02cc069f2c37_story.html|title=Top Senate Republicans accuse Comey of planning to clear Clinton before interviewing her|first=Karoun|last=Demirjian|date=September 1, 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was confirmed by the FBI in October, which released a Comey memo dated May 2. Comey interviewed Clinton as part of his investigation on July 2. Former FBI official Ron Hosko reacted saying, "You tend to reach final conclusions as the investigation is logically ended. Not months before." Donald Trump called it "disgraceful." In contrast, former Department of Justice spokesman Matthew Miller wrote on Twitter, "The decision is never 'made' until the end, even when there's a 99% chance it is only going to go one way."&lt;ref name="Kutner"/&gt;

Comey's original draft of the exoneration stated that Clinton had committed "gross negligence," which is a crime. However, the language was later changed to "extreme carelessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/358982-early-comey-memo-accused-clinton-of-gross-negligence-on-emails |title=Early Comey memo accused Clinton of gross negligence on emails |last=Solomon |first=John |date=November 6, 2017 |publisher=''The Hill'' |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, it was revealed that the change had been made by [[Peter Strzok]], an FBI official who would later join Mueller's probe and be dismissed after exchanging private messages with an FBI lawyer that could be seen as favoring Clinton politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/peter-strzok-james-comey/index.html|title=FBI agent dismissed from Mueller probe changed Comey's description of Clinton to 'extremely careless' |last1=Jarrett |first1=Laura |last2=Perez |first2=Evan |date=December 4, 2017 |publisher=''CNN'' |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of Comey's July press conference, the FBI acquired the [[Donald Trump-Russia dossier]] by [[Christopher Steele]].&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt; In late July, the FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign.&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt; Comey asked President Obama for permission to write an [[op-ed]], which would warn the public that the Russians were interfering in the election. The President denied the request.&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt; CIA Director [[John O. Brennan]] then gave an unusual private briefing on the Russians to Senate Minority Leader [[Harry Reid]]; Reid then publicly referred to the briefing.&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt; Comey, however, refused to confirm—even in classified Congressional briefings—that the Trump Campaign was under investigation.&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt; In early October, meetings were held in the White House [[Situation Room]]; National Security Advisor [[Susan Rice]] argued that the information should be released, while Comey argued that disclosure was no longer needed.&lt;ref name="NYT23April17" /&gt;

On May 3, 2017, in testimony before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], Comey said that Russia is the "greatest threat of any nation on Earth ...

=== Government surveillance oversight ===
{{See also|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
In his July 2013 FBI confirmation hearing, Comey said that the oversight mechanisms of the U.S. government have sufficient privacy protections.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Spencer. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/09/james-comey-fbi-director-senate-hearing?INTCMP=SRCH "James Comey defends US surveillance practices at FBI confirmation hearing"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. July 9, 2013. Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2014 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article, [[Yale]] historian Beverly Gage reported that Comey keeps on his desk a copy of the FBI request to wiretap [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] "as a reminder of the bureau's capacity to do wrong".&lt;ref name="NYT-Gage-2014-11-11"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html | date = November 11, 2014 | first =  Beverly | last = Gage | work = The New York Times | title =  What an Uncensored Letter to M.L.K. Reveals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he and his agency were criticized for their request to [[Apple Inc.]] to install a "back door" for U.S. surveillance agencies to use. Former NSA and CIA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] stated: "Jim would like a back door available to American law enforcement in all devices globally. And, frankly, I think on balance that actually harms American safety and security, even though it might make Jim's job a bit easier in some specific circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/21/ex-nsa-chief-backs-apple-iphone-back-doors/80660024/|title=Ex-NSA chief backs Apple on iPhone 'back doors'|date=February 21, 2016|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comey, speaking at a cybersecurity conference in 2017, told the audience, "There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/james-comey-privacy-cybersecurity/| author=Mary Kay Mallonee and Eugene Scott| title=Comey: 'There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America'| publisher=CNN| date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Trump formally dismissed Comey on May 9, 2017, less than 4 years into his 10-year term as [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Director of the FBI]]. Comey first learned of his termination from television news reports that flashed on screen while he was delivering a speech to agents at the Los Angeles Field Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/05/09/us/politics/ap-us-trump-comey-the-latest.html|title=The Latest: Comey Learned of Ouster as He Spoke at FBI in LA|last=The Associated Press|date=May 9, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 10, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources said he was surprised and caught off guard by the termination. Comey immediately departed for Washington, D.C., and was forced to cancel his scheduled speech that night at an FBI recruitment event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-comey-los-angeles-20170509-story.html|title=Comey was 'caught flat-footed' and learned of firing from TV while talking to FBI agents in L.A., source says|last=Winton|first=Richard|date=May 9, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 10, 2017|last2=Queally|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump reportedly called Deputy Director [[Andrew McCabe]] the next day, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly back to Washington on an FBI jet after he had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-gripes-against-mccabe-included-wife-s-politics-comey-n842161|title=Trump's gripes against McCabe included wife's politics, Comey's ride home|last=Lee|first=Carol E.|date=January 29, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, Comey sent a letter to FBI staff in which he said, "I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either.

====Reasons for dismissal====
The White House initially stated the firing was on the recommendation of [[United States Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] and [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Rod Rosenstein]], to both of whom Comey reported .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michael D. |last1=Shear |first2=Matt |last2=Apuzzo |authorlink2=Matt Apuzzo |title=F.B.I.

By May 11, however, in a direct contradiction of the earlier statements by the White House, Vice President [[Mike Pence]], and the contents of the dismissal letter itself, President Trump stated to [[Lester Holt]] in an [[NBC News]] interview that Comey's dismissal was in fact "my decision" and "I was going to fire [Comey] regardless of recommendation [by Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitali|first1=Ali|last2=Siemaszko|first2=Corky|title=EXCLUSIVE: President Trump reveals he asked Comey whether he was under investigation|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-comey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=May 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|last2=Shear|first2=Michael D.|title=Trump Shifts Rationale for Firing Comey, Calling Him a 'Showboat'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-showboat-fbi.html|accessdate=May 12, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 12, 2017|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump later said of the dismissal "when I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-impeached-james-comey-allan-lichtman-latest-a7735456.html|title=Donald Trump could be impeached over firing of James Comey, says professor who called election|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|date=May 14, 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0951-9467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same televised interview, Trump labelled Comey "a showboat" and "grandstander".

On May 19, the [[New York Times]] published excerpts of an official White House document summarizing Trump's private meeting, the day after the firing, with Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] and Russian Ambassador to the US [[Sergey Kislyak]] in the Oval Office. Trump told Kislyak and Lavrov that he "just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job." Trump added: "I faced great pressure because of Russia.

According to reports, Trump had been openly talking to aides about finding a reason to fire Comey for at least a week before both the dismissal and the requesting of memoranda from Sessions and Rosenstein the day prior to the dismissal. Trump was angry and frustrated when, in the week prior to his dismissal, Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He felt Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not enough to internal leaks to the press from within the government.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Parker,|first2=Ashley|last3=Barrett|first3=Devlin|last4=Costa|first4=Robert|title=Inside Trump's anger and impatience – and his sudden decision to fire Comey|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trumps-anger-and-impatience-prompted-him-to-fire-the-fbi-director/2017/05/10/d9642334-359c-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html|website=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before Comey was fired, Comey had requested additional money and resources to further expand the probe into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference into the Presidential election]].&lt;ref name=NYT11may17/&gt; Trump had long questioned Comey's loyalty to Trump personally, and Comey's judgment to act in accordance to a loyalty to Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/how-trump-decided-to-fire-james-comey.html|title='Enough Was Enough': How Festering Anger at Comey Ended in His Firing|first1=Maggie|last1=Haberman|first2=Glenn|last2=Thrush|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=Peter|last4=Baker|date=May 10, 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President [[Barack Obama]] had his campaign offices wiretapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/fbi/332880-trump-mad-comey-would-not-back-wiretap-claims-report|title=Trump angry Comey would not back wiretap claims about Obama: report|first=Mark|last=Hensch|date=May 10, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reference to tapes====

On June 8, when Comey was asked by the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] about the existence of tapes, he replied "Lordy, I hope there are tapes!" He added that he would have no problem with the public release of any recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/08/532102878/i-hope-there-are-tapes-highlights-of-james-comeys-testimony|title='Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes': Highlights Of James Comey's Testimony|last=Naylor|first=Brian|date=June 8, 2017|work=NPR|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, after the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary committee]] threatened the White House with a potential [[subpoena]] for the alleged tapes, Trump issued a tweet stating "I have no idea [...] whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/22/trump-says-he-has-no-recordings-of-his-comey-talks-239862|title=Trump says he has no Comey tapes|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours later, when asked to clarify the [[non-denial denial]] wording of Trump's tweet regarding the tapes, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] stated that Trump's tweet was "extremely clear" and that she did "not have anything to add".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/22/donald-trump-says-he-has-no-tapes-james-comey-conv/|title=Donald Trump says he has no tapes of James Comey's conversations|work=[[The Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions raised for clarification on Trump's tweet centered principally around whether Trump ever had knowledge of said tapes having ever existed and whether he is simply no longer privy to the knowledge of whether said tapes still exist; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump having made said tapes or recordings, and; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump currently having or previously having had in their possession said tapes or recordings. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for California, Democrat [[Adam Schiff]], stated that Trump's tweet "raises as many questions as it answers," and that in any event, the tweet did not comply with the 23 June deadline, and that Schiff would move forward with subpoenas for the tapes, adding that "[r]egardless of whether the President intends his tweets to be an official reply to the House Intelligence Committee, the White House must respond in writing to our committee as to whether any tapes or recordings exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-denies-comey-tapes-won-deny-recordings-exist-article-1.3269174|title=Trump denies having Comey tapes — but won't deny recordings exist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comey's termination was immediately controversial.

In the dismissal letter, Trump stated that Comey had told him "on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fox59.com/2017/05/09/fbi-director-james-comey-fired-by-president-trump/ | title=FBI Director James Comey fired by President Trump | agency=Associated Press | date=May 9, 2017 | publisher=Fox59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fact checkers reported that while they had no way of knowing what Comey may have told Trump privately, no such assertion was on the public record at that time of Comey directly stating that Trump was not personally under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/10/did-james-comey-tell-donald-trump-three-times-he-i/|title=Did James Comey tell Donald Trump three times that he isn't under FBI investigation?|last=Carroll|first=Lauren|date=May 10, 2017|work=Politifact|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later Congressional testimony, Comey confirmed that on three occasions he volunteered to Trump that the latter was not personally under FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Comey|first1=James|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf|title=Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|work=[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]|pp=2, 4, 6|date=2017-06-08|accessdate=2017-07-19|quote=I discussed with the FBI's leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally.&amp;nbsp;... without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.&amp;nbsp;...

According to Comey associates interviewed by news organizations, Trump had asked Comey in January to pledge loyalty to him, to which Comey demurred, instead offering him "honesty".&lt;ref name=NYT12may17 /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSPledge"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-asked-james-comey-to-pledge-his-loyalty-to-him/ |title=Trump asked James Comey to pledge his loyalty to him|publisher=CBS News|date=May 11, 2017|quote=Soon after he was inaugurated, President Trump asked FBI Director James Comey to pledge his loyalty to him, a request that Comey turned down.

On May 11, Acting Director McCabe testified before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] that "Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does" and that "the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey". This contradicted White House spokeswoman [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]], who said she had heard from "countless" FBI agents in support of the firing.&lt;ref name="NYT12may17goldman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldman |first1=Adam |authorlink1=Adam Goldman |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Matthew |authorlink2=Matthew Rosenberg |title=Acting F.B.I.

On May 16, ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed the existence of a memo Comey had written after a February 14 meeting with Trump. It said that Trump had asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into [[Mike Flynn]], who had been fired as National Security Advisor the day before.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html |title=Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation |last=Schmidt |first=Michael S. |authorlink=Michael S. Schmidt |date=May 16, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey later explained that he had arranged, through a friend, for the memo to be shared with the press in hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.&lt;ref name=Hill-Williams&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/336932-comey-leaked-memo-to-prompt-special-counsel|title=Comey leaked memos to prompt special counsel|last=Williams|first=Katie Bo|date=June 8, 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2017, Comey gave public testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his firing. When asked why thought he had been fired, he said he had been confused by the shifting explanations for it but that "I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation."&lt;ref name="testimony"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-testimony-summary-trust-trump-hopes-theres-tapes/|title=James Comey testifies before Senate Intelligence Committee|date=June 8, 2018|work=CBS News|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had made contemporaneous notes about several of his conversations with the president because "I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I felt the need to document it."&lt;ref name = "testimony"/&gt; He said he had not done so with the two previous presidents he had served.

On April 19, 2018, the Justice Department released 15 pages of documents to Congress which comprise partially declassified [[:File:Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.pdf|memos]] that Comey made after his meetings with Trump. The memos were released by Assistant Attorney General [[Stephen Boyd (attorney)|Stephen Boyd]] in both a classified and unclassified versions.

The '''Joint Security Area''' ('''JSA''') is the only portion of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) where [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]n forces stand face-to-face. It is often called the '''Truce Village''' of Panmunjom (the Truce Village; or simply, Panmunjom) in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Korea_Truce_Village_At_Peace_999.html |title=Korea Truce Village At Peace |publisher=Spacewar.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15563058/ |title=Despite tensions, tourists flock to Korean DMZ |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various military accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maic.jmu.edu/JOURNAL/5.1/Profiles/NKorea/nkorea.htm |title=Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) |publisher=Maic.jmu.edu |date=December 7, 1979 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JSA is used by the two Koreas for diplomatic engagements and, until March 1991, was also the site of military [[negotiation]]s between North Korea and the [[United Nations Command]] (UNC). In 2018, North and South Korean officials ordered the JSA to be cleared of all landmines, weapons, guard posts, and personnel. This withdrawal was complete on October 25, 2018 and the JSA now just contains 35 unarmed security guards.&lt;ref name=xinhuaoct25&gt;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/25/c_137557889.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independentoct25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wapooct25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=timesoct25&gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/koreas-agree-to-disarm-at-armistice-peace-village-bt7zchfk7&lt;/ref&gt; The area will also no longer function in its current state and it was agreed that it will now just serve as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=yonhapoct25&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/10/25/0200000000AEN20181025001351315.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oct191&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/09/20/0200000000AEN20180920005500320.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oct19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=oct192 /&gt; On November 6, 2018, it was announced that the UNC would transfer primary guard duties of the now demilitarized Joint Security Area to both North and South Korea.&lt;ref name=nov6stripes&gt;https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/koreas-ready-for-joint-guard-duty-as-dmz-truce-village-gets-new-look-1.555405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no6nk&gt;https://www.nknews.org/2018/11/two-koreas-unc-agree-on-guard-duty-rules-for-new-look-joint-security-area-mnd/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Map of Joint Security Area.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the current Joint Security Area (JSA) showing the red Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and the buildings; solid black are occupied by North Korea (KPA) and the white are occupied by South Korea (ROK) and the United Nations (UN)]]
The Joint Security Area is located at {{Coord|37|57|21|N|126|40|36|E|type:landmark|display=inline,title}} lying within the village of [[Panmunjom]].

The original village of [[Panmunjom]] encompassed a larger area than the current inter-military complex of the JSA, and consisted mostly of farms. The JSA itself is actually about {{convert|1/2|mi|m|order=flip|abbr=off|sp=us}} south of where the village proper used to be, though still within the village's old farming area. It is because of this proximity that there is often ambiguity between the terms JSA or Panmunjom. Panmunjom no longer exists as an inhabited village as it was destroyed during the war, and all that now remains on the site of the village is the building constructed for the signing of the armistice agreement, now the [[North Korea Peace Museum]].

Residing within the North Korean half of the DMZ, the village has not been rebuilt or repopulated, but the name carries on and the name is now used to usually refer to the JSA. The village gained lasting fame as the site where the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] was negotiated. General [[Nam Il]] of North Korea and General [[William Kelly Harrison, Jr.|William Harrison, Jr.]] of the United Nations Command signed the armistice agreement at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am on July 27, 1953, in a hastily constructed pavilion at Panmunjom.

General [[Mark Wayne Clark|Mark W. Clark]], Commander-in-Chief, UNC, later countersigned the document in a separate ceremony at [[Munsan]], approximately 18 kilometers (11&amp;nbsp;mi) south of the DMZ; and Marshal [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], Korean People's Army (KPA) Supreme Commander, along with [[Peng Dehuai]], Commander, Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPV), countersigned it at [[Kaesong]], approximately 10 kilometers (6&amp;nbsp;mi) to the north in another separate ceremony.

The JSA has been the site of numerous major events since its establishment in 1953, the first of which was the repatriation of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) after the cessation of hostilities, across the [[Bridge of No Return]].

=== Tourism ===
The Joint Security Area currently has around 100,000 tourists visit each year through several tourism companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panmunjomtour.com/english/tour/opcenter.htm Panmunjom Tour Travel Information Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819065015/http://www.panmunjomtour.com/english/tour/opcenter.htm |date=August 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourdmz.com/ |title=DMZ Tour Guide |publisher=Tourdmz.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Service Organizations|USO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uso.org/Korea/default.cfm?contentid=347 |title=Panmunjom (Dmz) Tour |publisher=Uso.org |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508190602/http://www.uso.org/Korea/default.cfm?contentid=347 |archivedate=May 8, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (through the various U.S. military commands in Korea). Before being allowed to enter the DMZ, if visiting from the South, tourists are given a briefing during which they must sign a document which states, in part, "The visit to the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom will entail entry into a hostile area and possibility of injury or death as a direct result of enemy action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~yisei/issues/spring_95/yisei_95_23.html |title=Panmunjom By Jennifer Lee '98 |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Edmonton |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/travel/story.html?id=04d2bee4-acfc-4795-b09f-21138ca4d512 |title=Surreal, sobering visit to Korea's Demilitarized Zone |publisher=Canada.com |date=November 18, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023235155/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/travel/story.html?id=04d2bee4-acfc-4795-b09f-21138ca4d512 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/panmunjom/waiver.htm |title=VISITORS DECLARATION (UNC REG 551-5) |publisher=Members.aol.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting held between the UN command and military officers from North and South Korea on the South Korean side of Panmunjom on October 16, 2018,&lt;ref name=wapooct16&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/koreas-us-led-un-command-discuss-disarming-border-area/2018/10/15/ad15f9d4-d0e5-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voaoct26&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/koreas-continue-tension-easing-talks-as-the-north-criticizes-us/4630152.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was agreed the Joint Security Area disarmament is complete, civilian and foreign tourists will be allowed to visit the border area from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. without restrictions about what they can wear.&lt;ref name=oct192 /&gt; The disarmament was and it was agreed that at this point, the [[Military Demarcation Line]] which runs through the Joint Security Area will  be open to local and foreign tourists so they can reenact Kim and Moon's crossing which occurred on April 27, 2018.&lt;ref name=yonhapoct25 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/south-korea/articles/selfies-dmz-north-south-korea-wagah-cyprus-darien/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oct16 /&gt; This withdrawal was complete on October 25, though tourism has been delayed.&lt;ref name=upioct25 /&gt; No date was set for the resumption of Joint Security Area tourism when rules were established for the transfer of guard duty command on November 6, 2018 as well.&lt;ref name=nov6stripes /&gt;

== Establishment ==
Among the provisions of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed July 27, 1953, to bring a cease-fire in the Korean War, was establishment of the [[Military Armistice Commission]] (MAC), an agency to supervise implementation of the truce terms. Meetings of MAC representatives from the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] (UNC) and the [[Korean People's Army]]/[[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese People's Volunteers]] (KPA/CPV) were held at the Joint Security Area, an 800-meter (2600&amp;nbsp;ft) wide enclave, roughly circular in shape, bisected by the [[Military Demarcation Line (Korea)|Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL) separating South and North Korea, and created as a neutral area, where there was free movement of both sides anywhere within the JSA boundaries.

Military Police of both sides provide security for the JSA with guard forces of no more than 35 security personnel on duty at any given time. The administrative facilities for both guard forces are located within the JSA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-hr.korea.army.mil/Programs_Policy/PublicationsRecords/Regulations/Unc_Cfc_Usfk/UNC%20Reg%20551-4%20Compliance%20with%20the%20Korean%20Armistice%20Agreeme(1).pdf UNC Reg 551-1, Compliance With the Korean Armistice Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705104235/http://www-hr.korea.army.mil/Programs_Policy/PublicationsRecords/Regulations/Unc_Cfc_Usfk/UNC%20Reg%20551-4%20Compliance%20with%20the%20Korean%20Armistice%20Agreeme(1).pdf |date=July 5, 2007 }}. Retrieved November 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

While the boundary has remained the same over the years, the buildings themselves have changed. Some have been removed, including all of the KPA checkpoints on the southern half of the JSA. New buildings have been constructed, whilst some existing buildings have been expanded or simply renovated. The only boundary change of the Joint Security Area was the enforcement of the dividing line within the JSA after [[Axe murder incident|the murders of two American officers in 1976]]. Prior to this, the entire area was neutral, where members of either side possessed the freedom of movement within the JSA.

Since the enforcement of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) within the JSA, several UNC checkpoint buildings have also been rebuilt and/or renamed as well. Examples of this are what was called Observation Post (OP) No. 5 on the hill overlooking the [[Bridge of No Return]], is now Checkpoint (CP) #3,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr1997/n04141997_9704146.html Cohen: Economic Failure Plagues North Korea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230234127/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr1997/n04141997_9704146.html |date=December 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while what used to be called CP#3 (and sometimes called "The Loneliest Outpost in the World"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debito.org/americatreksix.html |title=Americatrek Part Six, Final Part, Vestiges of the Cold War |publisher=Debito.org |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/panmunjom/NORTN.HTML |title=Panmunjom |publisher=Members.aol.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the UNC checkpoint at the southern end of the Bridge of No Return. After the enforcement of the MDL however, the North Koreans no longer had a road leading into the JSA and within 72 hours built what has now become known as the "72-Hour Bridge" or "Bridge of 72 Hours".

== United Nations Command staffing ==
[[File:DPRK soldier.JPG|thumb|left|Two KPA soldiers standing guard inside a JSA conference room, in front of the door leading to the South Korean side of the JSA. View from north to south.]]

The [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] Security Battalion—Joint Security Area was constituted on May 5, 1952, as Army Unit 8020, United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission Support Group (Provisional). Originally authorized five officers and ten enlisted soldiers, the unit grew to over 1,400 officers and men supporting almost 32,000 soldiers, civilians, and diplomats involved in negotiating and then enforcing the Armistice Agreement. By the end of February 1954 the scope of work declined and the number of soldiers assigned to the unit declined as well.

For the next 50 years, the unit underwent several organizational and name changes, although the original mission to secure the Joint Security Area remains the same today as it was in 1952. On June 11, 1979, the name was changed from US Army Support Group (Joint Security Area) to United Nations Command Support Group—Joint Security Area, and further changed to United Nations Command Security Force—Joint Security Area on December 23, 1985. On October 15, 1994, UNC Commander directed that the unit be known by its present designation, the United Nations Command Security Battalion—Joint Security Area.

[[File:InsideTheJointSecurityArea1.jpg|thumb|upright|A Republic of Korea soldier of the United Nations Command Security Battalion stands guard inside a JSA conference room, in front of the door leading to the North Korean side of the JSA. View from south to north.]]

Originally a purely U.S. Army organization, the unit also included ROK soldiers ([[KATUSA]]s). In addition, ROK Army officers served as liaison officers. In the mid-1970s the JSA consisted of the JSF company with three platoons of one U.S. and one ROKA officer, and thirty enlisted men, supported by a battalion staff. The three platoons were led by the U.S. officer with the ROK officer as the executive officer, and U.S. Army platoon sergeants. The platoons consisted of three squads, with equal numbers of U.S. and KATUSA soldiers.

Sometime after 1979, another (fourth) platoon was added to the JSF to allow time for training during platoon work rotations. In July 1987 the four platoons of the Joint Security Force (JSF) company were reorganized to mix KATUSA and US soldiers at all levels. At the platoon level, two platoons were led by U.S. Army lieutenants and ROKA platoon sergeants, and two were led by ROKA lieutenants and US Army platoon sergeants. In November 1987 the unit received a ROK Army major as its first deputy commander.

On April 25, 1992, the JSF company became a KATUSA-pure formation. Captain Yin Sung-hwan became the first ROK commander assisted by a U.S. Army lieutenant as his executive officer. The number of U.S. Army personnel assigned to the unit fell below 200 for the first time since 1952. American forces assigned to the JSA assumed mainly administrative and support roles.

On October 31, 2004, a ROK Army battalion assumed sole responsibility for the Joint Security Area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=24393&amp;archive=true Leadership of Joint Security Area at DMZ transferred to S. Koreans]. Retrieved December 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This modified light infantry battalion consisted of a battalion headquarters, a headquarters company, two security companies, and a civil affairs company. The number of U.S. personnel assigned decreased further, reflecting the UNC Commander's desire to minimize the USFK presence near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The commander of the ROKA JSA Battalion serves as the UNCSB-JSA Deputy Commander. The UNCSB-JSA Commander's principal responsibility now lies in his operational control of selected ROKA formations during both Armistice and wartime periods.

Both sides placed guards between the blue meeting houses, where the demarcation line is marked by blocks of concrete. South Korean guards in this area were armed with [[pistol]]s and they stood in a modified taekwondo stance with stolid facial expressions, clenched fists and sunglasses, which was meant to intimidate the North Korean guards. The South Korean guards had to be at least 170&amp;nbsp;cm (5'6") tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic: Dangerous Divide|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0307/feature1/|publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explorer: Inside North Korea"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLBywKrTf4|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have a black belt in [[taekwondo]] or [[judo]].

Since October 25, 2018, guards in the Joint Security area no longer have posts.&lt;ref name=upioct25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nhkoct25 /&gt; They are also required to maintain a capacity no larger than 35 people and must be unarmed.&lt;ref name=nhkoct25&gt;https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20181026_02/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=upioct25&gt;https://www.upi.com/South-Korea-disarms-Joint-Security-Area-in-North-South-border/1631540459514/?rc_fifo=3&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of movement across the border must also enforced for visitors and tourists at some point as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.france24.com/en/20181025-koreas-remove-guns-cold-war-truce-village&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=upioct25 /&gt;

On November 6, 2018, both Koreas and the UNC established new rules which called for, among other things, the transfer of guard duty command to both Koreas for each of their respective sides of the area.&lt;ref name=nov6stripes /&gt;&lt;ref name=no6nk /&gt;

== History and major events ==
{{prose|section|date=June 2017}}

=== Overview ===
During one of the initial negotiations of the armistice, agents of the KPA/CPV side went into the truce tents one night and sawed down the chair legs of the UNC delegation. The next day, when the UNC delegates arrived, they were forced to sit lower than their KPA/CPV counterparts and lost face, so they quickly left the meeting. At a later meeting, the UNC delegation brought a flag into the truce tent and set it up on the meeting table. The KPA/CPV delegation left after losing face, but showed up at the next meeting with a flag that was larger than the UNC flag. At the following meeting, the UNC delegation brought in a slightly larger flag. This kept up until a special meeting was called just to discuss the size of the flags, as they had grown too large to fit within the tents. The size of the flags within the meeting building have stayed about the same since then, with only minor changes. The KPA flag is wider than the UNC flag, but the UNC flag is longer. The KPA flag has thicker fringe around the edges of the flag, but the UNC's trim is longer. The truck at the top of the KPA flagpole is taller than the UNC truck, but the UNC's is wider. The KPA flag has a three tiered base while the UNC flag only has two tiers, but each of the tiers on the UNC base is taller than any of the tiers on the KPA flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Caroline Joan Picart | title = Inside Notes from the Outside | isbn = 978-0-7391-0763-8 | publisher = Lexington Books | page = 56| year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maass | first = Peter | title = THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-22-06: PHENOMENON; Radioactive Nationalism |work=The New York Times | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE3D81E30F931A15753C1A9609C8B63&amp;pagewanted=2 | date = October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nevius | first = C.W. | title = North Korea and One-Upsmanship |work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cwnevius/detail?blogid=18&amp;entry_id=9675 | date = October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being at the center of one of the world's most tense military and political fault lines, the Joint Security Area has been the site of numerous interactions between North and South, including over 750 overt acts of violence. The UNC has documented most of the violent incidents with reports and photographs, which have been reported in the course of MAC meetings. Countless fistfights, shouting matches, exchanges of rude gestures, and other provocations have occurred since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/333.html#333.6.3 |title=Records of the UNC Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been several prisoner exchanges and other interactions.

* [[Operation Little Switch]], April 1953

This operation was a test case for prisoner repatriation, one of the four main issues of contention during two years of negotiation. 605 sick, wounded, and/or injured UNC prisoners were exchanged for 6,030 sick or injured Communist prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Barton.

* [[Operation Big Switch]], April–September 1953

Based on the success of the repatriations undertaken earlier, a general exchange of prisoners began in late April. During Operation Big Switch, prisoners were brought to Panmunjom, on the banks of the [[Sachong River]]. Each prisoner was then asked if he wished to cross the river and return to his countrymen or remain with his captors. Once the choice was made there was no turning back—hence the name [[Bridge of No Return]]. During this time 13,444 UNC prisoners returned to UNC countries, and 89,493 KPA and CPV prisoners returned to their Communist countries. In June 1953, ROK president [[Syngman Rhee]] released a further 25,000 KPA soldiers held in ROKA camps (mostly southerners impressed into service for the north) into South Korea in an attempt to wreck the armistice negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://korea50.army.mil/history/biographies/rhee.shtml Syngman Rhee Biography: Rhee Attacks Peace Proceedings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716121057/http://korea50.army.mil/history/biographies/rhee.shtml |date=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/kw-stale/stale.htm |title=The Korean War: Years of Stalemate, p. 30 |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/chapter8.htm |title=The Korean War 1950–1953, p. 245 |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operation Movement of Custodial Forces—India, September 2, 1953

The Armistice Agreement provided that a nonbelligerent nation would provide security forces to hold any prisoner of war who refused repatriation. India provided 6,413 soldiers for this purpose. After landing at the port of [[Inchon]], the UNCMAC Support Group (Provisional) moved all personnel to the Demilitarized Zone by helicopter in a single day without incident.
* Operation Comeback, January 21, 1954

Approximately 23,000 KPA and CPV soldiers held in UNC prisoner of war camps refused to return to Communist control. Twenty-two UNC soldiers ([[List of American defectors in the Korean War|21 Americans, one Briton]]) also refused repatriation. Under the provisions of the Armistice, these soldiers were held for a further six months and interviewed by neutral observers to ensure they had not been coerced into refusing repatriation. Most KPA expatriates remained in South Korea, while the overwhelming majority of CPV expatriates traveled to [[Taiwan]] to join the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]].
* Operation Rainbow, March 1954

During this operation the UNCMACSG(P) oversaw the repatriation of displaced persons, expellees, and refugees from North Korea to South Korea across the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom.

* On August 29, 1967, at 1645 hours&lt;!-- What time zone? Korean time or UTC? --&gt;, KPA soldiers armed with small arms and light machine guns attacked the United States Army Support Group Advance Camp (now known as [[Camp Bonifas]]). During this attack one US soldier and two ROKA soldiers were killed. An additional twelve US soldiers, nine ROKA soldiers, and three ROK civilians were wounded. The KPA soldiers were pursued to the MDL by US soldiers from the Advance Camp. Following this incident the southern boundary fence for the DMZ was relocated to a line north of the camp's perimeter.
* On April 14, 1968, at 2300 hours&lt;!-- What time zone?

Using small arms and automatic weapons fire and hand grenades, the KPA soldiers succeeded in stopping the truck and attempted to kill all six soldiers aboard. They withdrew across the MDL after killing four of the soldiers (two US and two ROKA) and wounding the remaining two soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=21020&amp;archive=true DMZ ambush survivors seen lucky to be alive].

Secret negotiations had taken place in the JSA Conference Room during the time of their captivity. They were the last group of UNC personnel to cross the Bridge of No Return.
* Operation Temple Bell, December 1969

:On August 17, 1969, an unarmed [[OH-23 Raven|OH-23]] observation helicopter strayed over DPRK airspace and was forced to land in North Korea. The three crew were held for {{frac|3|1|2}} months during negotiations between Major General A. H. Adam  senior negotiator at the UN Command, and North Korean Major General Lee Choon Sun. In early December 1969 the three crew members were released and ushered  over the Bridge of No Return.

* Operation Runaway I, February 14, 1970

:A [[Korean Air|Korean Air Lines]] aircraft was hijacked by a North Korean agent on December 11, 1969, and forced to divert to Sondǒk Airfield in [[Wonsan]], North Korea. Aside from the hijacker, the plane carried 46 passengers and four crew members. 39 passengers were repatriated through Panmunjom on [[Valentine's Day]], 1970.

* On October 12, 1970, two KPA guards and one KPA officer approached a group of UNC guards. The KPA soldiers attempted to remove the MP brassard from one UNC guard; a shoving match ensued. The KPA guards disengaged, moved to the KPA Joint Duty Officer building and returned with approximately 30 KPA guards and workers. Armed with shovels, clubs, and rocks, the KPA workers initiated a mêlée. One UNC guard was isolated from the rest, dragged between the MAC and JDO buildings, and beaten on the head with a shovel. Shortly afterward 50 unarmed UNC guards from the UNC JDO building arrived and joined the fray and began isolating and disabling KPA guards on the UNC side of the MDL. Fighting ceased when two KPA guards emerged from a guard post armed with AK-47 rifles. Seven UNC guards suffered injuries, including one with a skull fracture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imjinscout.com/stan_suit.html Rough Day at PanMunJom – Joint Security Area (JSA)].

* On September 22, 1971, the first [[Seoul–Pyongyang hotline|hotline between North and South Korea]] became operational to allow the [[Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North]] and [[Republic of Korea National Red Cross|South Korean Red Crosses]] to negotiate. More direct phone lines were established throughout the 1990s and 2000s until there were 33 hotlines that run through the Panmunjom area.&lt;ref name="bbc._What"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What we know of Koreas' red and green phones | work = BBC News | date = 3 January 2018 | accessdate = 6 January 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42553877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 3, 1974, a KPA officer and two KPA guards approached a UNC-sponsored tour at UNC Observation Post 5 (now UNCP #3). The UNC escort officer prevented the KPA group from harassing the tour group, at which point the KPA officer grabbed the UNC officer's shoulder. At the same time one of the KPA guards kicked the officer in the back and groin. Approximately 25–30 KPA personnel moved to the site and isolated the UNC officer, preventing him from returning to UNC Check Point 4 until the UNC Quick Reaction Force arrived on scene and dispersed the KPA soldiers. After the UNC QRF departed with the injured officer, KPA guards returned, broke into Check Point 4 and began to vandalize the interior. The QRF redeployed to Check Point 4 and forced the KPA away. The KPA responded by sending approximately 100 additional soldiers to KPA Guard Post No. 7 at the west end of the Bridge of No Return. The UNC JDO arrived on the scene and prevented an escalation by proposing an immediate Security Officers' Meeting. However, upon withdrawing from the area to convene the meeting, the JDO sedan was attacked by the KPA, who broke out the windows with rocks and clubs, injuring the JDO, after which all KPA forces withdrew to their side of the bridge.
* [[Major Henderson Incident]] – On June 30, 1975, a DPRK journalist with a history of provocative actions verbally accosted Major W.D. Henderson, the acting commander of the US Army Support Group. When Major Henderson failed to respond to the verbal insults and rude gestures, the journalist struck him in the face. Rising to protect himself, Major Henderson was attacked from behind by a KPA guard, who knocked him unconscious and then stomped on his throat, crushing his larynx. UNC and KPA guards from around the JSA immediately responded, and a mêlée ensued. The KPA guards attempted to inflict further injuries to Major Henderson as he was evacuated. KPA guards also assaulted a UNC-sponsored newswoman, who was hit in the face. The JSF commander arrived on the scene, confronted the fighters, and ended the incident by demanding an immediate Security Officers' Meeting. Major Henderson was evacuated from the area and eventually transported to the United States for treatment and rehabilitation.

* [[Axe Murder Incident]] – On August 18, 1976, North Korean guards attacked a [[United Nations Command]] (UNC) work party which was pruning a large tree obscuring visibility between two UNC checkpoints. During the fight, Joint Security Force (JSF) company commander Captain Bonifas of the [[US Army]] was killed by a North Korean guard, and Lieutenant Barrett was killed and most of the UNC guards were wounded by the [[Korean People's Army|KPA]] using axes dropped by the fleeing work party.
* [[Operation Paul Bunyan]], August 21, 1976 – In response to the killing of Bonifas and Barrett by the KPA on August 18, the UNC Commander, General [[Richard G. Stilwell]] ordered a massive show of force to accompany the felling of the [[poplar tree]] inside the JSA. The tree had been the focal point of the murders.
* In 1977, a U.S. [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 helicopter]] on patrol over the DMZ strayed into North Korean territory and was shot down. The crew—three dead, one alive—were repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/15/archives/us-copter-strayed-on-north-korea-line-carter-acts-to-avert.html |title=U.S. Copter Strayed On North Korea Line |publisher=nyt.com |accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Soviet Defector Incident – On November 23, 1984, during a communist-led tour, Soviet citizen Vasily Matusak (variously spelled Matusok) suddenly dashed across the Military Demarcation Line into South Korea. 30 KPA soldiers pursued him, firing their weapons as they did so. The JSF commanded by Captain [[Bert Mizusawa]] deployed from Camp Kitty Hawk (renamed Camp Bonifas in 1985) to safeguard Matusak and repel the North Koreans. The KPA soldiers, who were pinned down by fire from the JSF's 4th Platoon on guard duty in Panmunjom, were quickly outmaneuvered and isolated in the area of the Sunken Garden, now the site of the Unification Monument. In the 40-minute firefight that ensued, Corporal Jang Myong-Ki was killed, and Private First Class Michael A. Burgoyne was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=32397&amp;archive=true Soldiers gather to honor KATUSA killed at Korean JSA in 1984].

[[Image:Kadirga.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Traditional dancing in festival time]]

The '''Kadirga Festival''' is the most famous of all [[Turkey|Turkish]] festivities. The festival takes place in one of the yayla (plateaus) about 25 kilometers from [[Tonya, Turkey|Tonya]] (a town in [[Trabzon Province]]).

The magnificent treeless mountaintop where the festival takes place is located at the juncture of the territories of [[Beşikdüzü]], Tonya, [[Maçka]], [[Torul]], [[Eynesil]] and [[Görele]]. People from the four districts gather on the mountaintop during the third week of July for three days of wild revelry. Some of the celebrations suggest a ritualistic origin from ancient and forgotten hostilities related to the delicate issue of yayla demarcation amongst the various communities of the mountains.

==Coverage==

===Television===
In Britain, the [[BBC]] provided live television coverage of the show on [[BBC Two]], followed by [[BBC One]] later on, [[BBC Radio 1]], and [[BBC HD]]. The television coverage was presented by [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Graham Norton]] and [[Edith Bowman]]. Coverage commenced at 13:00 on [[BBC Two]] and concluded at 17:20 continuing on [[BBC One]] at 17:30.

In Ireland, [[RTÉ Two]] provided live coverage starting from 12:30 until 19:00 and then again from 21:30 until 06:00 the following morning, presented by [[Dave Fanning]].

In Canada, [[CTVglobemedia]] provided uninterrupted live television coverage of the show on [[MuchMoreMusic]].  Highlights of the show were featured on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] throughout the day.

===Online===
[[MSN]] was responsible for the online broadcasting of the concert.

==Controversy==
[[Chris Rock]]'s explicit language during the introduction of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] caused problems with Canadian TV networks and the [[BBC]]. Rock also used the word "nigger" while being interviewed on [[BBC One]] by [[Jonathan Ross]], alongside [[Ricky Gervais]]. Rock called the crowd "motherfuckers" and Jonathan Ross had to apologize to the viewers. He was unrepentant in later [[NME]] interviews.

The BBC missed the start of the [[Metallica]] set, joining live halfway through the first song, then switched to [[Crowded House]] from [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Sydney]] just as they started to play "[[Enter Sandman]]". This resulted in 413 complaints from Metallica fans who watched the concert from home.

[[Phil Collins]] sang during "[[Invisible Touch (song)|Invisible Touch]]", "And though she will fuck up your life, you'll want her just the same." Collins has sung this as part of many Genesis concerts. BBC presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] was required to apologize on air for the expletives used by Collins and [[Johnny Borrell]] of [[Razorlight]] and vowed to give them a "talking to". The offensive language used by performers at the event and broadcast live before the watershed caused the BBC to be censured by media regulator [[Ofcom]].

'''Minecode, LLC''' was a privately held [[IT consulting]] company based in [[Bellevue, Washington]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Reuters09"&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Owen|title=Minecode Aligns Leadership With Niche-Focused Business Strategy|publisher=''[[Reuters]]''|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS209710+03-Feb-2009+PRN20090203|accessdate=2009-02-03 | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had development centers both in India and the U.S with focus on Microsoft, Java, and Web 2.0 technologies.

==History==
Minecode was established in 2001 as Syntegral, LLC. In 2003, Syntegral, LLC changed its name to Minecode. In 2005, Minecode established an offshore subsidiary in [[Gurgaon]], [[India]]. Minecode currently is DBA Minebrain, headquartered in India. Samal moved remaining assets offshore to avoid attachment in bankruptcy and legal proceedings.   
   
In 2007, Minecode purchased Seattle-based X6 Technologies, a company specializing in customized marketing and VDP technology solutions and shortly thereafter, in early 2008, purchased Saltmine, an interactive design firm with offices in [[Seattle]], Washington and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Swartz|title=Minecode LLC|publisher=''[[BusinessWeek]]''|year=2009|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=30742712|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Minecode and Saltmine filed for bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/02/minecode_ceo_files_for_bankruptcy.html |title=Minecode and Saltmine close, CEO files for bankruptcy |publisher=Techflash.com |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving multiple employees with unpaid salaries and expenses.&lt;ref name="techflash1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/03/legal_troubles_mount_for_ex-minecode_ceo_samal.html |title=Legal troubles mount for ex-Minecode CEO Samal |publisher=Techflash.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employees have filed suit following the backrupcy filing.&lt;ref name="techflash1"/&gt;

==Scandals==
Minecode employees, CEO Pradyumna Samal (PK Samal) and project manager Sandeep Verma, plead guilty to several counts of computer intrusion in 2009.

The '''murder of Annie Le''' occurred September 8, 2009, on the campus of [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]]. Annie Marie Le (July 3, 1985&amp;nbsp;– September 8, 2009) was a 24-year-old [[doctorate|doctoral student]] at the [[Yale School of Medicine]]'s Department of [[Pharmacology]]. She was last seen in a research building on the New Haven campus on September 8. On September 13, the day she was to be married, she was found dead inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32810822/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Clues point to inside job in Yale killing|work=msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, police arrested a suspect, Raymond J. Clark III, a Yale laboratory technician who worked in the building.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/17/yale.student.le/index.html|title=Yale lab worker arrested in student's killing, police say|work=cnn.com |publisher=CNN|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark pleaded guilty to the murder on March 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/raymond-clark-pleads-guilty-murder-yale-grad-student/story?id=13158057|title=Clark Pleads Guilty to Murder of Yale Student|last=News|first=A.

== Disappearance and death ==
On the morning of September 8, Le left her apartment and took Yale Transit to the Sterling Hall of Medicine on the Yale campus. At about 10&amp;nbsp;a.m., she walked from Sterling Hall to another campus building at 10 Amistad Street, where her research laboratory was located. Le had left her purse, cell phone, credit cards, and cash in her office at Sterling Hall. She entered the Amistad Street building just after 10&amp;nbsp;a.m., as documented on footage from the building's security cameras. Le was never seen leaving the building. At approximately 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the evening of September 8, when Le had still not returned to her home, one of her five housemates called police to report her missing.

Because the security footage did not show Le exiting the building at Amistad Street, police closed the whole building for investigation. Police also searched through refuse at the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] dump, where Yale's garbage is incinerated, looking for clues as to Le's whereabouts. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[New Haven Police Department]] and the [[Connecticut State Police]] were all involved in the search.

On Sunday, September 13, her planned wedding date, authorities discovered Le's body in a cable [[:wikt:chase#Noun 3|chase]] inside the wall of a basement laboratory in the Amistad Street building.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Herman, ''Visual Intelligence: Sharpen Your Perception, Change Your Life'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016), p. 118. Herman noted that the FBI discovered the body not through visual clues but from the smell of Le's decomposing body which had been detected not at the supposed crime scene but in the men's bathroom.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody clothes had previously been found above a ceiling tile in the same building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/14/missing.yale.student/index.html|title=Yale student's killing 'completely senseless,' roommate says|date=September 14, 2009|work=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building and the area are monitored by about 75 security cameras and the entrance to the building, and the rooms inside the building require Yale identification cards in order to be opened and accessed. The basement where Le's body was found houses animals (mostly [[mouse|mice]]) that are used for experiments and research. Due to the high security measures in the building, authorities and Yale officials maintained that it would be extremely difficult for someone without a Yale ID card to enter the basement laboratory where Le's body was discovered, leading them to focus their investigation on Yale employees and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/09/14/body-identified-as-annie-le-grd-13/ | title=Body Identified as Annie Le Grd ’13 | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-22 | first=Harrison | last=Korn | first2=Paul | last2=Needham | newspaper=Yale Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Connecticut [[medical examiner]]'s [[autopsy]] found that Le's death was due to "traumatic [[asphyxia]] due to neck compression".&lt;ref name=cnn.com/&gt; On September 17 police arrested Raymond Clark, a 26-year-old laboratory technician who had been working in the building when Le disappeared.&lt;ref name=cnn.com/&gt; The previous day he had been taken into custody after police had obtained a warrant to collect [[DNA]] samples from him; he had been released after providing a sample.&lt;ref name=cnn.com/&gt;

Memorials were held in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]], and the funeral was broadcast live on the Internet. The Yale community also publicly mourned Le's death. The ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' reported that professor and [[Cold War]] historian [[John Lewis Gaddis]] called September 14 the "saddest day to open class" since the day after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Isaac | last=Arnsdorf | title=Gaddis: Saddest day to hold class since day after 9/11 | url=http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2009/09/14/gaddis-saddest-day-to-hold-class-since-day-after-911/ | newspaper=[[Yale Daily News]] | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
In the wake of Le's disappearance and the discovery of her body, and the sympathy and outrage over the crime going worldwide, there was a backlash in some circles to the extensive media coverage, and while most acknowledged the crime was especially heartbreaking, some questioned whether the level of interest was warranted.

Some commentators have suggested that the attention given by the media was inappropriately disproportionate to that given to other murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Media frenzy over Yale murder draws criticism |first=Kristen|last=Chick |url=http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/09/18/media-frenzy-over-yale-murder-draws-criticism/ |publisher=Christian Science Monitor Global News Blog |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' contributor Jack Shafer opined that, "Journalists almost everywhere observe this rough rule of thumb: Three murders at a [[Midwest]]ern college equal one murder at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] or Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder Draped in Ivy: Why the press can't get enough of Harvard or Yale murders |first=Jack|last=Shafer |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2228705/ |publisher=Slate |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post]]'' columnist MariAn Gail Brown argued that there is a "[[pecking order]]" in the investigation of crimes, and that Le's murder attracted media attention because she was "an [[Ivy League]]r. Translation: Someone who might earn beaucoup bucks. Someone who possesses sky's-the-limit potential. Vivacious and attractive, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the edge of Yale, murder's not a new story|first=MariAn Gail|last=Brown |url=http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/On-the-edge-of-Yale-murder-s-not-a-new-story-124970.php |publisher=Connecticut Post |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecution ==
After his arrest, Clark was held on $3 million bail at the [[MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution]], a maximum security prison in [[Suffield, Connecticut]]. He appeared in Connecticut State [[Superior Court]] on October 6, 2009, but did not then enter a plea to the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale Killing Suspect Appears in Court|first=Serge|last=Kovaleski|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/nyregion/07Yale.html |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2009-12-22 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hearing was delayed until January 26, 2010, since not all of the materials in the case had been made available to lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clark hearing put off until January | first=Esther | last=Zuckerman | url=http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2009/12/21/clark-hearing-put-off-until-january/ | newspaper=[[Yale Daily News]] | date=2009-12-21 | accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark initially pleaded not guilty on January 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/01/26/connecticut.yale.killing/|title=Suspect in Yale killing pleads not guilty|date=January 26, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pretrial hearing was scheduled for March 3, 2010, in New Haven,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jud2.ct.gov/crdockets/CaseDetail.aspx?source=Pending&amp;Key=bfd16236-8d07-42e4-a23a-0c9347656b48 Pending Criminal / Motor Vehicle – Search by Defendant], State of Connecticut Judicial Branch&lt;/ref&gt; and pretrial evidence processing was scheduled for July 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/family_stands_by_annie_le_murder_suspect/id_27033|title=Family Stands By Annie Le Murder Suspect|date=June 16, 2010|publisher=New Haven  Independent|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, Clark's case was continued, and another hearing was scheduled for February 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale killing suspect due back in court |url=http://www.courant.com/community/new-haven/hc-ap-ct-yalekillingfeb06,0,6401077.story |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |newspaper=Hartford Courant |date=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Clark entered a guilty plea in Le's murder, in exchange for a 44-year prison term.

'''PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars''' ('''PLATO''') is a [[space observatory]] under development by the [[European Space Agency]] for launch in 2026.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2017-06-plato-spacecraft-earth-like-exoplanets.html PLATO spacecraft to find new Earth-like exoplanets]. June 21, 2017, Max Planck Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission goals are to search for planetary [[transit (astronomy)|transits]] across up to one million stars, and to discover and characterize [[Terrestrial planet|rocky]] [[extrasolar planet]]s around [[yellow dwarf]] stars (like our [[sun]]), [[subgiant]] stars, and [[red dwarf]] stars. The emphasis of the mission is on earth-like planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars where water can exist in liquid state.&lt;ref name='proposed 2014'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jonathan | last = Amos | title = Plato planet-hunter in pole position | date = 29 January 2014 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25911893 | work = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is the third medium-class mission in ESA's [[Cosmic Vision]] programme and named after the influential Greek philosopher [[Plato]], the founding figure of Western philosophy, science and mathematics. A secondary objective of the mission is to study stellar oscillations or seismic activity in stars to measure stellar masses and evolution and enabling the precise characterization of the planet host star, including its age.&lt;ref name='plato mission'&gt;{{cite news|publisher= [[European Space Agency]] | title = Plato | url = http://sci.esa.int/plato/ | work = European Space Agency | accessdate = 9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
PLATO was first proposed in 2007 to the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) by a team of scientists in response to the call for ESA's [[Cosmic Vision]] 2015–2025 programme.&lt;ref name='INAF'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oact.inaf.it/plato/PPLC/Home.html | title = PLATO 2.0 | author= Isabella Pagano | accessdate = 20 February 2014 | year = 2014 | work = INAF- Osservatorio Astrofisico di Catania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment phase was completed during 2009, and in May 2010 it entered the Definition Phase. Following a call for missions in July 2010, ESA selected in February 2011 four candidates for a medium-class mission (M3 mission) for a launch opportunity in 2024.&lt;ref name='INAF'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/53109-cosmic-vision-m3-candidate-missions-presentation-event/ Cosmic Vision M3 candidate missions presentation event]. Announcement and registration. (21 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; PLATO was announced on 19 February 2014 as the selected M3 class science mission for implementation as part of its Cosmic Vision Programme. Other competing concepts that were studied included the four candidate missions [[EChO]], [[LOFT]], [[MarcoPolo-R]] and [[STE-QUEST]].&lt;ref name="selected2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=ESA selects planet-hunting PLATO mission| url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_selects_planet-hunting_PLATO_mission |publisher=European Space Agency| accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 ESA selected [[Thales Alenia Space]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/regional/2015/01/12/esa-selects-thales-alenia-space-for-plato-phase-b1-study/|title=ESA Selects Thales Alenia Space for PLATO Phase B1 Study|date=12 January 2015|publisher=Via Satellite|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Airbus Defence and Space|Airbus DS,]] and [https://www.ohb-system.de/ OHB System AG] to conduct three parallel phase B1 studies to define the system and subsystem aspects of PLATO, which were completed in 2016. On 20 June 2017, ESA has adopted PLATO&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/59243-gravitational-wave-mission-selected-planet-hunting-mission-moves-forward/|title=Gravitational wave mission selected, planet-hunting mission moves forward|website=sci.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Science Programme, which means that the mission can move from a blueprint into construction. In the coming months industry will be asked to make bids to supply the spacecraft platform.

The PLATO Mission Consortium that is responsible for the payload and for major contributions to the science operations is led by Prof. Heike Rauer at the [[German Aerospace Center|German Aerospace Center (DLR)]] Institute of Planetary Research. The design of the Telescope Optical Units is made by an international team from Italy, Switzerland and Sweden and coordinated by Roberto Ragazzoni at INAF ([[Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica]]) Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova. The Telescope Optical Unit development is funded by the [[Italian Space Agency]], the [[Swiss Space Office]] and the [[Swedish National Space Board]].&lt;ref name="Optical units" /&gt;

PLATO is an acronym, but also the name of a [[philosopher]] in [[Classical Greece]]; [[Plato]] (428–348 [[Anno Domini|BC]]) was looking for a [[physical law]] accounting for the orbit of planets (errant stars) and able to satisfy the philosopher's needs for "uniformity" and "regularity".&lt;ref name='INAF'/&gt;

== Objective ==
The goal is to find planets like Earth, not just in terms of their size but in their potential for [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].&lt;ref name='proposed 2014'/&gt; By using 26 separate small telescopes and cameras, PLATO will search for planets orbiting from 300,000 to one million stars.&lt;ref name="selected2014"/&gt; The main objective of PLATO is to elucidate the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of [[life]]. To achieve this objective, the mission has these goals: 
*Discover and characterize a large number of close-by [[Exoplanet|exoplanetary systems]], with a precision in the determination of the planet radius up to 3%, of stellar age up to 10%, and of the planet mass up to 10% (the latter in combination with on-ground [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity]] measurements)
*Detect and characterize Earth-sized planets and [[super-Earth]]s in the [[habitable zone]] around solar-type stars
*Discover and characterize a large number of [[Exoplanet|exoplanetary systems]] to study their typical architectures, and dependencies on the properties of their host stars and the environment 
*Measure [[Asteroseismology|stellar oscillations]] to study the internal structure of stars and how it evolves with age
*Identify good targets for spectroscopic measurements to investigate [[Extraterrestrial atmosphere|exoplanet atmospheres]]
PLATO will differ from the [[COROT]] and [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] space telescopes in that it will study relatively bright stars (between magnitudes 4 and 11), enabling a more accurate determination of planetary parameters, and making it easier to confirm planets and measure their masses using follow-up [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity]] measurements on ground-based telescopes. Its dwell time will be longer than that of the [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] NASA mission, making it sensitive to longer-period planets.

== Optics ==
The PLATO payload is based on a multi-telescope approach, involving a set of 24 "normal cameras" working at a readout cadence of 25 seconds and monitoring stars fainter than [[apparent magnitude]] 8, plus two "fast cameras" working at a cadence of 2.5 seconds, and observing stars between magnitude 4 to 8.&lt;ref&gt;''PLATO: detailed design of the telescope optical units.'' Authors: D. Magrin, Ma. Munari, I. Pagano, D. Piazza, R. Ragazzoni, et al., in ''Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2010: Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave'', Edited by Oschmann, Jacobus M., Jr.; Clampin, Mark C.; MacEwen, Howard A. Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 7731, pp. 773124-8 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras are [[refracting telescope]]s using six lenses; each camera has an 1,100 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; field and a 120&amp;nbsp;mm lens diameter. Each camera is equipped with its own [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[staring array]], consisting of four CCDs of 4510 x 4510 [[pixels]].

The 24 "normal cameras" will be arranged in four groups of six cameras with their lines of sight offset by a 9.2° angle from the +ZPLM axis. This particular configuration allows surveying a total field of about 2,250 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per pointing. The satellite will rotate around the mean line of sight once a year, delivering a continuous survey of the same region of the sky.

== Launch ==
The satellite is planned to launch in 2026 from [[Guiana Space Centre]] with a [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] rocket to the Earth-Sun L2 [[Lagrangian point]].&lt;ref name="selected2014"/&gt;

The '''Pagan Spirit Gathering''' (PSG) is one of the [[United States]]'s oldest and largest nature spirituality festivals, organized by [[Circle Sanctuary]].&lt;ref name="drawing_down"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Revised &amp; Updated| chapter = Pagan Spirit Gathering (PSG)| publisher = Penguin | isbn = 0-14-303819-2| authorlink = Margot Adler| last = Adler| first = Margot| title = Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its inception in 1980 it has been held from Sunday to Sunday during the week around the [[summer solstice]].  Pagan Spirit Gathering is set up to represent a temporary Pagan Town.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.circlesanctuary.org/index.php/pagan-spirit-gathering/pagan-spirit-gathering Circle Sanctuary's Pagan Spirit Gathering Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the festivals were held in [[Richland County, Wisconsin]], but it outgrew the facilities and in 1997 moved to a location near [[Athens, Ohio]], at Wisteria. In 2009, PSG moved to Camp Zoe near [[Salem, Missouri]], then in 2011, to Stonehouse Farm near [[Earlville, Illinois]].  After a flash flood caused PSG 2015 to close early,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildhunt.org/2015/06/pagan-spirit-gathering-2015-stories-from-the-flood-and-the-aftermath.html Wild Hunt Article]&lt;/ref&gt; PSG moved to Tall Tree Lake near [[Vienna, Illinois]].

==Rituals==
Many rituals take place regularly at PSG,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circlesanctuary.org/psg/rituals/ Circle Sanctuary's PSG Ritual Page]&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Summer Solstice Sun Morning Ritual - on Solstice morning
* Men's and Women's Rituals - Rituals celebrating divine masculinity and femininity
* Croning Ritual
* Sacred Hunt
* Tribal Drum &amp; Dance Ritual
* Young Women's' Rite of Passage
* Young Men's Rite of Passage

==Children, tweens, and young elders==
PSG has youth programming grouped into three categories: the Children's Center serves those under 7 year old; guided activities are provided for tweens (8-12); and the Young Elders (13-18) have a teen center with snacks and amenities. Most workshops are open to youth, and many are open to tweens and children.

==Safety &amp; rules==
The PSG registration process includes agreeing to abide by rules set down by Circle Sanctuary, mostly for the safety and health of the participants. Some rules, such as those regarding alcohol and drugs or the nudity of minors, are put in place to assure the legality of the festival under federal and state laws. The Guardians of the Sacred Circle are a separate protective order which provides safety and medical services for the festival.

PSG is [[clothing optional|clothing-optional]] throughout most of the campsite. Relatively few attendees go [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]]. There are some limitations for minors (in more private circumstances where adults are also present) in order to assure compliance with state law.

At PSG, each adult must perform four hours of community service or equivalent (as determined by Circle Sanctuary staff) during the course of the week. These periods of time are referred to as "workshifts". Many of these workshifts are great opportunities to interact with festival-goers in other parts of the site.

==Music==
Music is very much a part of the activities at Pagan Spirit Gathering. Chanting and singing can be heard at the Morning Meetings, at musically oriented workshops, and one can find drumming and dancing into the night at the Bonfire Circle. There is a performing arts show on the main stage and concerts every afternoon and evening of the event.

The main stage has hosted numerous performers and bands, including [[Owain Phyfe]], Skinny White Chick with [[S. J. Tucker]], Damh the Bard, Coyote Run, [[SONA (band)|SONA]], Arthur Hinds, Ruth Barrett, Heather Jinmaku, Murphey's Midnight Rounders (formerly Dunn County Clerics), Celia, Shibaten, Spellsinger, The One Hat Band, Lezlie Revelle, Todd Alan, Incus, MotherTongue, Abbi Spinner, Wendy Rule, Stone Ring, Gypsy, Sentinel Grove, Green Crown and others.

The '''Pinkpop Festival''' or '''PINKPOP''' is a large, annual [[music festival]] held at [[Landgraaf]], [[Netherlands]]. It is usually held on the [[Pentecost]] weekend ('''''Pink'''steren'' in Dutch, hence the name). If Pentecost falls on an early date in May, the festival is held later in June. Starting in 1970, at [[Burgemeester Damen Sportpark]] in the town of [[Geleen]], PinkPop is the oldest and longest running annual dedicated pop and rock music festival in the world.&lt;ref name="Pollstar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gammon |first=John |date=17 June 2011 |title=Six In A Row For Pinkpop |url=http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=771453 |location=London, U.K. |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |accessdate=13 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813184357/http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=771453 |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VPRO 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2010/mei/Pinkpop-is-langstlopende-popfestival-ter-wereld.html |title=Pinkpop is langstlopende popfestival ter wereld |language=Dutch |trans-title=Pinkpop is longest running pop festival in the world |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 May 2010 |website=http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/ |publisher=[[VPRO]] independent Dutch [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|public broadcaster]] |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, Pinkpop is a three-day festival, from Saturday through Monday when on Pentecost weekend, or Friday through Sunday otherwise, with a 60,000 people per day capacity, and with performances on 4 separate stages. From 2006 through 2011, Pinkpop sold out six years in a row.&lt;ref name="Pollstar"/&gt; During 44 editions, more than 2 million people have attended Pinkpop.

In 1994 (the 25th edition), it was decided to sell only 60,000 tickets, to prevent overcrowding due to the popularity of the festival. In 1995, it was made into a 2-day festival. Two years later, in 1997, this was further expanded to three days.

2007 saw a spin-off, later in the year, on 11 August, called [[Pinkpop Classic]], for an older rock audience, with bands that previously performed there in past decades. This spin-off was held again in following years, with exception of 2011, in which the organisation was not able to sign enough interesting older bands.

In 2008, Pinkpop was for the first time in its history not held on Pentecost weekend, which fell too early that year for the convenience of fans and performers alike. This was decided following the 2005 edition, in which the Pentecost weekend also fell early and therefore Pinkpop could not convince many great performers to come play at the festival. Sales were disappointing in 2005, so by shifting the 2008 festival, the organisation hoped to solve these problems. Pinkpop 2008 turned out to have had the largest concert attendance to date. The dates for the 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2016 edition have been shifted as well, for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkpop.nl/2014/pinkpop-2015-12-13-14-juni/|title=Pinkpop 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and logo==
{{external media |float=right |width= |image1=[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/0/03/Pinkpop-banner.jpg Pinkpop Logo picture] on the [[German Wikipedia]] article [[:de:Pinkpop|on Pinkpop]].}}
The name consists of two parts. 'Pink' comes from the Dutch word for Pentecost (''Pinksteren'') and 'pop' comes from [[pop music|''pop'' music]] (or 'popular music'). But a later creative interpretation for the name combines the ''English'' word [[pink]] and the Dutch word ''pop'', which means [[doll]], thus forming the origin for the [[logo]], a doll in a pink dress.

The precursor to Pinkpop was held on [[Pentecost Monday]] in 1969. It was completely free, and called Pinknick because people were supposed to bring their own food. Only a free [[pig roast]] and free apples were provided by the organizers.&lt;ref name="VPRO 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/andere-tijden/afleveringen/2000-2001/De-beginjaren-van-Pinkpop.html |title=De beginjaren van Pinkpop |language=Dutch |trans-title=The early years of Pinkpop |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 May 2001 |website=www.geschiedenis24.nl |publisher=[[Nederland 24#Geschiedenis 24|Geschiedenis 24]] (defunct [[specialty channel|history channel]]) |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey festival]] from 1967, a number of hip local bands were persuaded to come and play unpaid. Almost 10,000 visitors were attracted, ranging from pop music lovers to grandparents and their grandchildren. And families with empty shopping bags, loading up on apples.&lt;ref name="VPRO 2"/&gt;

==Editions==

===2007===
Pinkpop 2007 was held on May 26, 27 and 28 2007. It was the 20th time the event was held at the Megaland Park. On February 28, most of the line-up was revealed. [[Pearl Jam]] was announced to make their 3rd appearance on the Pinkpop stage, but they cancelled, for two of their members would become fathers in the Pentecost weekend.

===2008===
Pinkpop 2008 was held in the [[Landgraaf]] Megaland Park on 30 May, 31 May and 1 June 2008. On 10 and 17 December there were 3 bands officially announced to headline on each of the three festival days. These headlining bands are the internationally renowned [[Foo Fighters]], [[Metallica]], and the recently reunited [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Pinkpop 2008 had the largest audience of concert attendees to date, with an average of just over 60,000 people arriving each of the three days, prompting the festival organizers to announce that 180,000 people had visited the festival. Because the 42,500 available three-day passes sold out completely, the actual number of unique visitors is 94,000.

:{{note label|G|G|G}} At first [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] would perform as well, but he had to cancel due to voice problems. Placebo replaced Sam Smith's spot.
:{{note label|H|H|H}} Originally the Foo Fighters would serve as the festivals headliner but had to cancel their performance due to a broken leg by frontman Dave Grohl two days earlier. [[Pharrell Williams]] became headliner instead and the Flemish trio [[Triggerfinger]] was added as a last-minute addition to the line-up.

===2018===
Pinkpop 2018 was held on June 15, 16 and 17.

A fatal traffic accident involving festival-goers took place in the early morning of June 18. After the festival, at around 04:00, a group of persons [https://www.ad.nl/dossier-drama-pinkpop/pinkpop-slachtoffers-zaten-in-een-kring-op-de-weg~aed0a0fe/ sat on the road near Campsite B], which was, apparently unbeknownst to them, not closed to vehicular traffic. Information as it is now, indicates that a white Opel van travelling along this road could not avoid the group and ran into them, killing one and severely injuring three more. The driver [https://nos.nl/artikel/2237087-bestuurder-busje-dodelijke-aanrijding-pinkpop-is-man-uit-heerlen.html reported himself] to the police several hours later in Amsterdam.

During the performance of the [[Foo Fighters]] on June 16, the disintegration of a large [[meteor]] was observed in the sky right behind the main stage and caught on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xvEN4I-iY|title=Falling star during Foo Fighters Concert - Pinkpop 2018|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fireball and its disintegration was widely observed also elsewhere in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and [[France]]. An analysis of over 200 eyewitness reports suggests that the disintegration took place at 23:11 local time near the Belgian city of [[Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akm.imo.net/imo_view/event/2018/2065#|title=Fireball event 2018: 2065-2018|website=akm.imo.net|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3437">The '''Praguerie''' was a revolt of the [[France|French]] [[nobility]] against King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] in 1440.

It was so named because a similar rising had recently taken place in [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]], at that time closely associated with France through the [[House of Luxembourg]], [[kings of Bohemia]]. Its causes lay in the reforms of Charles VII at the close of the [[Hundred Years' War]], by which he sought to diminish the anarchy in France and its brigand-soldiery.  The ordinances passed by the estates of ''[[langue d'oïl]]'' at [[Orléans]] in 1439, not only gave the king an aid of 100,000 [[franc]]s (an act which was later used by the king as though it were a perpetual grant and so freed him from that [[parliament]]ary control of the purse so important in [[England]]), but demanded as well royal nominations to officerships in the army, marked a gain in the royal prerogative which the nobility resolved to challenge.

The main instigator was [[Charles I, Duke of Bourbon]],{{sfn|Small|2009|p=161}} who three years before had attempted a similar rising, and had been forced to ask pardon of the king. He and his bastard brother, John, were joined by the former [[favourite]], [[Georges de la Tremoille]],{{sfn|Small|2009|p=161}} [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|John VI, duke of Brittany]],{{sfn|Vale|1974|p=76}} who allied himself with the English, the [[John II of Alençon|duke of Alençon]],{{sfn|Small|2009|p=161}} the [[Louis, Count of Vendôme|count of Vendôme]],{{sfn|Vale|1974|p=76}} and [[mercenaries]] captains like [[Rodrigo de Villandrando]],{{sfn|Vale|1974|p=74}} Antoine de Chabannes, or Jean de la Roche. The [[duke of Bourbon]] won over the ''[[Dauphin of France|dauphin]]'' Louis, —afterwards [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], then only sixteen years old, and proposed to set aside the king in his favour, making him regent.{{sfn|Vale|1974|p=76-78}} 

Louis was readily induced to rebel; but the country was saved from a serious civil war by the energy of the king's officers and the solid loyalty of his "good cities". The [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|constable de Richemont]]{{sfn|Small|2009|p=161}} marched with the king's troops into [[Poitou]], his old battleground with de la Tremoille, and in two months he had subdued the country. The royal artillery battered down the [[feudal]] strongholds. The dauphin and the duke of Alençon failed to bring about any sympathetic rising in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and the Praguerie was over, except for some final pillaging and plundering in [[Saintonge]] and Poitou, which the royal army failed to prevent.

Charles then attempted to ensure the loyalty of the duke of Bourbon by the gift of a large pension, forgave all the rebellious gentry, and installed his son in [[Dauphiné]]. The ordinance of Orleans was enforced.  The dauphin was forced to beg his father's forgiveness.{{sfn|Vale|1974|p=81}}

'''''Prima Donna: A Symphonic Visual Concert''''' is a music and visual concert inspired by American-Canadian singer-songwriter [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s 2009 opera ''[[Prima Donna (opera)|Prima Donna]]''. The two-part program features a concert adaptation of the opera accompanied by a film directed by [[Francesco Vezzoli]], produced by Petite Maison Production and featuring [[Cindy Sherman]], followed by a performance of Wainwright singing well-known songs from his repertoire.

==Description==
''Prima Donna: A Symphonic Visual Concert'' is a 2015 program in two parts, inspired by [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s 2009 opera ''[[Prima Donna (opera)|Prima Donna]]''. Wainwright "reconfigured" the opera's musical compositions and scheduled a tour to coincide with the release of the opera's [[Prima Donna (Rufus Wainwright album)|studio recording of the same name]].&lt;ref name=MusicNews&gt;{{cite web|title=Rufus Wainwright presents Prima Donna: A Symphonic Visual Concert|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=91830|publisher=Music-News|accessdate=August 28, 2015|date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half is a 60-minute concert adaptation of the opera accompanied by a film conceived by Wainwright and directed by Italian artist and filmmaker [[Francesco Vezzoli]]. It features Cindy Sherman as the opera's main character, who was inspired by American-born Greek soprano [[Maria Callas]], wearing Callas' actual costumes borrowed from the Rome-based costume suppliers [[Tirelli Costumi]] and [[Costumi d'Arte]].&lt;ref name=MusicNews/&gt;
The film, produced by Tessa Louise-Salomé and Solveig Rawas from [http://www.petitemaisonproduction.com/PETITE_MAISON_PRODUCTION_US/PRIMA_DONNA_US.html Petite Maison Production] was shot during Spring 2015. Main photography took place in Paris, at [[Théâtre des Variétés]].

The program's second half features Wainwright performing popular songs from his repertoire with full orchestra accompaniment and special appearances by opera singers.&lt;ref name=HK&gt;{{cite web|title=A night of star power|url=http://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/programmes/rufus-wainwright-prima-donna/|publisher=Hong Kong Arts Festival|accessdate=August 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410011441/https://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/programmes/rufus-wainwright-prima-donna/|archivedate=April 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remoxipride''' ('''Roxiam''') is an [[atypical antipsychotic]] (although according to some sources it is a [[typical antipsychotic]]) which was previously used in [[Europe]] for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and acute [[mania]] but was withdrawn due to [[toxicity]] concerns (incidence of [[aplastic anemia]] in 1/10,000 patients).&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-31058-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=José Miguel Vela |author2=Helmut Buschmann |author3=Jörg Holenz |author4=Antonio Párraga |author5=Antoni Torrens | title = Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics: From Chemistry and Pharmacology to Clinical Application | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 3-527-31058-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially launched by [[AstraZeneca]] in 1990 and suspension of its use began in 1993.&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-31058-4"/&gt; Remoxipride acts as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[D2 receptor|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[D3 receptor|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] and also has high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[sigma receptor]], possibly playing a role in its atypical neuroleptic action.&lt;ref name="pmid1978484"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Köhler C, Hall H, Magnusson O, Lewander T, Gustafsson K | title = Biochemical pharmacology of the atypical neuroleptic remoxipride | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica.

'''Roswell''' is a city and the [[County seat|seat]] of [[Chaves County, New Mexico|Chaves County]] in the U.S. state of [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="GR6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] it had a population of 48,411,&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3564930| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Roswell city, New Mexico (revision of 01-02-2013)| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fifth-[[List of populated places in New Mexico by population|largest city in New Mexico]]. It is a center for irrigated farming, dairying, ranching, manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum production. It is also the home of [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), founded in 1891. [[Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] is located a few miles northeast of the city on the [[Pecos River]]. [[Bottomless Lakes State Park]] is located {{convert|12|mi}} east of Roswell on [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]].

Roswell is most popularly known for having its name attached to what is now called the [[Roswell UFO incident]], though the crash site of the alleged [[UFO]] was some {{convert|75|mi}} from Roswell and closer to [[Corona, New Mexico|Corona]]. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local [[Roswell Army Air Field]]. Roswell is a popular town for tourists from around the country because of its many alien-themed stores.

==History==
[[image:Historical-museum.jpg|thumb|left|The White family home, built in 1912, is now a museum.]]
[[image:Chaves County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Chaves County courthouse]]
[[File:Roswell New Mexico Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Roswell flood]]
The first nonindigenous or [[Hispanic America|Hispanic]] settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from [[Missouri]], who attempted to start a settlement {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. [[John Chisum]] had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.

Van C. Smith, a businessman from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two [[adobe]] buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first [[postmaster]]. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.

In 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the [[Lincoln County War]] (1877–1879). A major [[aquifer]] was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.

During World War II, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was located in nearby [[Orchard Park, New Mexico|Orchard Park]]. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the [[North Spring River]]. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an [[iron cross]] among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]], presented to the city of Roswell by the [[German Air Force]].

In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s early [[rocket]]ry work. (The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard's rocketry development workshop.)

Roswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the [[Walker Air Force Base]] was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a [[retirement community]].

Roswell has benefited from interest in the alleged [[Roswell UFO incident|UFO incident of 1947]]. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an [[extraterrestrial spacecraft]] and its [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a [[conspiracy theory]] regarding a classified program named "[[Project Mogul|Mogul]]". Many [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.

In 1978–79 and 2002, Roswell was named one of the [[All-America City Award|All-American cities]].

Roswell hosted the [[Red Bull Stratos|record-breaking skydive]] by [[Felix Baumgartner]] on October 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Llorca| first=Juan| title=Felix Baumgartner Completes Record-Setting Jump| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/felix-baumgartner-jump-redbull-skydive_n_1965299.html| publisher=Huffington Post| accessdate=17 October 2012| date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Roswell is located in southeastern New Mexico about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Pecos River]] and some {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of highlands that rise to the [[Sierra Blanca (New Mexico)|Sierra Blanca]] range. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|70]], [[U.S. Route 285 (New Mexico)|285]], and [[U.S. Route 380 (New Mexico)|380]] intersect in the city. US 70 leads northeast {{convert|111|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] and {{convert|117|mi|abbr=on}} west to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]; US 285 leads north {{convert|192|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and south {{convert|76|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]; and US 380 leads east {{convert|134|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Brownfield, Texas]], and west {{convert|164|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Socorro, New Mexico]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Roswell has a total area of {{convert|77.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|77.3|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|km2|order=flip|2}}, or 0.19%, is covered by water.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"/&gt;

===Climate===
Roswell is located in the [[Great Plains|High Plains]] and has four very distinct seasons, giving it a ''BSk'' or ''BSh'' [[semiarid climate]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and [[snowfall]] is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and [[Colorado]]) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100&amp;nbsp;°F, which can be unpleasant. The North American [[monsoon]] occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe [[thunderstorms]] (with high winds and [[hail]]) and sometimes even [[tornadoes]]. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.

The record low in Roswell is {{convert|-24|F|0}} on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; The record high is {{convert|114|F|0}} on June 27, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/daily/USNM0267?climoMonth=6 June Daily Averages for Roswell, NM ''Weather.com'' Retrieved June 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spec miata.jpg|thumb|right|Spec Miata cars on track]]

'''Spec Miata''' is a class of [[racing car]] used in [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA), [[National Auto Sport Association]] (NASA), and [[Midwestern Council]] of Sports Car Clubs (MCSCC) [[road racing]] events.

The Spec Miata (SM) class is intended to provide the opportunity to compete in low-cost cars with limited modifications, suitable for racing competition. It is intended to encourage low cost, entry level, production car based competition. Spec Miata currently races both sprints and enduros where available.

[[Mazda MX-5]]s (also known as Mazda Miata Roadsters) in model years 1990 through 1993 with 1600 cc engines, model years 1994 through 1997 with 1800 cc engines, and model years 1999 through 2005 with 1800 cc engines have been approved by the SCCA for Regional racing in all divisions of the SCCA. The class was approved for National SCCA racing beginning in the 2006 racing season.  At the professional level, the SM cars are known as the [[Global MX-5 Cup|MX-5 Cup]].

Spec Miata was first approved as a Regional class in the Southwest Division of SCCA in 1999 and the first race as an official class was at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20010502045713/http://houscca.com/racing/results/results99/jul241999.html Fiesta Carrera Regional], Texas World Speedway 2.90 road course on July 24, 1999 at 1:05 pm and included a starting field of 4 drivers:  Tim Evans, Shannon McMasters, Bob Reinhardt and David Obeney finishing in that order.  

The first Spec Miata race for the [[National Auto Sport Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baruth|first1=Jack|date=May 2015|title=Spec-Tacular|journal=[[Road &amp; Track]]|volume=66|issue=8|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in February 2000 by the NorCal Region.  At the national level, the "UPR Racing Supply First Ever Spec Miata National" was held in Avondale, Arizona at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]'s infield road course on April 4th 2005 with Brad Rampelberg  as the "First Ever" National race winner.
Results of the 1st SCCA National Qualifying Race may be googled at: azscca 2006 National Double Double. 
Mike Helpin a local highly respected racer was awarded the 1st place trophy because Brad Rampelberg was disqualified for an undisclosed reason. Brads disqualification was later overturned by a SCCA board. Brad Rampelberg was named winner in later posted results. (may be seen at the above azscca website)
As its name shows, Spec Miata is a "specified" class. This means that the rules for allowable modifications to the car are very strict. The class intends to put drivers on a very even footing by making their cars as identical as possible. The rules are far more conservative than the [[Improved touring|Improved Touring]] category, but provide equivalent safety measures.

Because of the support of Mazda through [[Mazdaspeed]], the wide availability of the car on the used market, plentiful and inexpensive parts, and the simplicity of maintenance on the cars, Spec Miata has become a very popular class. Also adding to the appeal is the fact that A Spec Miata can be raced in both SM and ITA/ITS in SCCA Regional Competition. A typical race-ready spec miata can be purchased on the market for $8000–$35,000 depending on race win history and specific modifications.  A new MX-5 Cup (professional class) based on the ND series MX-5 costs $58,900 new, and champions of the national series can win over $200,000 to advance up the motorsport ladder.

==Class rules==
This section is not an exhaustive set of rules; it is intended to give the reader an idea of the preparation level of the cars in this class.

[[File:Racefab Inc. Spec Miata.jpg|thumb|An example of Spec Miata safety roll cage by [[Racefab Inc.]]]]

Spec Miatas use a specific Bilstein shock with an adjustable coil-over [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] with Eibach springs and adjustable front and rear [[sway bar]]s, steel braided brake lines.

Depending on the region, [[Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Toyo]], [[Kumho Tires|Kumho]], or [[Hankook]] tires are specified. For National competition, the Toyo RA-1 (205/50R15) is the spec tire. Toyo RA-1 is now required in SCCA as of January 1, 2010 though the R-888 may be used until supplies are exhausted. In 2012 [[Hoosier Racing Tire|Hoosier Tires]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=racer.com|title=Hoosier named tire for SCCA National Spec Miata competition beginning in 2012
|url=http://www.racer.com/hoosier-named-tire-for-national-spec-miata-competition-beginning-in-2012/article/209985/|publisher=racer.com|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide the spec tire for all National Events. The wheel size is fixed at 15x7, with the wheels weighing no less than 13 pounds.

Cars with 1.6 liter engines have a race weight of 2300 pounds (1057&amp;nbsp;kg) and first generation cars with a 1.8 liter displacement engine have a minimum race weight of 2350 pounds. "Second generation Miatas" (1999-05) have a minimum weight of 2400 pounds. (These rules as of January 1, 2012)

The 1.8 liter displacement cars may not run an aftermarket air intake and must run a throttle restrictor, while the 1.6 liter displacement cars do not require a restrictor and may run a modified air box. The full rules for the class may be found in the current Spec Miata Category Specifications of the [[SCCA]] rule book, called the GCR (General Competition Rules &amp; Specifications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scca.com/contentpage.aspx?content=44 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221170701/http://www.scca.com/contentpage.aspx?content=44 |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22477">The '''St. Cecilia Society''' of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], named for the traditional [[Saint Cecilia|patron saint of music]], was formed in 1766 as a private subscription concert organization. Over the next fifty-four years, its annual concert series formed the most sophisticated musical phenomenon in North America.

Due to loss of the organization's administrative records during the [[American Civil War]], much inaccurate information about the society has been published. Its important role in the formation of early American musical culture has largely been overlooked.

Although its musical patronage ended in 1820, the St. Cecilia Society continues to flourish today as one of South Carolina's oldest and most exclusive social institutions.

==Origin==
Many writers have labeled Charleston's St. Cecilia Society the first musical society in the [[United States]], but it would be more accurate to describe it as the earliest known private subscription concert organization in [[North America]]. Similar subscription concert organizations, such as the [[Academy of Ancient Music]], abounded in mid-18th-century Britain, and similar subscription series also appeared in [[Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Philadelphia]] in the mid-1760s. Unlike those northern examples that were founded as public commercial ventures run by professional musicians, however, Charleston's St. Cecilia Society was established as a private organization. It was incorporated and administered by gentlemen amateurs, who contracted with professional musicians to present an annual series of private concerts.&lt;ref&gt;The details of the St. Cecilia Society early management and finances are found in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 63-111.&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement not only endowed the society with a more secure financial base, but also ensured its survival beyond the initial generation of founders.

Since the loss of the society's earliest records, its founding date has been the subject of a good deal of speculation and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;The loss of the society's early records is confirmed in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of dates, spanning from as early as 1732 to as late as 1784, has been published in various books and articles over the past century, but the year 1762 is most often cited in reference to the society's origin. Unfortunately, this widely accepted date is grounded on inaccurate information taken from secondary sources. The preponderance of historical evidence, of which there is a considerable amount, clearly places the founding of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society in the year 1766.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed discussion of the historical confusion about the St. Cecilia Society's founding date can be found in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 40-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early membership==
The full list of the early members of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society perished with the rest of its records during the Civil War. Recent efforts to reconstruct the early membership from archival sources have yielded more than two hundred names, which, while representing only a fraction of the membership, allow some general conclusions to be drawn. From the beginning, the St. Cecilia Society's membership included the most prosperous planters, politicians, lawyers, physicians, and merchants in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]].

As with other social organizations and political institutions formed in 18th-century South Carolina, the society's early membership consisted entirely of white Protestant men, the majority of whom were members of the [[Anglican]] or [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;A list of the known members of the society during its first half century, drawn from extant archival sources, is included in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 273-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the example of the numerous subscription concert organizations in late 18th-century Britain, the membership of the St. Cecilia Society was (and still is) open only to men. Women have formed a significant part of the audience at the society's events since 1767, but they have never been considered as members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 21-22, 48-49, 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concert series==
Over the span of 54 years of concert activity, 1766 to 1820, the St. Cecilia Society presented 43 seasons of regular concerts. The eleven years of apparent inactivity were the result of the [[American Revolution]] (eight seasons, autumn 1775 - spring 1783), financial complications (two seasons, autumn 1788 –  spring 1790), and the [[War of 1812]] (one season, autumn 1814 - spring 1815).

While the date of the commencement and termination of each season varied from year to year, the concerts generally began in mid-autumn and continued [[fortnight]]ly through early spring.  The number of concerts each season also varied, but over the course of half a century they averaged at least eight or nine performances per season.&lt;ref&gt;A reconstructed calendar of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts, 1766-1820, is included in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 259-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elegant balls or dancing assemblies replaced the concerts after 1820, but dancing was not a new addition to the society's activities. Beginning with its inaugural season in 1766-67, each concert was followed by several hours of social dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1820, however, dancing assemblies have been the focus of the society's annual events.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, ''Reminiscences of Charleston'', 61; Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience==
A number of music historians have described the St. Cecilia Society's performances as among the earliest public concerts in the United States. This statement is misleading, however, as the society's concerts were never "public" events in the modern American sense of the word. From the beginning, the St. Cecilia concerts were open only to members of the society and their guests, including the ladies of the members' families and invited gentlemen.

The early success of its concerts prompted the society to enact measures to control access to its events. Many of its early rules articulated the eligibility requirements for male guests and expressly prohibited the admission of "boys."&lt;ref&gt;See the discussions of the society's rules and its distribution of tickets for ladies in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 265-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance venues==
In its long history, the St. Cecilia Society has never owned or built its own performance space. During its concert era the society hired eight different venues in Charleston, ranging in size from approximately 1,000 to nearly {{convert|3600|sqft|m2}}. Four of these structures still survive: the Great Room in the [[Exchange and Provost|Exchange Building]], the Long Room of [[McCrady's Tavern and Long Room|McCrady's Tavern]], the [[South Carolina Society Hall]], and the first South Carolina State House (now [[Charleston County Courthouse]]).&lt;ref&gt;All eight of the venues hired by the St. Cecilia Society are discussed in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 113-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1821 and 1861, the society held its events at [[St. Andrew's Hall, Charleston|St. Andrew's Hall]]. After the Civil War it briefly used the South Carolina Society Hall and the [[Deutsche Freundschafts Bund Hall]] (now the home of Charleston's [[Washington Light Infantry]]).

Since the early 1880s, its events have taken place at [[Hibernian Hall (Charleston, South Carolina)|Hibernian Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Each of the numerous invitations in the ''St. Cecilia Society Collection'' at the South Carolina Historical Society, which span from 1841 through the 20th century, names the location of the event.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==
The music at the St. Cecilia Society's concerts was performed by a combination of amateurs and hired professionals. Like the British subscription concert organizations it emulated, the core of the society's early orchestra was drawn from its membership, and seasoned professionals were hired as its treasury grew.

Professional musicians were usually drawn from the local population or recruited through private channels, but in 1771 the society advertised throughout the American colonies and in London to fill several positions, offering contracts for one to three years. On the eve of the American Revolution, the orchestra of the St. Cecilia Society included at least twenty musicians, including gentlemen amateurs and professionals from [[England]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 151-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following several years of rebuilding its forces in the wake of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], the size of the society's orchestra was augmented in 1793 by the opening of the [[Charleston Theatre]], with its seasonally resident orchestra, and the nearly simultaneous arrival of French musicians fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Over the next two decades, the society enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the local theater musicians, many of whom traveled northward for the summer months and performed at other concert series.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 175-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female amateurs and female professionals appeared occasionally at the St. Cecilia Society's concerts, as instrumental or vocal soloists. Professional singers, usually affiliated with the local theater, presented songs from popular English and French stage works. Young lady amateurs, generally performing on the [[harpsichord]], piano, or harp, occasionally played solo works or appeared in small ensembles or as concerto soloists.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous examples of female performers at these concerts are mentioned in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 180-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical repertoire==
Despite the long distance between Charleston and London, the repertoire of the St. Cecilia concerts (as the society's performances were known) generally kept pace with the musical fashions of contemporary Britain. The constant commercial trade between the two cities, augmented by Charleston's fervent desire to follow English fashions, encouraged the importation of musical works by the most "modern" and "fashionable" European composers, or at least the works of composers then favored in [[London]]. Among the composers whose works were heard in Charleston between 1766 and 1820 are [[Carl Friedrich Abel]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Leopold Kozeluch]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Ignaz Pleyel]], and [[Johann Stamitz]].&lt;ref&gt;A complete discussion of the society's musical tastes and the repertoire heard in Charleston is found in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 203-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

London musical fashions did not completely monopolize the concert repertoire heard in Charleston during this period. Thanks to the influx of French musicians in the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]], the works of composers such as [[François Adrien Boieldieu]], Nicolas-Marie [[Dalayrac]], [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]], and [[Étienne Méhul]] were also heard in Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;The influence of French refugees and French repertoire on the content of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts is discussed in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 203-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several of the musicians residing in Charleston during the late 18th and early 19th centuries are known to have composed some music, the St. Cecilia Society made no effort to encourage the creation of a local musical style. Since the society measured its musical success by its ability to replicate contemporary European practices, the cultivation of a "native" musical language would have seemed too provincial for an organization that strove to appear as cosmopolitan as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 206-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with British practices of the day, each of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts included a mix of musical genres. Orchestral works opened and closed each of the "acts" or "parts" of the concert, while a varied succession of concertos, pieces for small instrumental ensembles, and vocal selections filled the rest of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 207-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cessation of concerts==
The termination of the society's concert series in 1820 was motivated by several factors. By 1815, musical fashions in Charleston were changing and enthusiasm for the society's concerts, a conspicuous vestige of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], was in decline. In 1817, the [[Charleston Theatre]] Company initiated a touring circuit which disrupted the society's long-standing practice of sharing musicians with the local theater.

On a number of occasions in the ensuing seasons, the St. Cecilia Society offered balls as last-minute substitutes for concerts when a sufficient number of musicians could not be procured. Finally, the [[Panic of 1819]] unraveled the local economy and induced the organization to curtail its activities. After three increasingly meager seasons, the society held its last regular concert in the spring of 1820 and in subsequent years presented a greatly reduced number of balls.&lt;ref&gt;The multiple causes leading to the termination of the St. Cecilia Society concert series are examined in Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 237-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
The St. Cecilia Society's importance as a musical institution is considerable, although this aspect of the society's heritage it is often overlooked in favor of its relatively more recent notability as an elite social organization. While the society's existence is not unknown to music historians, few details of its concert activity have heretofore been available, to facilitate comparisons with European or other early American musical phenomena. For more than a century, musicologists have been inclined to characterize 18th-century American concert life in general as a "feeble imitation" of European practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sonneck, ''Early Concert-Life in America'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this conclusion, however, Nicholas Butler's recent reconstruction of the St. Cecilia Society's concert era demonstrates the existence of a robust and long-term effort in Charleston to replicate Old World models. It portrays the society as the most significant example of concert patronage in the United States before the advent of the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo'', 253-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memories of the society's musical heritage soon faded after its records were lost during the Civil War, and subsequent writers have focused on the society's social activities and the glamour of its annual debutante ball. At the end of the 19th century, many Charlestonians began to view the St. Cecilia Society as a valuable link to their city's "golden age" of prosperity in the preceding century.

On the other hand, to many observers the St. Cecilia Society stood as a symbol of Charleston's rigid insularity and its resistance to a broader democratic philosophy. Despite such friction, inclusion in the society's activities is still widely believed to represent the achievement of the ultimate insider status in Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''New Men, New Cities, New South'', 240-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The earliest-known published description of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society and its legacy of musical patronage is found in [[Charles Fraser (artist)]]'s ''Reminiscences of Charleston'' (first published in 1854), which contains a brief but highly influential synopsis of the history of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, ''Reminiscences of Charleston'', 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Fraser (1782–1860) was admitted as a society member in 1803, and his father, Alexander Fraser, had been among the founding members, his 1854 account of concert activities is vague and contains factual errors. Nevertheless, his description of the St. Cecilia Society's concert era has been cited and repeated by numerous authors as the definitive (and only) published first-person account of this early American musical phenomenon.

Oscar Sonneck's influential text, ''Early Concert-Life in America'' (1907), was the first scholarly publication to acknowledge the musical prominence of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society, but Sonneck lamented that their early history appeared to have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Sonneck, ''Early Concert-Life in America'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century musicologists repeated Sonneck's assessment without adding further insight or additional detail.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Howard, ''Our American Music'', 26; Chase, ''America's Music'', 95; Davis, ''A History of Music in American Life'', 1: 49–50; Hamm, ''Music in the New World'', 98; Hindman, "Concert Life in Ante Bellum Charleston," 89-96; Bagdon, "Musical Life In Charleston, South Carolina, from 1732 to 1776 As Recorded In Colonial Sources," 174-84; Crawford, ''America's Musical Life'', 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of musicological circles, [[Harriott Horry Ravenel]]'s ''Charleston: The Place and the People'' (1906) was the first local history text to offer a glimpse into the St. Cecilia Society's past. Despite having attended the society's balls since the early 1850s, Mrs. Ravenel's assessment of the concert era is based entirely upon Charles Fraser's earlier synopsis.

In the course of the 20th century, scores of books and articles about Charleston and its cultural heritage have included mention of the St. Cecilia Society. With very little deviation, such works echo the words of Fraser, Sonneck, and/or Ravenel; they do not offer new factual information.&lt;ref&gt;The most recently published example is James Hutchison's 2006 article, "The Rites of St. Cecilia," which contains many historically inaccurate statements.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Butler's recently published monograph, ''Votaries of Apollo: the St. Cecilia Society and the Patronage of Concert Music in Charleston, South Carolina, 1766–1820'' (2007), represents the first scholarly effort to reconstruct the details of the group's 54 years of concert activity. It is based upon extant archival materials from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Current activity==
Between the cessation of its concert patronage in 1820 and the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the St. Cecilia Society continued its activities by presenting an annual series of three or four elegant balls. The economic downturn of the 1930s induced the society to limit its seasonal activities to a single ball, and this pattern has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;See the extant invitations in the "St. Cecilia Society Collection" at the South Carolina Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first century, the St. Cecilia Society's membership included the gentlemen of Charleston's socio-economic elite---a group that included representatives of a broad range of professions and backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Votaries of Apollo,'' 273-78&lt;/ref&gt; As the city's population expanded and more men sought to be included in this prestigious organization, the society established new restrictions on membership in an effort to prevent its events from swelling to an unmanageable size. For more than a century now, the society has limited its membership to the male descendants of earlier members---a move that has effectively closed the organization to anyone without deep roots in Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph W. Barnwell's discussion of his experiences in the St. Cecilia Society between the mid-1870s and the late 1920s in his unpublished memoirs, "Joseph W. Barnwell Papers," South Carolina Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Cecilia Society continues to flourish in the 21st century, but two hundred years of social change have sapped much of its original vitality. Due to its popular reputation as an "ancient," hyper-exclusive organization, the group is frequently portrayed in the media as an exaggerated romantic [[synecdoche]] for the historic "charm" of the city of Charleston. The modern St. Cecilia Society of Charleston strives to eschew public notice, however, as it attempts to preserve its narrowly defined, time-honored cultural traditions.

'''''The Stand''''' is a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Horror fiction|horror]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel by American author [[Stephen King]]. It expands upon the scenario of his earlier short story "[[Night Surf]]" and outlines the total breakdown of society after the accidental release of a strain of [[influenza]] that had been modified for [[biological warfare]] causes an apocalyptic [[pandemic]], which kills off the majority of the world's human population. King dedicated the book to his wife, [[Tabitha King|Tabitha]]: "For Tabby: This dark chest of wonders."

== Plot ==
Note that depending upon the edition of the novel, the dates of ''The Stand'' occur in either 1980–1981, 1985–1986, or 1990–1991.

===''Captain Trips''===

June 16 – July 4

At a remote [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] base, a [[biological warfare|weaponized]] strain of [[influenza]] known as "Project Blue" is accidentally released inside a secret underground laboratory. Charles Campion, a soldier charged with security, manages to escape from the base by car with his wife and child. By the time the Army tracks Campion down to the East Texas town of Arnette and establishes a [[cordon sanitaire]] around it, he as [[Index case|patient zero]] has already died of the Project Blue virus and spread it to numerous others beyond the cordon. The virus is extremely contagious and resistant to antibodies and vaccines. A [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions is triggered, which eventually kills off 99.4% of the world's human population.

As the pandemic intensifies it gains many names, "Captain Trips" and the superflu being the most used. A multi-faceted narrative—told partly from the perspective of primary characters—outlines the total breakdown and destruction of society through widespread violence; the failure of [[martial law]] to contain the outbreak; the military's increasingly violent efforts to censor information; the rapid collapse of society; the deliberate exposure of the virus in the Soviet Union and China to guarantee their destruction as well and, finally, the near-extinction of humanity. The emotional toll is also dealt with, as the few survivors must care for their families and friends, dealing with confusion and grief as virtually everyone they know succumbs to the disease.

The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition opens with a prologue entitled "The Circle Opens" that offers greater detail into the circumstances surrounding the development of the virus and the security breach that allowed its escape from the secret laboratory compound where it was created. It also expands upon the Army's response to the outbreak; scenes of civil unrest, looting, and vigilantism; and deaths caused not by the pandemic itself, but by the resulting collapse of society.

===''On the Border''===

July 5 – September 6

Intertwining cross-country odysseys are undertaken by a small number of survivors in three parties, all drawn together by circumstances and their shared dreams of a 108-year-old woman in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]],&lt;ref&gt;King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19–20, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; whom they see as an embodiment of good. The woman, Abagail Freemantle—better known as "Mother Abagail"—becomes the spiritual leader for the survivors. Mother Abagail directs them to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where they struggle to re-establish a democratic society called the "Free Zone".

Meanwhile, another group of survivors is drawn to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] by [[Randall Flagg]], an evil being with supernatural powers. Flagg's governance is brutally tyrannical, using gruesome methods of torture and execution to quell dissent. Flagg's group is able to quickly reorganize its society, restore power to Las Vegas, and rebuild the city with the many technical professionals who have migrated there. Flagg's group launches a weapons program, searching what remains of the United States for suitable arms.

Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold Lauder and Nadine Cross, who are disaffected Free Zone inhabitants tempted by Flagg, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return.

The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition expands on a character seen only in flashbacks in the original novel: The Kid, modeled after spree killer [[Charles Starkweather]]. The Kid travels west through Colorado with the Trashcan Man, one of Flagg's recruited henchmen. He states to the Trashcan Man that he intends to kill Flagg and take over as leader in Las Vegas when he arrives. In response, Flagg causes a pack of wolves to descend on the two travelers, allowing the Trashcan Man to flee unharmed, but the wolves kill The Kid after a standoff. Stu Redman's party, which is sent to Vegas later in the novel, find The Kid's remains and dub him "The Wolfman".

===''The Stand''===

September 7 – January 10

The stage is now set for the final confrontation as Flagg's group becomes aware of the threat from the Free Zone. There is no pitched battle, however. Instead, at Mother Abagail's dying behest, four of the five surviving members of the leadership committee—Glen Bateman, Stu Redman, Ralph Brentner, and Larry Underwood—set off on foot towards Las Vegas on an expedition to confront Flagg. Stu breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen.

The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd Henreid, Flagg's second-in-command. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Brentner and Underwood. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a stolen [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand—"The Hand of God"—which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph.

The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of a baby by Stu's love interest, Frances Goldsmith. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to a live baby, Stu returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by dog Kojak and then by Tom Cullen, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. The original edition of the novel ends with Fran and Stu questioning whether the human race can learn from its mistakes. The answer, given in the last line, is ambiguous: "I don't know."

The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition follows this with a brief [[epilogue]], "The Circle Closes", which leaves a darker impression. While Stu, Fran, and baby Peter leave Boulder and return to Fran's hometown in Maine to establish a home front in the east, an [[amnesia]]-stricken Flagg wakes up on a beach on an unknown island, having somehow escaped the atomic blast in Vegas by using his dark magic to teleport away at the last second. There he begins recruiting adherents among a pre-literate, dark-skinned people, who worship him as a deity.

==Characters==
{{Main article|List of The Stand characters}}

== Background ==
In his non-fiction book [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], Stephen King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because "it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions".

The author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote—just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''–type story in a contemporary American setting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a long time—ten years, at least—I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

King nearly abandoned ''The Stand'' due to [[writer's block]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast in order to do this.

== Publication history ==

The novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The book was later re-released in 1990 as ''The Stand: The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition''; King restored some text originally cut for brevity, added and revised sections, changed the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of the story to 1990, and updated a few [[pop culture]] references accordingly. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.

In 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as "The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition". Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he cut approximately 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete &amp; Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. This edition, known as the "Coffin Box" edition due to the book being housed in a wooden case, was signed by King and Wrightson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/lifetimes/king-stand.html |title=ARMAGEDDON, COMPLETE AND UNCUT|date=1997-03-09| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veryfinebooks.com/Stephen_King_The_Stand_Signed_First_Edition_p/sk200.htm |title=Stephen King The Stand Signed Limited Coffin Edition |publisher=VeryFineBooks.com |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedarktower.org/palaver/showwiki.php?title=Stand+The+-+S+L |title=Stand, The – S/L – Palaver |publisher=Thedarktower.org |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''The Stand'' was nominated for the [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novel]] in 1979, and was adapted into both a [[The Stand (miniseries)|television miniseries]] for ABC and a [[The Stand (comics)|graphic novel]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref name="rama1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWE-1979"&gt;{{cite web

==Adaptations==

=== Film and television ===

A movie adaptation of ''The Stand'' was in [[development hell]] for over ten years. During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not "want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time." Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF "THE STAND" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries for television]]. King wrote a new screenplay (toned down slightly for television). The [[The Stand (miniseries)|miniseries]] was broadcast in 1994, directed by [[Mick Garris]], and starring such actors as [[Gary Sinise]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Laura San Giacomo]], [[Jamey Sheridan]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]] and [[Shawnee Smith]], with notable cameos including [[John Landis]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Sam Raimi]] and King himself. Parts of the miniseries were shot in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah State Prison]], [[Sundance Resort|Sundance]], [[Orem]], [[Provo Canyon]] and [[Salina, Utah|Salina]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Wanderers''' is a novel by [[Ingrid Rimland]] published in 1977 loosely based upon her own experiences from growing up in a [[Mennonite]] community in the Ukraine. Rimland wanted to write a novel about her people, and ''The Wanderers'' tells the story of the plight of Mennonite women caught in the social upheavals of revolution and war. The novel traces the decimation of a pacifist people during the Russian Revolution, anarchy, famine, the Stalinist purges, escape from the Ukraine, and eventual resettlement in the rain forests of Paraguay.

The novel remains Rimland's most acclaimed book. It earned her the California Literature Medal Award for best fiction in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Martens, [http://www.directionjournal.org/article/?302 Book review: The Wanderers], ''Direction'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C.

'''''To Pay the Price''''' is a 2009 play by [[Peter-Adrian Cohen]] based in part on the letters of Israeli hero [[Yonatan Netanyahu]], who was killed in action during [[Operation Entebbe]] at [[Entebbe]] airport, by [[Uganda]]n soldiers, when the Israeli military rescued hostages after an aircraft hijacking by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorists.  Netanyahu was the leader of the assault, and the only Israeli military fatality of the raid.

The play, produced by North Carolina's Theatre Or &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatreor.com/&lt;/ref&gt; opened off-off Broadway in New York in June 2009 during the ''Festival of Jewish Theater and Ideas.'''&lt;ref&gt;Untitled Theater Co #61's Fest Of Jewish Theater &amp; Ideas Runs 5/20-6/14 In NYC , Broadway World, May 20, 2009 [http://broadwayworld.com/article/Untitled_Theater_Co_61s_Fest_Of_Jewish_Theater_Ideas_Runs_520614_In_NYC_20090520]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Netanyahu's letters, the playwright drew on interviews he conducted with Netanyahu's friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;''When all Israelis were heroes and the world looked up to them,'' Miriam Rinn, Jewish Standard, June 5, 2009 [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HdJNunHO4hEJ:www.jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/when_all_israelis_were_heroes_and_the_world_looked_up_to_them/8557+%22to+pay+the+price%22+netanyahu&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''To Pay the Price by Peter-Adrian Cohen.

The play had been scheduled to run at the [[New Repertory Theatre]] company near Boston, Massachusetts.  The run was canceled by the [[Netanyahu]] family because the theater was intending to run the play as a companion piece to ''[[My Name is Rachel Corrie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/05/09/under_pressure_new_rep_cancels_play/ Under pressure, New Rep cancels play, Boston Globe, May 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Formula Three Championship''' was a short-lived [[Formula Three]] championship contested in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Sanctioned by the [[Sports Car Club of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Racing to sanction U.S. Formula Three|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/scca-pro-racing-to-sanction-u-s-formula-three/?v=2&amp;y=1999&amp;s=1&amp;i=20|work=Press release|accessdate=24 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68eEUEYwb?url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/scca-pro-racing-to-sanction-u-s-formula-three/?v=2&amp;y=1999&amp;s=1&amp;i=20|archivedate=24 June 2012|date=18 August 1999|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series lasted for two seasons, 2000 and 2001.  All teams used [[Volkswagen]] engines tuned by Bertils Racing Engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Örnerdal|editor-first=Stefan|title=Formula 3 2000 Championship Tables|url=http://www.formula2.net/F300_Tables.htm|work=Formula2.net|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=11 August 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68M3rymHs?url=http://www.formula2.net/F300_Tables.htm|archivedate=12 June 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was plagued by low car counts; no more than 6 cars contested races in the inaugural season. In 2001, fields were bolstered by [[Formula Ford]], [[Formula Continental]], and even [[Sports 2000]] and historic [[Formula 5000]] cars, as no race had more than 3 Formula Three cars on the grid.  14 of the series' 19 races were won by [[Brazil]]ian driver [[Luciano Gomide]].  A 2002 season was planned with 13 races, including a doubleheader supporting the [[2002 United States Grand Prix]], but was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 USF3 tentative schedule|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-2002-usf3-tentative-schedule/?v=2&amp;y=2001&amp;s=1&amp;i=3|work=Press release|accessdate=24 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68eFq0Rkd?url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-2002-usf3-tentative-schedule/?v=2&amp;y=2001&amp;s=1&amp;i=3|archivedate=24 June 2012|date=5 December 2001|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000 season==
The 2000 season was contested over 11 races at 6 race meetings.  The schedule initially included two [[oval track racing|oval races]] at [[Indianapolis Raceway Park]] and [[Irwindale Speedway]], but these were later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US-F3 Schedule Announced|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-us-f3-schedule-announced/?v=2&amp;y=1999&amp;s=1&amp;i=1|work=Press release|accessdate=24 June 2012|date=10 December 1999|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68eClNDco?url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-us-f3-schedule-announced/?v=2&amp;y=1999&amp;s=1&amp;i=1|archivedate=24 June 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irwindale event cancelled|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-irwindale-event-cancelled/?v=2&amp;y=2000&amp;s=1&amp;i=25|work=Press release|accessdate=24 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68eEj4g14?url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-irwindale-event-cancelled/?v=2&amp;y=2000&amp;s=1&amp;i=25|archivedate=24 June 2012|date=17 September 2000|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The round at San Diego was a joint race with the [[Mexican Formula Three Championship]], although the Mexican series ran with older, slower machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest filed heads to San Diego GP|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-largest-filed-heads-to-san-diego-gp/?v=2&amp;y=2000&amp;s=1&amp;i=15|work=Press release|accessdate=24 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68eF0Sbjd?url=http://www.motorsport.com/f3/news/usf3-largest-filed-heads-to-san-diego-gp/?v=2&amp;y=2000&amp;s=1&amp;i=15|archivedate=24 June 2012|date=31 October 2000|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stuart Crow]] won the championship by 5 points over [[Luciano Gomide]].

The '''WARM Festival''' is an international [[arts]] and [[human rights]] [[festival]] held annually in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. &lt;ref&gt;The First World WARM Festival: http://www.warmfoundation.org/warm-festival-2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Libyan Rebels Fly to Bosnia to see Revolution Film'', AP: http://www.warmfoundation.org/news/libyan-rebels-fly-to-bosnia-to-see-revolution-film-ap&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WARM Festival 2015: http://www.warmfoundation.org/warm-festival-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Telling their story: reflections on war'', Insight on Conflict : http://www.insightonconflict.org/2015/05/telling-their-story-reflections-on-war/&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the [[WARM (Foundation)|WARM Foundation]] in 2014. Its main focus is on bringing awareness to contemporary armed conflicts through the mediums of war reporting and war art. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warmfoundation.org/mission|title=Warm Festival Mission|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[WARM (Foundation)|WARM Foundation]] was established in 2013 by French journalist and [[war correspondent]], [[Rémy Ourdan]] &lt;ref&gt;WARM: http://www.warmfoundation.org/mission&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;WARM Launch Press Release: http://www.warmfoundation.org/news/2013-04-08-warm-launch-press-release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''War Reporters Network Launches in Sarajevo'', BIRN: http://www.warmfoundation.org/news/war-reporters-network-launches-in-sarajevo-denis-dzidic-balkan-insight-birn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The WARM Foundation: Telling the Story of Modern War'', The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kj-wetherholt/the-warm-foundation_b_3857148.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Telling their Story: Reflections on War'', PCRC blog: http://p-crc.org/telling-their-story-reflections-on-war/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026181804/http://p-crc.org/telling-their-story-reflections-on-war/ |date=2014-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, who had covered the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] and other chapters of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] for the French daily newspaper [[Le Monde]], before covering the [[Rwandan genocide]], the [[Sierra Leone civil war]] and the wars in the [[Middle East]]. On 6 April 2012 - the 20th anniversary of the start of the Siege of Sarajevo, he organized a reunion called "Sarajevo 2012" &lt;ref&gt;Sarajevo 2012: http://www.warmfoundation.org/project/sarajevo-2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarajevo 2012: http://www.remyourdan.com/otherworks/2012-04-06-sarajevo-2012/&lt;/ref&gt;, which was attended by hundreds of war reporters that had covered it. &lt;ref&gt;''It’s not hard to fall in love for Sarajevo'', Radio Sarajevo: http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost/77110/# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102081921/http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost/77110/ |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarajevo was The Story Of Their Lives'', The Cutting Edge: http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=72788&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gary Knight, Jon Jones, Tom Stoddart and Rémy Ourdan revisit Bosnia'', Canon Professional Network: http://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/interviews/gary_knight_and_jon_jones_revisit_bosnia.do&lt;/ref&gt; The reunion was a precursor to the foundation which was established 9 months later, and founded the festival on the 100th anniversary of the start of the [[First World War]] in 2014. The first edition was held in May and June of the same year and hosted numerous international historians, journalists, photographers and artists including French cartoonist [[Plantu]], German film director [[Marcel Mettelsiefen]], Syrian filmmaker [[Ossama Mohammed]], photojournalist [[Camille Lepage]] who was killed one month later covering the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|conflict in the Central African Republic]] and others. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warmfoundation.org/warm-festival-2014|title=Warm Festival 2014|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has subsequently become an annual affair and gathers the biggest names in international war correspondence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warmfoundation.org/warm-festival-2017|title=Warm Festival 2017|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The festival is held either in May and June or June and July of each year and lasts for 6 days. It is composed of numerous conferences, photography exhibitions, film screenings, workshops and panel discussions. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="176973">In [[healthcare]], the '''weekend effect''' is the finding of a difference in [[mortality rate]] for patients admitted to hospital for treatment at the [[weekend]] compared to those admitted on a weekday. The effects of the weekend on patient outcomes has been a concern since the late 1970s, and a ‘weekend effect’ is now well documented. Although this is a controversial area, the balance of opinion is that the weekend (and bank holidays) have a deleterious effect on patient care (and specifically increase mortality)—based on the larger studies that have been carried out. Variations in the outcomes for patients treated for many acute and chronic conditions have been studied.

==Published research: Non-disease specific (unselected) patients==

[[File:Bray et al 2014, Adjusted hazard ratio of 30-d mortality of patients admitted on weekends, by ratio of registered nurses per ten beds on the weekend.tif|thumb|right|This figure shows the change in mortality for stroke patients over 30 days in a UK sample as the number of nurses relative to the number of beds in the hospital changes, adjusting for various covariates.]]

===Medical patients===

Schmulewitz et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16411359 | volume=5 | issue=6 | title=The impact of weekends on outcome for emergency patients | author=Schmulewitz L, Proudfoot A, Bell D | journal=Clin Med (Lond) | pages=621–5 | doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.5-6-621 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK in 2005, studied 3,244 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular accidents, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, collapse and upper gastrointestinal bleed. They found "Weekend admission was not associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality, readmission rates or increased length of stay compared to the weekday equivalent for any of the six conditions".

However, in 2010, Clarke et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19811554 | doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02067.x | volume=40 | issue=11 | title=Exploratory study of the 'weekend effect' for acute medical admissions to public hospitals in Queensland, Australia | author=Clarke MS, Wills RA, Bowman RV, Zimmerman PV, Fong KM, Coory MD, Yang IA | journal=Intern Med J | pages=777–83 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a much larger Australian study of 54,625 mixed medical/surgical non-elective admissions showed a significant weekend effect (i.e. worse mortality) for acute myocardial infarction. Marco et al. (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20484660 | doi=10.1177/1062860610366031 | volume=25 | issue=4 | title=Analysis of the mortality of patients admitted to internal medicine wards over the weekend | author=Marco J, Barba R, Plaza S, Losa JE, Canora J, Zapatero A | journal=Am J Med Qual | pages=312–8 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a US study of 429,880 internal medical admissions showed that death within 2 days after admission was significantly higher for a weekend admission, when compared to a weekday one (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.22-1.33). In the same year, in an Irish study of 25,883 medical admissions (Mikulich et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22111090 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=The increased mortality associated with a weekend emergency admission is due to increased illness severity and altered case-mix | author=Mikulich O, Callaly E, Bennett K, O'Riordan D, Silke B | journal=Acute Med | pages=182–7 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), patients admitted at the weekend had an approximate 11% increased 30-day in-hospital mortality, compared with a weekday admission; although this was not statistically significant either before or after risk adjustment. Thus the authors pointed out that "admission at the weekend was not independently predictive in a risk model that included Illness Severity (age and biochemical markers) and co-morbidity".

There is some evidence for intervention from physicians, in an attempt to address this issue. Bell et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23613858 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0061476 | volume=8 | issue=4 | title=Consultant input in acute medical admissions and patient outcomes in hospitals in England: a multivariate analysis | pmc=3629209 | author=Bell D, Lambourne A, Percival F, Laverty AA, Ward DK | journal=PLOS ONE | pages=e61476 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, surveyed  91 acute hospital sites in England to evaluate systems of consultant cover for acute medical admissions. An 'all inclusive' pattern of consultant working, incorporating all guideline recommendations (and which included the minimum consultant presence of 4 hours per day) was associated with reduced excess weekend mortality (p&lt;0.05).

In 2014, it was shown in a huge US study, that the presence of resident trainee doctors (and nurses) may also be of benefit (Ricciardi, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24397268 | doi=10.1186/1472-6920-14-4 | volume=14 | title=Is the presence of medical trainees associated with increased mortality with weekend admission? | pmc=3926858 | author=Ricciardi R, Nelson J, Roberts PL, Marcello PW, Read TE, Schoetz DJ | journal=BMC Med Educ | pages=4 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In this study of 48,253,968 medical patients, the relative risk of mortality was 15% higher following weekend admission as compared to weekday admission. This is currently the largest known study in this area. After adjusting for diagnosis, age, sex, race, income level, payer, comorbidity, and weekend admission, the overall odds of mortality was higher for patients in hospitals with fewer nurses and staff physicians. Mortality following a weekend admission for patients admitted to a hospital with resident trainees was significantly higher (17%) than hospitals with no resident trainees (p&lt;0.001).

In the following year, Vest-Hansen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25762233 | doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006731 | volume=5 | issue=3 | title=Out-of-hours and weekend admissions to Danish medical departments: admission rates and 30-day mortality for 20 common medical conditions | pmc=4360838 | author=Vest-Hansen B, Riis AH, Sørensen HT, Christiansen CF | journal=BMJ Open | pages=e006731 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in a whole nation study, in Denmark—studied 174,192 acute medical patients. The age-standardised and sex-standardised 30-day mortality rate was 5.1% (95% CI 5.0-5.3) after admission during weekday office hours, 5.7% (95% CI 5.5-6.0) after admission during weekday (out of hours), 6.4% (95% CI 6.1-6.7) after admission during weekend daytime hours, and 6.3% (95% CI 5.9-6.8) after admission during weekend night-time hours. In 2016, Huang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26871788 | doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000002643 | volume=95 | issue=6 | title=Effect of Weekend Admissions on the Treatment Process and Outcomes of Internal Medicine Patients: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study | pmc=4753883 | author=Huang CC, Huang YT, Hsu NC, Chen JS, Yu CJ | journal=Medicine (Baltimore) | pages=e2643 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Taiwan, studied 82,340 patients, admitted to the internal medicine departments of 17 medical centres. Patients admitted at the weekend had higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.09-1.30; p &lt; 0.001).

In a 2016 study of 12 Italian Acute Medical Units, Ambrosi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27155980 | doi=10.1007/s40520-016-0576-8 | title=In-hospital elderly mortality and associated factors in 12 Italian acute medical units: findings from an exploratory longitudinal study | author=Ambrosi E, De Togni S, Guarnier A, Barelli P, Zambiasi P, Allegrini E, Bazoli L, Casson P, Marin M, Padovan M, Picogna M, Taddia P, Salmaso D, Chiari P, Frison T, Marognolli O, Canzan F, Saiani L, Palese A | journal=Aging Clin Exp Res | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=517–527 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that elderly patients were six times (95% CI 3.6-10.8) more likely at risk of dying at weekends. They also found that "those with one or more ED admissions in the last 3 months were also at increased risk of dying (RR = 1.360, 95% CI 1.02-1.81) as well as those receiving more care from family carers (RR = 1.017, 95% CI 1.001–1.03). At the nursing care level, those patient receiving less care by Registered Nurses (RNs) at weekends were at increased risk of dying (RR = 2.236, 95% CI 1.27-3.94) while those receiving a higher skill-mix, thus indicating that more nursing care was offered by RNs instead of Nursing Auxiliaries{{sic?|hide=y}} were at less risk of dying (RR = 0.940, 95% CI = 0.91-0.97)."

Conway et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=28069914 | doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcw219 | volume=110 | issue=5 | title=Survival analysis of weekend emergency medical admissions | year=2017 | author=Conway R, Cournane S, Byrne D, O'Riordan D, Silke B | journal=QJM | pages=291–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017, studied of 44,628 Irish medical patients. Weekend admissions had an increased mortality of 5.0%, compared with weekday admissions of 4.5%. Survival curves showed no mortality difference at 28 days (P = 0.21) but a difference at 90 days (P = 0.05).

The effects of the introduction of a 7-day consultant service have been investigated in medical patients. In 2015, Leong et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27070886 | doi=10.4997/JRCPE.2015.402 | volume=45 | issue=4 | title=A retrospective study of seven-day consultant working: reductions in mortality and length of stay | author=Leong KS, Titman A, Brown M, Powell R, Moore E, Bowen-Jones D | journal=J R Coll Physicians Edinb | pages=261–7 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied elderly medical patients in the UK; noting admission numbers increasing from 6,304 (November 2011-July 2012) to 7,382 (November 2012-July 2013), with no change in acuity score. They stated that the "introduction of seven-day consultant working was associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality from 11.4% to 8.8% (p&lt;0.001)". Weekend discharges increased from general medical wards (from 13.6% to 18.8%, p&lt;0.001) but did not increase from elderly medicine wards.

In December 2016, another study found that reports of higher weekend mortality rates were based on administrative databases with incomplete information about the clinical state of patients on admission, and that studies that used better data found no greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2594727|title=Higher Mortality in Weekend Admissions to the Hospital : True, False, or Uncertain?|publisher=Journal of the American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical patients===
'''''Non-elective (emergency) Patients'''''
There have been many similar studies (with similar conclusions) in surgery. In the US, in a very large study in 2011, 29,991,621 non-elective general surgical hospital admissions were studied (Ricciardi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21576609 | doi=10.1001/archsurg.2011.106 | volume=146 | issue=5 | title=Mortality rate after nonelective hospital admission | author=Ricciardi R, Roberts PL, Read TE, Baxter NN, Marcello PW, Schoetz DJ | journal=Arch Surg | pages=545–51 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Inpatient mortality was reported as 2.7% for weekend and 2.3% for weekday admissions (p&lt;0.001). Regression analysis revealed significantly higher mortality during weekends for 15 of the 26 (57.7%) major diagnostic categories. The weekend effect remained, and mortality was noted to be 10.5% higher during weekends compared with weekdays after adjusting for all other variables.

In another huge US study in 2016 (Ricciardi et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26265383 | doi=10.1016/j.jss.2015.07.030 | volume=200 | issue=1 | title=Do patient safety indicators explain increased weekend mortality? | author=Ricciardi R, Nelson J, Francone TD, Roberts PL, Read TE, Hall JF, Schoetz DJ, Marcello PW | journal=J Surg Res | pages=164–70 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016), 28,236,749 non-elective surgical patients were evaluated, with 428,685 (1.5%) experiencing one or more Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) events. The rate of PSI was the same for patients admitted on weekends as compared to weekdays (1.5%). However, the risk of mortality was 7% higher if a PSI event occurred to a patient admitted on a weekend, as compared with a weekday. In addition, compared to patients admitted on weekdays, patients admitted on weekends had a 36% higher risk of postoperative wound dehiscence, 19% greater risk of death in a low-mortality diagnostic-related group, 19% increased risk of postoperative hip fracture, and 8% elevated risk of surgical inpatient death.

Also in 2016, Ozdemir et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26675949 | doi=10.1093/bja/aev372 | volume=116 | issue=1 | title=Mortality of emergency general surgical patients and associations with hospital structures and processes | author=Ozdemir BA, Sinha S, Karthikesalingam A, Poloniecki JD, Pearse RM, Grocott MP, Thompson MM, Holt PJ | journal=Br J Anaesth | pages=54–62 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 294,602 surgical emergency admissions to 156 NHS Trusts (hospital systems) in the UK, with a 30-day mortality of 4.2%. Trust-level mortality rates for this cohort ranged from 1.6 to 8.0%. The lowest mortality rates were observed in hospitals with higher levels of medical and nursing staffing, and a greater number of operating theatres and critical care beds relative to provider size. Higher mortality rates were seen in patients admitted to hospital at weekends [OR = 1.11; 95% CI 1.06-1.17; p&lt;0.0001], in hospitals with fewer general surgical doctors [OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.13; p=0.019] and with lower nursing staff ratios [OR = 1.0; 95% CI 1.01-1.13; p=0.024].

McLean et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26892599 | doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.02.044 | volume=28 | title=A 15-year retrospective analysis of the epidemiology and outcomes for elderly emergency general surgical admissions in the North East of England: A case for multidisciplinary geriatric input | author=McLean RC, McCallum IJ, Dixon S, O'Loughlin P | journal=Int J Surg | pages=13–21 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, also in 2016, studied 105,002 elderly (≥70 years) emergency general surgical admissions. Factors associated with increased 30-day in-hospital mortality were increasing age and Charlson score, admissions directly from clinic, operations undertaken at the weekend, and patients admitted earlier in the study period.

'''''Elective patients'''''
The effect is not just seen in non-elective surgical patients. Aylin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23716356 | volume=346 | title=Day of week of procedure and 30 day mortality for elective surgery: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics | pmc=3665889 | year=2013 | journal=BMJ | pages=f2424 | author=Aylin P, Alexandrescu R, Jen MH, Mayer EK, Bottle A | doi=10.1136/bmj.f2424}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013) in the UK, investigated 27,582 deaths (within 30 days) after 4,133,346 inpatient admissions for elective operating room procedures; overall crude mortality rate was 6.7 per 1000). The adjusted odds of death were 44% and 82% higher, respectively, if the procedures were carried out on a Friday (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.39-1.50) or a weekend (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.71-1.94) compared with a Monday.

In a Canadian study (McIsaac et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24783992 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0000000000000137 | volume=52 | issue=6 | title=Elective, major noncardiac surgery on the weekend: a population-based cohort study of 30-day mortality | author=McIsaac DI, Bryson GL, van Walraven C | journal=Med Care | pages=557–64 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014), 333,344 elective surgical patients were studied, of whom 2826 died within 30 days of surgery; overall crude mortality rate was 8.5 deaths per 1000. Undergoing elective surgery on the weekend was associated with a 1.96 times higher odds of 30-day mortality than weekday surgery (95% CI 1.36-2.84). This significant increase in the odds of postoperative mortality was confirmed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.19-1.92).

'''''Both non-elective and elective patients'''''
Mohammed et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22471933 | doi=10.1186/1472-6963-12-87 | volume=12 | title=Weekend admission to hospital has a higher risk of death in the elective setting than in the emergency setting: a retrospective database study of national health service hospitals in England | pmc=3341193 | author=Mohammed MA, Sidhu KS, Rudge G, Stevens AJ | journal=BMC Health Serv Res | pages=87 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 in the UK, compared elective and non-elective admissions, in terms of day of admission. The mortality for non-elective patients following weekday admission was 0.52% (7,276/1,407,705), compared with 0.77% (986/127,562) following weekend admission.  Of the 3,105,249 emergency admissions, 76.3% (2,369,316) were admitted on a weekday and 23.7% (735,933) were admitted at the weekend. The mortality following emergency weekday admission was 6.53% compared to 7.06% following weekend admission. After case-mix adjustment, weekend admissions were associated with an increased risk of death, especially in the elective setting (elective OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.23- 1.41; vs emergency OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13).

In a 2016 Australian study (Singla et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26424504 | doi=10.1111/ans.13315 | volume=86 | issue=1–2 | title=No weak days? Impact of day in the week on surgical mortality | author=Singla AA, Guy GS, Field JB, Ma N, Babidge WJ, Maddern GJ | journal=ANZ J Surg | pages=15–20 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), of 7718 elective and non-elective patients, it was shown that unadjusted and adjusted odds of early surgical mortality was higher on the weekend, compared to weekdays (unadjusted and adjusted OR = 1.30 (p&lt;0.001) and 1.19 (p=0.026), respectively). When separated by day of week, there was a trend for higher surgical mortality on Friday, Saturday and Sunday vs all other days, although this did not reach statistical significance.

In the US, also in 2016, Glance et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27111750 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0000000000000532 | volume=54 | issue=6 | title=Outcomes are Worse in US Patients Undergoing Surgery on Weekends Compared With Weekdays | author=Glance LG, Osler T, Li Y, Lustik SJ, Eaton MP, Dutton RP, Dick AW | journal=Med Care | pages=608–15 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study of 305,853 elective and non-elective surgical patients; undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery, colorectal surgery, open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and lower extremity revascularisation. After controlling for patient risk and surgery type, weekend elective surgery (OR = 3.18; 95% CI 2.26-4.49; p&lt;0.001) and weekend urgent surgery (OR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.68-2.66; p&lt;0.001) were associated with a higher risk of death compared with weekday surgery. Weekend elective (OR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.29-1.93; p&lt;0.001) and weekend urgent surgery (OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.42-1.82; p&lt;0.001) were also associated with a higher risk of major complications compared with weekday surgery.

===Emergency department (ED) patients===

ED admissions have also been well studied. The first major study was published in 2001 by Bell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11547721 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa003376 | volume=345 | issue=9 | title=Mortality among patients admitted to hospitals on weekends as compared with weekdays | author=Bell CM, Redelmeier DA | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=663–8 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Canadian study, 3,789,917 ED admissions were analysed. Weekend admissions were associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates than weekday admissions among patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (42% vs 36%, p&lt;0.001), acute epiglottitis (1.7% vs 0.3%, p=0.04), and pulmonary embolism (13% vs 11%, p=0.009).

In another Canadian study (Cram et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15276592 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.02.035 | volume=117 | issue=3 | title=Effects of weekend admission and hospital teaching status on in-hospital mortality | author=Cram P, Hillis SL, Barnett M, Rosenthal GE | journal=Am J Med | pages=151–7 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2004), 641,860 admissions from the ED were investigated.  The adjusted odds of death for patients admitted on weekends when compared with weekdays was 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.06; p=0.005). The weekend effect was larger in major teaching hospitals compared with non-teaching hospitals (OR = 1.13 vs 1.03, p=0.03) and minor teaching hospitals (OR = 1.05, p=0.11).

In a UK study in 2010, Aylin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20110288 | doi=10.1136/qshc.2008.028639 | volume=19 | issue=3 | title=Weekend mortality for emergency admissions. A large, multicentre study | author=Aylin P, Yunus A, Bottle A, Majeed A, Bell D | journal=Qual Saf Health Care | pages=213–7 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 4,317,866 ED admissions, and found 215,054 in-hospital deaths with an overall crude mortality rate of 5.0% (5.2% for all weekend admissions and 4.9% for all weekday admissions). The overall adjusted odds of death for all emergency admissions was 10% higher (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.08-1.11) in those patients admitted at the weekend compared with patients admitted during a weekday (p&lt;0.001).

Handel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23135542 | doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001789 | volume=2 | issue=6 | title=Weekend admissions as an independent predictor of mortality: an analysis of Scottish hospital admissions | pmc=3533021 | author=Handel AE, Patel SV, Skingsley A, Bramley K, Sobieski R, Ramagopalan SV | journal=BMJ Open | pages=e001789 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, carried out a similar study in the UK (Scotland) on 5,271,327 ED  admissions. There was a significantly increased probability of death associated with a weekend emergency admission compared with admission on a weekday (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.26-1.28, p&lt;0.0001). However, in 2013, Powell et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23993937 | doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2013.04.042 | volume=45 | issue=5 | title=The weekend effect for patients with sepsis presenting to the emergency department | author=Powell ES, Khare RK, Courtney DM, Feinglass J | journal=J Emerg Med | pages=641–8 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, analysed 114,611 ED admissions with a principal diagnosis consistent with sepsis, and found that the difference for overall inpatient mortality (in terms of the weekend) was not significant (17.9% vs 17.5%, p=0.08).

In 2016, Shin et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=28025161 | doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2016.12.009 | volume=74 | issue=4 | title=Association of weekend effect with early mortality in severe sepsis patients over time | year=2017 | author=Shih YN, Chen YT, Shih CJ, Ou SM, Hsu YT, Chen RC, Aisiku IP, Seethala RR, Frendl G, Hou PC | journal=J Infect | pages=345–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Taiwan, studied 398,043 patients with severe sepsis. Compared with patients admitted on weekends, patients admitted on weekdays had a lower 7-day mortality rate (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.87-0.91), 14-day mortality rate (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.93), and 28-day mortality rate (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.98).

Also in the US, in 2013, Sharp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23465873 | doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2013.01.006 | volume=31 | issue=5 | title=Don't get sick on the weekend: an evaluation of the weekend effect on mortality for patients visiting US EDs | author=Sharp AL, Choi H, Hayward RA | journal=Am J Emerg Med | pages=835–7 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 4,225,973 adult ED admissions. They found that patients admitted on the weekend were significantly more likely to die than those admitted on weekdays (OR = 1.073; 95% CI 1.06-1.08). However, Smith et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23345314 | doi=10.1136/emermed-2012-201881 | volume=31 | issue=1 | title=Emergency medical admissions, deaths at weekends and the public holiday effect. Cohort study | author=Smith S, Allan A, Greenlaw N, Finlay S, Isles C | journal=Emerg Med J | pages=30–4 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014) in a smaller study (of 20,072 patients) in the US, found that weekend mortality was not significantly higher at 7 days (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 0.92-1.31; p=0.312) or at 30 days (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.94-1.21; p=0.322). By contrast, they found adjusted public holiday mortality in the all public holidays was 48% higher at 7 days (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.12-1.95; p=0.006) and 27% higher at 30 days (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.57; p=0.031).

Also in 2014, in an Australian study, Concha et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24163392 | doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002218 | volume=23 | issue=3 | title=Do variations in hospital mortality patterns after weekend admission reflect reduced quality of care or different patient cohorts? A population-based study | pmc=3933164 | author=Concha OP, Gallego B, Hillman K, Delaney GP, Coiera E | journal=BMJ Qual Saf | pages=215–22 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 3,381,962 ED admissions; and found that sixteen of 430 diagnosis groups had a significantly increased risk of death following weekend admission. They accounted for 40% of all deaths, and demonstrated different excess mortality risk patterns: early care effect (cardiac arrest); care effect washout (e.g., pulmonary embolism); patient effect (e.g., cancer admissions) and mixed (e.g., stroke). These findings are consistent with most of the disease-specific studies outlined below.

Blecker et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25947881 | doi=10.1007/s11606-015-3330-6 | volume=30 | issue=11 | title=Impact of an Intervention to Improve Weekend Hospital Care at an Academic Medical Center: An Observational Study | pmc=4617935 | author=Blecker S, Goldfeld K, Park H, Radford MJ, Munson S, Francois F, Austrian JS, Braithwaite RS, Hochman K, Donoghue R, Birnbaum BA, Gourevitch MN | journal=J Gen Intern Med | pages=1657–64 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, in the US, studied 57,163 ED admissions, before and after implementation of an intervention to improve patient care at weekends. The average length of stay decreased by 13% (95% CI 10-15%) and continued to decrease by 1% (95% CI 1-2%) per month as compared to the underlying time trend. The proportion of weekend discharges increased by 12% (95% CI 2-22%) at the time of the intervention and continued to increase by 2% (95% CI 1-3%) per month thereafter. However, the intervention had no impact on readmissions or mortality.

In a smaller Danish study (of 5,385 patients) in 2016, it was found that there was a higher mortality for patients attending the ED during the evening shift than during the dayshifts, and during weekends than during weekdays (Biering et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26726901 | volume=63 | issue=1 | title=Admission-time-dependent variation in mortality in a Danish emergency department | author=Biering K, Nielsen RF, Pérez N | journal=Dan Med J | pages=A5173 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Patients attending the ED during the night shift had no excess mortality compared with the day shifts. The combination of evening shift and weekday and the combination of dayshift and weekend reached significance.

Not all ED studies show the weekend effect. Some argue that it relates to higher acuity patients being admitted over the weekend. For example, also in 2016, Mohammed et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27413051 | doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcw104 | title=Adjusting for illness severity shows there is no difference in patient mortality at weekends or weekdays for emergency medical admissions | author=Mohammed MA, Faisal M, Richardson D, Howes R, Beaston K, Speed K, Wright J | journal=QJM | volume=110 | issue=7 | pages=e1–e8 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, studied 58,481 emergency adult medical admissions in three acute hospitals with the electronic National Early Warning Score (NEWS) recorded within 24 hours of admission. Admissions over the weekend had higher index NEWS (weekend: 2.24 vs weekday: 2.05; p&lt;0.001) with a higher risk of death (weekend: 6.65% vs weekday: 5.49%; OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19, p=0.023) which was no longer seen after adjusting for the index NEWS (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.92-1.08, p=0.94).

===Intensive care unit patients===

As well as ED, ICU care has been extensively studied in terms of weekend mortality. In 2002, Barnett et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12021679 | volume=40 | issue=6 | title=Day of the week of intensive care admission and patient outcomes: a multisite regional evaluation | author=Barnett MJ, Kaboli PJ, Sirio CA, Rosenthal GE | journal=Med Care | pages=530–9 | doi=10.1097/00005650-200206000-00010 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 156,136 patients in the US. They found the in-hospital death was 9% higher (OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.15; p&lt;0.001) for weekend admissions (Saturday or Sunday) than in patients admitted midweek (Tuesday to Thursday). However, the adjusted odds of death were also higher (p&lt;0.001) for patients admitted on a Monday (OR = 1.09) or a Friday (OR = 1.08). Findings were generally similar in analyses stratified by admission type (medical vs. surgical), hospital teaching status, and illness severity.

In 2003, in Finland, Uusaro et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 14600808 | doi=10.1007/s00134-003-2035-1 | volume=29 | issue=12 | title=The effects of ICU admission and discharge times on mortality in Finland | author=Uusaro A, Kari A, Ruokonen E | journal=Intensive Care Med | pages=2144–8 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 23,134 consecutive ICU patients. Adjusted ICU-mortality was higher for weekend as compared with weekday admissions (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.01-1.43).

But not all ICU studies show an effect. For example, in the following year, Ensminger et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15486395 | doi=10.1378/chest.126.4.1292 | volume=126 | issue=4 | title=The hospital mortality of patients admitted to the ICU on weekends | author=Ensminger SA, Morales IJ, Peters SG, Keegan MT, Finkielman JD, Lymp JF, Afessa B | journal=Chest | pages=1292–8 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;(2004) published a similar study in the US, looking at a significantly smaller population (of 29,084 patients). In multivariable analyses - controlling for the factors associated with mortality such as APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) III predicted mortality rate, ICU admission source, and intensity of treatment - no statistically significant difference in hospital mortality was found between weekend and weekday admissions in the study population (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.95-1.17)

A small study in Saudi Arabia was published by Arabi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16521254 | volume=34 | issue=3 | title=Weekend and weeknight admissions have the same outcome of weekday admissions to an intensive care unit with onsite intensivist coverage | author=Arabi Y, Alshimemeri A, Taher S | journal=Crit Care Med | pages=605–11 | doi=10.1097/01.ccm.0000203947.60552.dd | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006. A total of 2,093 admissions were included in the study. Again, there was no significant difference in hospital mortality rate between weekends and weekdays. Similarly, Laupland et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18725035 | doi=10.1016/j.jcrc.2007.09.001 | volume=23 | issue=3 | title=Hospital mortality among adults admitted to and discharged from intensive care on weekends and evenings | author=Laupland KB, Shahpori R, Kirkpatrick AW, Stelfox HT | journal=J Crit Care | pages=317–24 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, in Canada studied 20,466 ICU admissions. After controlling for confounding variables using logistic regression analyses, neither weekend admission nor discharge was associated with death. However, both night admission and discharge were independently associated with mortality.

However, in 2011, Bhonagiri et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21426282 | volume=194 | issue=6 | title=Increased mortality associated with after-hours and weekend admission to the intensive care unit: a retrospective analysis | author=Bhonagiri D, Pilcher DV, Bailey MJ | journal=Med J Aust | pages=287–92 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a huge study of 245,057 admissions in 41 Australian ICUs, found that weekend admissions had a 20% hospital mortality rate compared with 14% on weekdays (p&lt;0.001), with SMRs of 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.97) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.92-0.93). Conversely, Ju et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24112558 | doi=10.1186/cc13053 | volume=17 | issue=5 | title=Effect of admission time on mortality in an intensive care unit in Mainland China: a propensity score matching analysis | pmc=4055975 | author=Ju MJ, Tu GW, Han Y, He HY, He YZ, Mao HL, Wu ZG, Yin YQ, Luo JF, Zhu DM, Luo Z, Xue ZG | journal=Crit Care | pages=R230 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in China, in 2013 studied 2,891 consecutive ICU patients; and found no mortality difference between weekend and workday admissions (p= 0.849).

In a French study in 2015, 5,718 ICU inpatient stays were included (Neuraz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25867907 | doi=10.1097/CCM.0000000000001015 | volume=43 | issue=8 | title=Patient Mortality Is Associated With Staff Resources and Workload in the ICU: A Multicenter Observational Study | author=Neuraz A, Guérin C, Payet C, Polazzi S, Aubrun F, Dailler F, Lehot JJ, Piriou V, Neidecker J, Rimmelé T, Schott AM, Duclos A | journal=Crit Care Med | pages=1587–94 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).The risk of death increased by 3.5 (95% CI 1.3-9.1) when the patient-to-nurse ratio was greater than 2.5, and by 2.0 (95% CI 1.3-3.2) when the patient-to-physician ratio exceeded 14. The highest ratios occurred more frequently during the weekend for nurse staffing and during the night for physicians (p&lt;0.001).

In another small French study (in 2016), Brunot et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=28033395 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0168548 | pmc=5199040 | volume=11 | issue=12 | title=Mortality Associated with Night and Weekend Admissions to ICU with On-Site Intensivist Coverage: Results of a Nine-Year Cohort Study (2006-2014) | year=2016 | author=Brunot V, Landreau L, Corne P, Platon L, Besnard N, Buzançais A, Daubin D, Serre JE, Molinari N, Klouche K | journal=PLoS One | page=e0168548}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 2428 patients. They found that weeknight and weekend (off-hour admissions), did not influence the prognosis of ICU patients. However, they did conclude that the higher illness severity of patients admitted during the second part of the night (00:00-07:59) may explain the observed increased mortality of that time period.

Also in 2016, Arulkamaran et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27927721 | doi=10.1093/bja/aew398 | volume=118 | issue=1 | title=Association between day and time of admission to critical care and acute hospital outcome for unplanned admissions to adult general critical care units: cohort study exploring the 'weekend effect' | year=2017 | author=Arulkumaran N, Harrison DA, Brett SJ | journal=Br J Anaesth | pages=112–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, studied 195,428 ICU patients. After adjustment for casemix, there was no difference between weekends and weekdays (P=0.87) or between night-time and daytime (P=0.21).

Two studies into paediatric ICUs have been carried out.  In 2005, Hixson et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16148810 | volume=6 | issue=5 | title=Do weekends or evenings matter in a pediatric intensive care unit? | author=Hixson ED, Davis S, Morris S, Harrison AM | journal=Pediatr Crit Care Med | pages=523–30 | doi=10.1097/01.pcc.0000165564.01639.cb | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a US study of 5968 patients admitted to paediatric ICU, found neither weekend admission (p=0.15), weekend discharge/death (p=0.35), nor evening PICU admission (p=0.71) showed a significant relationship with mortality. Fendler et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23348487 | volume=44 | issue=4 | title=Weekend admissions to paediatric/neonatal intensive care units are associated with longer hospitalisation time but not with greater mortality | author=Fendler W, Klobusinska J, Walenciak Ł, Młynarski W, Piotrowski A | journal=Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther | pages=204–7 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, in a study of 2240 Polish paediatric ICU patients, found mortality was 10.9% and did not differ depending on weekend or weekday admission (10.95% vs 10.86% respectively, p=0.96).

===Other non-selected patients===

Schilling et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20168260 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181c162c0 | volume=48 | issue=3 | title=A comparison of in-hospital mortality risk conferred by high hospital occupancy, differences in nurse staffing levels, weekend admission, and seasonal influenza | author=Schilling PL, Campbell DA Jr, Englesbe MJ, Davis MM | journal=Med Care | pages=224–32 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, investigated 166,920 patients admitted to 39 Michigan hospitals. Participants were adults, 65 years+, and admitted through the emergency department with six common discharge diagnoses (acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, pneumonia, hip fracture, gastrointestinal bleeding). Seasonal influenza conferred the greatest increase in absolute risk of in-hospital mortality (0.5%; 95% CI 0.23-0.76), followed by weekend admission (0.32%; 95% CI 0.11-0.54), and high hospital occupancy on admission (0.25; 95% CI 0.06-0.43).

In a huge study in 2012 by Freemantle et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22307037 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2012.120009 | volume=105 | issue=2 | title=Weekend hospitalization and additional risk of death: an analysis of inpatient data | pmc=3284293 | author=Freemantle N, Richardson M, Wood J, Ray D, Khosla S, Shahian D, Roche WR, Stephens I, Keogh B, Pagano D | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=74–84 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14,217,640 admissions (all types) were assessed. Admission on weekend days was associated with an increase in risk of subsequent death compared with admission on weekdays. Hazard ratio for Sunday vs Wednesday 1.16 (95% CI 1.14-1.18; p&lt;0.0001), and for Saturday vs Wednesday 1.11 (95% CI 1.09-1.13; p&lt;.0001). Also in 2012, Lee et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23770862 | volume=67 | issue=5 | title=A Study of Weekend and Off-hour Effect on Mortality in a Public Hospital in Malaysia | author=Lee KG, Indralingam V | journal=Med J Malaysia | pages=478–82 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Malaysia, studied 126,627 patients admitted to a single hospital. The group found that there was a statistically significant increased risk of mortality for those patients admitted during weekends (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31) and out-of-hours on a weekday (OR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.57-1.78). As well as the effect of the weekend, there is a considerable literature on the effect of being admitted 'out-of-hours'. This effect is seen during the week and at weekends. This study by Lee is such a paper. The degree of effect is usually higher for the 'Out-of-Hours Effect' rather than the 'Weekend Effect'. This suggests that the 'weekend effect' may be nothing to do with the weekend per se, but may be caused by varying staff levels, and less intensive working practices, outside the '9-5 window'.

Ruiz et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26150550 | doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2014-003467 | volume=24 | issue=8 | title=The Global Comparators project: international comparison of 30-day in-hospital mortality by day of the week | pmc=4515980 | author=Ruiz M, Bottle A, Aylin PP | journal=BMJ Qual Saf | pages=492–504 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, researched 28 hospitals in England, Australia, US and the Netherlands; including both emergency and surgical-elective patients. This was an important study as it compared different healthcare systems throughout the developed world. They examined 2,982,570 hospital records. Adjusted odds of 30-day death were higher for weekend emergency admissions to 11 hospitals in England (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.04-1.13 on Sunday), 5 hospitals in US (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.24 on Sunday) and 6 hospitals in the Netherlands (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.33). Emergency admissions to the six Australian hospitals showed no daily variation in adjusted 30-day mortality, but showed a weekend effect at 7 days post emergency admission (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.04-1.22 on Saturday). All weekend elective patients showed higher adjusted odds of 30-day postoperative death; observing a 'Friday effect' for elective patients in the six Dutch hospitals. It seems that the ‘weekend effect’ is a phenomenon seen around the developed world.

Conway et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Conway R, Cournane S, Byrne D, O'Riordan D, Coveney S, Silke B. The Relationship Between Social Deprivation and a Weekend Emergency Medical Admission. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27759746 Acute Med. 2016; 15(3): 124-129]&lt;/ref&gt; in a 2016 Irish study of 30,794 weekend admissions (in 16,665 patients) found that the admission rate was substantially higher for more deprived areas, 12.7 per 1000 (95% CI 9.4-14.7) vs 4.6 per 1000 (95% CI 3.3-5.8).

Also in 2016, in the UK, Aldridge et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27178476 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30442-1 | volume=388 | issue=10040 | title=Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in England: a cross-sectional study | pmc=4945602 | author=Aldridge C, Bion J, Boyal A, Chen YF, Clancy M, Evans T, Girling A, Lord J, Mannion R, Rees P, Roseveare C, Rudge G, Sun J, Tarrant C, Temple M, Watson S, Lilford R | journal=Lancet | pages=178–86 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 34,350 clinicians. They found substantially fewer specialists were present providing care to emergency admissions on Sunday (1667, 11%) than on Wednesday (6105, 42%). The Sunday-to-Wednesday intensity ratio was less than 0.7 in 104 (90%) of the contributing trusts. Mortality risk among patients admitted at weekends was higher than among those admitted on weekdays (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.08-1.11; p&lt;0.0001). There was no significant association between Sunday-to-Wednesday specialist intensity ratios and weekend to weekday mortality ratios (r = -0.042; p=0.654).

'''''Cardiac arrest'''''
In 2008, in the US, Pederby et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18285590 | doi=10.1001/jama.299.7.785 | volume=299 | issue=7 | title=Survival from in-hospital cardiac arrest during nights and weekends | author=Peberdy MA, Ornato JP, Larkin GL, Braithwaite RS, Kashner TM, Carey SM, Meaney PA, Cen L, Nadkarni VM, Praestgaard AH, Berg RA | journal=JAMA | pages=785–92 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 58,593 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Among in-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during day/evening hours, survival was higher on weekdays (20.6%; 95% CI 20.3%-21%) than on weekends (17.4%; 95% CI 16.8%-18%); odds ratio was 1.15 (95% CI 1.09-1.22). Day of week was not the only determinant of survival. Rates of survival to discharge was substantially lower during the night compared with day/evening; 14.7% (95% CI 14.3%-15.1%) vs 19.8% (95% CI 19.5%-20.1%). The authors concluded "survival rates from in-hospital cardiac arrest are lower during nights and weekends, even when adjusted for potentially confounding patient, event, and hospital characteristics".

In Japan, in 2011, Kioke et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21397380 | doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.02.007 | volume=82 | issue=7 | title=Effect of time and day of admission on 1-month survival and neurologically favourable 1-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest patients | author=Koike S, Tanabe S, Ogawa T, Akahane M, Yasunaga H, Horiguchi H, Matsumoto S, Imamura T | journal=Resuscitation | pages=863–8 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 173,137 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). No significant differences were found between weekday and weekend/holiday cases, with odds ratios of 1.00 (95% CI 0.96-1.04; p=0.96) for 1-month survival and 0.99 (95% CI 0.94-1.04; p=0.78) for neurologically favourable 1-month survival.

In a study in 2015, Robinson et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26658774 | doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004223 | title=Risk-adjusted survival for adults following in-hospital cardiac arrest by day of week and time of day: observational cohort study | pmc=5136724 | author=Robinson EJ, Smith GB, Power GS, Harrison DA, Nolan J, Soar J, Spearpoint K, Gwinnutt C, Rowan KM | journal=BMJ Qual Saf | volume=25 | issue=11 | pages=832–841 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, analysed 27,700 patients who had had a cardiac arrest, in 146 UK acute hospitals. Risk-adjusted mortality was worse (p&lt;0.001) for both weekend daytime (OR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.64-80), and night-time (OR = 0.58; 95 CI 0.54-0.63) compared with weekday daytime. In a much smaller study, also in 2015, Lee et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26431921 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.06.077 | volume=101 | issue=1 | title=Survival After Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on Weekends in Comparison With Weekdays | author=Lee DS, Chung CR, Jeon K, Park CM, Suh GY, Song YB, Hahn JY, Choi SH, Choi JH, Gwon HC, Yang JH | journal=Ann Thorac Surg | pages=133–40 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 200 patients in South Korea. Rates of survival to discharge were higher with weekday care than with weekend care (35.8% vs 21.5%, p=0.041). Furthermore, complication rates were higher on the weekend than on the weekday, including cannulation site bleeding (3.0% vs 10.8%, p = 0.041), limb ischaemia (5.9% vs 15.6%, p = 0.026), and procedure-related infections (0.7% vs 9.2%, p = 0.005).

'''''Psychiatry Patients'''''
Orellana et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24896279 | volume=16 | issue=3 | title=Mortality by suicide: a focus on municipalities with a high proportion of self-reported indigenous people in the state of Amazonas, Brazil | author=Orellana JD, Basta PC, de Souza ML | journal=Rev Bras Epidemiol | pages=658–69 | doi=10.1590/s1415-790x2013000300010 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Brazil, in 2013, investigated suicide amongst indigenous peoples of the state of Amazonas. They observed that most of the suicides has occurred among men, aged between 15 – 24 years, at home and during the weekend.

In a psychiatry study in the UK, in 2016, Patel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27103681 | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.115.180307 | volume=209 | issue=1 | title=Clinical outcomes and mortality associated with weekend admission to psychiatric hospital | pmc=4929405 | author=Patel R, Chesney E, Cullen AE, Tulloch AD, Broadbent M, Stewart R, McGuire P | journal=Br J Psychiatry | pages=29–34 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 7303 weekend admissions. Patients admitted at the weekend were more likely to present via acute hospital services, other psychiatric hospitals and the criminal justice system than to be admitted directly from their own home. Weekend admission was associated with a shorter duration of admission (B-coefficient -21.1 days, 95% CI -24.6-717.6, p&lt;0.001) and an increased risk of readmission in the 12 months following index admission (incidence rate ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18, p&lt;0.001); but in-patient mortality (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.51-0.23; p= 0.30) was not greater than for weekday admission.

'''''Other studies'''''
In a palliative care study in Germany, Voltz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25515670 | volume=349 | title=Silent night: retrospective database study assessing possibility of "weekend effect" in palliative care | pmc=4267701 | author=Voltz R, Kamps R, Greinwald R, Hellmich M, Hamacher S, Becker G, Kuhr K, Gaertner J | journal=BMJ | pages=g7370 | doi=10.1136/bmj.g7370 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2015) studied 2565 admitted patients - 1325 deaths were recorded. Of the deaths, 448 (33.8%) occurred on weekends and public holidays. The mortality rate on weekends and public holidays was 18% higher than that on working days (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.05-1.32; p=0.005). They concluded "Patients in the palliative care unit were at higher risk of dying on weekends and public holidays. In the absence of a prospective study, the exact reasons for this correlation are unclear." So, even in a situation where all the patients studied are dying, there is a weekend death effect, perhaps relating to differing work patterns.

In summary, there is strong evidence of a weekend effect when large non-disease specific groups of unselected patients are studied; both medical, surgical (both elective and non-elective patients) and ED. Patients who have had a cardiac arrest, or are palliative, also show the effect. There is variable evidence of an effect in ICU patients, adult and paediatric; also with variable evidence in psychiatry admissions.

'''''AMI'''''
Multiple studies have been carried out into acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In the first study, in Japan in 2007, Matsui et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18037733 | volume=71 | issue=12 | title=Weekend onset of acute myocardial infarction does not have a negative impact on outcome in Japan | author=Matsui K, Kojima S, Sakamoto T, Ishihara M, Kimura K, Miyazaki S, Yamagishi M, Tei C, Hiraoka H, Sonoda M, Tsuchihashi K, Ooie T, Honda T, Ogata Y, Ogawa H | journal=Circ J | pages=1841–4 | doi=10.1253/circj.71.1841 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 6084 patients. There were no differences between the weekday and weekend groups in terms of in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates.

However, also in 2007, in a much larger US study (of 231,164 AMI patients), Kostis et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17360988 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa063355 | volume=356 | issue=11 | title=Weekend versus weekday admission and mortality from myocardial infarction | author=Kostis WJ, Demissie K, Marcella SW, Shao YH, Wilson AC, Moreyra AE | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=1099–109 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the difference in mortality at 30 days was significant even after adjustment for demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, and site of infarction (OR = 1.048; 95% CI 1.02-1.08; p&lt;0.001).

In 2008, Kruth et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18465106 | doi=10.1007/s00392-008-0671-8 | volume=97 | issue=10 | title=Influence of presentation at the weekend on treatment and outcome in ST-elevation myocardial infarction in hospitals with catheterization laboratories | author=Krüth P, Zeymer U, Gitt A, Jünger C, Wienbergen H, Niedermeier F, Glunz HG, Senges J, Zahn R | journal=Clin Res Cardiol | pages=742–7 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, analysed 11,516 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). On weekends the group found a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (11.1 vs 9.4%, p=0.01) and at night there was a trend to higher in-hospital mortality when compared with regular working hours (10.6 vs 9.4%, p=0.07).

In small Japanese study, two years later, 370 AMI patients were studied (Turin et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19089589 | doi=10.1007/s10654-008-9308-5 | volume=24 | issue=2 | title=Incidence, admission and case-fatality of acute myocardial infarction: weekend versus weekday in a Japanese population: 16-year results from Takashima AMI Registry (1988-2003) | author=Turin TC, Kita Y, Rumana N, Sugihara H, Morita Y, Tomioka N, Okayama A, Nakamura Y, Ueshima H | journal=Eur J Epidemiol | pages=93–100 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009). Odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI 0.7-1.9) but there was no significant difference between weekend and weekday patients. Similarly, also in 2010, in South Korea, in another large study (97,466 patients), Hong el al,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20075558 | volume=74 | issue=3 | title=Comparison of case fatality rates for acute myocardial infarction in weekday vs weekend admissions in South Korea | author=Hong JS, Kang HC, Lee SH | journal=Circ J | pages=496–502 | doi=10.1253/circj.cj-09-0678 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found the 30-day fatality rate was insignificantly different after adjustment for medical or invasive management (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.99-1.11).

Similarly, in 2012, in a study of 4616 AMI patients in Middle Eastern Countries, Al-Lawati et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23002404 | doi=10.2174/1874192401206010106 | volume=6 | title=Weekend versus weekday, morning versus evening admission in relationship to mortality in acute coronary syndrome patients in 6 middle eastern countries: results from gulf race 2 registry | pmc=3447162 | author=Al-Lawati JA, Al-Zakwani I, Sulaiman K, Al-Habib K, Al Suwaidi J, Panduranga P, Alsheikh-Ali AA, Almahmeed W, Al Faleh H, Al Saif S, Hersi A, Asaad N, Al-Motarreb A, Mikhailidis DP, Amin H | journal=Open Cardiovasc Med J | pages=106–12 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no significant differences in 1-month (OR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14) and 1-year mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.70-1.10), respectively, between weekday and weekend admissions.

In the following year, 2013, five studies were published; three showed a weekend effect, two (smaller studies) did not. In Denmark, Hansen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23199552 | doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.11.071 | volume=168 | issue=2 | title=Prognosis and treatment in patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction on weekends and weekdays from 1997 to 2009 | author=Hansen KW, Hvelplund A, Abildstrøm SZ, Prescott E, Madsen M, Madsen JK, Jensen JS, Sørensen R, Galatius S | journal=Int J Cardiol | pages=1167–73 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 92,164 AMI patients. Mortality rates were higher on weekends within seven days of admission in 1997-99 (absolute difference ranging from 0.8 to 1.1%), with weekend-weekday hazard-ratios of 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.23) at day 2 and 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.18) at day 7. But there were no significant differences in 2000-09 and suggesting an attenuation of the initial 'weekend-effect', perhaps relating to more equitable care. Khera et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23838593 | doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.06.021 | volume=168 | issue=4 | title=ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the elderly--temporal trends in incidence, utilization of percutaneous coronary intervention and outcomes in the United States | author=Khera S, Kolte D, Palaniswamy C, Mujib M, Aronow WS, Singh T, Gotsis W, Silverman G, Frishman WH | journal=Int J Cardiol | pages=3683–90 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, carried out another huge study, of 1,434,579 patients with a STEMI. Weekend admission and multivessel PCI were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients who underwent PCI for STEMI. Gyenes et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23910228 | doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2013.04.035 | volume=29 | issue=11 | title=Use and timing of coronary angiography and associated in-hospital outcomes in Canadian non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients: insights from the Canadian Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events | author=Gyenes GT, Yan AT, Tan M, Welsh RC, Fox KA, Grondin FR, Deyoung JP, Rose BF, Gallo R, Kornder JM, Wong GC, Goodman SG | journal=Can J Cardiol | pages=1429–35 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada, studied 6711 NSTEMI patients. Weekend admission was independently associated with higher mortality (OR = 1.52; 95% CI 1.15-2.01; p=0.004).

Rahthod et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23811175 | doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003063 | volume=3 | issue=6 | title=Out-of-hours primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction is not associated with excess mortality: a study of 3347 patients treated in an integrated cardiac network | pmc=3696864 | author=Rathod KS, Jones DA, Gallagher SM, Bromage DI, Whitbread M, Archbold AR, Jain AK, Mathur A, Wragg A, Knight CJ | journal=BMJ Open | pages=e003063 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, studied 3347 STEMI patients, but did not find a weekend effect. In hospital mortality rates were comparable between the weekday and weekend groups (3.6% vs 3.2%) with day of presentation not predictive of outcome (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 0.74-2.11). In another small UK study in 2013, Showkathali et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23737507 | doi=10.1093/qjmed/hct132 | volume=106 | issue=11 | title=The advantages of a consultant led primary percutaneous coronary intervention service on patient outcome | author=Showkathali R, Davies JR, Sayer JW, Kelly PA, Aggarwal RK, Clesham GJ | journal=QJM | pages=989–94 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 1471 STEMI patients and found a similar result. In-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality were not different between weekday and weekend groups.

In 2014, in another Canadian study (of 11,981 AMI patients), O’Neill et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24585942 | doi=10.1177/2048872613510086 | volume=3 | issue=2 | title=Weekend compared with weekday presentation does not affect outcomes of patients presenting with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome | author=O'Neill DE, Southern DA, O'Neill BJ, McMurtry MS, Graham MM | journal=Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care | pages=99–104 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, after adjusting for baseline risk factors, the hazards ratio for mortality was non-significant (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.82-1.38). Mortality at 1 year was also similar. Conversely, in the following year, in another Japanese study (of 111,200 patients, i.e. much larger than the previous two Japanese studies), Isogai et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25464474 | doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.11.070 | volume=179 | title=Effect of weekend admission for acute myocardial infarction on in-hospital mortality: a retrospective cohort study | author=Isogai T, Yasunaga H, Matsui H, Tanaka H, Ueda T, Horiguchi H, Fushimi K | journal=Int J Cardiol | pages=315–20 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for weekend admission, compared to weekday admission (13.6% vs 11.4%; p&lt;0.001; OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.17-1.27), despite the higher rate of PCI performed on the day of admission (68.9% vs 64.8%; p&lt;0.001).

In South Korea in 2015, Kim et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25829809 | doi=10.3346/jkms.2015.30.4.414 | volume=30 | issue=4 | title=The effect of admission at weekends on clinical outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and its contributing factors | pmc=4366962 | author=Kim HJ, Kim KI, Cho YS, Kang J, Park JJ, Oh IY, Yoon CH, Suh JW, Youn TJ, Chae IH, Choi DJ | journal=J Korean Med Sci | pages=414–25 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 577 patients with NSTEMI or ACS. After adjustment for all confounding factors, weekend admission was associated with a 2.1-fold increased hazard for major adverse cardiac event (MACE), including cardiac death  (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.26-3.60; p=0.005).

In 2016, in a huge American study by Khoshchehreh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26950171 | doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.087 | volume=210 | title=Changes in mortality on weekend versus weekday admissions for Acute Coronary Syndrome in the United States over the past decade | pmc=4801736 | author=Khoshchehreh M, Groves EM, Tehrani D, Amin A, Patel PM, Malik S | journal=Int J Cardiol | pages=164–72 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 13,988,772 patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), adjusted mortality was higher for weekend admissions for Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.14-1.16); but only somewhat higher for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.04). Additionally, patients were significantly less likely to receive coronary revascularisation intervention/therapy on their first day of admission; OR = 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) and OR = 0.75 (95% CI 0.75-0.75) for STEMI and NSTEMI respectively.

In another huge US study, also in 2016, 3,625,271 NSTEMI admissions were identified by Agrawal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27381668 | doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.06.022 | volume=118 | issue=5 | title=Comparison of Inhospital Mortality and Frequency of Coronary Angiography on Weekend Versus Weekday Admissions in Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction | author=Agrawal S, Garg L, Sharma A, Mohananey D, Bhatia N, Singh A, Shirani J, Dixon S | journal=Am J Cardiol | pages=632–4 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission on a weekend vs weekday was independently associated with a lower rate of coronary angiography (OR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.89-0.90; p&lt;0.001). And adjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for the cohort of patients admitted on weekends (OR = 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.04; p&lt;0.001).

'''''PCI'''''
Noman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22947609 | doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehs261 | volume=33 | issue=24 | title=Mortality outcome of out-of-hours primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the current era | author=Noman A, Ahmed JM, Spyridopoulos I, Bagnall A, Egred M | journal=Eur Heart J | pages=3046–53 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK in 2012, studied 2571 consecutive PCI-treated STEMI patients. There was no difference in mortality between weekday and weekend groups (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.82-1.46; p=0.57). Similarly, no increase in mortality was seen in patients who underwent PCI at night (22:00-06:00).

Whereas, in 2015, Singh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25824542 | doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.02.037 | volume=115 | issue=10 | title=Comparison of inhospital mortality, length of hospitalization, costs, and vascular complications of percutaneous coronary interventions guided by ultrasound versus angiography | author=Singh V, Badheka AO, Arora S, Panaich SS, Patel NJ, Patel N, Pant S, Thakkar B, Chothani A, Deshmukh A, Manvar S, Lahewala S, Patel J, Patel S, Jhamnani S, Bhinder J, Patel P, Savani GT, Patel A, Mohamad T, Gidwani UK, Brown M, Forrest JK, Cleman M, Schreiber T, Grines C | journal=Am J Cardiol | pages=1357–66 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, carried out a much larger study of 401,571 PCI procedures. In a multivariate analysis, the weekend was a significant predictor of mortality.

Patel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Patel NJ, Pau D, Nalluri N, Bhatt P, Thakkar B, Kanotra R, Agnihotri K, Ainani N, Patel N, Patel N, Shah S, Kadavath S, Arora S, Sheikh A, Badheka AO, Lafferty J, Alfonso C, Cohen M. Temporal Trends, Predictors, and Outcomes of In-Hospital Gastrointestinal Bleeding Associated With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27642112 Am J Cardiol. 2016 Oct 15; 118(8): 1150-1157]&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA in 2016, studied 4,376,950 patients who underwent PCI, focussing on a complication, upper GI bleed (UGIB). The incidence of UGIB was 1.1%. Mortality rate in the UGIB group was significantly higher (9.71% vs 1.1%, p &lt;0.0001). They also found a higher risk of UGIB in urgent versus elective admissions, and weekend versus weekday admissions.

===Other cardiac disease===
Three studies have been carried out into Acute Heart Failure (AHF). In 2009, in a US study of 48,612 patients with AHF, there were no differences in death rate by day of admission or discharge (Fornarow et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19808270 | doi=10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.107.748376 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Day of admission and clinical outcomes for patients hospitalized for heart failure: findings from the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) | author=Fonarow GC, Abraham WT, Albert NM, Stough WG, Gheorghiade M, Greenberg BH, O'Connor CM, Nunez E, Yancy CW, Young JB | journal=Circ Heart Fail | pages=50–7 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Conversely, in the same year, also in the US, Horwich et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19699870 | doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2009.06.025 | volume=158 | issue=3 | title=Weekend hospital admission and discharge for heart failure: association with quality of care and clinical outcomes | author=Horwich TB, Hernandez AF, Liang L, Albert NM, Labresh KA, Yancy CW, Fonarow GC | journal=Am Heart J | pages=451–8 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysed 81,810 AHF admissions at 241 sites. Weekend AHF admission compared to weekday admission was associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.27). In a smaller Japanese study (of 1620 patients) in 2014, Hamaguchi et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23653107 | doi=10.1007/s00380-013-0359-5 | volume=29 | issue=3 | title=Weekend versus weekday hospital admission and outcomes during hospitalization for patients due to worsening heart failure: a report from Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) | author=Hamaguchi S, Kinugawa S, Tsuchihashi-Makaya M, Goto D, Tsutsui H | journal=Heart Vessels | pages=328–35 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in-hospital death was comparable between patients admitted on the weekend and weekdays (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.63-2.00; p=0.69).

Deshmukh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22481013 | doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.03.011 | volume=110 | issue=2 | title=Comparison of outcomes of weekend versus weekday admissions for atrial fibrillation | author=Deshmukh A, Pant S, Kumar G, Bursac Z, Paydak H, Mehta JL | journal=Am J Cardiol | pages=208–11 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US in 2012, analysed 86,497 discharges with atrial fibrillation. The rate of AF requiring cardioversion was lower at the weekend when compared to a weekday (7.9% vs 16.2%, p&lt;0.0001; OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.45-0.55; p&lt;0.0001).  The adjusted hospital mortality odds was greater for weekend admissions (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.51; p&lt;0.0001), after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and disease severity.

===Cardiovascular surgery===
There have been three studies in cardiovascular surgery. In 2011, Kim et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22010202 | doi=10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.111.963223 | volume=4 | issue=6 | title=Resource use among adult congenital heart surgery admissions in pediatric hospitals: risk factors for high resource utilization and association with inpatient death | author=Kim YY, Gauvreau K, Bacha EA, Landzberg MJ, Benavidez OJ | journal=Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes | pages=634–9 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied 97, 563 congenital heart surgery admissions to pediatric hospitals. Multivariable analysis demonstrated higher case complexity for weekend admission (OR = 2.6; p&lt;0.001). No mortality data was presented.

Badheka et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24608018 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2014.02.025 | volume=127 | issue=8 | title=Percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy in the United States: a 13-year perspective | author=Badheka AO, Patel NJ, Singh V, Shah N, Chothani A, Mehta K, Deshmukh A, Ghatak A, Rathod A, Desai H, Savani GT, Grover P, Patel N, Arora S, Grines CL, Schreiber T, Makkar R, Rihal CS, Cohen MG, De Marchena E, O'Neill WW | journal=Am J Med | pages=744–753.e3 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, in 2014, studied 2127 patients who had had percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy. Significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were the presence of increasing comorbidities (p=0.03), unstable patient (P&lt;0.001), any complication (p&lt;0.001), and weekend admission (p=0.008).

In 2016, in the US, Gonzalez et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27220493 | doi=10.1007/s00383-016-3901-6 | volume=32 | issue=7 | title=Effect of timing of cannulation on outcome for pediatric extracorporeal life support | author=Gonzalez KW, Dalton BG, Weaver KL, Sherman AK, St Peter SD, Snyder CL | journal=Pediatr Surg Int | pages=665–9 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 176 paediatric patients placed on extracorporeal life support (ECLS). The most common indications for ECLS were congenital diaphragmatic hernia (33%) and persistent pulmonary hypertension (23%). When comparing 'in-hours' (40%) to 'out-off-hours' cannulation (60%), there were no significant differences in central nervous system complications, haemorrhage (extra-cranial), cannula repositioning, conversion from venovenous to venoarterial, mortality on ECLS, or survival-to-discharge.

In summary, in AMI and PCI (in the larger studies), and AF, there is good evidence of a weekend effect. AMI is a condition where a weekend effect might not have been predicted (i.e. a fairly random acute disease, traditionally looked after on a CCU where working patterns are usually similar through the week). In AHF, and Cardiothoracic Surgery, there is variable evidence of a weekend effect.

===Respiratory medicine===
'''''COPD'''''
There have been four studies in COPD (one including pneumonia), three on PE and two on pneumonia alone. In 2011, in a study of 9,915 admissions in the UK with an acute exacerbation of COPD, Brims et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21853828 | volume=11 | issue=4 | title=Weekend admission and mortality from acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in winter | author=Brims FJ, Asiimwe A, Andrews NP, Prytherch D, Higgins BR, Kilburn S, Chauhan AJ | journal=Clin Med (Lond) | pages=334–9 | doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.11-4-334 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the adjusted odds ratio for death on day 1 after winter weekend admission was 2.89 (95% CI 1.04-8.08). But after opening a Medical Admission Unit, the OR for death day 1 after weekend winter admission fell from 3.63 (95% CI 1.15-11.5) to 1.65 (95% CI 0.14-19.01).

In the following year, in a much larger study (of 289,077 COPD patients), in Spain, Barba et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21659418 | doi=10.1183/09031936.00013211 | volume=39 | issue=1 | title=The impact of weekends on outcome for acute exacerbations of COPD | author=Barba R, Zapatero A, Losa JE, Marco J, Plaza S, Rosado C, Canora J | journal=Eur Respir J | pages=46–50 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered weekend admissions were associated with a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (12.9%) than weekday admissions (12.1%) (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10). In 2014, in Canada, Suissa et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24829270 | doi=10.1183/09031936.00007714 | volume=44 | issue=3 | title=Friday and weekend hospital stays: effects on mortality | author=Suissa S, Dell'Aniello S, Suissa D, Ernst P | journal=Eur Respir J | pages=627–33 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published another very large study (of 323,895 patients) with COPD and pneumonia. They found mortality was higher for weekend (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) but not Friday admissions (OR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-1.00), relative to Monday-Thursday admissions.

In a US study of 25,301 COPD patients (Rinne et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26147865 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0000000000000395 | volume=53 | issue=9 | title=Weekend Discharges and Length of Stay Among Veterans Admitted for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease | author=Rinne ST, Wong ES, Hebert PL, Au DH, Lindenauer PK, Neely EL, Sulc CA, Liu CF | journal=Med Care | pages=753–7 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015), there were significantly fewer discharges on the weekend (1922 per weekend day vs 4279 per weekday, p&lt;0.01); weekend discharges were significantly associated with lower odds of mortality within 30 days after discharge (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.65-0.99).

'''''Pulmonary embolus'''''
Three first studies in Pulmonary Embolus (PE) have been carried out. The first was published by Aujesky in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19204300 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.824292 | volume=119 | issue=7 | title=Weekend versus weekday admission and mortality after acute pulmonary embolism | pmc=2746886 | author=Aujesky D, Jiménez D, Mor MK, Geng M, Fine MJ, Ibrahim SA | journal=Circulation | pages=962–8 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning 15,531 patients with PE in Switzerland. Patients admitted on weekends had a higher unadjusted 30-day mortality rate (11.1% vs 8.8%) than patients admitted on weekdays, with no difference in length of stay. Patients admitted on weekends had significantly greater adjusted odds of dying (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.34) than patients admitted on weekdays. Then Gallerani et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21544321 | doi=10.1160/TH11-02-0068 | volume=106 | issue=1 | title=Higher mortality rate in patients hospitalised for acute pulmonary embolism during weekends | author=Gallerani M, Imberti D, Ageno W, Dentali F, Manfredini R | journal=Thromb Haemost | pages=83–9 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, studied 26,560 Italian patients with PE. Weekend admissions were associated with significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality than weekday admissions (28% vs. 24.8%) (p&lt;0.001). The third study, by Nanchal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22459777 | doi=10.1378/chest.11-2663 | volume=142 | issue=3 | title=Pulmonary embolism: the weekend effect | pmc=4694190 | author=Nanchal R, Kumar G, Taneja A, Patel J, Deshmukh A, Tarima S, Jacobs ER, Whittle J | journal=Chest | pages=690–6 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was carried out a year later, in the US, and was a huge one (of 1,143,707 patients). The authors found unadjusted mortality was higher for weekend admissions than weekday admissions (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.13-1.24). This increase in mortality remained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounding variables (OR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.11-1.22).

'''''Pneumonia'''''
There are two studies concerning  pneumonia. Firstly, in Taiwan, in 2012, Chang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22095573 | doi=10.1007/s11606-011-1932-1 | volume=27 | issue=5 | title=Factors associated with pneumonia outcomes: a nationwide population-based study over the 1997-2008 period | pmc=3326101 | author=Chang GM, Tung YC | journal=J Gen Intern Med | pages=527–33 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; described 788,011 patients. The patients admitted on weekends had a 3% higher odds of 30-day death compared with those admitted on weekdays (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05). Secondly, in Japan, in 2016, Uematsu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27040008 | doi=10.1111/resp.12788 | volume=21 | issue=5 | title=Impact of weekend admission on in-hospital mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia patients in Japan | author=Uematsu H, Kunisawa S, Yamashita K, Fushimi K, Imanaka Y | journal=Respirology | pages=905–10 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 23,532 patients. After adjusting for baseline patient severity and need for urgent care, weekend admissions were associated with higher mortality (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19).

In summary, there is good evidence of a weekend effect in a spectrum of respiratory disease, including COPD, PE and pneumonia.

===Gastroenterology===
'''''Upper GI Bleed'''''
The studies related to Upper GI Bleed (UGIB) are almost as numerous as those on myocardial infarction; two focus on Acute Variceal Hemorrhage (AVH) alone. In 2009, in the US, Shaheen et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18849015 | doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2008.08.033 | volume=7 | issue=3 | title=Weekend versus weekday admission and mortality from gastrointestinal hemorrhage caused by peptic ulcer disease | author=Shaheen AA, Kaplan GG, Myers RP | journal=Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol | pages=303–10 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; found, in a study of 237,412 patients with UGI bleed, that those admitted on the weekend had an increased risk of death (3.4% vs 3.0%; OR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.15). In a similar US paper that year, Ananthakrishnan et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19084483 | doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2008.08.013 | volume=7 | issue=3 | title=Outcomes of weekend admissions for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: a nationwide analysis | author=Ananthakrishnan AN, McGinley EL, Saeian K | journal=Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol | pages=296–302e1 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied another very large population (of 419,939 patients with UGIB). On multivariate analysis, non-variceal UGIB patients admitted on weekends had higher adjusted in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.35). Whereas, weekend admission was not predictive of in-hospital mortality in patients with AVH (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.75-1.18).

In another similar US study, by Dorn et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19672711 | doi=10.1007/s10620-009-0914-1 | volume=55 | issue=6 | title=Effect of weekend hospital admission on gastrointestinal hemorrhage outcomes | author=Dorn SD, Shah ND, Berg BP, Naessens JM | journal=Dig Dis Sci | pages=1658–66 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, 98,975 patients with UGIB were studied, and a similar weekend effect found. Compared to patients admitted on a weekday, for those admitted on a weekend, in-hospital mortality was higher (unadjusted mortality 3.76 vs 3.33%; p = 0.003; adjusted OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18). Whereas, in a much smaller 2011 UK study (of 6749 patients), Jaraith et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21606977 | doi=10.1038/ajg.2011.172 | volume=106 | issue=9 | title=Mortality from acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United kingdom: does it display a "weekend effect"? | author=Jairath V, Kahan BC, Logan RF, Hearnshaw SA, Travis SP, Murphy MF, Palmer KR | journal=Am J Gastroenterol | pages=1621–8 | year=2011}}{{sic|hide=y}}: does it display a "weekend effect"? Am J Gastroenterol. 2011 Sep; 106(9): 1621-8]&lt;/ref&gt; no weekend effect was found in UGIB. After adjustment for confounders, there was no evidence of a difference between weekend and weekday mortality (OR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.75-1.16).

Two further small studies were published in 2012. In South Korea, 388 UGIB (due to peptic ulcer) patients were studied by Youn et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22826623 | doi=10.3748/wjg.v18.i27.3578 | volume=18 | issue=27 | title=Weekend and nighttime effect on the prognosis of peptic ulcer bleeding | pmc=3400860 | author=Youn YH, Park YJ, Kim JH, Jeon TJ, Cho JH, Park H | journal=World J Gastroenterol | pages=3578–84 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients (97%) had undergone early endoscopy, but the mortality rate was not different between the two groups (1.8% overall vs 1.6% on the weekend). Whereas, in the Netherlands, de Groot et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22747509 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2012.05205.x | volume=36 | issue=5 | title=Admission time is associated with outcome of upper gastrointestinal bleeding: results of a multicentre prospective cohort study | author=de Groot NL, Bosman JH, Siersema PD, van Oijen MG, Bredenoord AJ | journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther | pages=477–84 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 571 patients with UGIB. The group found patients admitted during the weekend had a higher mortality rate than patients admitted during the week (9% vs 3%; OR = 2.68; 95% CI 1.07-6.72).

In 2014, Abougergi et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24674354 | doi=10.1016/j.gie.2014.01.043 | volume=80 | issue=2 | title=Impact of day of admission on mortality and other outcomes in upper GI hemorrhage: a nationwide analysis | author=Abougergi MS, Travis AC, Saltzman JR | journal=Gastrointest Endosc | pages=228–35 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another very large US study (of 202,340 patients) found that (compared with patients admitted on weekdays), patients with non-variceal UGIB admitted on weekends had similar adjusted in-hospital mortality rates (OR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.30).

In a Scottish study of 60,643 patients with UGIB in 2015, there was no significant change in annual number of admissions over time; but there was a statistically significant reduction in 30-day case fatality from 10.3% to 8.8% (p&lt;0.001) over 10 years (Ahmed et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26478680 | doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i38.10890 | volume=21 | issue=38 | title=Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Scotland 2000-2010: Improved outcomes but a significant weekend effect | pmc=4600590 | author=Ahmed A, Armstrong M, Robertson I, Morris AJ, Blatchford O, Stanley AJ | journal=World J Gastroenterol | pages=10890–7 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Patients admitted with UGIB at weekends had a higher 30-day case fatality compared with those admitted on weekdays (p&lt;0.001), after adjusting for comorbidities.

In 2016, Serrao et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26972023 | doi=10.1016/j.gie.2016.02.046 | volume=84 | issue=3 | title=In-hospital weekend outcomes in patients diagnosed with bleeding gastroduodenal angiodysplasia: a population-based study, 2000 to 2011 | author=Serrao S, Jackson C, Juma D, Babayan D, Gerson LB | journal=Gastrointest Endosc | pages=416–23 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied 85,971 patients with bleeding gastroduodenal angiodysplasia (GIAD). Mortality rates were higher for patients with weekend admission (2% vs 1%, p=0 .0002). And the adjusted odds ratio for inpatient mortality associated with weekend admission was elevated (OR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.5-3.9; p=0.0005)

Also in 2016, Weeda et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27534406 | doi=10.1007/s11739-016-1522-7 | title=Association between weekend admission and mortality for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: an observational study and meta-analysis | author=Weeda ER, Nicoll BS, Coleman CI, Sharovetskaya A, Baker WL | journal=Intern Emerg Med | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=163–169 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA, studied 119,353 patients in a metanalysis (of five studies, including their own. They found weekend admission for nonvariceal UGIB was associated with an increased odds of mortality (OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.15).

'''''UGIB (Variceal haemorrhage alone)'''''
In a Canadian study of 36,734 patients with AVH alone, Myers et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19623333 | volume=23 | issue=7 | title=The effect of weekend versus weekday admission on outcomes of esophageal variceal hemorrhage | pmc=2722470 | author=Myers RP, Kaplan GG, Shaheen AM | journal=Can J Gastroenterol | pages=495–501 | doi=10.1155/2009/713789 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2009—after adjusting for confounding factors, including the timing of endoscopy - found that the risk of mortality was similar between weekend and weekday admissions (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.97-1.14). Similarly, in a much smaller South Korean study (of 294 AVH patients), Byun et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3282972 | pmid=22318819 | doi=10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.318 | volume=53 | issue=2 | title=Acute variceal hemorrhage in patients with liver cirrhosis: weekend versus weekday admissions | author=Byun SJ, Kim SU, Park JY, Kim BK, Kim DY, Han KH, Chon CY, Ahn SH | journal=Yonsei Med J | pages=318–27 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), found no weekend effect; when seventeen (23.0%) of 74 patients with a weekend admission and 48 (21.8%) of 220 with a weekday admission died during hospitalisation (p=0.872).

'''''Other Gastroenterological Disease'''''
In 2016, in the US, Gaeteno et al. investigated 31,614 with cirrhosis and ascites. Among these admissions, approximately 51% (16,133) underwent paracentesis. Patients admitted on a weekend demonstrated less frequent use of early paracentesis (50% weekend vs 62% weekday) and increased mortality (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25).

Two US studies of acute cholangitis were also published in 2016. Firstly, Inamdar et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26782818 | doi=10.1038/ajg.2015.425 | volume=111 | issue=3 | title=Weekend vs. Weekday Admissions for Cholangitis Requiring an ERCP: Comparison of Outcomes in a National Cohort | author=Inamdar S, Sejpal DV, Ullah M, Trindade AJ | journal=Am J Gastroenterol | pages=405–10 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified 23,661 patients who were admitted for cholangitis who required ERCP; of which 18,106 (76.5%) patients were admitted on the weekday, and 5,555 (23.5%) admitted on the weekend. By 24h, the weekday group had undergone ERCP more frequently than the weekend group (54.6 vs 43%; p&lt;0.001). There was no statistical difference between the groups for in-hospital all-cause mortality (2.86 vs 2.56%; p=0.24), or length of stay (6.97 days vs 6.88 days; p=0.28). Secondly, in a much smaller study (of 181 patients), Tabibian et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26391268 | doi=10.1007/s10620-015-3853-z | volume=61 | issue=1 | title=Weekend Admission for Acute Cholangitis Does Not Adversely Impact Clinical or Endoscopic Outcomes | year=2016 | journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. | pages=53–61 | author=Tabibian JH, Yang JD, Baron TH, Kane SV, Enders FB, Gostout CJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no significant differences in mortality between weekend and weekday admission groups.

In a Japanese study, also in 2016, Hamada et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26897739 | doi=10.1007/s00535-016-1179-z | volume=51 | issue=11 | title=No weekend effect on outcomes of severe acute pancreatitis in Japan: data from the diagnosis procedure combination database | author=Hamada T, Yasunaga H, Nakai Y, Isayama H, Matsui H, Fushimi K, Koike K | journal=J Gastroenterol | pages=1063–1072 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 8328 patients hospitalised with severe acute pancreatitis. In-hospital mortality rates were not significantly different: 5.9% vs 5.4% for weekend and weekday admissions, respectively (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.83-1.35).

In summary, there is reasonable evidence (from larger studies) of a ‘weekend effect’ in UGIB (including bleeding gastroduodenal angiodysplasia) and paracentesis for cirrhosis and ascites; but little effect in AVH alone, and none in ERCP for cholangitis, or pancreatitis.

===Nephrology and transplantation===
In a very large Canadian study (of 963,730) patients, in 2010, James et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20395373 | doi=10.1681/ASN.2009070682 | volume=21 | issue=5 | title=Weekend hospital admission, acute kidney injury, and mortality | pmc=2865737 | author=James MT, Wald R, Bell CM, Tonelli M, Hemmelgarn BR, Waikar SS, Chertow GM | journal=J Am Soc Nephrol | pages=845–51 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that (compared with admission on a weekday), AKI patients admitted on a weekend had a higher risk of death (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.12). Similarly, in a huge study of 3,278,572 American haemodialysis patients in 2013, Sakhuja et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23669002 | doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.03.014 | volume=62 | issue=4 | title=Outcomes of patients receiving maintenance dialysis admitted over weekends | pmc=3783620 | author=Sakhuja A, Schold JD, Kumar G, Dall A, Sood P, Navaneethan SD | journal=Am J Kidney Dis | pages=763–70 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that patients admitted over weekends had higher mortality during the first 3 days of admission (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.10-1.26).

Haddock et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26610796 | doi=10.1177/0036933015619293 | volume=61 | issue=4 | title=In-patient hospital mortality patterns by day of the week: an analysis of admissions to a regional renal unit | author=Haddock R, Deighan C, Thomson PC | journal=Scott Med J | pages=179–184 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, in 2015, studied admissions to a renal unit. No weekend effect was observed. Thirty-day mortality rate was 46/208 = 0.22 deaths/weekend day of admission compared with 107/523 = 0.20 deaths/weekday of admission (OR =  1.08, p = 0.67). Acute kidney injury and haemodialysis patients formed a higher percentage of admissions.

Orman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | pmid = 22271668 | doi=10.1002/lt.23395 | pmc=3334405 | volume=18 | issue=5 | title=Impact of nighttime and weekend liver transplants on graft and patient outcomes | author=Orman ES, Hayashi PH, Dellon ES, Gerber DA, Barritt | journal=Liver Transpl | pages=558–65 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, in the USA, studied 94,768 liver transplants. The patient survival rates did not significantly differ from those for daytime and weekday operations. The graft failure rate was unchanged at 30 and 90 days for weekend transplants but was modestly increased at 365 days (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.11).

In 2016, an American study of 181,799 deceased donor kidneys was carried out by Mohan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27182001 | doi=10.1016/j.kint.2016.03.007 | volume=90 | issue=1 | title=The weekend effect alters the procurement and discard rates of deceased donor kidneys in the United States | pmc=4912390 | author=Mohan S, Foley K, Chiles MC, Dube GK, Patzer RE, Pastan SO, Crew RJ, Cohen DJ, Ratner LE | journal=Kidney Int | pages=157–63 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that organs procured on weekends, when compared with weekday kidneys, were significantly more likely to be discarded than transplanted (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.13–1.19). This was even after adjusting for organ quality (adjusted OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.10–1.17). Of concern, was that the kidneys discarded at the weekend, were of a significantly higher quality than weekday discards (Kidney Donor Profile Index: 76.5% vs 77.3%).

In another study in 2016, Anderson et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27755501 | doi=10.1097/TP.0000000000001522 | volume=101 | issue=9 | title=Outcomes After Weekend Admission for Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation: A Population Cohort Study | year=2017 | author=Anderson BM, Mytton JL, Evison F, Ferro CJ, Sharif A | journal=Transplantation | pages=2244–2252}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, studied 12,902 deceased-donor kidney alone transplants performed in 19 English transplant centres. In a Cox regression model, transplantation at the weekend was not associated with increased 1 year mortality, rehospitalisation or allograft failure/rejection.

In summary, in nephrology, and in aspects of renal and liver transplantation (not mortality), a weekend effect is (variably)seen. This is surprising as both renal and liver medicine usually do not vary clinical practice through the weekend.

===Haematology-oncology and other medical specialties===
In a small study of 422 patients in 2010 with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, also in the US, Bejanyan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20564070 | doi=10.1002/cncr.25086 | volume=116 | issue=15 | title=Impact of weekend admissions on quality of care and outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia | author=Bejanyan N, Fu AZ, Lazaryan A, Fu R, Kalaycio M, Advani A, Sobecks R, Copelan E, Maciejewski JP, Sekeres MA | journal=Cancer | pages=3614–20 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not see a difference in mortality based on day of admission. Similarly, in a much larger US study (of 12,043 patients with acute leukaemia), in 2014, Goodman et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman EK, Reilly AF, Fisher BT, Fitzgerald J, Li Y, Seif AE, Huang YS, Bagatell R, Aplenc R | date = Oct 2014 | title = Association of weekend admission with hospital length of stay, time to chemotherapy, and risk for respiratory failure in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed leukemia at freestanding US children's hospitals | journal = JAMA Pediatr | volume = 168 | issue = 10| pages = 925–31 | pmid = 25155012 | doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.1023 | pmc=4404706}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that those admitted on the weekend did not have an increased mortality (OR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.8-1.6).

Conversely, in a large study (534,011) of US patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate also in 2014, Schimd et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25099032 | doi=10.1111/bju.12891 | volume=116 | issue=6 | title=An evaluation of the 'weekend effect' in patients admitted with metastatic prostate cancer | author=Schmid M, Ghani KR, Choueiri TK, Sood A, Kapoor V, Abdollah F, Chun FK, Leow JJ, Olugbade K Jr, Sammon JD, Menon M, Kibel AS, Fisch M, Nguyen PL, Trinh QD | journal=BJU Int | pages=911–9 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; did show a weekend effect. In multivariate analysis, weekend admission was associated with an increased likelihood of complications (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.19) and mortality (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.14- 1.27).

Lapointe-Shaw et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27407127 | volume=14 | issue=7 | title=Care and Outcomes of Patients With Cancer Admitted to the Hospital on Weekends and Holidays: A Retrospective Cohort Study | author=Lapointe-Shaw L, Abushomar H, Chen XK, Gapanenko K, Taylor C, Krzyzanowska MK, Bell CM | journal=J Natl Compr Canc Netw | pages=867–74 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada in 2016, studied 290,471 hospital admissions with cancer. Patients admitted to hospital on weekends/holidays had an increased 7-day in-hospital mortality (4.8% vs 4.3%; OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.08-1.17); corresponding to 137 excess deaths per year compared with the weekday group. Among those who had procedures in the first 4 days of admission, fewer weekend/holiday-admitted patients had them performed in the first 2 days, for 8 of 9 common procedure groups.

In 2013, Wichmann et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22505303 | doi=10.1136/emermed-2012-201124 | volume=30 | issue=3 | title=Risk factors for 48-hours mortality after prehospital treatment of opioid overdose | author=Wichmann S, Nielsen SL, Siersma VD, Rasmussen LS | journal=Emerg Med J | pages=223–5 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Danish study of 4762 episodes of opiate overdose, found age &gt;50 years and overdose during the weekend significantly associated with 48h mortality.

In summary, in haematology and oncology, two out of three studies showed the weekend effect, both on &gt;100,000 patients.

==Published research: Disease-specific (selected) patients: neuroscience==

===Neurology===
'''''Stroke'''''
With myocardial infarction and UGIB, the most well studied disease is stroke, with varying results regarding the weekend effect.  Though there are three very large studies (&gt;100,000 patients), two of which are positive.

In the first stroke study, by Saposnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17347472 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000259622.78616.ea | volume=38 | issue=4 | title=Weekends: a dangerous time for having a stroke? | author=Saposnik G, Baibergenova A, Bayer N, Hachinski V | journal=Stroke | pages=1211–5 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, 26,676 patients in 606 hospitals in Canada were assessed. Seven-day stroke mortality was 7.6%. Weekend admissions were associated with a higher stroke mortality than weekday admissions (8.5% vs 7.4%). In the multivariable analysis, weekend admissions were associated with higher early mortality (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.02-1.26) after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and medical complications.

In Japan in the following year, a much smaller study of 1578 patients, was carried out by Turin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18946216 | doi=10.1159/000165114 | volume=26 | issue=6 | title=Case fatality of stroke and day of the week: is the weekend effect an artifact? Takashima stroke registry, Japan (1988-2003) | author=Turin TC, Kita Y, Rumana N, Ichikawa M, Sugihara H, Morita Y, Tomioka N, Okayama A, Nakamura Y, Ueshima H | journal=Cerebrovasc Dis | pages=606–11 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the 28-day case fatality rate for the weekend admission group was 14.7% (95% CI 11.3-18.8) and 10.1% (95% CI 8.5-11.9) for the weekday admission group. This phenomenon was observed mainly for cerebral infarction, and to some extent for cerebral haemorrhage. But it did not reach statistical significance. In 2009, Tung et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19648828 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181a81144 | volume=47 | issue=9 | title=Associations of physician volume and weekend admissions with ischemic stroke outcome in Taiwan: a nationwide population-based study | author=Tung YC, Chang GM, Chen YH | journal=Med Care | pages=1018–25 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Taiwan, studied 34,347 ischaemic stroke patients and found that weekend admissions were associated with increased 30-day mortality.

Five studies were published in 2010; three showed a weekend effect. Kazley et al.,&lt;ref name=Kazley&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20065127 | doi=10.1001/archneurol.2009.286 | volume=67 | issue=1 | title=Hospital care for patients experiencing weekend vs weekday stroke: a comparison of quality and aggressiveness of care | author=Kazley AS, Hillman DG, Johnston KC, Simpson KN | journal=Arch Neurol | pages=39–44 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a US study of 78,657 patients, found no significant difference in mortality depending on day of admission. Similarly, in a larger US study (of 599,087 patients), Hoh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20724715 | doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.591081 | volume=41 | issue=10 | title=Effect of weekend compared with weekday stroke admission on thrombolytic use, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, hospital charges, and length of stay in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database, 2002 to 2007 | author=Hoh BL, Chi YY, Waters MF, Mocco J, Barker FG 2nd | journal=Stroke | pages=2323–8 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found no difference in in-hospital mortality. Whereas Fang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21041782 | doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181fb84bc | volume=75 | issue=18 | title=Association between weekend hospital presentation and stroke fatality | author=Fang J, Saposnik G, Silver FL, Kapral MK | journal=Neurology | pages=1589–96 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Canadian study of 20,657 patients, reported that the all-cause 7-day fatality rate was higher in patients seen on weekends compared to weekdays (8.1% vs 7.0%), even after adjustment for age, sex, stroke severity, and comorbid conditions (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25). Smith et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith EE, Shobha N, Dai D, Olson DM, Reeves MJ, Saver JL, Hernandez AF, Peterson ED, Fonarow GC, Schwamm LH | date = Oct 2010 | title = Risk score for in-hospital ischemic stroke mortality derived and validated within the Get With the Guidelines-Stroke Program | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 15| pages = 1496–504 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.932822 | pmid = 20876438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out another (much larger) Canadian study with 1036 hospitals contributing 274,988 ischaemic stroke patients. Characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality were age, arrival mode (e.g., via ambulance vs other mode), history of atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, history of dyslipidemia, current smoking, and weekend or night admission. In the Netherlands, Ogbu et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20667853 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2009.202176 | volume=82 | issue=1 | title=A multifaceted look at time of admission and its impact on case-fatality among a cohort of ischaemic stroke patients | author=Ogbu UC, Westert GP, Slobbe LC, Stronks K, Arah OA | journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | pages=8–13 | year=2011| url=http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/a-multifaceted-look-at-time-of-admission-and-its-impact-on-casefatality-among-a-cohort-of-ischaemic-stroke-patients(9b7c21d3-e7df-46d6-a5c1-9cfb3c5f8af7).html | format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 82,219 ischaemic stroke admissions to 115 hospitals. A higher 7-day death risk for weekend admission, when compared to weekday admission, was seen (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.20-1.34).

In 2011, McKinney et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21868723 | doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.612317 | volume=42 | issue=9 | title=Comprehensive stroke centers overcome the weekend versus weekday gap in stroke treatment and mortality | author=McKinney JS, Deng Y, Kasner SE, Kostis JB | journal=Stroke | pages=2403–9 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied a much larger number of patients (134,441). Ninety-day mortality was greater in patients with stroke admitted on weekends compared with weekdays (17.2% vs 16.5%; p=0.002). The adjusted risk of death at 90 days was significantly greater for weekend admission (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.09). In a much smaller US study, also in 2011, by O'Brien et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21772968 | doi=10.4061/2011/383012 | volume=2011 | title=Stroke Mortality, Clinical Presentation and Day of Arrival: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study | pmc=3137964 | author=O'Brien EC, Rose KM, Shahar E, Rosamond WD | journal=Stroke Res Treat | pages=1–8 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 929 stroke patients were analysed. The overall risk of 28-day mortality was 9.6% for weekday strokes and 10.1% for weekend strokes. However, in  a model controlling for patient demographics, risk factors, and event year, weekend arrival was not associated with 28-day mortality (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.51-1.50).

Three studies were published in 2012; two showed a weekend effect. Firstly, Palmer et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22777008 | doi=10.1001/archneurol.2012.1030 | volume=69 | issue=10 | title=Dying for the weekend: a retrospective cohort study on the association between day of hospital presentation and the quality and safety of stroke care | author=Palmer WL, Bottle A, Davie C, Vincent CA, Aylin P | journal=Arch Neurol | pages=1296–302 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of 93,621 UK patients, found the rate of 7-day in-hospital mortality for Sunday admissions was 11.0% (OR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.16-1.37; with Monday used as a reference) compared with a mean of 8.9% for weekday admissions. Secondly, Albright et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23207423 | volume=34 | issue=5–6 | title=Comprehensive stroke centers and the 'weekend effect': the SPOTRIAS experience | pmc=3568158 | author=Albright KC, Savitz SI, Raman R, Martin-Schild S, Broderick J, Ernstrom K, Ford A, Khatri R, Kleindorfer D, Liebeskind D, Marshall R, Merino JG, Meyer DM, Rost N, Meyer BC | journal=Cerebrovasc Dis | pages=424–9 | doi=10.1159/000345077 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of 8581 patients in the US, reported that weekend admission was not a significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (8.4 vs 9.9%, p=0.056), or 90-day mortality (18.2 vs 19.8%, p=0.680). Thirdly, in a Polish study, Niewada et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22426758 | volume=46 | issue=1 | title=Weekend versus weekday admissions in Polish stroke centres -- could admission day affect prognosis in Polish ischaemic stroke patients? | author=Niewada M, Jezierska-Ostapczuk A, Skowrońska M, Sarzyńska-Długosz I, Członkowska A | journal=Neurol Neurochir Pol | pages=15–21 | doi=10.5114/ninp.2012.27209 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 19,667 ischaemic stroke patients, in 72 stroke centres. More patients admitted on weekends died during hospitalisation or had poor outcome at discharge than weekday patients (15.9% and 59.8% vs. 14.1% and 55.3%, respectively).

In 2013 in France, Béjot et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23551852 | doi=10.1111/ene.12154 | volume=20 | issue=8 | title=Stroke care organization overcomes the deleterious 'weekend effect' on 1-month stroke mortality: a population-based study | author=Béjot Y, Aboa-Eboulé C, Jacquin A, Troisgros O, Hervieu M, Durier J, Osseby GV, Giroud M | journal=Eur J Neurol | pages=1177–83 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of 5864 patients, found that onset during weekends/bank holidays was associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality during 1985-2003 (OR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.06-1.51; p=0.01), but not during 2004-2010 (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.69-1.43; p=0.97). The authors concluded "The deleterious effect of weekends/bank holidays on early stroke mortality disappeared after the organization of a dedicated stroke care network in our community".

In 2014, Bray et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25137386 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001705 | volume=11 | issue=8 | title=Associations between stroke mortality and weekend working by stroke specialist physicians and registered nurses: prospective multicentre cohort study | pmc=4138029 | author=Bray BD, Ayis S, Campbell J, Cloud GC, James M, Hoffman A, Tyrrell PJ, Wolfe CD, Rudd AG | journal=PLoS Med | pages=e1001705 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, studied 56,666 patients in 103 stroke units. The authors found that the highest risk of death was observed in stroke services with the lowest nurse/bed ratios. In multivariable analysis, patients admitted on a weekend to a stroke unit with 1.5 nurses/ten beds had an estimated adjusted 30-d mortality risk of 15.2% (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.29) compared to 11.2% for patients admitted to a unit with 3.0 nurses/ten beds (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.93). The presence of specialist stroke physicians doing daily ward rounds did not have a significant effect on mortality.

Three studies in stroke were published in 2015, one which showed a weekend effect. In the largest study, 47,885 Japanese stroke patients were included (Inoue et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26365617 | doi=10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.08.010 | volume=24 | issue=12 | title=Weekend versus Weekday Admission and In-Hospital Mortality from Ischemic Stroke in Japan | author=Inoue T, Fushimi K | journal=J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis | pages=2787–92 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Of these patients, 32.0% were admitted to a Stroke ICU and 27.8% were admitted to a general medical ward (GMW) on a weekend. The estimated in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher among the patients admitted to a GMW on a weekend compared with those admitted on a weekday (7.9% vs 7.0%), but this difference was not significant after adjusting for the patients' background characteristics. The estimated in-hospital mortality rates of the patients admitted to an S-ICU were similar between weekend and weekday admissions (10.0% vs 9.9%). In a UK stroke study of 37,888 patients, it was found that when compared with weekdays, mortality at seven days was increased significantly; by 19% for admissions on weekends—although the admission rate was 21% lower on weekends (Roberts et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26121338 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131836 | volume=10 | issue=6 | title=Mortality following Stroke, the Weekend Effect and Related Factors: Record Linkage Study | pmc=4487251 | author=Roberts SE, Thorne K, Akbari A, Samuel DG, Williams JG | journal=PLOS ONE | pages=e0131836 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Although not significant, there were indications of increased mortality at seven days for weekend admissions during winter months (31%), in the community (81%) rather than large hospitals (8%) and for patients resident furthest from hospital (32% for distances of &gt;20 kilometres). In a much smaller Spanish study, 1250 patients were described; and no difference was found in in-hospital mortality (Romero Sevilla et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26385014 | doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2015.07.011 | volume=31 | issue=3 | title=A stroke care management system prevents outcome differences related to time of stroke unit admission | author=Romero Sevilla R, Portilla Cuenca JC, López Espuela F, Redondo Peñas I, Bragado Trigo I, Yerga Lorenzana B, Calle Escobar M, Gómez Gutiérrez M, Casado Naranjo I | journal=Neurologia | pages=149–56 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Regarding functional outcome at 3 months, 67.0% of weekday vs 60.7% of weekend admissions were independent (p=0.096); as were 65.5% of patients admitted during the academic months vs 3.5% of those admitted during summer holidays (p=0.803). They also identified a trend toward higher rates of thrombolysis administration on weekdays, during the morning shift, and during the academic months.

Four studies have, so far, been published in 2016; three showing a weekend effect, one not. Turner et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26285585 | doi=10.1136/jnnp-2015-311273 | volume=87 | issue=2 | title=Stroke patients admitted within normal working hours are more likely to achieve process standards and to have better outcomes | pmc=4752676 | author=Turner M, Barber M, Dodds H, Dennis M, Langhorne P, Macleod MJ | journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | pages=138–43 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, investigated 52,276 stroke events. OR for seven-day mortality, 30-day mortality and 30-day discharge for weekend admission compared to weekday was 1.17 (95% CI 1.05-1.30), 1.08 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.17) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), respectively. A smaller Korean study (of 8957 stroke patients) by Cho et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26654666 | doi=10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.10.014 | volume=25 | issue=2 | title=Effect of Weekend Admission on In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Ischemic Stroke: An Analysis of Korean Nationwide Claims Data from 2002 to 2013 | author=Cho KH, Park EC, Nam CM, Choi Y, Shin J, Lee SG | journal=J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis | pages=419–27 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found evidence of an effect. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, their frailty model analysis revealed significantly higher in-hospital mortality in patients admitted on weekends than in those admitted on weekdays (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47).

Hsieh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27336904 | doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000004046 | volume=95 | issue=25 | title="Weekend effect" on stroke mortality revisited: Application of a claims-based stroke severity index in a population-based cohort study | pmc=4998342 | author=Hsieh CY, Lin HJ, Chen CH, Li CY, Chiu MJ, Sung SF | journal=Medicine (Baltimore) | pages=e4046 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Taiwan, analysed 46,007 ischaemic stroke admissions. They found, in multivariate analysis without adjustment for stroke severity, weekend admission was associated with increased 30-day mortality (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.08-1.34). But this association did not persist after adjustment for stroke severity (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.95-1.20). Whereas, Ansa et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27080145 | pmc=5370317 | doi=10.5830/CVJA-2016-025 | volume=27 | issue=5 | title=Patient outcomes following after-hours and weekend admissions for cardiovascular disease in a tertiary hospital in Calabar, Nigeria | author=Ansa V, Otu A, Oku A, Njideoffor U, Nworah C, Odigwe C | journal=Cardiovasc J Afr | pages=328–332 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Nigeria in 2016, studied 339 patients, of which 187 (55.2%) had had a stroke. They found presentation to hospital after-hours was a significant predictor of death (OR = 3.37).

There has been one study of stroke in (8467) children, by Adil et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27118791 | doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.013453 | volume=47 | issue=6 | title=Weekend Effect in Children With Stroke in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample | author=Adil MM, Vidal G, Beslow LA | journal=Stroke | pages=1436–43 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, in 2016. After adjusting for age, sex, and confounders, the odds of in-hospital mortality remained higher among children admitted on weekends (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.9; p=0.04).

'''''Other neurological disease'''''
One study related to meningococcal septicaemia has been published. In 2013, Goldacre et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23378233 | doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdt004 | volume=35 | issue=3 | title=Mortality from meningococcal disease by day of the week: English national linked database study | author=Goldacre MJ, Maisonneuve JJ | journal=J Public Health (Oxf) | pages=413–21 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a UK study of 19,729 patients, found that the risk of in-hospital death was significantly higher (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05-1.20) for weekend admission.

===Neurosurgery===
'''''Intracranial haemorrhage'''''
Several studies have been published regarding intracranial bleeding: intracerebral, subarachnoid and subdural haemorrhage. In 2009 in the US, Crowley et al.,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19231928 | doi=10.3171/2008.11.JNS081038 | volume=111 | issue=1 | title=Influence of weekend versus weekday hospital admission on mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clinical article | author=Crowley RW, Yeoh HK, Stukenborg GJ, Ionescu AA, Kassell NF, Dumont AS | journal=J Neurosurg | pages=60–6 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of 13,821 US patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), reported  the risk of in-hospital death was 12% higher with weekend admission (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05-1.20). In China, in 2012, Jiang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | pmid = 21725777 | doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-0693-8_55 | volume=111 | title="Weekend effects" in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage | author=Jiang F, Zhang JH, Qin X | journal=Acta Neurochir Suppl | pages=333–6 | year=2011| series=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum | isbn=978-3-7091-0692-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a much smaller study (of 313 patients with ICH) found that weekend admission was not a statistically significant predictive factor of in-hospital mortality (p=0.315) or functional outcome (p=0.128). However, in 2016, Patel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27053981 | doi=10.1177/1941874415601164 | volume=6 | issue=2 | title=A Nationwide Analysis of Outcomes of Weekend Admissions for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Shows Disparities Based on Hospital Teaching Status | pmc=4802773 | author=Patel AA, Mahajan A, Benjo A, Pathak A, Kar J, Jani VB, Annapureddy N, Agarwal SK, Sabharwal MS, Simoes PK, Konstantinidis I, Yacoub R, Javed F, El Hayek G, Menon MC, Nadkarni GN | journal=Neurohospitalist | pages=51–8 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in the US, studied 485,329 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Overall, weekend admission was associated with 11% higher odds of in-hospital mortality. When analysed in 3-year groups, excess mortality of weekend admissions showed temporal decline.

Three relatively small studies on SAH have been carried out. Crowley et al.,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; in the US in 2009, investigated patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH; 5667 patients). Unlike the group's other study, weekend admission was not a statistically significant independent predictor of death in the study population at 7 days (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.25), 14 days (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17), or 30 days (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.19). In 2011, in China, Zhang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2111694 | volume=35 | issue=2 | title=Effects of zinc oxide-eugenol on leucocyte number and lipoxygenase products in artificially inflamed rat dental pulp | author=Hashimoto S, Maeda M, Yamakita J, Nakamura Y | journal=Arch Oral Biol | pages=87–93 | doi=10.1016/0003-9969(90)90168-a | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a smaller study, analysed 183 patients with SAH. In logistic regression model, weekend admission was not an independent predictor of higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.83-3.77) after SAH. However a weekend effect was observed by Deshmukh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26928730 | doi=10.1007/s00701-016-2746-z | volume=158 | issue=5 | title=Effect of weekend admission on in-hospital mortality and functional outcomes for patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) | pmc=4826657 | author=Deshmukh H, Hinkley M, Dulhanty L, Patel HC, Galea JP | journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien) | pages=829–35 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, when the group studied 385 UK patients with SAH. They found that the patients admitted on a weekend had a significantly higher scan to treatment time (83.1 ± 83.4 h vs 40.4 ± 53.4 h, p&lt;0.0001) and admission to treatment (71.6 ± 79.8 h vs 27.5 ± 44.3 h, p &lt; 0.0001) time. After adjustments for adjusted for relevant covariates, weekend admission was significantly associated with excess in-hospital mortality (OR =  2.1, 95% CI 1.13-4.0; p = 0.01).

In 2013, Busi et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23746103 | doi=10.3171/2013.4.JNS122236 | volume=119 | issue=5 | title=Predictors of mortality in nontraumatic subdural hematoma | author=Busl KM, Prabhakaran S | journal=J Neurosurg | pages=1296–301 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 14,093 US patients with acute non-traumatic subdural haemorrhage. In multivariate analysis, weekend admission (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.02-1.38) was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.

Similarly, in 2017, Rumalia et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=28129634 | doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2017.01.014 | volume=154 | title=Traumatic subdural hematoma: Is there a weekend effect? | year=2017 | author=Rumalla K, Reddy AY, Mittal MK | journal=Clin Neurol Neurosurg | pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an American study of 404,212 patients with traumatic SDH, showed that weekend admission was associated with an increased likelihood of in-hospital complication (OR = 1.06-1.12), prolonged length of stay (OR = 1.08-1.17), and in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.04-1.11).

'''''Other neurosurgical disease'''''
In 2012, in the US, Dasenbrook et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21869727 | doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e318232d1ee | volume=70 | issue=3 | title=The impact of weekend hospital admission on the timing of intervention and outcomes after surgery for spinal metastases | author=Dasenbrock HH, Pradilla G, Witham TF, Gokaslan ZL, Bydon A | journal=Neurosurgery | pages=586–93 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 2714 patients with spinal metastases. Weekend admission was associated with a significantly lower adjusted odds of receiving surgery within 1 day (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.54-0.81; p&lt;0.001) and within 2 days (OR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.56-0.83; p&lt;0.001) of admission. But the adjusted odds of in-hospital death was not significantly different for those admitted on the weekend.

In 2012, Schneider et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22795343 | doi=10.1016/j.jss.2012.06.022 | volume=177 | issue=2 | title=Beating the weekend trend: increased mortality in older adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients admitted on weekends | author=Schneider EB, Hirani SA, Hambridge HL, Haut ER, Carlini AR, Castillo RC, Efron DT, Haider AH | journal=J Surg Res | pages=295–300 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in the US, carried out a study of 38,675 patients with traumatic brain injury. Weekend patients demonstrated 14% increased risk of mortality (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.23). However, Nandyala et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24285275 | doi=10.1097/BRS.0000000000000020 | volume=38 | issue=25 | title=Comparison of perioperative outcomes and cost of spinal fusion for cervical trauma: weekday versus weekend admissions | author=Nandyala SV, Marquez-Lara A, Fineberg SJ, Schmitt DR, Singh K | journal=Spine | pages=2178–83 | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year, in a US study of 34,122 patients who had undergone cervical fusion for cervical spine trauma, found the mortality rate was not significantly different among the weekend patients.

Desai et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26406160 | doi=10.3171/2015.6.PEDS15184 | volume=16 | issue=6 | title=The effect of weekend and after-hours surgery on morbidity and mortality rates in pediatric neurosurgery patients | author=Desai V, Gonda D, Ryan SL, Briceño V, Lam SK, Luerssen TG, Syed SH, Jea A | journal=J Neurosurg Pediatr | pages=726–31 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, in 2015, investigated 580 children undergoing emergency neurosurgical procedures. After multivariate analysis, children undergoing procedures during a weekday after hours or weekends were more likely to experience complications (p=0.0227), and had an increased mortality.

In 2016, Tanenbaum et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26792199 | pmc=5506776 | doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2015.12.090 | volume=16 | issue=5 | title=Predictors of outcomes and hospital charges following atlantoaxial fusion | author=Tanenbaum JE, Lubelski D, Rosenbaum BP, Thompson NR, Benzel EC, Mroz TE | journal=Spine J | pages=608–18 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied 8,189 patients who had had atlantoaxial fusion. Significant predictors of in-hospital mortality included increased age, emergent or urgent admission, weekend admission, congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, depression, electrolyte disorder, metastatic cancer, neurologic disorder, paralysis, and non-bleeding peptic ulcer.

Atenello et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26544080 | doi=10.3171/2015.6.PEDS15109 | title=Reevaluating the weekend effect on patients with hydrocephalus undergoing operative shunt intervention | author=Attenello FJ, Christian E, Wen T, Cen S, Zada G, Kiehna EN, Krieger MD, McComb JG, Mack WJ | journal=J Neurosurg Pediatr | pages=1–7 | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, studied 99,472 US paediatric patients with shunted hydrocephalus, 16% of whom were admitted on a weekend. After adjustment for disease severity, time to procedure, and admission acuity, weekend admission was not associated with an increase in the inpatient mortality rate (p=0.46) or a change in the percentage of routine discharges (p=0.98) after ventricular shunt procedures. In addition, associations were unchanged after an evaluation of patients who underwent shunt revision surgery. High-volume centres were incidentally noted in multivariate analysis to have increased rates of routine discharge (OR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07; p=0.02).

Also in 2016, Linzey et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27399384 | doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000489675.22357.39 | volume=63 Suppl 1 | title=104 The Effect of Surgical Start Time and Day of the Week on Morbidity and Mortality for Neurological Surgeries | author=Linzey JR, Sabbagh MA, Pandey AS | journal=Neurosurgery | pages=144 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied 15, 865 patients. This were all patients undergoing neurosurgery in a single centre (Michigan). Surgical morbidity was more common during weekend cases vs weekday cases (6.60% vs 4.65%, p=0.03). Surgical mortality during weekend cases was 0.87% compared to only 0.20% during weekdays (p&lt;0.001).

In summary, in neuroscience, the evidence is less clear. In stroke, the weekend effect probably exists. Except for two studies (by Kazley et al.,&lt;ref name=Kazley /&gt; and Hoh et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 207247 | volume=23 | issue=2 | title=A magnetic resonance spin label study of human dental enamel | author=Ferguson S, Chesnut DB | journal=Arch Oral Biol | pages=85–90 | doi=10.1016/0003-9969(78)90144-9 | year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in 2010), all the studies over 20,000 patients show the effect. In neurological/surgical conditions that may require surgery, there is variable evidence of a weekend effect.

==Published research: Disease-specific (selected) patients: Paediatrics and obstetrics==
'''''Neonatal mortality'''''
Several paediatric and obstetric studies have been performed. In fact, the first studies on the weekend effect were in this area in the late 1970s.

Possibly the first study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 59692 | volume=13 | issue=4 | title=The specificity and polyvalency of binding of a monoclonal rheumatoid factor | author=Eisenberg R | journal=Immunochemistry | pages=355–9 | doi=10.1016/0019-2791(76)90347-5 | year=1976}}{{cite journal|title=Newcastle survey of deaths in early childhood 1974/76, with special reference to sudden unexpected deaths.

The paper stated "16 of the 29 sudden unexpected deaths occurred at a weekend or bank holiday".

In 1981, Hendry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7306474 | volume=88 | issue=12 | title=The weekend--a dangerous time to be born? | author=Hendry RA | journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol | pages=1200–3 | year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, stated that "babies born on Sundays were more at risk of dying during or after birth." Also in 1981, in the US, Mangold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7235098 | volume=71 | issue=6 | title=Neonatal mortality by the day of the week in the 1974-75 Arkansas live birth cohort | pmc=1619835 | author=Mangold WD | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=601–5 | doi=10.2105/ajph.71.6.601 | year=1981}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; studied 66,049 live births. Neonatal mortality was found to be higher among weekend deliveries with a Sunday rate that was 27 per cent above the weekly average. Two years later, in Australia, Mathers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 6683744 | volume=37 | issue=1 | title=Births and perinatal deaths in Australia: variations by day of week | pmc=1052257 | author=Mathers CD | journal=J Epidemiol Community Health | pages=57–62 | doi=10.1136/jech.37.1.57 | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that "stillbirth and neonatal death rates were 17% and 29% higher respectively among babies born at weekends than among those born on weekdays".

In 2003, Hamilton et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 14649592 | volume=32 | issue=6 | title=Weekend birth and higher neonatal mortality: a problem of patient acuity or quality of care? | author=Hamilton P, Restrepo E | journal=J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | pages=724–33 | doi=10.1177/0884217503258306 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an American study of 111,749 births, found that neonatal mortality was higher among the births on weekends than those during the week. However, in the same year, Gould et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12799403 | doi=10.1001/jama.289.22.2958 | volume=289 | issue=22 | title=Neonatal mortality in weekend vs weekday births | author=Gould JB, Qin C, Marks AR, Chavez G | journal=JAMA | pages=2958–62 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in the US, studied 1,615,041 live births. Observed neonatal mortality increased was 2.80/1000 for weekday births and 3.12/1000 for weekend births (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05-1.19; p=0.001). But after adjusting for birth weight, the increased odds of death for infants born on the weekend were no longer significant.

In 2004, Luo et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 14757669 | volume=170 | issue=3 | title=Risks of stillbirth and early neonatal death by day of week | pmc=331383 | author=Luo ZC, Liu S, Wilkins R, Kramer MS | journal=CMAJ | pages=337–41 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 3,239,972 births recorded in Canada. The proportion of births on weekend days was 24% lower than the proportion on weekdays. Infants born on weekend days had slightly but significantly elevated risks of stillbirth (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) and early neonatal death (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.16). However, the higher risks disappeared after adjustment for gestational age.

Salihu et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22487462 | doi=10.1111/j.1447-0756.2011.01818.x | volume=38 | issue=7 | title=Risk of infant mortality with weekend versus weekday births: a population-based study | author=Salihu HM, Ibrahimou B, August EM, Dagne G | journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Res | pages=973–9 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another American study, in 2012, found that the neonatal mortality rate was higher on weekends (3.25/1000) compared to weekdays (2.87/1000)(p=0.042). In the same year, Ibrahimou et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22797696 | doi=10.1007/s00404-012-2463-7 | volume=286 | issue=6 | title=Twins born over weekends: are they at risk for elevated infant mortality? | author=Ibrahimou B, Salihu HM, English G, Anozie C, Lartey G, Dagne G | journal=Arch Gynecol Obstet | pages=1349–55 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a US study of twin births, found post-neonatal mortality risk was higher on weekends as compared to weekdays (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.04-1.36). Also twins born on weekends to teenage mothers (age&lt;18) had a 35% greater risk for neonatal death (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.06-1.71.

In 2015, Palmer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26602245 | volume=351 | title=Association between day of delivery and obstetric outcomes: observational study | pmc=4658392 | author=Palmer WL, Bottle A, Aylin P | journal=BMJ | pages=h5774|doi=10.1136/bmj.h5774 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK carried out an observational study on outcomes from maternal and neonatal records; on 1,332,835 deliveries and 1,349,599 births. They found that performance across four of seven measures was significantly worse for women admitted, and babies born, at weekends. In particular, the perinatal mortality rate was 7.3 per 1000 babies delivered at weekends; 0.9 per 1000 higher than for weekdays (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.13). No consistent association between outcomes and staffing was identified, although trusts that complied with recommended levels of consultant presence had a perineal tear rate of 3.0% compared with 3.3% for non-compliant services (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.00-1.45.

The authors went on to make a prediction regarding the possible benefits of removing the ‘weekend effect’: "The results would suggest approximately 770 perinatal deaths and 470 maternal infections per year above what might be expected if performance was consistent across women admitted, and babies born, on different days of the week."

'''''Other paediatric disease'''''
Mitchell et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3250410 | volume=18 | issue=7 | title=Deaths from sudden infant death syndrome on public holidays and weekends | author=Mitchell EA, Stewart AW | journal=Aust N Z J Med | pages=861–3 | doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.1988.tb01646.x | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New Zealand in 1988, carried out a small study of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Examination of deaths by day of the week, and showed the weekend had more deaths than the weekdays (p=0.0002).

Goldstein et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24952794 | doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2014.01.001 | volume=49 | issue=7 | title=The "weekend effect" in pediatric surgery - increased mortality for children undergoing urgent surgery during the weekend | author=Goldstein SD, Papandria DJ, Aboagye J, Salazar JH, Van Arendonk K, Al-Omar K, Ortega G, Sacco Casamassima MG, Abdullah F | journal=J Pediatr Surg | pages=1087–91 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, studied 439,457 US paediatric patients who underwent a range of surgical procedures.  After multivariate adjustment and regression, patients undergoing a weekend procedure were more likely to die (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.21-2.20).

Burstein et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27084114 | doi=10.1016/j.injury.2016.02.021 | volume=47 | issue=6 | title=Increased morbidity associated with weekend paediatric road traffic injuries: 10-year analysis of trauma registry data | author=Burstein B, Fauteux-Lamarre E, As AB | journal=Injury | pages=1236–41 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of 71,180 South African paediatric trauma patients found that 8,815 (12.4%) resulted from Road Traffic Accidents. RTAs were more common on weekends than weekdays (2.98 vs 2.19 patients/day; p&lt;0.001), representing a greater proportion of daily all-cause trauma (15.5% vs 11.2%; p&lt;0.001). Moreover, weekend RTA patients sustained more severe injuries than on weekdays, and compared to weekend all-cause trauma patients (injury score 1.66 vs. 1.46 and 1.43; both p&lt;0.001).

In obstetric and paediatrics, most studies did show a weekend effect. This is a concern as both specialties, traditionally, have similar work patterns throughout the week.

==Published research: Disease-specific (selected) patients: Specialist surgery==

===General surgery===
The weekend effect have been assessed in a wide range of specific surgical conditions. Four studies were published in 2012. Worni et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22411091 | doi=10.1007/s00268-012-1550-z | volume=36 | issue=7 | title=Laparoscopic appendectomy outcomes on the weekend and during the week are no different: a national study of 151,774 patients | author=Worni M, Østbye T, Gandhi M, Rajgor D, Shah J, Shah A, Pietrobon R, Jacobs DO, Guller U | journal=World J Surg | pages=1527–33 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, studied 151,774 patients who had had a laparoscopic appendectomy. Overall mortality (OR = 1.37; p=0.075) was not statistically different between weekday and weekend groups. Whereas the same group, found a weekend effect in a study of 31,832 patients who underwent urgent surgery for left-sided diverticulitis (Worni et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22802061 | doi=10.1001/archsurg.2012.825 | volume=147 | issue=7 | title=Worse outcomes in patients undergoing urgent surgery for left-sided diverticulitis admitted on weekends vs weekdays: a population-based study of 31 832 patients | author=Worni M, Schudel IM, Østbye T, Shah A, Khare A, Pietrobon R, Thacker JK, Guller U | journal=Arch Surg | pages=649–55 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012). In a risk-adjusted analysis, patients admitted on weekends had a significantly higher risk for any postoperative complication (OR = 1.10; p=0.005). A mortality analysis was not presented.

In the same year, in a small study of 404 US patients with small bowel obstruction, McVay et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25008263 | doi=10.1093/gastro/gou043 | volume=2 | issue=3 | title=The weekend effect: does time of admission impact management and outcomes of small bowel obstruction? | pmc=4124276 | author=McVay DP, Walker AS, Nelson DW, Porta CR, Causey MW, Brown TA | journal=Gastroenterol Rep (Oxf) | pages=221–5 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that mortality was low at 1.7%, with no difference noted between the groups (p=0.35). This is not surprising with a small study of a lowish risk procedure. In the US, Orman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22271668 | doi=10.1002/lt.23395 | volume=18 | issue=5 | title=Impact of nighttime and weekend liver transplants on graft and patient outcomes | pmc=3334405 | author=Orman ES, Hayashi PH, Dellon ES, Gerber DA, Barritt AS 4th | journal=Liver Transpl | pages=558–65 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 94,768 liver transplant patients. Unadjusted Cox proportional hazards modelling showed that in comparison with weekday liver transplant patients, weekend liver transplant patients had an OR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.93-1.07) for mortality at 30 days (i.e. no weekend effect).

In 2017, Hoehn et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Hoehn RS, Hanseman DJ, Chang AL, Daly MC, Ertel AE, Abbott DE, Shah SA, Paquette IM. Surgeon Characteristics Supersede Hospital Characteristics in Mortality After Urgent Colectomy. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586190 J Gastrointest Surg. 2017 Jan; 21(1): 23-32]&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA, studied 50,707 patients who had undergone urgent colectomy. They found, on multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with patient age (10 years: OR = 1.31, p &lt; 0.01), severity of illness (extreme: OR = 34.68, p &lt; 0.01), insurance status (Medicaid: OR = 1.24, p &lt; 0.01; uninsured: OR = 1.40, p &lt; 0.01), and weekend admission (OR = 1.09, p = 0.04).

===Trauma and orthopaedics===
In 2011, Carr et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21422328 | doi=10.1001/archsurg.2011.60 | volume=146 | issue=7 | title=Weekend and night outcomes in a statewide trauma system | author=Carr BG, Reilly PM, Schwab CW, Branas CC, Geiger J, Wiebe DJ | journal=Arch Surg | pages=810–7 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out a study of 90,461 US patients with trauma. The authors found that patients presenting on weekends were less likely to die than patients presenting on weekdays (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.81-0.97). This is one of only two studies that have shown weekend mortality is less at the weekend.

There have been four studies looking at fracture of the neck of femur.  In 2012, Daugaard et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23140106 | doi=10.3109/17453674.2012.747926 | volume=83 | issue=6 | title=Is mortality after hip fracture associated with surgical delay or admission during weekends and public holidays? A retrospective study of 38,020 patients | pmc=3555458 | author=Daugaard CL, Jørgensen HL, Riis T, Lauritzen JB, Duus BR, van der Mark S | journal=Acta Orthop | pages=609–13 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out a study on 38,020 Danish patients with a fractured neck of femur. The mortality rate for patients admitted during weekends or public holidays, or at night, was similar to that found for those admitted during working days. Whereas, two years later, Thomas et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24589794 | doi=10.1302/0301-620X.96B3.33118 | volume=96-B | issue=3 | title=The weekend effect: short-term mortality following admission with a hip fracture | author=Thomas CJ, Smith RP, Uzoigwe CE, Braybrooke JR | journal=Bone Joint J | pages=373–8 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a much smaller UK of 2989 consecutive patients, found that (whether managed surgically or conservatively), patients  were more likely to die as an inpatient when admitted at the weekend (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.02-1.80; p=0.032).

However, in a US study of 344,989 patients with fractured neck of femur, in 2015, the opposite effect was found (Boylan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26447407 | volume=44 | issue=10 | title=Hip Fracture and the Weekend Effect: Does Weekend Admission Affect Patient Outcomes? | author=Boylan MR, Rosenbaum J, Adler A, Naziri Q, Paulino CB | journal=Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ) | pages=458–64 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Compared with patients admitted on weekdays, patients admitted on weekends had lower mortality (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99) and shorter mean hospital stay (estimate, 3.74%; 95% CI 3.40-4.08); but did not differ in risk of perioperative complications (OR = 1.00; 95% CI 0.98-1.02). The authors concluded: "our study data do not support a weekend effect among hip fracture admissions in the United States".  This is second study where a ‘weekday effect’ has been found.

In 2016, in Denmark, Kristiansen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27097886 | doi=10.1093/intqhc/mzw037 | volume=28 | issue=3 | title=Off-hours admission and quality of hip fracture care: a nationwide cohort study of performance measures and 30-day mortality | author=Kristiansen NS, Kristensen PK, Nørgård BM, Mainz J, Johnsen SP | journal=Int J Qual Health Care | pages=324–31 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 25,305 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. When comparing admission during weekends with admission during weekdays, off-hours admission was associated with a higher risk of surgical delay (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.05-1.37) and a higher 30-day mortality risk (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.04-1.23). They felt that "The risk of surgical delay appeared not to explain the excess 30-day mortality".

Three studies on major or polytrauma were carried out in 2016. Dei Giudici et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26312113 | doi=10.2174/1874325001509010296 | volume=9 | title=Orthopaedic Timing in Polytrauma in a Second Level Emergency Hospital. An Overrated Problem? | pmc=4541330 | author=Dei Giudici L, Giampaolini N, Panfighi A, Marinelli M, Procaccini R, Gigante A | journal=Open Orthop J | pages=296–302 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out a small study (of 208 Italian polytrauma patients). No correlation between mortality and orthopaedic surgical timing was found.

Also in 2016, in the UK, Giannoudis et al.&lt;ref&gt;Giannoudis V, Panteli M, Giannoudis PV. Management of polytrauma patients in the UK: Is there a 'weekend effect'? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27809989 Injury. 2016 Nov; 47(11): 2385-2390]&lt;/ref&gt; studied 1735 patients, and found mortality was lower in the weekend group: 39/360 pts (10.8%) compared to the weekday group: 100/670 pts (14.9%) but this did not reach statistical significance p=0.07). The relative risk (RR) of weekend mortality was 0.726 (95% CI: 0.513-1.027).

In another study on major trauma in 2016, in all 22 UK major trauma centres (MTC), Metcalfe et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe D, Perry DC, Bouamra O, Salim A, Lecky FE, Woodford M, Edwards A, Costa ML. Is there a 'weekend effect' in major trauma? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789565 Emerg Med J. 2016 Dec; 33(12): 836-842]&lt;/ref&gt; investigated 49,070 patients. Using multivariable logistic regression models, odds of secondary transfer into an MTC were higher at night (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.93-2.19) but not during the day at weekends (OR = 1.09; CI 0.99-1.19). Neither admission at night nor at the weekend was associated with increased length of stay, or higher odds of in-hospital death.

===Vascular surgery===
Two studies of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have been carried out. Both demonstrated the weekend effect. In 2012, Gellerani et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22542339 | doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2011.11.133 | volume=55 | issue=5 | title=Higher mortality in patients hospitalized for acute aortic rupture or dissection during weekends | author=Gallerani M, Imberti D, Bossone E, Eagle KA, Manfredini R | journal=J Vasc Surg | pages=1247–54 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy, investigated 4461 patients. Weekend admissions were associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality (43.4%) than weekday admissions (36.9%; p&lt;0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that weekend admission was an independent risk factor for increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.14-1.52; p&lt;0.001). Two years later, in the US, in a study of 5832 patients, Groves et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24709439 | doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.052 | volume=60 | issue=2 | title=Effects of weekend admission on the outcomes and management of ruptured aortic aneurysms | pmc=4121436 | author=Groves EM, Khoshchehreh M, Le C, Malik S | journal=J Vasc Surg | pages=318–24 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that patients admitted on the weekend had a statistically significant increase in mortality compared with those admitted on the weekdays (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.13-1.55; p=0.0004).

There are also two studies on lower limb ischaemia, both performed in the US. In a study of 63,768 patients with an ischaemic lower limb in 2014, Orandi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25441678 | doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2014.08.091 | volume=60 | issue=6 | title=Outcomes of nonelective weekend admissions for lower extremity ischemia | author=Orandi BJ, Selvarajah S, Orion KC, Lum YW, Perler BA, Abularrage CJ | journal=J Vasc Surg | pages=1572–9.e1 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no statistically significant association between weekend admission and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.06-1.25; p=0.10). Whereas, Arora et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26100585 | doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.05.050 | volume=116 | issue=5 | title=Impact of Hospital Volume on Outcomes of Lower Extremity Endovascular Interventions (Insights from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample [2006 to 2011]) | author=Arora S, Panaich SS, Patel N, Patel N, Lahewala S, Solanki S, Patel P, Patel A, Manvar S, Savani C, Tripathi B, Thakkar B, Jhamnani S, Singh V, Patel S, Patel J, Bhimani R, Mohamad T, Remetz MS, Curtis JP, Attaran RR, Grines C, Mena CI, Cleman M, Forrest J, Badheka AO | journal=Am J Cardiol | pages=791–800 | year=2015}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Am J Cardiol. 2015 Sep 1; 116(5): 791–800]&lt;/ref&gt; a year later, in a similar study, did show a weekend effect. They found through multivariate analysis, that weekend admission (OR = 1.53; 95% CI 1.26-1.86; p&lt;0.001) was a significant predictor of inhospital mortality.

In 2015, Tadisina et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26019238 | doi=10.1093/asj/sjv088 | volume=35 | issue=8 | title=The "weekend effect" in plastic surgery: analyzing weekday versus weekend admissions in body contouring procedures from 2000 to 2010 | author=Tadisina KK, Chopra K, Singh DP | journal=Aesthet Surg J | pages=995–8 | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out the only study so far published on plastic surgery, investigating 50,346 US patients who had body contouring procedures. The authors found mortality rates to be higher on weekend admissions (3.7%) vs weekdays (0.5%). This is very surprising as presumably these are low risk operations.

===Other specialist surgery===
The first ENT study was carried out in the UK in 2016 by Patel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27292442 | doi=10.1017/S0022215116008161 | volume=130 | issue=8 | title=Is weekend surgery a risk factor for post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage? | author=Patel A, Foden N, Rachmanidou A | journal=J Laryngol Otol | pages=763–7 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that 2208 elective tonsillectomies were performed on a weekday and 141 on the weekend. Post-tonsillectomy haemorrhages occurred in 104 patients (4.7%) who underwent the procedure on a weekday and in 10 patients (7.1%) who had surgery at the weekend (p = 0.20), i.e. not significantly different.

Also in 2016, Sayari et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26932247 | doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2016.02.014 | volume=51 | issue=5 | title=Weekday vs. weekend repair of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula | author=Sayari AJ, Tashiro J, Wang B, Perez EA, Lasko DS, Sola JE | journal=J Pediatr Surg | pages=739–42 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, carried out a small study of (861) patients with esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF). The cohort survival was 96%. Complication rates were higher with EA/TEF repair on a weekend (OR: 2.2) compared to a weekday. However weekend vs weekday procedure had no significant effect on mortality.

Blackwell et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26804754 | pmc=5207476 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2016.01.056 | volume=196 | issue=1 | title=Early Intervention during Acute Stone Admissions: Revealing "The Weekend Effect" in Urological Practice | author=Blackwell RH, Barton GJ, Kothari AN, Zapf MA, Flanigan RC, Kuo PC, Gupta GN | journal=J Urol | pages=124–30 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, also in 2016, studied 10,301 patients who were admitted urgently for nephrolithiasis with obstruction to the renal tract. Weekend day admission significantly influenced time to intervention, and decreased the likelihood of intervention by 26% (p&lt;0.001).

In summary, across a range of surgical conditions, little pattern was obvious with some conditions showing a weekend effect (e.g. small bowel obstruction and AAA) but others not (appendicitis and diverticulitis). In fractured neck of femur, two studies showed a weekend effect, two did not.

==Published research: Summary==
In summary, in a majority (over 60%) of the over 190 studies described above, mortality is increased if the patient is admitted at the weekend. Of these, there are 56 very large studies (of over 100,000 patients). These have included 27.5 million (27514157) patients. Of these 56 studies, 29 concern patients in the USA, and 11 in the UK or England. 25 are non-disease specific, 31 disease specific. 49/56 (88%) show the weekend effect, 6 no effect, one ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447407 Boylan et al], on fracture neck of femur) shows a weekday effect. All of the UK-based &gt;100,000 patient studies show the weekend effect.

22/56 of these &gt;100,000 patient studies, were carried out on over 1 million patients. Of these, 20/22 (91%) show the weekend effect, and 2 no effect (both neonatal mortality). The median relative risk (RR) of these papers is 1.11 (range 0.94-3.18), i.e. patients admitted at weekends are, on average, 11% more likely to die than those admitted in the week. This data takes into account confounding variables, as all these papers use regression analysis.

The following table summarises the larger studies (&gt;100,000 patients) on the Weekend Effect and mortality:

==Published research: Discussion==
This weekend effect is seen in non-selected (non disease-specific) studies, medical and surgical; for both non-elective and elective admissions, in most countries in the developed world. In fact, the strength of the effect is highest in elective surgical care; the highest relative risk being 3.18 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111750 Glance et al] in 2016, and 1.82 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23716356 Aylin et al], in 2013. However, it is not entirely valid to compare weekend vs weekday mortality in elective and non-elective surgical patients; as they may not be from the same patient groups - e.g. the elective patients may be older, with comorbidities, with degenerative or malignant disease (e.g. hip replacement or bowel carcinoma), and the non-elective younger with infection or inflammation (e.g. appendicitis).

In terms of the disease-specific studies, the larger studies showed good evidence for a weekend effect in myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, AF, pulmonary embolus, COPD, pneumonia, upper GI bleed, stroke (probably), AAA; and in specialties including plastic surgery, and paediatrics and obstetrics (probably), including SIDS. There is variable evidence of an effect in ICU and psychiatry; and no evidence of an effect in disease group-specific studies in general, orthopaedic, vascular and other specialist surgery.

Public holidays, and 'Out-of-Hours' (weekday) admission and discharge, have also been studied. Public holidays may have a greater effect than the weekend. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465873 Sharp et al]., in their 2013 paper, studied over 4.2 million adult ED admissions; and found the adjusted public holiday mortality was 48% higher at 7 days and 27% higher at 30 days. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18725035 Laupland et al]. in 2008 in Canada, studied 20,466 ICU admissions. Both night admission and discharge were independently associated with mortality. Similar findings regarding weekday out-of-hours care have been found by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22307037 Freemantle et al]. in 2012; and in cardiac arrest, by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18285590 Pederby et al]. in 2008 in the US, and by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658774 Robinson et al]. in 2015 in the UK.

It has been suggested that most (but not all) of the contradictory studies are smaller, single hospital and statistically underpowered (Aylin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26342692 | volume=351 | title=Making sense of the evidence for the "weekend effect" | author=Aylin P | journal=BMJ | pages=h4652 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.h4652 | year=2015| hdl=10044/1/42383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016); two very large neonatology studies ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12799403 Gould et al]., 2003; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757669 Luo et al], 2004) are the exceptions. There is no evidence of a weekend effect in terms of neonatal mortality. That excluded, in other words, a large study multicentre study may be necessary to show an effect; probably over 100,000 patients, as suggested above.

The consistency of the effect (most show an increase in mortality of 10-15%) is further evidence of biomedical meaning, as the studies have been carried all over the developed world. Furthermore, there is a tendency for the effect to be larger in the larger studies. That the trend is almost always suggestive of a raised mortality at weekends (even in studies where the effect did not reach statistical significance) further supports the hypothesis. In other words, the effect is almost always the 'right way around'. Though it cannot be ruled out that positive publication bias could be a factor in this observation. There are two studies—both orthopaedic—that show that weekday mortality is more than the weekend ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21422328 Carr et al]., 2011; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447407 Boylan et al], 2015).

There are many reasons to think this effect is real. Firstly, the effect is seen in such a wide range of patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, the effect is very consistent in terms of the degree of difference (10–15%). Thirdly, the effect is seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.

Furthermore, to make this point, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150550 Ruiz et al]., in 2015 stated in the discussion in their International comparative study: "Due to limitations of administrative datasets, we cannot determine the reasons for these findings; however, the international nature of our database suggests that this is a systematic phenomenon affecting healthcare providers across borders."

Fourthly, in conditions where by their acute nature (e.g. AMI, pulmonary embolus and child birth), they are likely to be admitted on the day and be no more common on weekdays or weekends, the effect is still seen. Such conditions are normally looked after by teams that work normal patterns at weekends. This may also imply that the effect is strong, a ‘whole system’ issue, and be difficult to overcome. This is a concern. It is not clear why stroke has a variable effect. Fifthly, and finally—and perhaps the strongest argument—it is unlikely that elective care patients would have been chosen for surgery at the weekend if they were high risk.

There are several alternative explanations for this effect, including the hypothesis that an increase in mortality is due to a different (frailer) demography of patients being admitted at the end of the week (e.g. Friday and Saturday). There are two counter-arguments to this idea. Firstly, if this was the case, it is unlikely that the effect would be seen in elective admissions. Secondly, in most of the papers described above, weekend vs weekday data has been studied by multivariate analysis (i.e. taking comorbidities into account).

==Cause of weekend effect==

The cause of this effect is unclear. It could be a ‘purely medical problem’, i.e. the mortality is increased due to reduced medical staffing levels at the weekend. The cardiology, nephrology, paediatric and obstetric studies are against this argument; as these are all specialties where senior medical staff usually work normally at weekends. It could be due to a combination of medical, nursing and other health professional staff being less available at weekends. There is some evidence for the importance of nursing numbers, in terms of weekend mortality. In [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25867907 Neuraz et al]'s study in 2015, the patient-to-nurse ratio was more important that the ratio of patient-to-physician. Alternatively, the effect may not just be a health issue, i.e. it could be due to reduced health and social care availability (that the patient may be discharged into) at the weekend.

As described above in the Discussion, there is also considerable literature on the 'Out-of-Hours Effect'. This effect is seen during the week and at weekends. The study by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23770862 Lee et al] in 2012, looked at (and compared) the 'Out-of-Hours' and 'Weekend Effect' on the same dataset (of 126,627 patients). In this, and other such studies, the degree of effect is usually higher for the 'Out-of-Hours Effect' rather than the 'Weekend Effect'. This suggests that the 'Weekend Effect' may be nothing to do with the weekend per se, but may be an effect caused by varying staffing levels, and less intensive working practices, outside the '9-5 Monday-Friday window'. In the Lee paper, the relative risk of 'Out-of-Hours Effect' was 1.67, compared to 1.22 for the 'Weekend Effect'.

Another alternative is that it may not be a health (or social, or both) issue at all. It could be a manifestation of a societal problem—i.e., due to a combination of health-social care and other (as yet unidentified) aspects of society (financial, working patterns of relatives etc.)—or nothing to do with health-social care. Indeed, a 'weekend effect' has been observed in other (non-health) aspects of society. For example, in the [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weekendeffect.asp financial world], a 'weekend effect' is well documented. It is the phenomenon in financial markets, in which stock returns on Mondays are often significantly lower than those of the immediately preceding Friday. One theory attributes it to the tendency for companies to release bad news on a Friday after the markets close; which depresses stock prices on the following Monday. This is analogous to the theory put forward by some health professionals that challenge the (health) weekend effect by saying it is due to the tendency of GPs and nursing homes etc. to admit their iller patients on a Friday—so they do not have a problem over the weekend.

The Japanese paper by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21397380 Koike et al] in 2011, is important in this debate. It is a large study (of 173,137 patients) who had had an 'out-of-hospital' cardiac arrest. And importantly, its negative, with a relative risk of 1.0 - i.e. no weekend effect was seen. If the weekend effect was a societal problem (it could be), this might be positive. This gives some weight to the argument that it relates to health (plus or minus social) care and is amenable to change if we can change the cause(s), e.g. working patterns.

Of course, the (health) weekend 'effect' is really an association. A variety of possible causes have been discussed above. A combination of such factors is likely. And the solution will vary according to the cause(s). A huge controlled trial would be necessary to prove causation and reversilibility. This is unlikely to happen; so a more pragmatic approach will be required. If the cause cannot be identified, it can only be assumed that all these factors will have to be addressed, if we want to decrease the weekend effect. In Nov 2014, the East Midlands Senate published an extensive [http://www.hsj.co.uk/Journals/2015/05/05/c/k/v/East-Midlands-Clinical-Senate-report.pdf report] that described the services provided by a group of hospitals in the UK during the week and at weekends. This is a good summary of the size of the task that may be ahead for the NHS.

==Weekend effect and working patterns==
A small number of studies have examined the evidence for an association between the weekend effect and patterns of health professional working; six studies have addressed medical staffing, two have addressed nursing issues, and two have addressed both.

In 2011, in a study of COPD patients in the UK, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21853828 Brims et al]. found that after opening a Medical Admission Unit, the risk of death on day 1 after weekend winter admission fell from 3.63 (95% CI 1.15-11.5) to 1.65 (95% CI 0.14-19.01). Similarly, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613858  Bell et al]., in 2013, in the UK, found an 'all inclusive' pattern of consultant working, incorporating a minimum consultant presence of 4 hours per day, was associated with reduced excess weekend mortality. In the US, in 2014, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397268 Ricciardi et al]., in another medical study, found that mortality following a weekend admission for patients admitted to a hospital with resident trainees, was significantly higher than hospitals with no resident trainees.

The effects of the introduction of a 7-day consultant service have been investigated in medical patients. In 2015, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070886 Leong et al]., in an uncontrolled study of elderly medical patients in the UK, stated "introduction of seven-day consultant working was associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality from 11.4% to 8.8%". They also found that weekend discharges increased from general medical wards but did not increase from elderly medicine wards.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25947881 Blecker et al]., also in 2015, in the US, studied 57,163 ED admissions, before and after implementation of an intervention to improve patient care at weekends. The average length of stay decreased by 13%, and the number of weekend discharges increased by 12%. But the intervention had no impact on readmissions or mortality.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397268 Aldridge et al]., in the UK in 2016, found that there was no significant association between Sunday-to-Wednesday specialist intensity ratios and weekend-to-weekday mortality ratios.

Two stroke studies have looked at working patterns. In 2013 in France, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551852 Bejot el al]. found that onset during weekends/public holidays was associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality during 1985-2003 but not during 2004-2010; before and after the introduction of a dedicated stroke care network. In 2014, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397268 Bray et al]., in the UK, found that the highest risk of death observed was in stroke services with the lowest nurse/bed ratios.

Similarly, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397268 Ambrosi et al]., in 2016, found that elderly medical patients in Italy who were receiving less care by Registered Nurses (RNs) at weekends, were at increased risk of dying; while those receiving a higher skill-mix, thus indicating that more nursing care was offered by RNs instead of Nursing Auxiliaries, were at less risk of dying.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397268 Neuraz et al]., in a French adult ICU study in 2015, found the risk of death increased when the patient-to-nurse ratio was greater than 2.5, and when the patient-to-physician ratio exceeded 14. The highest ratios occurred more frequently during the weekend for nurse staffing, and during the night for physicians. Similarly, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26675949 Ozdemir et al]., in a UK ED study in 2016, found that the lowest mortality rates were observed in hospitals with higher levels of medical and nursing staffing; and a greater number of operating theatres and critical care beds relative to hospital size.

It has long been argued that the weekend effect may be due to a lower quality of clinical services at the weekend. Australian researchers [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094756 Richardson et al]., in 2014 were the first to observe and quantify junior doctor work practices at the weekend. The authors report that doctors were frequently interrupted, engaged in high levels of multitasking, and had very few breaks when compared to work practices during the week.

In summary, there is variable evidence that working patterns are a factor in the weekend effect; with nurse:patient ratio possibly being more important than physicians' pattern of working. It is unclear whether changing the patterns will reverse the effect.

== Politics ==
In July 2015, UK Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, quoted a mortality increase of 15% around weekends. This is in keeping with the literature outlined above. This figure had been used the UK Department of Health to propose a "7-day NHS" involving increased staffing at weekend.

The weekend effect is an area of particular interest in the UK's [[National Health Service]], and some have attributed it to fewer staff being available during the weekend period. The [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 2010 issued a position statement,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hospitals undertaking the admission of acutely ill medical patients should have a consultant physician on‐site for at least 12 hours per day, seven days per week, at times related to peak admission periods. The consultant should have no other duties scheduled during this period.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While much of the work of the consultant physician will be on the acute medical unit, provision should be made for a daily consultant visit to all medical wards. In many hospitals this will require input from more than one physician."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/rcp-position-statement-care-of-medical-patients-out-of-hours.pdf|title = RCP Position Statement Care of Medical Patients Out of Hours|date = November 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = RCP Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Currently emergency treatment, or [[acute care]], is available at all major [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals at weekends. In most hospitals, sick patients receive care from consultants in 'acute' specialties, such as [[Accident and emergency|Accident and Emergency]], [[General surgery|General]] and [[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic Surgery]], [[Physician|Medicine]], [[Anæsthetics|Anaesthetics]], [[Intensive care medicine|Intensive care]], [[Pediatrics|Paediatrics]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Obstetrics]], [[Pathology]] and [[Radiology]]. However, most patients are seen at time of diagnosis of an illness and treated, but are not routinely reviewed by any doctor at weekends. In November 2013, the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges set out to address this matter in a document entitled Seven Day Consultant Present Care - Implementation Considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aomrc.org.uk/doc_view/9728-seven-day-consultant-present-care-implementation-considerations|title = Seven Day Consultant Present Care Implementation|date = November 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Association of Royal Medical Colleges|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research identified that patients in hospitals fell into ten key specialties, and discussed the benefit and costs of daily consultant review.

[[Elective medicine|Elective]] services, or routine care, is rarely carried out at weekends. The provision of seven day elective services has proved divisive between doctors. In 2013, the NHS England (NHSE) Medical Director [[Prof Sir Bruce Keogh]] wrote that there is a clinical and compassionate argument for patient convenience. Other doctors state that overall patients are unlikely to benefit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Should the NHS work at weekends as it does in the week?

In 2015, Health Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt]] quoted that the 'weekend effect' in the NHS equated to 11,000 excess deaths a year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Increased mortality associated with weekend hospital admission: a case for expanded seven day services?|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4596|journal = The BMJ|date = 2015-09-05|issn = 1756-1833|pmid = 26342923|pages = h4596|volume = 351|doi = 10.1136/bmj.h4596|first = Nick|last = Freemantle|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Ray|first3 = David|last3 = McNulty|first4 = David|last4 = Rosser|first5 = Simon|last5 = Bennett|first6 = Bruce E.|last6 = Keogh|first7 = Domenico|last7 = Pagano}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'The weekend effect' means 11,000 extra NHS deaths a year|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/11845465/The-weekend-effect-means-11000-extra-NHS-deaths-a-year.html|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are now reporting the [[Hunt Effect]] - that some patients, too scared to attend hospital at weekends because of the weekend effect, have become seriously ill or even died as a direct consequence of waiting until Monday before seeking medical advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Hunt file: doctors' dossier of patients 'put at risk' by health secretary|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/07/the-hunt-file-doctors-dossier-of-patients-put-at-risk-by-health-secretary|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-07|first = Matthew|last = Weaver|first2 = Denis|last2 = Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors  state, &lt;blockquote&gt;"To assume that [the 11,000 deaths] are avoidable would be rash and misleading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;The paper was criticised by some clinicians unhappy with the findings, and a comment by a Professor of Cardiovascular Epidemiology suggested that the report was data-driven rather than based on a hypothesis; in fact the 2015 paper was a development from previous work which analysed an earlier data set in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Re: Increased mortality associated with weekend hospital admission: a case for expanded seven day services?|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4596/rr-31|journal = The BMJ|volume = 352|pages = i1762|date = 2015-10-12|doi=10.1136/bmj.i1762|pmid = 27025883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the 'weekend effect' and the lack of seven day elective services, there have been proposals for major reform to contracts of NHS staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Contract reform for consultants and doctors and dentists in training – supporting healthcare services seven days a week - Publications - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contract-reform-for-consultants-and-doctors-and-dentists-in-training-supporting-healthcare-services-seven-days-a-week|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff are in support of strengthening weekend services, but [[junior doctor]]s have criticised these changes as they do not account for the 40% increase in workload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = My NHS - NHS Choices|url = https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/performance/Results?ResultsViewId=1015|website = www.nhs.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-07|first = NHS|last = Choices}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's main doctors union, the [[British Medical Association]], is still negotiating, as they would like assurances that new contracts will safeguard against long working hours, and are fair for female employees and those with families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BMA - DDRB Recommendations - Analysis For Juniors │ British Medical Association|url = http://bma.org.uk/working-for-change/in-depth-junior-and-consultant-contract/ddrb-recommendations-analysis-for-juniors|website = bma.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junior doctor]]s (any [[Physician|doctor]] in [[consultant]] training) have protested across the country that the changes to their contracts are not safe and may harm patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Junior Doctors descend on Westminster in protest at 'unsafe' working contracts|url = http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/608568/Express-Crusade-Junior-Doctors-hundreds-protest-new-contract|website = Express.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Junior doctors plan protest against "unfair and unsafe" contract shake-up facing colleagues in England|url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13804496.Junior_doctors_plan_protest_against__unfair_and_unsafe__contract_shake_up_facing_colleagues_in_England/|website = Herald Scotland|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, some UK consultants challenged suggestions that the weekend effect is due (in part) to consultants who opt out of weekends&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Consultants must work weekends to save lives, Jeremy Hunt says|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/nhs/11742606/nhs-hospital-consultants-must-work-weekends-says-jeremy-hunt.html|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Petition for MPs to debate a vote of no confidence in Jeremy Hunt hits 100,000 in 24 hours|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/petition-for-parliament-to-debate-a-vote-of-no-confidence-in-health-secretary-jeremy-hunt-hits-10405225.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure later shown after FOI request to be less than 0.5%. However, in a [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26757573 BBC FOI request] (in March 2014), it was found that "Hospitals in England had an average of 86 consultants on a Wednesday, compared to just over eight in the afternoon at the weekend."

Research published in 2017 analysing outcomes in 79 NHS Trusts in England which had instituted 7-day changes based on the "NHS Services, Seven Days a Week" policy, showed that these changes did not result in improvements in mortality rates, admission rates, length of hospital stay nor A&amp;E four-hour breaches overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do expanded seven-day NHS services improve clinical outcomes?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11896">The '''Yale student abortion art controversy''' concerns reactions to a work of [[performance art]] by [[Aliza Shvarts]], ''Untitled [Senior Thesis], 2008''&lt;ref name="Hagen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hagen |first1=Lisa Hall |title=A performance ethics of the 'real' abortive body: The case of Aliza Shvarts and 'Untitled [Senior Thesis], 2008' |journal=Performing Ethos: International Journal of Ethics in Theatre and Performance |date=4 April 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=21–39 |doi=10.1386/peet.2.1.21_1 |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/intellect/peet/2011/00000002/00000001/art00003 |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she conducted during 2008, the final year of her visual arts degree at [[Yale University]]. The piece was controversial, and considerable debate revolved around whether or not the project was a “hoax” or “creative fiction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert-Beatty|first=Carrie|date=Summer 2009|title=Make-Believe: Parafiction and Plausibility|url=https://www.alizashvarts.com/ASIS/_.._files/Lambert-Beatty_Make-Believe.pdf|journal=[[October (journal)|October]]|volume=|issue=129|pages=51-84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Creation and performance ==
Over the course of nine months, Shvarts used donated sperm to inseminate herself as often as possible between the ninth and fifteenth days of her menstrual cycle. On the twenty-eighth day of her cycle, she took herbal medications meant to induce menses or miscarriage (although she never knew if she was pregnant). Shvarts intended to exhibit video of herself experiencing vaginal bleeding on four sides of a clear plastic cube, which would be wrapped with transparent plastic lined with samples of the discharged fluid. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/18/shvarts-explains-her-repeated-self-induced-miscarriages/|title=Shvarts Explains Her 'Repeated Self-Induced Miscarriages'|last=Shvarts|first=Aliza|date=18 April 2008|work=Yale News|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2008, the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' printed an article about the end-of-year student exhibition, in which Shvarts stated that the goal of the project was to spark conversation and debate on the relationship between [[art]] and the human body, saying: "I believe strongly that art should be a medium for politics and ideologies, not just a commodity. I think that I'm creating a project that lives up to the standard of what art is supposed to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/17/for-senior-abortion-a-medium-for-art-political-discourse/|title=For Senior, Abortion a Medium for Art, Political Discourse|last=Powers|first=Martine|date=17 April 2008|work=Yale News|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gawker]] and [[Drudge Report]] quickly picked up the story, and mainstream media reported on Shvarts’s work in the days following. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/890462461|title=Learning how to fall : art and culture after September 11|last=Schotzko|first=T.

Klasky — Yale University, Spokesperson]" April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the work was a "creative fiction" including "visual representations, a press release, and other narrative materials."&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinzie |first=Susan |title=Yale Senior's 'Abortion Art' Whips Up Debate, Protests |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-04-18 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/17/AR2008041702519.html?sub=new |accessdate= 2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pr/&gt; Shvarts maintained the veracity of her performance in a guest article for the ''Yale Daily News'', noting that the ambiguity surrounding the performance was an essential component of the work: “the piece exists only in its telling. This telling can take textual, visual, spatial, temporal, and performative forms—copies of copies of which there is no original … the artwork exists as verbal narrative, […] installation, […] as time-based performance, as an independent concept, as a myth, and as public discourse.” &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Storr, dean of Yale's art school, threatened to ban Shvarts from displaying her project unless she confessed in writing that the project had been a fiction and that no human blood had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/27409/yale-student-art-piece-may-be-banned|title=Yale Student Art Piece May be Banned|first=|last=|date=21 April 2008|publisher=|via=Blouin Art Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shvarts refused, and submitted an alternate project as her senior thesis. Yale ultimately admitted that the university “had been unable to determine with clarity whether Ms. Shvarts had in fact undertaken actions injurious to her health in carrying out her original project.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/30/breaking-stalemate-shvarts-submits-new-senior-art-project/|title=Breaking stalemate, Shvarts submits new senior art project|last=Kaplan|first=Thomas|date=30 April 2008|work=Yale News|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The piece was intensely controversial, with criticism from mass media outlets and political commentators across the political spectrum. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Wendy|date=Summer 2018|title=Going Viral: Aliza Shvarts’s Daring Performance Work|url=|journal=[[Mousse]]|volume=64|pages=250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Feminist political commentator [[Amanda Marcotte]] praised Shvarts because she "managed to demonstrate the logic that drives things like [[blood libel]]s and [[witch-hunt]]s, where a group believes the impossible because it confirms their irrational hatred for a person they've turned into [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]."

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brown University]] bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]] wrote in the ''Washington Post'' that "the history of great art is one of controversy and outrage" and that Shvarts was "an imaginative and worthy heir to" [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/07/AR2008050703373.html The Value of Controversial Art]", ''Washington Post'', May 8, 2008, Page A22&lt;/ref&gt; Kriston Capps objected to censorship of the work in the ''Guardian'', noting similarities between Shvarts’s work and “other examples of performance art that are recognized as groundbreaking moments in … art history,” such as [[Vito Acconci]] and [[Chris Burden]]’s work. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/23/bodypolitics|title=Body Politics|last=Capp|first=Kriston|date=23 April 2008|work=Guardian|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative and anti-abortion Web sites, as well as pro-choice groups and media, were critical of the project, and condemned the university for allowing the piece. Ted Miller, a spokesperson for the abortion-rights group [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] called the project "offensive and insensitive to the women who have suffered the heartbreak of miscarriage,"&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; and [[Wanda Franz]], the president of the [[National Right to Life Committee]], called the project "depraved."&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Broussard-Wilson, Samantha. [http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24532 Reaction to Shvarts: Outrage, shock, disgust]. [[Yale Daily News]], April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has since been written about in the context of feminist performance art. Art historian [[Jennifer Doyle]] notes that the “project explores the discursive field through which the female body is produced and read as a reproductive body.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/808216847|title=Hold it against me : difficulty and emotion in contemporary art|last=Doyle|first=Jennifer|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780822353027|location=Durham|pages=28-39|chapter=Three Case Studies in Difficulty and the Problem of Affect|oclc=808216847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Carrie Lambert Beatty writes that the project’s “central point [is] that what we take as biological facts are constructed in language and ideology,” noting the different implications of calling Shvarts’s bleeding a “period,” a “miscarriage,” or an “abortion.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert-Beatty|first=Carrie|date=Summer 2009|title=Make-Believe: Parafiction and Plausibility|url=https://www.alizashvarts.com/ASIS/_.._files/Lambert-Beatty_Make-Believe.pdf|journal=[[October (journal)|October]]|volume=|issue=129|pages=51-84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance has also been written about as an early example of the ways in which issues of truth, reality, and fiction are called into question in contemporary mass media. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch5-12-08.asp|title=Mission Aborted|last=Finch|first=Charlie|date=12 May 2008|work=Artnet|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doyle proposes that “the content of the performance has expanded to include nearly all reaction to it.” Art historian Nikki Cesare Schotzko writes that the “immaterial documentation that accumulated in virtual space” is an essential part of the work. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/890462461|title=Learning how to fall: art and culture after September 11|last=Schotzko|first=T.

== Documentation and exhibition ==
Video documentation of the performance was first exhibited at Shvarts’s solo exhibition at [[Artspace]], ''Off Scene'', ten years after Shvarts’s controversial senior thesis was banned. The video documentation was slowed to span the duration of the exhibition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Wendy|date=Summer 2018|title=Going Viral: Aliza Shvarts’s Daring Performance Work|url=|journal=[[Mousse]]|volume=64|pages=250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks incorporating statements by the artist and Yale, as well as the comment thread on the viral ''Yale Daily News'' article, were exhibited alongside the video documentation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://issuu.com/alizashvarts/docs/offscene_final_pages_cover_issuu|title=Off-Scene|last=Szymanek|first=Angelique|publisher=Artspace|year=2018|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=3-7|chapter=Aliza Shvarts: Material Fictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaipėda University DSC '''Žuvėdra''' (literally: ''tern'') is a [[dancesport]] [[formation dance]] team since 1995 affiliated with [[Klaipėda University]], [[Klaipėda]], [[Lithuania]]. It is a 7-time world champion and 9-time European champion. It was founded in 1965 by [[ballroom dance]]r Ona Skaistutė Idzelevičienė. She and her husband Romaldas Idzelevičius (since 1971) are the primary trainers.&lt;ref name=liat/&gt; 

Since 1989, the team participated in World and European Championships. During 1995–2006, it was in the top 3 in European and World Latin Formation Championships, taking world first places in 2002–05. In 2006–13, the club formed the second team that participated in most important competitions.&lt;ref name=liat/&gt; Besides competitions, the team performed at various events in many European countries. In total, the team performed 14 different compositions&lt;ref name=augu/&gt; (music by composer Audrius Balsys since 1997, costumes by Aina Zinčiukaitė since 1999).&lt;ref name=liat/&gt; 

The team did not compete in the 2014 season as, after retirement of a cohort of experienced dancers in 2012–13, there were not enough replacements.&lt;ref name=augu/&gt; In a press interview, the trainers blamed a higher education reform that made it more difficult for potential dancers to get admitted to Klaipėda University.&lt;ref name=60min/&gt; Additionally, the team faced financial difficulties: it could not offer stipends to its dancers, only small discounts on tuition fees. Therefore, dancers had to balance studies, work, and practice.&lt;ref name=augu/&gt;
