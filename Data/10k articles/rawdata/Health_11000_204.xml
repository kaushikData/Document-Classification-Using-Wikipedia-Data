{{Disability}}

'''Accessibility''' is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2596695.2596719  |authors=Henry, Shawn Lawton; Abou-Zahra, Shadi; Brewer, Judy |title=The Role of Accessibility in a Universal Web |publisher=Proceeding W4A '14 Proceedings of the 11th Web for All Conference Article No. 17  |isbn=978-1-4503-2651-3 |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted)  and  "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's [[assistive technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/accessit/print.html?ID=1109|title=What is assistive technology?|website=washington.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, computer [[screen reader]]s).

Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity. The concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities, or special needs, or enabling access through the use of [[assistive technology]]; however, research and development in accessibility brings benefits to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Orders/1999/fcc99181.txt  |title=Federal Communications Commission |publisher=FCC on Telecommunications Accessibility for the Disabled |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ahip.getty.edu/cyberpub/goldberg.html |first=L. |last=Goldberg |title=Electronic Curbcuts: Equitable Access to the Future |date=1996 |journal=Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities and the Getty Art History Information Program, Cyberspace/Public Space: the Role of Arts and Culture in Defining a Virtual Public Sphere. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427111220/http://www.ahip.getty.edu/cyberpub/goldberg.html |archivedate=April 27, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/technology/eleccurbcut.htm |first=S. |last=Jacobs |title=Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Fueling the Creation of New Electronic Curbcuts. |date=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/disacc00.htm  |first=L. |last=Valdes |title=Accessibility on the Internet |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brewer, J. |chapter=Access to the World Wide Web: Technical and Policy Aspects |title=Universal Design Handbook |edition=1st |editors=Preiser, W.; Ostroff, E. |publisher=MacGraw-Hill |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessibility is not to be confused with [[usability]], which is the extent to which a product (such as a device, service, or environment) can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

Accessibility is strongly related to [[universal design]] which is the process of creating products that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.udeworld.com/dissemination/publications/56-reprints-short-articles-and-papers/110-the-concept-of-universal-design.html|title=The Concept of Universal Design|website=udeworld.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is about making things accessible to all people (whether they have a disability or not).

[[File:Curitiba 10 2006 05 RIT.jpg|alt=a woman with a baby carriage uses a platform lift to access a station above street level|thumb|Universal access is provided in [[Curitiba]]'s [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|public transport]] system, [[Brazil]].]]

==Legislation==
The [[disability rights movement]] advocates equal access to social, political, and economic life which includes not only physical access but access to the same tools, services, organizations and facilities for which everyone pays (e.g., museums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/cura.12034|title=Museums and Technology: Being Inclusive Helps Accessibility for All|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|volume=56|issue=3|pages=353|year=2013|last1=Lisney|first1=Eleanor|last2=Bowen|first2=Jonathan P.|last3=Hearn|first3=Kirsten|last4=Zedda|first4=Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Article 9 of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] commits signatories to provide for full accessibility in their countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html|title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|alt=white line figure of a person seated over the axis of a wheel, blue background|thumb|This is the  [[International Symbol of Access|internationally recognized symbol for accessibility]].]]
While it is often used to describe facilities or amenities to assist people with [[Disability|handicap]] impaired mobility, through the provision of facilities like [[wheelchair ramp]]s, the term can extend include other types of disability. Accessible facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/toolbox/acc/acc12.htm|title=Accessibility Tools: When is a facility considered accessible?|website=fs.fed.us|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore extend to areas such as [[Braille]] signage, [[elevator]]s, audio signals at [[pedestrian crossing]]s, walkway contours, [[Website accessibility|website design]] and [[Accessible publishing|reading accessibility]].

Government mandates including Section 508, WCAG,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.section508.gov/|title=Section508.gov {{!}} GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program|website=section508.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDA are all enforcing practices to standardize accessibility testing engineering in product development.

Accessibility modifications may be required to enable persons with disabilities to gain access to education, employment, transportation, housing, recreation, or even simply to exercise their right to vote.

===National legislation===
Various countries have legislation requiring physical accessibility which are (in order of enactment):
* In the US, under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adata.org/factsheet/ADA-overview|title=An Overview of the Americans With Disabilities Act {{!}} ADA National Network|website=adata.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; new public and private business construction generally must be accessible. Existing private businesses are required to increase the accessibility of their facilities when making any other renovations in proportion to the cost of the other renovations. The [[United States Access Board]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/|title=Home - United States Access Board|website=access-board.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "A Federal Agency Committed to Accessible Design for [[Americans with disabilities|People with Disabilities]]." The [[Job Accommodation Network]] discusses accommodations for people with disabilities in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://askjan.org/|title=JAN - Job Accommodation Network|website=askjan.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states in the US have their own disability laws.
* In Australia, the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] has numerous provisions for accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00763|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1992|last=AG|website=legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In South Africa the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 2000]] has numerous provisions for accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/56231/65195/E00ZAF01.htm|title=SOUTH AFRICA. PROMOTION OF EQUALITY AND PREVENTION OF UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION ACT, 2000|last=56231|website=ilo.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the UK, the [[Equality Act 2010]] has numerous provisions for accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance|title=Equality Act 2010: guidance|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court, on 27 April 2011 gave a landmark order to boost the inherent right of disabled persons to have unhindered access to public buildings and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ockersz | first = Lynn | title = Landmark Supreme Court ruling – A fillip for accessibility rights of disabled. | work = News – Page 17 | publisher = Upali Newspapers – The Sunday Island | date = 8 November 2009 | url = http://www.island.lk/2009/11/08/news-17.jpg | accessdate = 2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Norway, the Discrimination and Accessibility Act Diskriminerings- og tilgjengelighetsloven defines lack of accessibility as discrimination and obliges public authorities to implement universal design in their areas. The Act refers to issue-specific legislation regarding accessibility in e.g. ICT, the built environment, transport and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2013-06-21-61|title=Ikke tilgjengelig:Lov om forbud mot diskriminering på grunn av nedsatt funksjonsevne (diskriminerings- og tilgjengelighetsloven) - Lovdata|website=lovdata.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, relevant federal legislation includes the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]], [[Employment equity (Canada)|the Employment Equity Act]], and the [[Canadian Labour Code]].

Legislation may also be enacted on a state, provincial or local level. In [[Ontario, Canada]], the [[Ontarians with Disabilities Act]] of 2001 is meant to "improve the identification, removal and prevention of barriers faced by persons with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://accessontario.com/aoda/|title=About the AODA – Accessibility Ontario|website=accessontario.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;..."

The [[European Union]] (EU), which has signed the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, also has adopted a European Disability Strategy for 2010-20. The Strategy includes the following goals, among others:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU disability strategy 2010-20: access and rights|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/101115_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* devising policies for inclusive, high-quality education;
* ensuring the European Platform Against Poverty includes a special focus on people with disabilities (the forum brings together experts who share best practices and experience);
* working towards the recognition of disability cards throughout the EU to ensure equal treatment when working, living or travelling in the bloc
* developing accessibility standards for voting premises and campaign material;
* taking the rights of people with disabilities into account in external development programmes and for EU candidate countries.

A ''European Accessibility Act'' was proposed in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/impact/planned_ia/docs/2012_just_025_european_accessibiliy_act_en.pdf| title=European Accessibility Act: legislative initiative to improve accessibility of goods and services in the Internal Market | publisher=[[European Commission]] | date=September 2012 | accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act would establish standards within member countries for accessible products, services, and public buildings. The harmonization of accessibility standards within the EU "would facilitate the social integration of persons with disabilities and the elderly and their mobility across member states, thereby also fostering the free movement principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=European Accessibility Act proposed for 2012 | url=http://www.eurocities.eu/eurocities/news/European-Accessibility-Act-proposed-for-2012-WSPO-8SMHJQ | publisher=[[Eurocities]] | accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology and adaptive technology==
[[File:Birmingham opportunities fair.jpg|thumb|This [[Birmingham, West Midlands]], Opportunities Fair was held to help persons with disabilities, and carers, to find out what services, support and opportunities are available to them.]]
[[Assistive technology]] is the creation of a new device that assists a person in completing a task that would otherwise be impossible. Some examples include new computer software programs like [[screen reader]]s, and inventions such as [[assistive listening devices]], including [[hearing aid]]s, and [[traffic light]]s with a standard [[color code]] that enables [[colorblind]] individuals to understand the correct signal.

Adaptive technology is the modification, or adaptation, of existing devices, methods, or the creation of new uses for existing devices, to enable a person to complete a task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://actcenter.missouri.edu/about-the-act-center/what-is-adaptive-technology/|title=What is Adaptive Technology? // ACT Center|website=actcenter.missouri.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the use of remote controls, and the [[autocomplete]] (word completion)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_autocomplete.asp|title=HTML input autocomplete Attribute|website=w3schools.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature in computer word processing programs, which both help individuals with mobility impairments to complete tasks. Adaptations to wheelchair tires are another example; widening the tires enables wheelchair users to move over soft surfaces, such as deep snow on ski hills, and sandy beaches.

Assistive technology and adaptive technology have a key role in developing the means for people with disabilities to live more independently, and to more fully participate in mainstream society. In order to have access to assistive or adaptive technology, however, educating the public and even legislating requirements to incorporate this technology have been necessary.

==Employment==
[[File:Usda hiring applicants with disabilities.jpg|thumb|upright|William P. Milton, Jr., Deputy Director, Office of Human Resources Management explained the “Four Easy Steps to Hiring Qualified Applicants with Disabilities” to [[United States Department of Agriculture]] employees during a 2011 [[National Disability Employment Awareness Month]] event in [[Washington, DC]], USA.]]
Accessibility of employment covers a wide range of issues, from skills training, to [[occupational therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/Conference-Events/OTMonth/what-is-OT.aspx|title=What is Occupational Therapy? - AOTA|website=aota.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding employment, and retaining employment.

Employment rates for workers with disabilities are lower than for the general workforce. Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination. Despite this, in the United States the 2012 unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was 12.9%, while it was 7.3% for workers without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Employment Resources by Topic|url=http://www.dol.gov/odep/#.ULk_D47R3zI|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor – Office of Disability Employment Policy|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of workers with disabilities (52%) earned less than $25,000 in the previous year, compared with just 38% of workers with no disabilities. This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn.Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%). The rates for refuse and recyclable material collectors, personal care aides, and janitors and building cleaners were not statistically different from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=n/a|title=Workers with a Disability Less Likely to be Employed, More Likely to Hold Jobs with Lower Earnings, Census Bureau Reports|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/american_community_survey_acs/cb13-47.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau Newsroom|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys of non-Western countries are limited, but the available statistics also indicate fewer jobs being filled by workers with disabilities. In India, a large 1999 survey found that "of the 'top 100 multinational companies' in the country [...] the employment rate of persons with disabilities in the private sector was a mere 0.28%, 0.05% in multinational companies and only 0.58% in the top 100 IT companies in the country".&lt;ref name="dsq-sds"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arun Kumar|author2=Deepa Sonpal|author3=Vanmala Hiranandani|title=Trapped Between Ableism And Neoliberalism: Critical Reflections On Disability And Employment In India|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|year=2012|volume=32|issue=3|pages=N.p.|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3235/3109|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, like much of the world, has large sections of the economy that are without strong regulation or social protections, such as the [[informal economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1008562|title=Nearly two-thirds of global workforce in the ‘informal’ economy – UN study|date=2018-04-30|work=UN News|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors have been cited as contributing to the high unemployment rate, such as public service regulations. Although employment for workers with disabilities is higher in the public sector due to hiring programs targeting persons with disabilities, regulations currently restrict types of work available to persons with disabilities:
"Disability-specific employment reservations are limited to the public sector and a large number of the reserved positions continue to be vacant despite nearly two decades of enactment of the PWD Act".&lt;ref name="dsq-sds" /&gt;

Expenses related to adaptive or assistive technology required to participate in the workforce may be tax deductible expenses for individuals with a medical practitioner's prescription in some jurisdictions.

===Disability Management (DM)===
Disability Management (DM) is a specialized area of [[human resources]], to support efforts by employers to better integrate and retain workers with disabilities. Some workplaces have policies in place to provide "reasonable accommodation" for employees with disabilities, however, many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end [[ableism|discrimination against persons with disabilities]].

It has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with "pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities",&lt;ref name="Geisen165"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geisen, Thomas |author2=Henry George Harder|title=Disability Management and Workplace Integration: International Research Findings|year=2011|publisher=Gower Publishing|isbn=9781409418887|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness. Protecting employability is a factor that can help close the unemployment gap for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Geisen165" /&gt;

===Meeting and conference access===
Meetings and conferences should consider the needs of all of their participants. Checklists such as this may make it easier to identify specific needs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/equal_conf.html | title=Equal Access: Universal Design of Conference Exhibits and Presentations | publisher=[[University of Washington]] | location=USA | accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning for accessibility==
Accessibility based planning is a spatial planning methodology that centralises goals of people and businesses and defines accessibility policy as enhancing people and business opportunities.

Traditionally, urban transportation planning has mainly focused on the efficiency of the transport system itself and is often responding to plans made by spatial planners. Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport.
Using this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the land use system (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|title=Planning for Sustainable Travel - Key Themes - Accessibility of Key Facilities|website=plan4sustainabletravel.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as "the potential for interaction".

===Accessibility instruments===
Generally since the 1960s, accessibility instruments have been developed for a multitude of contexts and scopes. These instruments have their focus on origins and on destinations, they measure access through time, distance or cost and focus on different modes of transportation and geographical scales. Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/accessibility-instruments-2/|title=Accessibility Instruments|website=accessibilityplanning.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potentials of accessibility in planning practice===
Despite the high potential of accessibility in integrating the different components of urban planning, such as land use and transportation and the large number of accessibility instruments available in the research literature, the latter are not widely used to support urban planning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Accessibility Instruments for Planning Practice|date=June 2012|publisher=COST Office|isbn=978-989-20-3210-8 |author1=Angela Hull |author2=Cecília Silva |author3=Luca Bertolini |url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COST-Report-1-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.
Focusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tut.fi/edge/?page_id=182|title=COST Action TU1002 {{!}} EDGE|website=tut.fi|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of sustainable urban management.
This Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers’ view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners’ viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.

==Transportation==

Providing mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people with wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind; dedicated services like [[paratransit]]; and adaptations to personal vehicles.

===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===
{{See also|Adapted automobile}}
Automobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted for a range of physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according to the needs of the driver. [[Ergonomic]] adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Physiotherapy|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405176156|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as [[Motability]] in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Occupational Therapy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444348163|pages=n.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a "[[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustment]]" in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Disability Rights Commission|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1995: Code of Practice ; Employment and Occupation|year=2004|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780117034198|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low floor===
{{redirect|Low floor|more details|Low-floor bus|and|Low-floor tram}}
A significant development in transportation, and [[public transport]] in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to "low-floor" vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with [[Baby transport|push chairs]]. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[trams]].

A low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard [[Curb (road)|kerb (curb)]] height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at [[bus stop]]s, or through use of level boarding [[bus rapid transit]] stations or tram stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/|title=What is BRT? - Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|work=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.

Low-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a [[kneeling bus]].

At [[rapid transit]] systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there isn't a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by [[elevator]]s, which are somewhat restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access isn't obstructed by healthy people taking advantage).

===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theknowledgeexchangeblog.com/2017/01/25/community-planning-in-the-devolved-uk/|title=Community planning in the devolved UK|date=2017-01-25|work=The Knowledge Exchange Blog|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more detailed guidance has been issued by the [[Department for Transport]] for each [[Local authority#England|local authority]]. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their [[Local Transport Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/transportplansandprojects/localtransportplan|title=Local Transport Plan {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK|website=plymouth.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.

Accessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report "Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion".&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&amp;nbsp;– Social Exclusion Unit: "[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |date=2010-09-07 }}". February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This report was the result of research carried out by the [[Social exclusion|Social Exclusion]] Unit. The United Kingdom also has a "code of practice" for making train and stations accessible: "Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice".&lt;ref&gt;Department of Transport &amp; Transport Scotland: "[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/railstations/accessiblestationdesigns/cop.pdf Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice]". July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/section/71B|title=Railways Act 1993|website=legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.

Making public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. [[Public announcement]] systems using [[audio induction loop]] technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported the creation of the [[National Public Toilet Map]], to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toiletmap.gov.au/|title=National Public Toilet Map - Home|last=Map|first=National Public Toilet|website=toiletmap.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GPS]] is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.

====Accessibility in urban design====
Accessibility modifications to conventional urban environments has become common in recent decades. The use of a [[curb cut]], or [[kassel kerb]], to enable wheelchair or walker movement between sidewalk and street level is found in most major cities of wealthy countries. The creation of priority parking spaces and of [[disabled parking permit]]s has made them a standard feature of urban environments. Features that assist people with visual impairments include [[braille]] signs and [[tactile paving]] to allow a user with a cane to easily identify stairways, train platforms, and similar areas that could pose a physical danger to anyone who has a visual impairment.

Urban design features that may appear to be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt snow-clearing on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.

==Housing==
{{Further|Accessible housing}}
Most existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. [[Occupational Therapist]]s are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational therapy research on assistive technology and physical environmental issues: A literature review, Fange et al. (2006), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy&lt;/ref&gt; They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility,&lt;ref&gt;Changes in accessibility and usability in housing: an exploration of the housing adaptation process (2005), Fange and Iwarsson, Occupational Therapy International&lt;/ref&gt; and in the design of future housing.&lt;ref&gt;Accessibility and usability in housing: construct validity and implications for research and practice (2003), Fange and Iwarsson, Disability and Rehabilitation&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad concept of [[Universal design]] is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a [[Visitability]] movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/visitability|title=Visitability {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.

===Accessibility and 'ageing in place'===
Accessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/homes/|title=Accessible Home Design: Information &amp; Ideas|work=Disabled World|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to 'age in place', living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.

==Disability, information technology (IT) and telecommunications==
{{Update section|inaccurate=yes|date=November 2012}}
{{Main|Design for All (in ICT)}}
Advances in information technology and telecommunications have represented a leap forward for accessibility. Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html |title=Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as [[speech-generating device]]s, [[Teletypewriter]] devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.

The following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:
* [[communication disorder]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.nih.gov/topic/SpeechCommunicationDisorders|title=Speech and Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[hearing impairment]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html|title=Hearing Disorders and Deafness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[visual impairment]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/visionimpairmentandblindness.html|title=Visual Impairment and Blindness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[mobility impairment]]s;
* a [[learning disability]] or impairment in mental functioning.

Each kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.
* [[Job analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2538128|title=Pre-employment and periodical health examinations, job analysis and placement of workers|publisher=National Library of Medicine | pmid=13276805|volume=13|issue=4|year=1955|journal=Bull.

====Mobility impairments====
One of the first areas where information technology improved the quality of life for disabled individuals is the voice operated wheelchair. Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheel chair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=849131|title=Voice Operated Wheelchair|publisher=National Library of Medicine | volume=58|issue=4|date=April 1977|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil|pages=169–75|author1=Clark|first1=J. A.|last2=Roemer|first2=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing arms and fingers interferes with the use of a keyboard and pointing device (mouse). This can be one of the most devastating types of handicap, and technology has made great improvements in this area during the last 20 years. Speech recognition devices and software can improve technology access.

====Communication (including speech) impairments====
A communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.

====Hearing impairment====
An individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30&amp;nbsp;dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss|title=Definition of hearing loss – Mild, Moderate, Severe &amp; Profound - hear-it.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.

Mild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.

The modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The [[telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) became available in the form of the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.

====Visual impairments====
A wide range of technology products are available to deal with visual impairment. This includes screen magnification for monitors, mouse-over speech synthesis browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, voice operated phones and tablets.

One emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.

[[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] ''(V1.0 Released 7 September 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-speech-synthesis-20040907/|title=Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)'' and [[Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] ''(V1.0 released 16 March 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/|title=Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)'' are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented [[Backus–Naur form|BNF]] Form and [[XML]] Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.

===Web accessibility===
{{See also |Web accessibility}}

====International standards and guidelines====
There have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the [[World Wide Web|web]]. The first and most well known is The [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]). This organization developed the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web "content" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html |title=WAI Resources on Introducing Web Accessibility | publisher=[[W3C]] | work=[[Web Accessibility Initiative]] | accessdate=18 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WCAG is separated into 3 levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of [[HTML]] (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into your code before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.

The [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36#WG 7 Culture.2C Language.2C and Human Functioning Activities|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7]] 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.

Another source of web accessibility guidance comes from the [[US government]]. In response to [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 508|Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act]], the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.&lt;ref&gt;Section 508: [http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=5 508 Training].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Web accessibility features====
Examples of accessibility features include:

* [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]]-AA compliance with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WAI's WCAG]]
* [[Semantic HTML|Semantic]] Web markup
* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the pages content
* Paste code of atoall in websites to increase accessibility for regional, rural and disable people. As per govt guidelines 
* CSS Validation from the W3C for the pages layout
* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act
* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia
* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)
* Simple and consistent navigation
* Device independent

While WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, ''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility – Code of Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility – Code of Practice].&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual.

Another useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/footer/accessibility-statement/general-web-accessibility-guidance/ PAS 78].&lt;/ref&gt; the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878].&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to "BBC My Web My Way"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/ BBC My Web My Way], [[BBC]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site's creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site doesn't currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/accessibility/ Example of an accessibility statement written by the lead-author of BS 8878].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and accessibility for students==
[[File:Vietnam phusical therapy school orphanage.jpg|thumb|upright|A teacher helps her student at an orphanage in central [[Vietnam]]. The orphanage caters to many abandoned and disabled children – through education and communication programs they are able to have a life that would otherwise not be possible.]]
[[File:Latrine ramp school.jpg|thumb|Construction of a ramp for a school latrine in Ukunda, Kenya, making the school building more accessible to students with disabilities.]]
Equal access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the [[Medical Council of India]] has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This happened due to a petition by Dr Satendra Singh founder of [[Infinite Ability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MCI asks all medical institutions to be ‘accessible’|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mci-asks-all-medical-institutions-to-be-accessible/article4628862.ece|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students with a physical or mental impairment or learning disability may require note-taking assistance, which may be provided by a business offering such services, as with tutoring services. Talking books in the form of talking textbooks are available in Canadian secondary and post-secondary schools. Also, students may require adaptive technology to access computers and the Internet. These may be tax-exempt expenses in some jurisdictions with a medical prescription.

===Test accessibility===
Test accessibility is defined as the extent to which a test and its constituent item set eliminates barriers and permits the test-taker to demonstrate his or her knowledge of the tested content.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Test accessibility involves an interaction between features of the test and individual test-taker characteristics.

With the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; student accountability in essential content areas such as reading, mathematics, and science has become a major area of focus in educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/execsumm.html|title=Executive Summary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001|date=2007-11-20|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, test developers have needed to create tests to ensure all students, including those with special needs (e.g., students identified with disabilities), are given the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have mastered the content measured on state assessments. Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.

To ensure these new tests generate results that permit valid inferences about student performance, they must be accessible to as many individuals as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |title=Peabody College of Education and Human Development &amp;#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Peabody.vanderbilt.edu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments integrate principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item-writing and test development. The TAMI is a non-commercial instrument that has been made available to all state assessment directors and testing companies. Assessment researchers have used the ARM to conduct accessibility reviews of state assessment items for several state departments of education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5606">A '''bioartificial liver device (BAL)''' is an artificial [[extracorporeal]] supportive device for an individual who is suffering from [[acute liver failure]].

==History==

===Early history===
The first bioartificial liver device was developed by Dr. Kenneth Matsumara and was named an invention of the year by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine in 2001.&lt;ref name = time&gt;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1936165_1936238_1936293,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Liver cells obtained from an animal were used instead of developing a piece of equipment for each function of the [[liver]]. The structure and function of the first device resembles that of today's BALs. Animal liver cells are suspended in a solution and a patient's blood is processed by a [[semipermeable membrane]] that allow toxins and blood proteins to pass but restricts an immunological response.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

===Development===
Advancements in [[bioengineering]] techniques in the decade after Matsumara's work have led to improved membranes  and hepatocyte attachment systems.&lt;ref name = toner&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Tilles A, Berthiaume F, Yarmush M, Tompkins R, Toner M| title=Bioengineering of liver assist devices|journal= Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg |volume= 9 |issue=6 |pages=686–696 |year=2002 |pmid=12658402 |doi=10.1007/s005340200095}} [http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/725/art%253A10.1007%252Fs005340200095.pdf?auth66=1427776434_76d20c763f1a1bebf23b531302253dff&amp;ext=.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; As time has progressed the sources of hepatocytes have increased. Cell sources now include primary porcine hepatocytes, primary human hepatocytes, human hepatoblastoma (C3A), [[immortalised cell line|immortalized human cell lines]] and [[stem cells]].&lt;ref name = toner/&gt;

==Use==
The purpose of BAL-type devices, currently, is not to permanently replace [[liver function]]s, but to serve as a supportive device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen J, Hassanein T, Bhatia S |title=Advances in bioartificial liver devices |journal=Hepatology |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=447–55 |year=2001 |pmid=11526528 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2001.26753}} [http://lmrt.mit.edu/publications/Advances_in_Bioartificial_Liver_Devices.pdf Free Full Text].&lt;/ref&gt; either allowing the liver to regenerate properly upon [[acute liver failure]], or to bridge the individual's liver functions until a [[liver transplant|transplant]] is possible.

==Function==
BALs are essentially [[bioreactor]]s, with embedded [[hepatocytes]] (liver [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) that perform the functions of a normal [liver]. They process oxygenated [[blood plasma]], which is separated from the other [[blood]] constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strain A, Neuberger J |title=A bioartificial liver--state of the art |journal=Science |volume=295 |issue=5557 |pages=1005–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11834813 |doi=10.1126/science.1068660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several types of BALs are being developed, including hollow fiber systems and flat membrane sheet systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2002_Groups/liver/webpage/Current_Work.htm Current Work on the Bioartificial Liver]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollow fiber system===
One type of BAL is similar to [[kidney dialysis]] systems that employ a hollow fiber cartridge. Hepatocytes are suspended in a gel solution, such as [[collagen]], which is injected into a series of hollow fibers. In the case of collagen, the suspension is then gelled within the fibers, usually by a temperature change. The hepatocytes then contract the gel by their attachment to the collagen matrix, reducing the volume of the suspension and creating a flow space within the fibers. Nutrient media is circulated through the fibers to sustain the cells. During use, plasma is removed from the patients blood. The patient's plasma is fed into the space surrounding the fibers. The fibers, which are composed of a semi-permeable membrane, facilitate transfer of toxins, nutrients and other chemicals between the blood and the suspended cells. The membrane also keeps immune bodies, such as [[immunoglobulin]]s, from passing to the cells to 
prevent an immune system rejection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hugroup.cems.umn.edu/Research/bal/BAL-howitworks.htm University of Minnesota Bioartificial Liver: How it Works]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to liver dialysis==
The advantages of using a BAL, over other dialysis-type devices (e.g. [[liver dialysis]]), is that [[metabolism|metabolic functions]] (such as [[lipid]] and plasma [[lipoprotein]] synthesis, regulation of [[carbohydrate]] [[homeostasis]], production of [[human serum albumin|serum albumin]] and [[clotting factor]]s, etc.), in addition to [[detoxification]], can be replicated without the use of multiple devices. There are currently several BAL devices in clinical trials.

A series of studies in 2004 showed that a BAL device reduced mortality by about half in acute liver failure cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/medizin_gesundheit/bericht-28316.html Major study: Bioartificial liver reduces mortality by 44 percent in acute liver-failure patients]&lt;/ref&gt; The studies, which covered 171 patients in the U.S. and Europe, compared standard supportive care to the use of a bioreactor device using pig liver cells.

'''Biodontics''' [[dentistry]] was founded by Dr. [[Edward Rossomando]] in 2001 as an area of [[oral health]].  Biodontics is funded by the United States [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research]] (NIDCR).  The purpose of Biodontics is to expand the dental profession in its research capacity, skill sets, and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodontics.org/|title= Biodontics}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational program known as the Biodontics Educational Program is held at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine every July and assembles business leaders, entrepreneurs, management executives, scientists, architects, and dental manufacturers to give presentations and lectures to students from all dental schools.

==NIDCR funding and dental educational reform==
New technologies and new educational models are believed by many to have disrupted and made obsolete the traditional models of dental education.  The 1995 [[Institute of Medicine]]’s report, Dental Education at the Crossroads, suggested that dental schools must “continue efforts to increase the productivity of the dental work force, including appropriately credentialed and trained allied dental personnel”; and, “avoid policies to increase or decrease overall dental school enrollments.”  The report’s recommendations stemmed from the fact that in 1993 six private dental schools closed; and many schools were plagued with inefficiencies which resulted in “gross wastes of student time [that added] to the student’s overcrowded week, squandering [of] patient time, and provided an inappropriate model of patient care.”  Revisions in the process of accrediting dental schools was also recommended.

In 2002 the NIDCR began an initiative to fund experimental educational programs in dental schools across the country.  The Biodontics Educational Program is one such program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/|title= The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodontics Educational Program==
The Biodontics Educational Program (BEP) is held annually in July.  The first class was made up of nine students from [[UConn]]; while the 2006 class was made up of 24 students from the [[Howard University]], [[Marquette University]], UConn, and [[New York University]] (NYU) dental schools.  The program consisted of lectures and presentations from business leaders, entrepreneurs, management executives, scientists, architects, and dental manufacturers.  New technologies, such as probiotics, dental lasers, as well as business practices including [[Kaizen]] training, were included in the program to offer students a wide range of experience.  The rationale in exposing dental students to a wide range of fields is to prepare them for owning their own businesses and managing these businesses, and incorporating new technologies at a faster rate.

==The American Biodontics Society==
The American Biodontics Society was formed in 2005 with the mission to promote an active, expanding profession that is adaptable and accountable to new technologies and procedures, thereby improving the general oral health of the [[United States]] and enhancing its accessibility.  The ABS acts as a forum for the detailed evaluation, discussion, and analysis of innovations in dentistry.  The ABS has chapters developed or developing at [[New York University]] (NYU), Howard University, UConn, and Marquette University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23227">[[Image:CWSRF Logo (1).png|thumb|Clean Water State Revolving Fund]]
The '''Clean Water State Revolving Fund''' ('''CWSRF''') is a self-perpetuating loan assistance authority for [[water quality]] improvement projects in the United States. The fund is administered by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. state|state]] agencies. The CWSRF, which replaced the [[Clean Water Act]] Construction Grants program, provides loans for the construction of municipal [[sewage treatment|wastewater]] facilities and implementation of [[nonpoint source pollution]] control and [[estuary]] protection projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf |title=Clean Water State Revolving Fund |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-17 |website= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congress]] established the fund in the [[Water Quality Act of 1987]]. Since inception, cumulative assistance has surpassed US$126 Billion, and is continuing to grow through interest earnings, [[debt|principal]] repayments, and leveraging.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"&gt;{{cite report |date=March 2018 |title=Clean Water State Revolving Fund: 2017 Annual Report |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf-reports |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 830-R-17-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolving structure ==
[[Image:Infrastructure.bank.png|thumb|An SRF Functions Like an Infrastructure Bank]]
All 50 [[U.S. state|state]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, plus [[Puerto Rico]] operate a CWSRF. The 51 CWSRF programs function like environmental [[infrastructure]] banks by distributing low interest rate loans for water quality projects. Loan repayments are recycled back into individual CWSRF programs. States can only use the funds to make loans, purchase local debt, or issue financial guarantees.  They cannot make [[federal grants (USA)|grants]] or otherwise dissipate the capital in their funds. Principal repayments plus interest earnings become available to finance new projects, allowing the funds to "revolve" over time. States can also increase their CWSRF financing capacity by issuing CWSRF-backed revenue or general obligation bonds. As of 2007, 27 states have leveraged their programs in this way, raising an additional $20.6 billion for important water quality projects.&lt;ref name="EPA-832-R-08-001"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Clean Water State Revolving Fund: 2007 Annual Report |url=http://www.epa.gov/owm/cwfinance/cwsrf/2007-annual-report.pdf |year=June 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 51 funds are capitalized in part by federal and state contributions. For every dollar contributed by the federal government, states contribute 20 cents. As of 2017, the cumulative federal appropriation to the 51 CWSRF programs had reached over $42 billion, with corresponding state contributions of $84 billion. Financial leveraging techniques conducted by state funds had snowballed federal and state contributions into $126 billion.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"/&gt;

States are responsible for the operation of their CWSRF program. Under the CWSRF, states may provide various types of assistance, including loans, refinancing, purchasing, or guaranteeing local debt and purchasing bond insurance. States may also set specific loan terms, including interest rates from zero percent to market rate and repayment periods of up to 30 years. States have the flexibility to target financial resources to their specific community and environmental needs.&lt;ref name="US EPA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/learn-about-clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=6 May 2018}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States may customize loan terms to meet the needs of small and disadvantaged communities, or to provide incentives for certain types of projects. Beginning in 2009, Congress authorized the CWSRFs to provide further financial assistance through additional subsidization, such as grants, principal forgiveness, and negative interest rate loans. Through the Green Project Reserve, the CWSRFs target critical green infrastructure, water and energy efficiency improvements, and other environmentally innovative activities.&lt;ref name="US EPA"/&gt;

== Program highlights ==
[[File:Clean Water SRF-poster EPA-2016.png|thumb|Overview of CWSRF program statistics as of 2016]]
Since the inaugural CWSRF project was funded in 1988, the 51 state-run CWSRF programs have provided over $126 billion in assistance for water quality projects through 38,441 loans. In 2017, the programs provided over $7.4 billion in assistance to loan recipients of all sizes, including farmers, homeowners, small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and major municipalities. In 2017 the average loan interest rate was 1.4%, compared to the prevailing market rate of 3.5%.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"/&gt;

While wastewater treatment projects have comprised 96 percent of all CWSRF funding to date, over $4.6 billion has gone to nonpoint source and estuary projects.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"/&gt; The number of assistance agreements for nonpoint source projects has grown significantly over the years, from only two projects in 1990 to 1,305 in 2007. The low cost and flexibility of CWSRF financing has helped the programs serve communities of all sizes. In 2007, two-thirds of all loans went to communities with populations below 3,500. In addition, over $1.1 billion in assistance targeted communities with fewer than 10,000 people (see Figure 3).&lt;ref name="EPA-832-R-08-001"/&gt;

The programs are projected to continue to grow over time, as interest earnings and repayments of loans increase (see Figure 4). Nationally, the CWSRF program provides a remarkable return on federal investment: as of 2017, the program has financed $3 in projects for every dollar the federal government has invested.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"/&gt;

The demand for CWSRF funds nationwide can be attributed to high needs, low interest rates, and flexible financing options.  The rate of fund utilization has increased steadily since 1988, signaling increased demand for funds as well as efficient state operations. As of 2007, 97 percent of all available funds were committed to projects. To meet high levels of demand, 27 states have chosen to implement leveraging approaches by issuing revenue and general obligation bonds that are secured by CWSRF assets. Through leveraging, states have increased their capacity to finance important water quality projects.&lt;ref name="EPA-832-R-08-001"/&gt;

=== The use of leveraging in the CWSRF ===
27 CWSRF's [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] their funds to increase the amount of capital available for loan assistance. This means that these states augment their CWSRF capital by issuing [[municipal bonds]]. Typically, they loan the proceeds of the bonds while investing their capitalization funds (both state and federal). These investments serve two purposes. First, they are pledged to the bondholders as additional collateral, thus more than assuring a AAA bond rating. Second, the interest on the invested capital is used to pay subsidies to the CWSRF program's local utility borrowers.

=== CWSRF Benefits Reporting System ===
The CWSRF Benefits Reporting System (CBR), launched in 2005 and adopted by all 51 state programs, produces a quantifiable record of the environmental and public health impact of CWSRF investments. Figures 6 and 8 present data reported in the CBR System to date. CBR allows users to record anticipated water quality improvements from every CWSRF loan directed towards water quality improvement. The 51 state programs have used CBR to track the environmental impact of 4,878 projects. The data link $15.8 billion in CWSRF loans to projects that protect and restore drinking water sources, recreational areas, and aquatic wildlife throughout the country. In 2007, CWSRF programs funded more than 964 projects designed to protect and restore water bodies, including 597 projects with direct human health benefits.

== Statutory authority ==
Clean Water Act sections 212, 319, and 320 provide the statutory authority for programs funded by the CWSRF. The CWSRF is authorized to provide financial assistance for the construction of publicly owned treatment works (sec. 212), the development and execution of state's comprehensive conservation management plans (sec. 319), and the development and execution of an estuary conservation and management plan (sec. 320).

In many cases, estuary level protection plans are combined with other elements of an overall project.  Where the water quality portion of a project is clearly distinct from other portions of the project, only the water quality portion can be funded by the CWSRF.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

=== Eligible use of funds ===
The CWSRF employs a variety of loan assistance mechanisms.

;Loans
* Terms may not exceed 20 years.
* Interest rates must be at or below market rate including interest-free.

;Purchase of debt or refinance
* A community's debt may be purchased by an SRF program.
* Under the ''Extended Term Finance Policy,'' the purchase may have terms greater than 20 years, up to the useful life of the project.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2006-03-17). [http://epa.gov/owm/cwfinance/cwsrf/extfinancing.pdf "Policy Statement--Extended Financing Terms under the Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund Program."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629065709/http://epa.gov/owm/cwfinance/cwsrf/extfinancing.pdf |date=2009-06-29 }} Memorandum.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Targeted to disadvantaged communities, though a waiver of the restriction may be granted.
* An SRF program may refinance previously issued debt.

;Guarantees and insurances
* Guarantees or insurance can be used where such assistance will result in improved credit market access or reduced interest rates.
* The SRF program does not disburse funds for construction; such funds are procured by a borrower in the market.

;Guarantee SRF revenue debt
* Section 603(d)(3) of the Act authorizes CWSRF's to guaranty debt.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 603(d)(3), {{USC|33|1383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guaranty powers increase the funding capacity of CWSRF's as well as decrease annual payments which utility ratepayers must pay for their wastewater projects.  Guaranties work very much like municipal [[bond insurance]].
* SRF programs may issue debt guaranteed by SRF funds.
* The revenue generated is used to provide assistance to borrowers for eligible projects.
* This greatly expands the capacity of a program in the near-term.

;Provide loan guarantees
* Similar [[revolving funds]] established by municipalities or inter-municipal agencies can receive loan guarantees.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

;Additional Subsidization
* Under certain conditions, CWSRF programs may provide up to a fixed percentage of their capitalization grants as additional subsidization in the form of principal forgiveness, negative interest rate loans, or grants.
* The recipient must be a municipality or inter-municipal, interstate, or state agency.
* Additional subsidization may only be used to help address affordability issues or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology that addresses water or energy efficiency goals; mitigates stormwater runoff; or encourages sustainable project planning, design, and construction.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI" /&gt;

;Earn Interest
* CWSRFs may invest available funds in short-term investments.
* All interest earnings must remain in the fund to be used for eligible purposes.&lt;ref name="US EPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI" /&gt;

==Return on federal dollar==
Due to the income stream into the program from state match, loan repayments, interest earnings, investment earning, and bond proceeds from leveraging, the return on every federal dollar investment to the CWSRF is currently $3 as of 2017.&lt;ref name="EPA-2017"/&gt;

EPA has projected that over a twenty-year time horizon, the initial federal investment into the CWSRF can result in the construction of up to three to four times as many projects compared to programs that utilize a one-time federal grant, depending on the allocation of resources to the program.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, 1996 {{title?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Addressing climate change ==
[[Climate change]] threatens both water quality and water quantity.  The CWSRF can assist water utilities and municipalities mitigate the effects of climate change as they relate to water quality by capitalizing costs related to planning and implementing new technologies.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt; Eligible criteria include the following.

=== Energy conservation ===
Wastewater and stormwater treatment facilities consume energy to collect and distribute treated water.  The CWSRF can fund capital costs needed to power these publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and strongly encourages the implementation of energy efficient technology.
* Energy efficient pumps
* Clean energy technology (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal)
* Purchase of [[energy audit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that have a reasonable prospect of resulting in a capital project
* [[Pro-rata]] share of capital costs for off-site publicly owned clean energy facilities that provides power to POTWs.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

=== Green infrastructure ===
The CWSRF can fund the "capital costs" of [[green infrastructure]] projects with direct water quality benefits.  Capital costs include traditional infrastructure expenditures (such as pipes, pumps and treatment plants), as well as unconventional infrastructure costs (like land conservation, tree plantings, equipment purchases, planning and design, environmental cleanups and even the development and initial delivery of environmental education programs). One of the few things the CWSRF cannot fund is the operation and maintenance costs of a project.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

The [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund#Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act|Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act]] of 2014 established additional financing mechanisms and includes eligibility for green infrastructure projects.&lt;ref name=WIFIA&gt;United States. Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. {{USPL|113|121}}, title V, §5022. Approved 2014-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon sequestration ===
The CWSRF can finance [[carbon sequestration]] through a variety of methods, including [[urban heat island|urban heat-island]] reduction, energy saving achievement, and habitat preservation.  Aquatic environments, green spaces, and geologic [[Carbon sequestration|carbon storage]] are efficient [[carbon sink]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that can be utilized with CWSRF loans.
* [[Wetlands]] restoration
* Land conservation (purchase of [[easement]]s and preserved [[Open space reserve|green spaces]])
* Tree plantings ([[reforestation]], [[green roof]]s, tree boxes, parks, vegetated [[bioswale|swale]]s and [[median strip]]s)
* [[CO2]] [[scrubber]]s on [[power station|power plants]] that provide energy to POTWs.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

=== Methane capture ===
* Publicly owned equipment for the capture of [[methane]] emitted from an [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] municipal wastewater treatment system and conversion to energy is eligible for CWSRF funding.
* Methane capture equipment can be privately owned if the project is located within a designated [[National Estuary Program|National Estuary]].
* Public or privately owned equipment to capture [[methane]] emitted from manure-containing ponds on [[factory farming|animal feeding operations]] (AFOs), not regulated as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and convert the methane to energy is eligible for CWSRF funding.
* This equipment can be located at CAFOs in designated National Estuaries.&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

== Water conservation and reuse ==
Eligible water conservation and reuse projects include:
* Efficient plumbing fixture retrofits or replacement
* [[Grey water]] recycling in public buildings
* Efficient landscape [[irrigation]] equipment for public facilities
* Publicly owned stormwater treatment and reuse
* Publicly owned wastewater distribution lines to support effluent reuse/recycling uses, including piping the effluent to the property line of a privately owned effluent consumer, as well as publicly owned equipment to reuse effluent
* Water quality trading for construction projects that generate water pollution control credits or capital projects that may be located offsite the POTW
* Replacing inefficient irrigation practices with efficient [[drip irrigation]].&lt;ref name="CWA Title VI"/&gt;

== Public-private partnerships ==
[[Public-private partnerships]], or "P3s", are one investment technique by which municipalities can finance the upgrade, expansion, repair, or implementation of new technology for wastewater infrastructure. The CWSRF, because of its unique financing authorities, is authorized to oversee (in concert with the EPA's Assistant Administrator for Water), provide technical assistance, and guidance for municipalities that choose to investigate P3s for the provision of their wastewater services.

A P3, as defined by the Environmental Financial Advisory Board,&lt;ref&gt;The Environmental Financial Advisory Board (EFAB) provides independent financial advice to EPA. ''See'' [https://www.epa.gov/waterfinancecenter/efab EFAB].&lt;/ref&gt; is a contractual, institutional, or other relationship between government and a private sector entity that results in sharing of duties, risks, and rewards of providing a service in which the government has an interest, recognizing that the government retains ultimate responsibility for insuring that social needs and objectives are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title="Public-Private Partnerships in the Provision of Water and Wastewater Services: Barriers and Incentives" |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100AM1T.PDF?Dockey=P100AM1T.PDF |author=U.S. Environmental Financial Advisory Board |date=April 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P3s are sought by states and local governments as a way to reduce the financial burden of [[water pollution]] and infrastructure needs.  It has been estimated that, of the costly capital improvements, upgrades, expansions, and new compliance requirements imposed on water and wastewater utilities, local governments bear 95% of the costs. Among local government expenditures, only education is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Conference of Mayors]]. Washington, DC (2007).

Local Government Expenditures on Sewer and Water-1991 to 2005."] Accessed 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ==
Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously-authorized revolving funds for wastewater and drinking water.&lt;ref name=WIFIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramseur |first1=Jonathan L. |last2=Tiemann |first2=Mary |title=Water Infrastructure Financing: The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program |date=September 26, 2018 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, DC |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43315.pdf |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the act, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn About the WIFIA Program |url=https://www.epa.gov/wifia/learn-about-wifia-program |date=2018-04-18 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;United States.&lt;br&gt;1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25606">The '''Clinical Care Classification''' ('''CCC''') '''System''' is a standardized, coded nursing terminology that identifies the discrete elements of [[nursing]] practice. The CCC provides a unique framework and coding structure. Used for documenting the plan of care; following the nursing process in all health care settings.&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2005). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) of Nursing Interventions. Retrieved December 15, 2005, from http://www.sabacare.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clinical Care Classification (CCC), previously the Home Health Care Classification (HHCC), was originally created to document nursing care in home health and ambulatory care settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saba | first1 = V | year = 1997 | title = Why the Home Health Care Classification is a recognized nursing nomenclature | url = | journal = Computers in Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 569–576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically designed for clinical information systems, the CCC facilitates nursing documentation at the point-of-care. The CCC was developed empirically through the examination of approximately 40,000 textual phrases representing nursing diagnoses/patient problems, and 72,000 phrases depicting patient care services and/or actions. The use of the CCC has expanded into other settings, and it is claimed to be appropriate for multidisciplinary documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1560509 | pmid=16779099 | title=Representing critical care data using the clinical care classification | year=2005 | journal=AMIA Annu Symp Proc | pages=545–9 | last1 = Moss | first1 = JA | last2 = Damrongsak | first2 = M | last3 = Gallichio | first3 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCC, capturing the essence of patient care, consists of two interrelated terminologies – the CCC of Nursing Diagnoses &amp; Outcomes and the CCC of Nursing Interventions &amp; and Actions – classified by 21 Care Components that link the two together. This merge enables a roadmap to other health-related classification systems.

The Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System is an [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA)-recognized comprehensive, coded, nursing terminology standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nursingworld.org/npii/ccc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184852/http://nursingworld.org/npii/ccc.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the CCC was accepted by the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthit/documents/m20070123/012207letter.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first national nursing terminology.&lt;ref&gt;American Health Information Community Meeting 31 October 2006, {{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/healthit/community/meetings/m20061031.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017121804/http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/community/meetings/m20061031.html |archivedate=2011-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Nursing Informatics (ANI), News of 12 February 2007 http://www.allianceni.org/docs/news012007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The computable structure of the CCC System allows nurses, allied health professionals, and researchers to determine; care needs (resources), workload (productivity), and outcomes (quality).

==History==
In 1988 to 1990, [[Harriet Werley]] established the Nursing Minimum Data Set, which consisted of 12 variables: 8 variables focused on patient demographics and the remaining 4 focused on nursing practice. These were (a) nursing diagnoses, (b) nursing interventions, (c) nursing outcomes, and (d) nursing intensity. The Nursing Minimum Data Set became the basis for the nursing classification standards recognized by the ANA.&lt;ref&gt;(Werley &amp; Lang, 1988. Identification of Nursing Minimum Data Set (NMDS).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the CCAIN was renamed the Database Steering Committee.

In 1991, the Database Steering Committee submitted to the Congress on Nursing Practice a resolution that NI be adopted as a new nursing specialty. This submission which was accepted,  leading to the development of the Nursing Informatics: Scope and Standards of Practice&lt;ref&gt;(ANA, 2008). Nursing Informatics: Scope and Standards of Practice. Sliver Spring, MD:ANA&lt;/ref&gt; and the certification of NI specialists. In 1992, the Database Steering Committee developed the criteria, recognizing the first 4 of 12 nursing classifications/terminologies. One being the CCC System. Previously known as the Home Health Care Classification System, as nursing standards for the documentation of nursing practice using computer technology systems.&lt;ref&gt;(Saba, 2011). Overview of the Clinical Care Classification: A national nursing standard coded terminology.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANA subsequently submitted the four of six classifications/terminologies to the National Library of Medicine for input into its developing Unified Medical Language System’s (UMLS) Metathesaurus.

In 2006, President George W. Bush issued an Executive Order (No. 13410) that every person in the country should have an EHR by 2014.  In 2007/2008, the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel selected and recommended the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System as the first national nursing terminology inter operable for the exchange of information among HIT systems. The CCC System was one of the standards in the first set of 55 national standards approved for use in the EHR, by the Department of Health and Human Services (AHIC, 2006) and the only national nursing terminology standard.

*Uses a framework of care components to classify the two CCC System terminologies and represent 4 healthcare patterns focusing on a holistic approach to patient care. 
*Consists of flexible, adaptable, and expandable concepts/data elements.

==The CCC Model==
The CCC Model depicts the documentation of patient care by nurses and allied health providers in any health care setting as an interactive, interrelated, and continuous feedback process. The CCC Model illustrates the relationship between the CCC of Nursing Diagnoses and Outcomes and the CCC of Nursing Interventions and Actions. The arrows are bi-directional indicating the continual flow and feedback among the three major concepts: 
* Nursing Diagnoses
* Interventions
* Outcomes.

==System framework==
* Components:
:A nursing care component is defined as a cluster of elements that represents a unique pattern of clinical care nursing practice; namely, Health Behavioral, Functional, Physiological, and Psychological.

* Nursing Diagnoses:
:A clinical judgment about the healthcare consumer’s response to actual or potential health conditions or needs. The diagnosis provides the basis for determination of a plan to achieve expected outcomes. Registered nurses utilize nursing and medical diagnoses depending upon education and clinical preparation and legal authority” &lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association. (2010). Nursing: Scrope and Standards of Practice. Sliver Spring p.64&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Nursing Interventions:
:A nursing intervention is defined as a single nursing action – treatment, procedure or activity – designed to achieve an outcome to a diagnosis, nursing or medical, for which the nurse is accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2007). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System manual: A guide to nursing documentation. New York: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Patient services are usually initiated as medical orders by a referring physician and reviewed by the admitting nurse. As part of the admission assessment the primary nurse also determines the nursing orders based on the signs and symptoms, diagnoses, and expected outcomes/goals; and together, form the plan of care that requires the nursing interventions following the [[nursing process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabacare.com/Interventions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105170524/http://www.sabacare.com/Interventions/ |archivedate=2013-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nursing Outcomes:
:The CCC of Nursing Outcomes Version 2.5 consists of 528 concepts derived from the three qualifiers used to modify the 176 Nursing Diagnoses: Improve(d), Stabilize(d), or Deteriorate(d). These three qualifiers depict the Expected Outcomes and Actual Outcomes – totaling 528 nursing outcome concepts. The Expected Outcomes represent the goal of patient care in future tense as Will: Improve, Stabilize, or Deteriorate whereas the Actual Outcomes represent whether the goals were met or not met using the qualifiers in the past tense as Improved, Stabilized, or Deteriorated.

The CCC System consists of discrete atomic-level data elements that encompasses nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. The CCC is a nursing terminology specifically developed for computerization: e.g. electronic healthcare information systems (EHR), computer-based patient records (CPR), and Clinical Information Systems (CIS), from research which collected live patient care data. The CCC System describes the six steps of the nursing process:

 
* Assessment
* Diagnosis
* Outcome Identification
* Planning
* Implementation
* Evaluation

The nursing process is the standard of professional nursing practice recognized by the ANA for clinical decision making in a coded, standardized framework. The CCC supports the exchange of nursing information and makes available for data retrieval and analysis in the electronic health record and health information record systems databases specifically linking nursing diagnoses to nursing interventions to nursing outcomes.

The Clinical Care Classification System was developed from a research study conducted by [[Virginia Saba|Dr. Virginia K. Saba]] and a research team through a contract with the Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA),&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (1991). Home health care classification project. Washington, DC: Georgetown University (NTIS No. PB 92-177013/AS)&lt;/ref&gt; currently known as the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS).  The objective was to develop a computerized method for assessing and classifying patients for the prediction of nursing resources needs and for evaluating the outcomes of care. "To accomplish this goal, data on actual resource use, that could objectively be measured, was collected and used to predict resource requirements" (Saba, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K.

Retrieved March 16, 2011 from http://nursingworld.org/ojin/tpc7/tpc7_7htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCC System was developed from retrospective research data from 8,967 patient records from a sample of 800 organizations randomly stratified by staff size, type of ownership, and geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saba | first1 = V. K. | year = 1992 | title = The classification of home health care nursing diagnoses and interventions | url = | journal = Caring | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 50–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology was applied to a national sample of home health agencies that provided all services and products (Spradley &amp; Dorsey, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Spradley, B. W., &amp; Dorsey, B. (1985). Home health care. In B. W. Spradley (Ed.), Community health nursing. Boston, MA: Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Saba and the research team analyzed and coded the research from 10,000 patient records from which the team obtained more than 70,000 statements focusing on nursing interventions and actions provided to patients. Also used were 40,000 diagnostic conditions and problems describing patient care needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saba | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Zuckerman | first2 = A.

The CCC System is a standardized framework consisting of four levels designed to allow nursing data to flow upward as well as downward. At the highest level the CCC System Framework consists of four healthcare patterns (Saba, 2007):&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2007). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System manual: A guide to nursing documentation. New York: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Health Behavioral
* Functional
* Physiological
* Psychological

Each represents a different set of Care Components. The second level consists of the 21 Care Components which serve to classify the two terminologies and define as a cluster of elements that depict one of four healthcare patterns. The third level consists of:

* 182 nursing diagnosis concepts representing concrete patient problems
* 792 nursing interventions and actions (198 interventions each with one of 4 action types (assess, perform, teach, and manage) each depicting a unique single atomic-level concept

The fourth level is represented by the expected and actual outcomes 182 diagnoses each with one of three outcomes for Expected Outcome (Saba, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;154):

* '''Improve''' or resolve patient's condition 
* '''Stabilize''' or maintain patient's condition 
* '''Support''' deterioration of  patient's condition

And one of three outcomes for Actual Outcome:

* '''Improved''' or resolved patient's condition 
* '''Stabilized''' or maintained patient's condition 
* '''Deteriorated''' or died

The CCC System uses a five-character structure to code the two terminologies: (1) CCC of Nursing Diagnoses and Outcomes and (2) CCC of Nursing Interventions and Actions. The CCC coding structure is paced on the format of the ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision: Volume 1, [[WHO]], 1992''. The coding strategy for each terminology consists of the following (Saba, 2007):&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2007). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System manual: A guide to nursing documentation. New York: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic shows examples of the coding structure for a CCC diagnosis code and a CCC intervention code.

[[File:CCC Code Hierarchy.jpg|right|alt=Two examples of CCC codes showing the derivation of the character positions|Illustration of CCC Code Structure]]
* First position: One alphabetic character code for Care Component (A to U);
* Second and Third positions: Two-digit code for a Core Concept (major category) followed by a decimal point; 
* Fourth position: One-digit code  for a subcategory, if available, followed by a  decimal point;
* Fifth position: One-digit code for: one of three Expected or Actual Outcomes and /or; one of four Nursing Intervention Action Types. 
* There are 4 CCC Action Types derived from the frequencies analyzed in the research study of 70,000 textual phrases described above.

The significance of the CCC is a nursing terminology that completes the missing link needed to address nursing contribution to healthcare quality. Nursing care may be the most critical factor in a patient’s treatment and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, S. (2005). Nursing Against the Odds: How Health Care Cost Cutting, Media Stereotypes, and Medical Hubris Undermine Nurses and Patient Care.

RWJF Online. Retrieved April 24, 2011 from http://www.rwjf.org/pr/product.jsp?id=66949&amp;cid=XEM_1177165&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefit of the CCC is the ability to represent the essence of nursing care in health information systems and applications during any patient care, transfer or transition. The CCC supports the mandate of accrediting organizations to reconcile patient-centered information ([[The Joint Commission]], 2011) [http://www.jointcommission.org] and supports the informational exchange and data integrity requirements of CMS and the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for meaningful use when patient data is exchanged by using the Nurse Process recognized for professional nursing.

* Standardized professional documentation)
* Standardized data on nursing interventions for evidence-based practice and research 
* Re-usable health data for cross-organization exchange comparisons
* Documented outcomes by nursing diagnoses 
* Standardized quality outcomes comparisons by nursing intervention and action type

The computable structure of the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System in the public domain (copyright permission) promotes the system upgrades of existing electronic healthcare information systems. The system architecture of the CCC offers a return on investment with discrete atomic-level data to describe the impact of nursing care on care quality, productivity (workload), resources (staffing), and outcomes management.&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K., &amp; McCormick, K. A. (2011). Essentials of Nursing Informatics (5th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community Therapeutic Care''' is a new approach to dealing with [[acute malnutrition]].

Community-based Therapeutic Care (CTC) was developed to improve the coverage and impact of selective feeding programs for the treatment of acute malnutrition. Its central innovation is to provide therapeutic feeding in the home.

Before the development of CTC, the traditional way of treating malnutrition was through therapeutic feeding centers: large centers where patients are admitted for an average of 30 days. Carers of malnourished children often have to travel long distances to access these centers, many having to leave the rest of their children at home for three weeks or longer.

Until recently, therapeutic feeding centers, that require long inpatient stays, have been the only accepted mode of treatment for severe acute malnutrition. CTC programmes treat the majority of these cases at home and aim to restrict inpatient care to only those suffering from acute malnutrition with medical complications. They use decentralised networks of outpatient treatment sites to provide a take-home food ration known as Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) along with routine medicines.

By providing easy access and reducing the [[opportunity cost]]s associated with enrollment in a therapeutic feeding programme, the CTC model increases the coverage and impact of humanitarian feeding interventions.

During the early years, the focus of CTC was on developing and demonstrating a model that can achieve rapid and widespread impact on the [[mortality and morbidity]] of children under five in emergency situations. Data from CTC programmes demonstrate that CTC can achieve very high coverage and excellent recovery rates. CTC has gained widespread acceptance in the [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] sector and is now the preferred model for selective feeding in emergency contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">In [[Celtic mythology]], '''Condatis''' ("waters meet") was a [[deity]] worshipped primarily in northern [[Roman Britain|Britain]] but also in [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Arbre Celtique.'' [http://www.arbre-celtique.com/approfondissements/divinites/inventaire-div/div_liste.php?nomdiv=Condatis "Condatis"]&lt;/ref&gt; He was associated with the confluences of rivers, in particular the [[River Wear]] which runs its course largely within [[County Durham]]. Condatis is known from several inscriptions in Britain and a single inscription found at Alonnes, Sarthe, France.  In each case he is equated with the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].

In 1886, a Roman altar was discovered near the Roman station at [[Chester-le-Street]], where the [[Cong Burn]] joins the River Wear. The altar was buried six feet deep in soil of an alluvial character. The inscription, which was to DEO marti CONDATI, was formed by a series of punctures. The altar probably belonged to the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. A fragmentary altar bearing the Inscription MARTI CONDATI has been found in Bowes, near [[Barnard Castle]] in County Durham and another in Piercebridge, the site of a Roman fort, also in County Durham. Recently a new inscription to Condatis has been discovered at Cramond in the Lothian region of Scotland (AE 1978, 451; dedicated to d(eo) M(arti) Con[dati]).

In Roman times he was equated with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], probably in his healing function.  The association with the confluence of waters would tend to link this deity with the prevalent Celtic cult of thermal waters rather than solely with war. Again, this may reflect the origins of Condatis as a protector of aberau (the confluence of waters) with his martial aspect only being predominant in the Roman world.

The name Condatis is derived from condate and means 'God of the Confluence'. Names with the root 'condate' are found in place-names such as Condé sur Itan and Condat Cantal in France as well as the ancient name of Northwich in Cheshire Condate. Condate was also the Celtic name of [[Rennes]], then the city of the [[:fr:Redones|Redones]] and now the capital of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]].

[[File:Davis Inlet 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Innu traders gathered outside the Hudson's Bay Company post in Davis Inlet, August 1903]]
'''Davis Inlet''' was a [[Naskapi]] community in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], formerly inhabited by the [[Mushuau Innu First Nation]]. It was named for its adjacent [[fjord]], itself named for its non-aboriginal discoverer, [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]].

==Settlement==
The community developed around 1924 during a period of sparse [[caribou]] populations when the Innu began spending their summers along the shoreline of Davis Inlet. This location was chosen because of its accessibility, its offering of other non-caribou food sources, and the presence of a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] [[trading post]] that was able to supply [[Animal trapping|traps]], [[ammunition]], [[tobacco]], [[butter]], [[sugar]] and [[flour]] to the Innu in exchange for [[fur]]s. Davis Inlet was also frequented by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[missionary|missionaries]], whom the Innu found helpful. In the following years the Innu began [[sedentarization|transitioning]] from a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle to a more [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] one, travelling inland to hunt caribou in the fall and winter, but spending the summer at Davis Inlet. Without prior consultation, in 1948 the Newfoundland government [[population transfer|relocated]] the Innu of Davis Inlet to the small community of Nutak in northern Labrador, promising better opportunities for [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]. However, two years later the Innu surprised government officials by returning to Davis Inlet, having made their way back through the interior of Labrador on foot. The government continued to consider relocation of the Innu, and in 1967 with the urging of government officials and missionaries the Innu of Davis Inlet moved and settled on Iluikoyak Island on a year-round basis, establishing the Davis Inlet community (known as Utshimasits by the Innu).&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press |first1=Harold |year=1995 |title=Davis Inlet in Crisis: Will the lessons ever be learned? |journal=Canadian Journal of Native Studies |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=187–209 |url=http://www2.brandonu.ca/library/cjns/15.2/press.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080657/http://www2.brandonu.ca/library/cjns/15.2/press.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social problems==
Problems with the new site for the Davis Inlet community began as early as 1969. Settling on Iluikoyak Island inhibited the ability of the Innu to continue their traditional means of providing food by hunting caribou on the mainland and the community struggled adapting to its new-found dependence on store-bought food. Iluikoyak Island is solid rock, and because working the rock was seen as too expensive, the houses provided by the government for settlement were made without [[basement]]s or [[water system|water]] and [[sewage system]]s.&lt;ref name="Mintz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mintz |first1=Eric |author2=Livianna Tossutti |author3=Christopher Dunn  |title=Democracy, Diversity, and Good Government: An Introduction to Politics in Canada |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-235061-7 |page=231 |chapter=Undue Hardship: The Innu of Davis Inlet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The houses were also small, poorly constructed, and not designed to house [[extended family|extended families]]. It was soon discovered that water supply on the island was insufficient, and most of it [[water pollution|contaminated]]. Waste began to pile up, and diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] began to appear.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

Many of the adults in Davis Inlet battled [[alcoholism]] and on [[Valentine's Day]], 1992, six unattended children aged between six months and nine years died in a [[structure fire|house fire]] while their parents were drinking at a Valentine's Day dance. About one-quarter of all adults in Davis Inlet had attempted [[suicide]] in the previous year, and between 1973 and 1995 fifty lives were lost in the community of 465 in alcohol-related deaths.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mintz"/&gt;

[[Inhalant abuse]] was another problem in Davis Inlet, with 47 children being recognized as chronic abusers of solvents, some as young as age 5. In 1993, a video (recorded by [[Simeon Tshakapesh]] who is now Deputy Grand Chief of the Innu Nation) was released to the media of six children in Davis Inlet between the ages of 11 and 14 huffing gasoline in an unheated shack in winter and shouting that they wanted to die.&lt;ref name="1993 Video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/poverty/davis-inlet-innu-community-in-crisis/a-heart-wrenching-cry-for-help.html |title=Davis Inlet: Innu Community in Crisis |date=28 Jan 1993 |work=CBC Digital Archives |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamed by the negative publicity and international outcry surrounding the events in 1993, the Canadian government agreed to move the Innu to mainland Labrador, and in 2002 at a cost of nearly $200 million the community of Davis Inlet was relocated to [[Natuashish]]. However, the problems of suicide, alcohol and solvent abuse followed the community and in 2008 they voted to outlaw alcohol entirely.&lt;ref name="Mintz"/&gt;

'''Dental anesthesia''' (or '''dental anaesthesia''') is a field of [[anesthesia]] that includes not only [[local anesthetic]]s but [[sedation]] and general anesthesia.

==Local anesthetic agents in dentistry==
The most commonly used local anesthetic is [[lidocaine]] (also called xylocaine or lignocaine), a modern replacement for [[procaine]] (also known as novocaine). Its [[half-life]] in the body is about 1.5–2 hours. Other local anesthetic agents in current use include [[articaine]] (also called septocaine or ubistesin), [[bupivacaine]] (a long-acting anesthetic),  [[Prilocaine]] (also called Citanest), and [[mepivacaine]] (also called Carbocaine or Polocaine). A combination of these may be used depending on the situation. Also, most agents come in two forms: with and without [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) or other vasoconstrictor that allow the agent to last longer and also controls bleeding in the tissue during procedures. Usually the case is classified using the [[ASA physical status classification system|ASA Physical Status Classification System]] before any anesthesia is given.

== Maxillary anaesthesia ==
Local anaesthesia is deposited at the buccal (cheek) side of the maxillary alveolus which can diffuse through the thin cortical plate of the maxilla, then further into the pulp of the tooth in order to achieve dental anaesthesia effect.
[[File:Karpulenspritze.jpg|thumb]]

== Mandibular anaesthesia ==
Both regional block and infiltration techniques are considered the first choice injections for anaesthetising the mandibular teeth.

Different techniques are chosen based on different factors:
# Patient age&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/642291828|title=Practical dental local anaesthesia|last=G.|first=Meechan, J.|date=2010|publisher=Quintessence Pub. Co|others=Wilson, Nairn H. F.|isbn=1850972044|edition= 2nd|location=London|oclc=642291828}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* Infiltration anaesthesia is a preferable method to anaesthetise deciduous/ primary teeth in children. The method is similar to the maxillary buccal infiltration. Ensure the lip/ cheek is stretched in a lateral and inferior direction instead of superiorly and the needle is then penetrated 45’ with the buccal cortical plate of the bone through the taut tissue of the muccobuccal fold.
# Tooth to be anaesthetised&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
#* Infiltration anaesthesia should be the first choice of method for pulpal and soft tissue anaesthesia of mandibular permanent incisors in adults. Regional block injections are sometimes ineffective due to crossover innervation from the opposite side of inferior alveolar nerve. It is recommended to deposit at least 0.5mL at each buccal and lingual site in the apical region of the tooth of interest. The use of infiltration anaesthesia with 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in obtaining pulp anaesthesia of the mandibular permanent first molar is getting more common these days due to its successful formulation.

=== Regional block techniques ===

==== Inferior alveolar and lingual block ====
The inferior alveolar nerve block is probably one of the most common methods used by dentist to anaesthetise the mandibular teeth in adults.  This technique aims to inject the needle and deposit local anaesthetic close the near to the nerve before it enters the mandibular foramen, which locates on the medial aspect of the mandibular ramus. This is to block the nerve transmission in the inferior alveolar nerve before entering into the bone through the mandibular foramen.&lt;ref name="Anesthesia 1162"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil H | title = A basic review on the inferior alveolar nerve block techniques | journal = Anesthesia, Essays and Researches | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25886095 | pmc = 4173572 | doi = 10.4103/0259-1162.128891 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Long buccal nerve block ====

&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drum M, Reader A, Beck M | title = Long buccal nerve block injection pain in patients with irreversible pulpitis | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = e51-4 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21458333 | doi = 10.1016/j.tripleo.2011.01.028 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tripleo.2011.01.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster W, Drum M, Reader A, Beck M | title = Anesthetic efficacy of buccal and lingual infiltrations of lidocaine following an inferior alveolar nerve block in mandibular posterior teeth | journal = Anesthesia Progress | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 163–9 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18085837 | pmc = 2213247 | doi = 10.2344/0003-3006(2007)54[163:AEOBAL]2.0.CO;2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supplementary Techniques ==

=== [[Intraosseous]]  ===
It is an alternative anaesthetic injection techniques that was first publish in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masselink|first=B.H.|date=1910|title=The advent of painless dentistry|url=|journal=Dent Cosmo|volume=52|issue=8|pages=868–872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraosseous anaesthetic injection involves the deposition of anaesthetic solution directly into the cancellous alveolar bone adjacent to the apex of the root of the tooth to be anaesthetised through a small hole.It also can be use more involved dental procedures such as surgery or endodontic therapy (root canals).

=== Intraligamentary ===
Intraligamentary or periodontal ligament anaesthesia is a technique used primarily for endodontic treatment and to supplement inferior dental blocks where they may have failed. This technique involves ‘the deposition of at least 0.2ml of local anaesthetic solution for each root of the tooth’ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malamed|first=SF|date=1982|title=The PDL injection: An alternative to inferior alveolar nerve block|pmid=6949113|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffusing into the marrow spaces surrounding the teeth. Clinicians may adopt this technique due to some benefits such as: no soft tissue anaesthesia, use of a smaller amount of anaesthetic and single tooth anaesthesia however use may be contraindicated due to claims that patients report sharp pain upon administration of interligamentary aesthetic. However the use of a high-pressure syringe and ultra fine needle provide both chemical anaesthesia (by action of anaesthetic agent) and mechanical anaesthesia (by pressure from deposition). Interligamentary anaesthetic may be complicated by poor operator technique where rapid injection and excessive volume is used; this could lead to sensitivity to biting and percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/dental/d6401/2007/supplementalBW.pdf|title=Supplemental injections|last=|first=|date=|website=columbia.edu |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that the rate of onset of anaesthesia in the patients was between 15-20 second; this provides an advantage compared to that of inferior alveolar dental block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan, Deepak, Lakshmi|first=Raunak,  Kulkarni, Shetty|date=January 2011|title=Evaluation of Efficacy of Intraligamentary Injection Technique for Extraction of Mandibular Teeth-A Prospective Study|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advantages include a decrease in overall trauma in comparison to conventional blocks therefore being an ideal procedure for extractions and endodontic treatment in children.

=== Intrapulpal  ===
Inter-pulpal anaesthesia involves the direct placement of anaesthetic agent using a small needle (of 25 or 27 gauge) into the pulp chamber; it is injected under pressure leading to brief yet intense discomfort. This particular technique provides effective pulpal anaesthesia as the pulpal tissue is subject to chemical action by the anaesthetic agent and mechanical stimulus due to the pressure applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/dental/d6401/2007/supplementalBW.pdf|title=supplemental injections|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is usually adopted when all other techniques have been unsuccessful and must include pre-operative warnings of sharp pain. However it may prove useful for pulpal extirpation or endodontic treatment on any tooth where anaesthesia is difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, due to the patient discomfort associated with this technique it should not be the primary anaesthetic technique used.

=== Intra-papillary ===
Intra-papillary anaesthesia is used as a supplementary technique to infiltrations in order to increase comfort for the patient and is primarily used to replace palatal or lingual infiltrations. This is exceptionally successful in paediatric patients and works to replace or increase comfort for particularly uncomfortable infiltrations such as palatal or lingual infiltrations. The technique involves direct deposition of anaesthetic agent into the papilla with associated tissue blanching at site of injection. The point of penetration should lie in attached gingiva 2mm apical of the papilla &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pocketdentistry.com/6-supplementary-techniques/|title=Supplementary techniques|last=|first=|date=|website=pocketdentistry.com |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pressure anesthesia ===
Pressure with a cotton swab in the area to distract the nerve sensation of pain when the needle enters certain areas such as palatal tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Akinoski Approach ===

=== [[Nerve block|Electrical nerve blocks]] ===
Technology that involves using electric current to block the reception or generation of pain signals; the pain control can be transient.

== Jet injection ==
A jet injection aims to create a release of pressure strong enough to push a liquid medication dose through a small orifice. This is usually done with the help of an energy source which is mechanical. With this, a thin column of fluid is created which has the force to penetrate soft tissues, thus a needle is not required.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013 Jan-Jun|title=Advances in dental local anesthesia techniques and devices: An update|pmc=3800379|journal=Advances in dental local anesthesia techniques and devices: An update|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages:

·         Faster drug absorption at injection site

·         Easy to use

·         Little/no pain

·         Less tissue damage

However, in dentistry, the effectiveness of this technique has been reported to be limited.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Examples of jet injections include: Syrijet, MED-JET H III and iCT injection SE by Dentium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dentium.com/product/newproduct.asp|title=Dentium {{!}} Product {{!}} New Product|website=www.dentium.com|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
When considering the use of a local anaesthesia there are many factors which should be considered. In terms of contraindications associated with LA there are “absolute” and “relative” contraindications.  When something is said to have an “absolute” contraindication this underlines that under no circumstance would that LA be selected to administer to that specific patient as it poses a potential life-threatening risk e.g. allergy. When the LA has a “relative” contraindication the administration of the LA is not preferable and should be avoided, but does not pose a life-threatening risk.

=== Type ===

As stated previously Local Anaesthesia used in dentistry can vary significantly as there are various preparations with a multitude of qualities. Each preparation has slight differences in how the anaesthetic effects the body. This is due to the use of different constituents. Local Anaesthetics which contain adrenaline such as Lidocaine (using 1:80,000 of adrenaline) or Articaine (using 1:100,000 of adrenaline) have a direct effect on the cardiac output by increasing the rate and contraction of the heart itself. Due to these effects, if a patient suffers from unstable angina or severe cardiac dysrhythmia, these preparations are often discouraged as they may predispose to unfavourable side effects.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xRgnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=dental+anaesthesia+contraindications&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkmOnbmqHZAhUQ2qQKHX2DAUEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dental%20anaesthesia%20contraindications&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Studies found that both articaine given by infiltration and lidocaine given by inferior block were equally efficient when used for routine dental treatments in pediatric patients, however, articaine injections caused less post-opserative pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong HJ, Alzahrani FS, Sim YF, Tahmassebi JF, Duggal M | title = Anaesthetic efficacy of articaine versus lidocaine in children's dentistry: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–360 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29635712 | doi = 10.1111/ipd.12363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative, other preparations such as Mepivicaine Hydrochloride or Prilocaine (containing Felypressin) can be used. Prilocaine is especially suitable for a patient who wishes to avoid adrenaline or may have a latex/preservative allergy. The main contraindication of Prilocaine is that it has a short half life and it possesses a mild cytotoxic effect, therefore should be avoided in pregnancy. This cytotoxic effect can influence the uterine tone and interfere with circulation, which can pose detrimental effects on the pregnancy. Mepivicaine Hydrochloride is then considered if Prilocaine is contraindicated. Mepivicaine is the least vasodilatory anesthetic as it has no vasoconstrictors and no preservatives added.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dmxjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=dental+anaesthesia+contraindications&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkmOnbmqHZAhUQ2qQKHX2DAUEQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dental%20anaesthesia%20contraindications&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Relation to the Dose ===

The dose of local anesthesia is often reduced when a patient has any systemic health implications or habits which may cause an interference. From time to time the local anaesthetic itself should be reduced (therefore reducing the maximum dose). This is particularly done when alcoholism, anaemia (if using Prilocaine), anorexia, bradycardia or GORD is concerned. On other occasions the vasoconstrictor used (often adrenaline) must be reduced when an individual suffers from angina, bradycardia, chronic bronchitis, cardia disarrhythmia, COPD or glaucoma. These include drug abuse, calcium channel blocker containing medications, beta blocker medications or liver disease as this impairs the metabolism.

=== In Relation to the Technique ===

The variety of techniques associated when giving a local anaesthetic can affect the success and if done incorrectly lead to a possible fracture of the needle tip. It is extremely rare for the needle to fracture whilst giving an injection intra-orally unless an inadequate technique is adopted. To prevent such an occurrence, especially when performing an inferior alveolar nerve block, it is recommended to not bend the needle, to use the correct needle length and to not insert the needle up to the hub.

==Most common local anesthetic procedure==

The [[Inferior alveolar nerve anaesthesia]] or block or IANB (sometimes termed "inferior dental block", or wrongly referred to as the "mandibular block") probably is anesthetized more often than any other nerve in the body. An injection blocks sensation in the [[inferior alveolar nerve]], which runs from the angle of the mandible down the medial aspect of the mandible, innervating the mandibular teeth, lower lip, chin, and parts of the tongue, which is effective for dental work in the mandibular arch. To anesthetize this nerve, the needle is inserted somewhat posterior to the most distal mandibular [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] on one side of the mouth. The [[lingual nerve]] is also anesthetized through diffusion of the agent to produce a numb [[tongue]] as well as anesthetizing the floor of the mouth tissue, including that around the tongue side or lingual of the teeth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Local Anesthesia for the Dental Hygienist, Logothetis, Elsevier, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Several nondental nerves are usually anesthetized during an inferior alveolar block. The [[mental nerve]], which supplies [[cutaneous innervation]] to the anterior [[lip]] and [[chin]], is a distal branch of the inferior alveolar nerve. When the inferior alveolar nerve is blocked, the mental nerve is blocked also, resulting in a numb lip and chin. Nerves lying near the point where the inferior alveolar nerve enters the [[human mandible|mandible]] often are also anesthetized during inferior alveolar anesthesia, such as affecting hearing (auriculotemporal nerve).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[facial nerve]] lies some distance from the inferior alveolar nerve within the parotid salivary gland, but in rare cases anesthetic can be injected far enough posteriorly to anesthetize that nerve. The result is a transient facial paralysis, with the injected side of the face having temporary loss of the use of the muscles of facial expression that include the inability to close the eyelid and the drooping of the labial commissure on the affected side for a few hours, which disappears when the [[anesthesia]] wears off.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 216&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[superior alveolar nerves (disambiguation)|superior alveolar nerves]] are not usually anesthetized directly because they are difficult to approach with a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]. For this reason, the maxillary arch is usually anesthetized locally for dental work by inserting the needle beneath the [[oral mucosa]] surrounding the teeth so as to anesthetize the smaller branches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Local Anesthesia for the Dental Hygienist, Logothetis, Elsevier, 2012{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dental syringe===

A [[dental syringe]] is a [[syringe]] for the injection of a [[local anesthetic]].&lt;ref name="drugs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/lidocaine-hydrochloride-local.html|title=Lidocaine Hydrochloride (Local) Monograph for Professionals - Drugs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a breech-loading syringe fitted with a sealed cartridge containing anesthetic solution.

In the UK and Ireland, manually operated hand syringes to inject [[Lidocaine]] in to patient's gums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zakrzewska JM, Boon EC | title = Use of safety dental syringes in British and Irish dental schools | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 195 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–9; discussion 198 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12970703 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4810445 | url = http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v195/n4/full/4810445a.html?foxtrotcallback=true | via = www.nature.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v190/n2/full/4800891a.html|title=Cross-infection control: Introducing safety syringes into a UK dental school – a controlled study | vauthors = Zakrzewska JM, Greenwood I, Jackson J | date=27 January 2001|publisher=|journal=British Dental Journal|volume=190|issue=2|pages=88–92|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4800891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drugs.com"/&gt;

==Other anesthetics used in dentistry==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
* [[Topical anesthetic]]s  [[benzocaine]], [[eugenol]], and forms of xylocaine are used topically to numb various areas before injections or other minor procedures.
* [[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), also known as "laughing gas", easily crosses the alveoli of the lung and is dissolved into the passing blood, where it travels to the brain, leaving a dissociated and euphoric feeling in most cases. Nitrous oxide is used in combination with oxygen. Often (especially with children) a sweet-smelling fruity scent similar to an auto{{clarify|date=August 2013}} scent is used with the gas to inspire deep inhalation.
* [[General anesthesia]]  drugs such as [[midazolam]], [[ketamine]], [[propofol]] and [[fentanyl]] are used to put a person in a  [[twilight sleep]] or render them completely unconscious and unaware of pain. Dentists who have completed a training program in anesthesiology may also administer general IV and inhalation anesthetic agents.
* [[Nebotamine]], a drug with similar effects to [[ketamine]], is injected into the anterior lingual glands blocking action potentials from sending signals to the [[myelinated nerve]]. The potency of the anesthetic is directly related to its lipid solubility, since 90% of the nerve cell membrane is composed of lipid.
* [[Midazolam]] (Versed), a drug that [[Amnestic|represses memories]] of the procedure, is usually given two hours prior to the procedure in combination with Tylenol in [[general anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] so the person will go home with no memories of being in surgery.
* [[Sevoflurane]] gas in combination with [[nitrous oxide]] and [[oxygen]] is often used during general anesthesia followed by the use of [[isoflurane]] gas to maintain anesthesia during the procedure. In children sweet fruity scents are often used with the gases to inspire deep inhalation. Scents come in cherry, apple, [[bubblegum]], watermelon, etc...
* [[Propofol]], a drug with similar effects to [[Sodium Pentathol]], is often used through intravenous infusion through an IV during general anesthesia after gasses are initiated.
* [[Morphine]] is often used to control pain during the dental surgery under general anesthesia. The [[morphine]] is usually administered through IV.
* [[Ketorolac]] is often administered through IV to suppress both pain and inflammation while under general anesthesia.

==Other drugs used in combination with general anesthesia in dentistry==

* [[Decadron]] a steroid is often administered through IV to suppress inflammation and swelling resulting during the surgery while under general anesthesia.
* [[Ondansetron]] brand named [[Zofran]] is often administered to prevent nausea during the surgery which may result from the blood draining into the stomach while under general anesthesia, or it is given after the procedure for postoperative nausea which may result from the anesthesia itself which was administered.

== Local anesthesia and the pregnant patient ==
Provided a dentist performs proper aspiration to avoid intravenous injections, local anesthetics containing epinephrine (adrenaline) are safe to use during pregnancy. lignocaine and prilocaine are assigned a category B ranking by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and are therefore safe for use during pregnancy. Lignocaine and prilocaine are sold as 2% and 4% formulations, respectively. It is therefore safer to use the lignocaine so as to administer a lower concentration of the drug to the pregnant patient.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ouanounou A, Haas DA | title = Drug therapy during pregnancy: implications for dental practice | language = En | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 220 | issue = 8 | pages = 413–7 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27103292 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.2016.299 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mepivicaine, articaine, bupivicaine are given an FDA category C ranking and so should be avoided. Benzocaine, the ingredient of most  topical anesthetic formulations, is also ranked as category C and should be avoided. Lignocaine should be used as topical anesthetic instead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Epinephrine in high doses is harmful to a pregnant woman in that it affects uterine blood flow. However its use in low dose with local anesthetic administration is warranted. The epinephrine causes vasoconstriction which in turn reduces systemic distribution of the anesthetic as well as prolongs its action in addition to decreasing bleeding at the operating site. Lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 adrenaline is the local anesthetic of choice in the treatment of pregnant women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Allergy to local anaesthetic ==
Allergic reactions from local anaesthesia have been reported in some patients. However, this occurrence is rare even in patients who had a past history of adverse reactions to LA.

There are mainly 2 classes of local anaesthetic agents: Amide or Ester linkages, based on their chemical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haas|first=D. A|date=2002|title=An update on local anesthetics in dentistry.|url=https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1601-1546.2002.10103.x|journal=Journal (Canadian Dental Association)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* E.g. of amide LA: lidocaine, prilocaine, articaine, mepivacaine
* E.g. of ester LA: benzocaine, procaine
Genuine allergic reactions of an amide LA is very uncommon. An ester LA is more possible to result in an allergic reaction because the compound will be broken down to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) which is a trigger for allergic reactions.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henderson|first=S.|date=2011|title=Allergy to local anaesthetic agents used in dentistry--what are the signs, symptoms, alternative diagnoses and management options?|pmid=21905354|journal=Dental Update|volume=38 |issue=6|pages=410–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general dentistry, only topical applications of LA contains esters (benzocaine) when applied onto area before LA is administered.

If one is allergic to an ester LA, then the use of other types of ester LA should be avoided as the breakdown of all esters will produce PABA. However, patients allergic to ester LA will usually not be affected by amide LA because PABA is not produced upon breakdown of amide LA. Unlike ester LA, allergy to an amide LA will not eliminate the use of other types of amide LA.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Some reactions are caused by administration of too much drug, usually because of the route of entry of drug (intravenously) or the quick uptake of drug into the system, or the aftereffect of the vasoconstrictor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomoyasu, Y., Mukae, K., Suda, M., Hayashi, T., Ishii, M., Sakaguchi, M., … Miyawaki, T.|first=|date=2011|title=Allergic reactions to local anesthetics in dental patients: analysis of intracutaneous and challenge tests.|url=https://doi.org/10.2174/1874210601105010146|journal=The Open Dentistry Journal|volume=5|pages=146–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfavourable reactions to LA can be classified into 3 different groups: psychogenic, allergic, toxic.

=== Differential Diagnosis &amp; management ===

* Psychogenic reactions
Unfavourable reactions to LA are commonly be due to a hyperemotional response to a perceived danger within someone’s mind, and it could be demonstrated in several ways. Examples are temporal loss of consciousness, sweating, flush, change in heart rate or blood pressure, panic attack, hyperventilation, of which may be mistaken as allergic reactions.

When treating such patients, treat them with care and take into consideration their anxiety. During treatment if the patients feel faint or experiences a drop in blood pressure, lay them flat and keep their legs elevated in an attempt to restore their blood pressure. Loosen any tight clothing and keep the patients sugary food/drink after they regain consciousness. Reassure the patient.
* Toxic reactions
This may occur when there are large amounts of anaesthetic within their vascular system, which may be due to them receiving repeated LA, intravenous entry of drug, or have underlying systemic conditions that does not metabolize or utilize the drug efficiently.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Signs and symptoms mainly involve the nervous system e.g. aggressive behaviour, drowsiness, speech alteration, disorientation etc.

Their symptoms should usually resolve in a few hours, up to 12 hours, as the body will gradually rid the bloodstream of the drug. Assure the patient that their symptoms will improve after a few hours and that such a reaction should not recur, and that there is no need to abstain from that drug hereafter.

Such reactions can be minimized via practicing safe injection methods using an aspirating syringe to prevent injecting in blood vessels, slow administration of drug, and avoid overprescribing LA, keeping in mind the patient’s weight, age and medical history.

=== Signs &amp; symptoms of allergic reactions to LA ===

Genuine allergy to LA will manifest either as Type 1 or Type 4 hypersensitivity. Signs and symptoms will vary depending on the type of allergy. Type 1 reactions have a rapid onset of symptoms which include swelling, redness, rashes, itchiness, chest tightness, breathing problems. A Type 4 reaction has a delayed onset of symptoms and is usually localized to the site of injection.

=== Management ===

If a genuine allergic reaction to LA should occur, the patient should be treated as an emergency for anaphylaxis, according to the guidelines in the respective areas. For the UK, the section on medical emergencies in dental practice in the “Prescribing in Dental Practice” part in the BNF should be referred to. The patient should be sent immediately to the hospital if their condition worsens.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The individual should undergo further tests to certify their allergy to the LA or for other possible causes of the adverse reaction.

== Gate Control Theory in Painless Anaesthesia ==
The gate control theory explains that pain can be reduced if the touch nerve fibres are stimulated due to non-harmful stimuli.

Advancement in techniques used to deliver local anaesthesia are very important. There are types of local anaesthesia that apply vibrations to the skin while the injection is being placed into the skin. This uses the gate control theory to minimise pain to the patient. The high frequency vibrations coming from the device which is attached to the syringe inhibit the pain sensations coming from the needle. They may interfere with the signals of pain by closing the gate in the brain. The nerve fibres that are stimulated are the Ab fibres using pressure or vibration. ''Other receptors called meissner’s corpuscles in the deeper tissues and bone also contribute.'' This closes a ‘neural gate’ This decreases the patient’s feeling of pain.

Methods used by dentist to reduce pain during anaesthesia by using the gate control theory are: Warming of the local anaesthetic cartridge, Stretching the oral mucosa, Gentle rubbing of the extra-oral skin.&lt;ref&gt;Technique tips--distraction anaesthesia: applying the gate control theory in delivering painless anaesthesia.

In [[epizoology]], an '''epizootic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''epi-'' upon + ''zoon'' animal) is a [[disease]] event in a nonhuman animal population, analogous to an [[epidemic]] in humans.  An epizootic may be: restricted to a specific locale (an "[[outbreak]]"), general (an "'''epizootic'''"), or widespread ("[[panzootic]]").  High [[population density]] is a major contributing factor to epizootics. [[Aquaculture]] is an [[industry]] sometimes plagued by disease because of the large number of [[fish]] confined to a small area.

Defining an epizootic can be subjective; it is based upon the number of new cases in a given animal population, during a given period, and must be judged to be a rate that substantially exceeds what is expected based on recent experience (''i.e.'' a sharp elevation in the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate).  Because it is based on what is "expected" or thought normal, a few cases of a very rare disease (like a [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|TSE]] outbreak in a [[cervid]] population) might be classified as an "epizootic", while many cases of a common disease (like [[lymphocystis]] in [[Esox|esocids]]) would not.

Common diseases that occur at a constant but relatively high rate in the population are said to be "[[enzootic]]" (''cf.'' the epidemiological meaning of "[[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]" for human diseases). An example of an enzootic disease would be the [[influenza]] virus in some bird populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm |title=Volume 12, Number 1—January 2006 - Emerging Infectious Disease journal - CDC |work=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, at a lower incidence, the Type IVb strain of [[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia|VHS]] in certain Atlantic fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/Viral-Hemorrhagic-Septicemia-Fact-Sheet-11-9-2006_178081_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an epizootic would be the 1990 outbreak of [[Newcastle disease]] virus in [[double-crested cormorant]] colonies on the [[Great Lakes]] that resulted in the death of some 10,000 birds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/field_manual/chapter_21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist political ecology''' is a [[feminist]] perspective on [[political ecology]], drawing on theories from  [[post-structuralism]], [[feminist geography]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Feminist political ecology examines the place of gender in the political ecological landscape, exploring gender as a factor in ecological and political relations. Specific areas in which feminist political ecology is focused are development, landscape, resource use, [[Agrarianism|agrarian reconstruction]] and [[Urbanization|rural-urban transformation]] (Hovorka 2006: 209).  Feminist political ecologists suggest gender is a crucial variable – in relation to class, race and other relevant dimensions of political ecological life – in constituting access to, control over, and knowledge of natural resources.

== Linking gender hierarchy with environmental degradation ==

Feminist political ecology attempts to include gender as a "key element" in  political ecology analysis (Hovorka 2006: 209). It is informed by several decades of feminist scholarship on the material and cultural links between gender hierarchy (where the masculine is valued more than the feminine) and the domination of the natural world. Ecological feminist scholars working in different disciplines, such as Carolyn Merchant (1980), [[Val Plumwood]] (1993; 2002) and Vandana Shiva (1989), laid the foundations for this field by providing empirical evidence and conceptual tools for the systematic analysis of the twin devaluation/domination of nature and the feminine.

== Research ==

The study of the relationship between environments, gender, and development has grown in importance because of the restructuring of economies, environments and cultures at a global and local level (Mitchell 2000). Women and men are being viewed as actors who affect environmental management, resource use, and the creation of policies for health and well-being. Feminist political ecology does not view gender differences in environmental impact as being biologically-rooted. Rather, they are derived from social constructs of gender, which vary depending on culture, class, race, and geographical location, and they change over time between individuals and societies. A key moment on the development of the approach was the publication of ''Feminist Political Ecology'', edited by Dianne Rocheleau ''et.al.'' at [[Clark University]] in 1996. The book showed how usage of environment and labor patterns are gendered, but also how certain environmental problems have particularly negative effects on women (Rocheleau ''et al.'' 1996). These concerns were largely absent in the better-known [[political ecology]] volume ''Liberation Ecologies'', which was published in the same year and also developed at Clark (Peet &amp; Watts, 1996).

In a study on the [[Rural Federation of Zambrana-Chacuey]] (a peasant federation) and an international nongovernmental organization ([[ENDA-Caribe]]) in the Dominican Republic, [[Dianne Rocheleau]] examines social forestry within the region. Women are involved in the forestry industry, but previous research (summary numbers, "regional maps of forestry-as-usual" (Rocheleau 1995: 460) had not represented the "different publics (differentiated by gender, class, locality, and occupation) within the Federation (p460)". Rocheleau's study draws upon post-structuralism to "expand our respective partial and situated knowledges through a politics a science that go beyond identity to affinities then work from affinities to coalitions" (p459).In other words, the study does not assume that the identity of a person defines them, but instead focuses on "affinities" (defined as "based on affiliations, and shared views of interests, subject to change over time"). The purpose of this was to "address women within the context in which they had organized and affiliated themselves (p461)". The purpose of the study was to include women in the general study of the area in a way that gave justice to the "ecological and social contexts that sustain their lives" (p461), instead of separating them from the context, rendering them invisible.

In a Botswana study on urban poultry agriculture, [[Alice J. Hovorka]] (2006) examines the implications of fast-paced urbanization on social and ecological relations in a Feminist Political Ecology framework. Men and women are both involved and affected by development issues, so therefore "gender is an integral part of a key element of agrarian change and rural-urban transformation" (Hovorka 2006:209). Before urbanization took off, socially constructed gender roles played a huge part in gendered experiences of the landscape. Gender determined the different roles, responsibilities and access to resources. It is important to note that although Botswana women gained the right to vote in 1966, they remain excluded from political power. Gender issues are rarely raised in this country where "powerful conventions restrict women's domain to the household and women's autonomy under male guardianship" (p211). With urbanization, land use is becoming more accessible to Botswana women. But studies have revealed that "women's access to social status and productive resources remains limited compared to men's" (p213). Traditional gender roles affect women's economic situation, their access to resources and land, their education, and their labor market.

== Quotes on feminist political ecology ==

* New research in feminist political ecology moves "from a focus on women's vulnerabilities and the silencing of gendered and subaltern knowledges to stress the global significance of women's embodied practices, emerging social movements, and collaborative action". —Stephanie Buechler and Anne-Marie Hanson (2015)
* "Feminist Political Ecology aims at analyzing gendered experiences of and responses to environmental and political-economic change that brings with it changing livelihoods, landscapes, property regimes, and social relations." —Alice Hovorka (2006)
* "Rather than "adding women" to standard methods of empirical research it was possible to include gender as a subject of study, to incorporate feminist post-structuralist perspective into the research design, and to apply it to an analysis of social and environmental change within the region." —Dianne Rocheleau 1995.
* "My first feminist paper was published, out of research I did in the late 1970s on sex difference in migration and social change in rural Puerto Rica. It had to do with how rural industrialization, reflecting US development policies, was affecting who stayed and who left. And how class and gender intersected with migration patterns in rural Puerto Rico." —Jan Monk

'''''Foucha v. Louisiana''''', 504 U.S. 71 (1992), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case in which the court addressed the criteria for the continued [[involuntary commitment|commitment]] of an individual who had been found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. The individual remained involuntarily confined on the justification that he was potentially dangerous even though he no longer suffered from the [[mental illness]] that served as a basis for his original commitment.&lt;ref name="Foucha"&gt;{{ussc|name=Foucha v. Louisiana|volume=504|page=71|pin=|year=1992}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Petitioner Terry Foucha was charged with aggravated [[burglary]] and illegal discharge of a [[firearm]]. He burglarized a home after the occupants fled and discharged a firearm in the direction of a law enforcement officer. Initially he was evaluated as [[Competency evaluation (law)|incompetent]] to proceed to trial because he was unable to distinguish right from wrong at the time of the offense. When he later was evaluated as competent, he was tried and found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. He was committed to East Feliciana State Hospital (LA Maximum Secure) on the grounds that he had a [[mental illness]] and was dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-12-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Louisiana]] law, a criminal defendant found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] and committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] will remain there until the [[hospital]] review committee  recommends that he be released. If the review committee recommends release, then the trial court must hold a hearing to determine whether he is dangerous to himself or others. If he is found to be dangerous, he may be returned to the hospital whether or not he is currently mentally ill. The committee met and stated that it could not guarantee that Foucha would not be a danger to himself or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the state court ordered petitioner Foucha to return to the mental institution to which he had been committed, ruling that he was dangerous. The decision was  based on a doctor's testimony that, although Foucha had recovered from the drug induced psychosis for which he was committed, he continued to be diagnosed as having an [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial personality]], a condition that is not a mental illness and is not considered treatable. Foucha had been involved in several fights within the facility which doctors felt might indicate he might pose a danger if released.&lt;ref name="Foucha"/&gt; The court stated the burden of proof rested on Foucha to prove that he was not a danger to himself or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
Foucha petitioned the Court for a [[writ of certiorari]]. The State Court of Appeals had denied Foucha's appeal and the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] affirmed, holding, among other things, that per ''[[Jones v. United States (1983)|Jones v. United States]]'' (1983) Foucha's release was not required. The latter ruled that the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was not violated by the statutory provision permitting confinement of an insanity acquittee based on dangerousness alone, although dangerousness alone in the absence of a mental illness would not satisfy the standards for a  civil commitment.&lt;ref name=Foucha/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court ruled that potential dangerousness was not a justification to retain a person found not guilty by reason of insanity if no mental illness was present. James P. Manasseh argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was Martin E. Regan, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;504 U.S. 71, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; An acquittee cannot be confined as a mental patient without some medical justification for doing so.&lt;ref name="Foucha"/&gt; Although the individual may be dangerous, the Court ruled that a person committed on the basis of an insanity defense and who has regained his sanity cannot continue to be confined on the sole justification that he remains dangerous.&lt;ref name="Foucha"/&gt; A (formerly) insane acquittee must remain both ill and dangerous to continue to be involuntarily committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"There is no conceivable basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is nearing the end of a penal term from all other commitments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |year= |month= |url=http://www.geocities.com/three_strikes_legal/effects_of_foucha.htm |title=The Effects of Foucha v. Louisiana on SVPACivil Commitments and Equal Protection |publisher= |accessdate=2007-12-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028164339/http://www.geocities.com/three_strikes_legal/effects_of_foucha.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the State of Louisiana was not justified in retaining the petitioner unless it could prove that serious public safety concerns existed to justify the acquittee's continuing classification as dangerous.

==Significance==
The Court clarified that if the justification for commitment after an insanity acquittal no longer applies, the individual is to be released. To maintain that an insanity acquittee remain  civilly committed to a psychiatric institution until he is no longer a danger to himself or others is unconstitutional. In this case the basis for commitment was that the defendant was both not responsible due to a mental illness and was dangerous. If he no longer suffers from a mental illness, then there is no justification to detain him. States must maintain the same standard for involuntarily committed insanity acquittees as they do for civilly committed individuals. Commitment must be based on standard principles of civil commitment, including proving that the individual is mentally ill. Commitment cannot be an automatic consequence of the acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul F.

Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex''' is a clinical and research ophthalmological center in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon [[Svyatoslav Fyodorov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeaneyebanks.org/article/MOSCOW%2B-%2BThe%2BS.%2BN.%2BFyodorov%2BEye%2BMicrosurgery%2BState%2BInstitution%2BEye%2BBank/247 |title=EEBA |publisher=Europeaneyebanks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center also includes regional branches in [[Cheboksary]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Kaluga]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Orenburg]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Tambov]], [[Volgograd]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].

Led by Fyodorov until his death in 2000, the center became famous for the [[refractive surgery]] procedures performed in a way aimed to be similar to an assembly line, with patients on operating tables rotated from one doctor to another, each of them responsible only for one part of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/world/svyatoslav-fyodorov-72-eye-surgery-pioneer.html |title=Svyatoslav Fyodorov, 72, Eye Surgery Pioneer - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-06-04 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same years, Fyodorov converted a seagoing vessel, the ''Peter I'', into an eye clinic, part of the institute, which sailed the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/fyodoroe.html |title=Fyodorov Svyatoslav Nikolayevich |publisher=Panorama.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the international popularity of its founder and director, the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex obtained the fame of one of the best ophthalmic centers in the world, with eleven branches in regional locations. During the years, it welcomed the best medical doctors and surgeons from different countries wanting to specialize in ophthalmology. At present, the center treats cataract, refractive abnormalities, glaucoma, vitreal, retinal and optic nerve pathology, corneal diseases and deals with daily examinations of 1200 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.mntk.ru/pages/index.php?id_page=366 |title=МНТК "Микрохирургия глаза" &amp;#124; ABOUT US |publisher=Eng.mntk.ru |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601221321/http://eng.mntk.ru/pages/index.php?id_page=366 |archivedate=2013-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11993">'''Gamblers Anonymous''' ('''GA''') is a [[twelve-step program]] for people who have a [[gambling problem]].  The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop gambling.

==History==
The organization began in [[Los Angeles]] on September 13, 1957. By 2005 there were over 1000 GA groups in the United States, and groups had been established in Mexico, the United Kingdom, [[Ireland]], [[Spain]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and many other locations throughout the world.&lt;ref name="PETRY2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petry |first=Nancy M. |title=Gamblers Anonymous and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies for Pathological Gamblers |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |issn=1573-3602 |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=March 2005 |pages=27–33 |pmid=15789187 |doi=10.1007/s10899-004-1919-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidence rate and evaluation ==
[[Problem gambling]] is estimated to occur in 1.6% of the adult population in the United States.&lt;ref name="PETRY2003"/&gt; GA has a list of twenty questions that can be used to self-diagnose compulsive gambling. The results from their instrument have correlated strongly with other tests that screen for compulsive gambling (e.g. the Total Sensation Seeking Scale, Boredom Susceptibility, Experience Seeking, South Oaks Gambling Screen, and Disinhibition subscales).&lt;ref name="KULEY1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kuley |first=Nadia B. |author2=Jacobs, Durand F. |title=The relationship between dissociative-like experiences and sensation seeking among social and problem gamblers |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1988 |pages=197–207 |doi=10.1007/BF01018332 |issn=1050-5350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="URSUA1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ursua |first=Maria Prieto |author2=Uribelarrea, Luis Llavona |title=20 Questions of Gamblers Anonymous: A Psychometric Study with Population of Spain |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=March 1998 |doi=10.1023/A:1023033924960 |pmid=12766432 |issn=1050-5350 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
{{see also|Twelve-step program#Effectiveness |l1=Twelve-step program: Effectiveness}}

Compared to problem gamblers who do not attend GA, GA members tend to have more severe gambling problems, are older, have higher incomes, are less likely to be single, have more years of gambling problems, have larger debts, have more serious family conflicts, and less serious [[substance abuse]] problems.&lt;ref name="PETRY2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petry |first=Nancy M. |title=Patterns and correlates of Gamblers Anonymous attendance in pathological gamblers seeking professional treatment |journal=Addictive behaviors |date=August 2003 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1049–1062 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(02)00233-2 |issn=0306-4603 |pmid=12834650}}&lt;/ref&gt; GA may not be as effective for those who have not had significant gambling problems. GA is effective to prevent "relapses" (inability to remain abstinent from gambling), but not as effective when helping members deal with the consequences of their relapse.&lt;ref name="BROWN1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=R.I.F. |title=Dropouts and continuers in Gamblers Anonymous: Part four. Evaluation and summary |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=September 1987 |pages=202–210 |doi=10.1007/BF01367441 |issn=1050-5350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GA spends much of its time and energy counseling members on how to deal with financial and legal problems. GA supports "pressure relief groups" where members take each other to task and encourage them to "get honest" with people in their lives and get their affairs in order. Gamblers who are able to moderate their activity are not likely to continue attending GA meetings. GA members who stopped attending meetings were more likely to consider the sharing at the meetings "meaningless" and were more critical of GA literature. Those who felt particularly elated at their first GA meetings were less likely to continue than those who had a more balanced first impression. GA, therefore, may be most suitable for severe problem gamblers who do not have compounding issues.&lt;ref name="FERENTZY2003"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Attrition===
Less than 8% of those who initially attend GA remain in the program and abstinent from gambling for over a year.&lt;ref name="STEWART1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=RM |author2=Brown, RI |title=An outcome study of Gamblers Anonymous |journal=[[The British Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=February 1988 |volume=152 |pages=284–288 |issn=0007-1250 |doi=10.1192/bjp.152.2.284 |pmid=3167353 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program participation and abstinence increase if members are involved in additional therapy, or if one or more of their family members are involved in Gam-Anon or Gam-A-Teen.&lt;ref name="PETRY1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petry |first=Nancy M. |author2=Armentano, Christopher |title=Prevalence, Assessment, and Treatment of Pathological Gambling: A Review |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=50 |pages=1021–1027 |date=1 August 1999|issn=1075-2730 |pmid=10445649 | doi = 10.1176/ps.50.8.1021 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/8/1021 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JOHNSON1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=EE |author2=Nora, RM |title=Does spousal participation in Gamblers Anonymous benefit compulsive gamblers? |journal=Psychological Reports |issn=    0033-2941|date=December 1992 |volume= 71|issue=3 Pt 1 |pmid=1454942 |pages=914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIARROCCHI1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ciarrocchi |first=Joseph W. |author2=Reinert, Duane F. |title=Family environment and length of recovery for married male members of Gamblers Anonymous and female members of GamAnon |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=December 1993 |pages=341–352 |doi=10.1007/BF01014626 |issn=1050-5350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender bias===
Although the likelihood of attending GA is the same for males and females,&lt;ref name="CRISP2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crisp |first=Beth R. |author2=Thomas, Shane A. |author3=Jackson, Alun C. |author4=Thomason, Neil |author5=Smith, Serena |author6=Borrell, Jennifer |author7=Ho, Wei-ying |author8= Holt, Tangerine A.  |title=Sex Differences in the Treatment Needs and Outcomes of Problem Gamblers |journal=Research on Social Work Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=229–242 |date=1 March 2000|url=http://rsw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/229 |format=abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt; GA has been characterized as a predominately male fellowship. The number of female members, however, is increasing and there is an increasing sensitivity within GA to women's attitudes.&lt;ref name="FERENTZY2003"/&gt; GA's lack of appeal towards females has been attributed to GA's lack of focus on the principles of spirituality in other twelve-step programs, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). A causal link, however, has not been shown. GA is often described as more secularized than AA.&lt;ref name="BROWNE1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Browne |first=Basil R. |title=Really not god: Secularization and pragmatism in Gamblers Anonymous |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |issn=1050-5350 |volume=10 |issue=3 |date=September 1994 |doi=10.1007/BF02104966 |pmid=24234922 |pages=247–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among problem gamblers, it has been found that women are more focused on interpersonal issues, and that social issues were more likely to cause them to "relapse." Males more frequently discuss "external concerns" such as jobs and legal problems, and are more likely to relapse because of substance abuse. Therefore, it does seem plausible that GA's downplaying of spiritual, interpersonal, and psychoemotional issues, inhibits its effectiveness for women.&lt;ref name="FERENTZY2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferentzy |first=Peter |title=Gamblers Anonymous: A critical review of the literature |journal=EGambling |year=2005 |url=http://www.camh.net/egambling/issue9/research/ferentszy/ |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRESTON1985"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Preston |first=Frederick W. |author2=Smith, Ronald W. |title=Delabeling and relabeling in Gamblers Anonymous: Problems with transferring the Alcoholics Anonymous paradigm |journal=Journal of Gambling Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=September 1985 |doi=10.1007/BF01019862 |pages=97–105 |issn=1050-5350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Traditional medicine|folk medicine]] remedies exist for [[hangover]]s.

Alcoholic writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] relied on tomato juice and beer.&lt;ref name="urbanlegends.about.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/hair_of_the_dog.htm | title = Hair of the Dog: Is there such a thing as a hangover "cure"? | work = About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other purported hangover cures include cocktails such as [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] or [[Black Velvet (beer cocktail)|Black Velvet]] (consisting of equal parts [[champagne]] and [[stout]]).&lt;ref name="urbanlegends.about.com"/&gt; A 1957 survey by an American [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] found widespread belief in the efficacy of heavy fried foods, tomato juice and sexual activity.&lt;ref name="American Folklore 1961 pp. 152-168"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Hair of the Dog and Some Other Hangover Cures from Popular Tradition | first = Frank M. | last = Paulsen | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Journal of American Folklore | volume = 74 | issue = 292 | date = April–June 1961 | pages = 152–168 | jstor = 537784 | doi = 10.2307/537784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">The '''Health Impact Fund''' ('''HIF''') is a proposed pay-for-performance mechanism that would provide a market-based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally. It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global [[disease burden|burden of disease]]. The HIF is the creation of a team of researchers led by the [[Yale]] philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] and the [[University of Calgary]] economist [[Aidan Hollis]], and is promoted by the non-profit organization [[Incentives for Global Health]] (IGH).

==Motivation==
In the current system of development and distribution of medicines, millions of people in poor countries die from diseases because the patented medicines they need are unaffordable or because no medicine exists to cure their ailments.  Little pharmaceutical research is concentrated on [[diseases of poverty|diseases specific to the poor.]] This is largely because it has been difficult for pharmaceutical companies to profit from [[drug development|research and development]] directed at products needed by the poor. The cost of pharmaceutical research and development is high and unlikely to be recovered from those in poor countries who cannot afford the medicines. Therefore, "the Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor." &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, T. Pogge. 2011. “Revitalizing Pharmaceutical Innovation for Global Health,” Health Affairs 30(2):367. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pharmaceutical research and development is partly a result of the global patent regime established by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).  Prior to TRIPS, countries were free to not enact intellectual property laws covering medicines, leading to flourishing generic drug industries in countries such as [[India]]. Following TRIPS, all [[World Trade Organization]] members were required to institute strict, American-style intellectual property rights. As a result, the supply of generic medicines to poor countries has been sharply diminished.&lt;ref name="stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1279 Scrooge and Intellectual Property Rights]," ''British Medical Journal'' 333, no. 7582 (2006), pp. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]], the pharmaceutical patent system needs an "alternative" that would "give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions."&lt;ref name="stiglitz" /&gt;

==Design of the Fund==
The HIF is intended to address the problems with an uncomplemented pharmaceutical patent system.  The HIF uses market forces to create incentives to develop medicines for typically neglected diseases and to distribute these medicines at low prices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical patent-holders would receive financial rewards by opting to register their new medicines, or new uses of existing medicines, with the Fund. By registering, a patent-holder agrees to distribute its medicine globally at [[cost]] and to cooperate in measuring the health impact of that medicine. In return, the firm receives an annual reward based on its measurable contribution to reducing the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Registrants of new drugs are eligible for reward payments for ten years starting at the date of [[Approved drug|marketing approval]] of their product. New uses receive rewards for five years. Following the reward period, registrants agree to allow [[generic drug|generic]] manufacturing of their medicines, in order to prevent price spikes.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Registrants retain their rights to control follow-on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the health impact of a registered product==
When assessing the health impact of a registered product, “the HIF would essentially estimate the difference between (1) the actual health status of people who consumed the registered product and (2) the estimated health status of those people, had they not had access to the registered product.”&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard measure of health impact is the [[Quality-Adjusted Life Year]] (QALY). For example, if all registered products were in conjunction estimated to have saved 10 million QALYs, then a registered product that saved 1 million of those QALYS would receive ten percent of the available reward funds for that year.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The health impact assessment of a registered product would be conducted for each year of its registration with the HIF, and payments would be disbursed annually.

==Funding==
The HIF is to be financed by governments. Ideally, countries will commit a fixed amount of their [[gross national income]] (GNI) to the HIF (0.03 percent of a country’s GNI is the suggested minimum).&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Next step: an innovative pilot==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
As performance measurement is a core component of the HIF, it needs to be robust across different products and in diverse settings. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IGH will perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. The HIF would expand assessment beyond pre-approval clinical trials, using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical trials, physician surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed HIF mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for-performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale.

Outcomes and Benefits of the Pilot:
(1.)	Create a comprehensive metric to evaluate the health impact of medicines based on the actual reductions in mortality and morbidity each achieves.
(2.)	Determine how to apply this metric reliably through a field-test that focuses on a new drug’s introduction into a specific area. No attempt has ever been made to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine.
(3.)	Benefit people in the field-test area by giving them access to an important new product at an affordable price and by rewarding the innovator promoting its wide and effective use by those who can benefit from it.

IGH is currently{{when|date=March 2014}} exploring opportunities for potential pilots.

==Relationship to other proposals==
The HIF can be seen as a kind of comprehensive [[advance market commitments|Advanced Market Commitment]], since it essentially is a way of incentivizing new research while ensuring access at low prices. However, compared to the Advanced Market Commitment, it is comprehensive because it could apply to any drug or vaccine, and it would operate in all countries. Alternatively, one can put it in the context of prizes, since it has prize-like characteristics in terms of incentivizing research while not enabling high prices. A third way of viewing it is as a supplementary global [[health insurance|drug insurance system]],  in which the [[copayment]] made by consumers is equal to the cost of production.

The HIF staff has prepared a memo setting out their view of the intellectual history of the HIF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/origins.doc HIF intellectual history memo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

=== Criticisms ===

When the HIF was proposed in 2008, it attracted criticism from Professor Brook Baker and Knowledge Ecology International for not requiring open licensing of registered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgap.org/trips/bakeronHIF.htm Baker criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keionline.org/hif Knowledge Ecology International criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it allowed drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly, subject to regulated prices. The proponents modified the proposal in response, suggesting greater flexibility about this aspect of the HIF,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/HIF_supplementsNov09.pdf Modified proposal in response to Baker and KEI criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; but this remains a controversial feature of the proposal, when compared to other prize fund proposals that feature open licensing of patents to generic manufacturers.

Brita Pekarsky (2010) has argued that the cost of the HIF may be too high, if it is taking money away from other valuable development aid or health related activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brita Pekarsky, “Should Financial Incentives be Used to Differentially Reward ‘Me-Too’ and Innovative Drugs,” ''Pharmacoeconomics''  28.1(2010): 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Grootendorst (2009) states that the primary drawback of the HIF is the difficulty of measuring health impact accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grootendorst, “How Should We Support Pharmaceutical Innovation?,” ''Expert. Rev. Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Res.'' 2009: 9(4) – 313-320.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes particularly the problems of trying to attribute health impact to drugs that have long latency periods in their effectiveness (such as vaccines and anti-hypertensives); the problems of consistency across different therapeutic areas; and the technical difficulty of disentangling the effect of the drug from confounding factors.

Jorn Sonderholm (2009) argues that there is a lack of evidence that patents create a barrier to access, so that the HIF may fail to address a real problem.&lt;ref&gt;Jorn Sonderholm, “A Reform Proposal in Need of Reform: A Critique of Thomas Pogge’s Proposal for How to Incentivize Research and Development of Essential Drugs,” ''Public Health Ethics'' 0.0 (2009): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana (2011) criticized the HIF on a variety of grounds, including its approach to the distribution of benefits and costs, the impact on generic competition and the role of the HIF in strategic negotiations on intellectual property rights,&lt;ref&gt;Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana, "Health Impact Fund – Raising Issues Of Distribution, IP Rights And Alliances," ''IP-Watch.Org'', September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a response from IGH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2011/10/03/a-response-from-the-authors-of-the-health-impact-fund/ Response to criticism by Fukuda-Parr and Ariana]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afschin Gandjour and Nadja Chernyak state that the HIF does not have a rational basis for the underlying willingness to pay per health gain and, instead, uses an arbitrary figure such as 0.03% of the GNI. Furthermore, the HIF assumes an arbitrary duration of reward (e.g., 10 years) and does not adjust health gains for equity concerns and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandjour|first1=Afschin|last2=Chernyak|first2=Nadja|title=A new prize system for drug innovation|journal=Health Policy|date=October 2011|volume=102|issue=2-3|pages=170–177|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Social Democratic Party of Germany officially endorsed the HIF and called on the German government to actively support a HIF pilot.&lt;ref&gt;German Social Democratic Party, "[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/021/1702135.pdf Germany's responsibility to fight for health in developing countries - neglected diseases, reduce child and maternal mortality and a strong Global Fund]," Drucksache 17/2135, June 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing (related to Public health, innovation and intellectual property) described the HIF as one of a few "promising" proposals deserving further examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/who-hif.html "WHO Working Group Endorses HIF"], Incentives for Global Health. 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   A new WHO Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) has noted that the HIF proposal would benefit from a pilot to demonstrate feasibility.

Carl Nathan (2009) suggests that the HIF could help to overcome obstacles to the control of tuberculosis such as development and distribution of vaccines and medicines to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Nathan, “Taming Tuberculosis: A Challenge for Science and Society,” ''Cell Host and Microbe'' 5(2009): 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

John J. DeGioia, President of Georgetown University, has complimented the HIF for bringing moral imperatives and pragmatic market principles together.  He states, "that this is the beauty of the Health Impact Fund . . . it translates idealism into innovation."&lt;ref&gt;John J. DeGioia, [http://president.georgetown.edu/sections/speeches/61659.html  “Making New Medicines Available to All: The Health Impact Fund,”] Georgetown University, Gonda Theater.  1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Barry and Matt Peterson favour the HIF as a mechanism for providing innovators with incentives to develop new medicines that have significant health impacts rather than significant sales impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Barry and Matt Peterson, “Shallow Cuts: GSK’s Voluntary Price Reductions and Patent Pooling Are Not Enough,” ''Public Ethics Media'', 4 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Orbinski states that the HIF is an innovative policy proposal that "should be implemented."&lt;ref&gt;James Orbinski, “Are Patents Impeding Medical Care and Innovation?”, [http://www.plosmedicine.org/home.action ''PLoS Medicine''] 7.1(2009): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">The '''Health Information and Quality Authority''' (HIQA) ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''An t-Údarás um Fhaisnéis agus Cáilíocht Sláinte'' ) is a statutory, [[Government of Ireland|government-funded]] agency in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which monitors the safety and quality of the [[Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland|healthcare]] and social care systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/08/31/calls_for_review_of_cancer_treatment/&lt;/ref&gt;  Mooted as early as 2001,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/early-death-still-a-major-health-issue-511673.html&lt;/ref&gt; HIQA received its powers and mandate in May 2007 under the Health Act 2007.  The Authority also exercises functions under the Child Care Act 1991, and the Children Act 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohc.ie/issues/nursing_home_inspection/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520160749/http://www.dohc.ie/issues/nursing_home_inspection/ |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitals==
The Authority has produced a number of reports and recommendations on the safety of care in both public and private hospitals, including [[Mallow General Hospital]], [[Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis]], and Barringtons Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0809/breaking31.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0409/ennis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/08/31/calls_for_review_of_cancer_treatment/&lt;/ref&gt;  HIQA is also tasked with inspecting hygiene standards in public hospitals with the exception of Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/88726.php&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as performing hospital evaluations, HIQA is charged with implementing [[electronic health record]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=6135&lt;/ref&gt; and information governance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imt.ie/features-opinion/2011/05/towards-a-digital-future.html&lt;/ref&gt; investigating waiting times,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0622/health.html&lt;/ref&gt; and protecting [[whistleblower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/better-health-in-new-year-64401.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nursing homes==
After the [[Leas Cross scandal]], there was increased demand for inspection of both private and public nursing homes.  As a result, HIQA was given powers to register, inspect and, via application to court, close nursing homes and similar residential services delivering sub-standard care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1214/nursing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/health/latest-news/independent-inspectors-to-spotcheck-hse-care-homes-1799123.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care==
HIQA has issued reports on foster care services, describing a lack of assessment of carers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herald.ie/national-news/wholl-bring-up-3-siblings-aged-under-5-2800703.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticising the "significant failure" by the [[Health Service Executive]] to monitor children in care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/foster-parents-still-not-fully-vetted-says-watchdog-2672187.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, HIQA raised concerns over the [[Dublin]] and North East areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/concerns-raised-over-quality-of-foster-care-449100.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Human Feces.jpg|thumb|Human feces photographed in a [[toilet]], shortly after [[defecation]].]]

'''Human feces''' (or '''faeces''' in [[British English]]; {{lang-la|fæx}}) are the solid or semisolid remains of the food that could not be digested or absorbed in the [[Gastrointestinal tract#Small intestine|small intestine]] of humans, but has been rotted down by bacteria in the [[large intestine]].&lt;ref name=tortora1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P. | name-list-format = vanc | title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |page=624|edition= Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|publication-date= 1987 |isbn= 0-06-350729-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciba&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. | last2=Lentner |first2=C. | chapter= Faeces | name-list-format = vanc | title= in: Scientific Tables | edition= Seventh |location=Basle, Switzerland |publisher=CIBA-GEIGY Ltd. |publication-date=1970 |pages=657–660}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains bacteria and a relatively small amount of [[metabolic waste]] products such as bacterially altered [[bilirubin]], and the dead epithelial cells from the lining of the gut.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; It is discharged through the [[anus]] during a process called [[defecation]]. Human feces have similarities to [[feces]] of other animals and vary significantly in appearance (i.e. size, color, texture), according to the state of the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[digestive system]] and general [[health]]. Normally human feces are semisolid, with a [[mucus]] coating. Small pieces of harder, less moist feces can sometimes be seen impacted in the [[Distal|distal]] (final or lower) end. This is a normal occurrence when a prior [[bowel movement]] is incomplete, and feces are returned from the [[rectum]] to the large [[intestine]], where water is absorbed.

In the medical literature, the term "'''stool'''" is more commonly used than "feces".&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stool&lt;/ref&gt;

Human feces together with human [[urine]] are collectively referred to as [[human waste]] or human [[excretion|excreta]]. Containing human feces, and preventing spreading of [[pathogen]]s from human feces via the [[fecal–oral route]], are the main goals of [[sanitation]].

== Characteristics ==

=== Classification ===
{{Main|Bristol stool scale}}
The Bristol stool scale is a [[medical]] aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories. Sometimes referred to in the UK as the Meyers Scale, it was developed by K. W. Heaton at the [[University of Bristol]] and was first published in the ''Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis SJ, Heaton KW | title = Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = 920–4 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9299672 | doi = 10.3109/00365529709011203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The form of the stool depends on the time it spends in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constipationadvice.co.uk/further-resources/pam-campbell-constipation-management.pdf|title=Constipation Management and Nurse Prescribing: The importance of developing a concordant approach|format=PDF|access-date=2006-11-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060705163244/http://www.constipationadvice.co.uk/further-resources/pam-campbell-constipation-management.pdf |archive-date = 2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven types of stool are:
# Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
# Sausage-shaped but lumpy
# Like a sausage but with cracks on the surface
# Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
# Soft blobs with clear-cut edges
# Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
# Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely Liquid
Types 1 and 2 indicate [[constipation]]. Types 3 and 4 are optimal, especially the latter, as these are the easiest to [[Defecation|pass]]. Types 5–7 are associated with increasing tendency to [[diarrhea]] or urgency&lt;!-- PER WP:ENGVAR, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF THIS OR OTHER WORDS --&gt;.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

[[Meconium]] is a newborn [[infant|baby]]'s first feces.

===Color===
Human fecal matter varies significantly in appearance, depending on diet and health.

==== Brown ====
:Human feces ordinarily has a light to dark brown coloration, which results from a combination of [[bile]], and [[bilirubin]] derivatives of [[stercobilin]] and [[urobilin]],&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|page=798|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; from dead [[red blood cell]]s. Normally it is semisolid, with a [[mucus]] coating.

==== Yellow ====
:Yellowing of feces can be caused by an infection known as [[giardiasis]], which derives its name from ''[[Giardia]]'', an [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[flagellated]] [[protozoan]] [[parasite]] that can cause severe and communicable yellow [[diarrhea]].  Another cause of yellowing is a condition known as [[Gilbert's Syndrome]]. Yellow stool can also indicate that food is passing through the digestive tract relatively quickly. Yellow stool can be found in people with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).

==== Pale or gray ====
:Stool that is pale or grey may be caused by insufficient bile output due to conditions such as [[cholecystitis]], [[gallstones]], [[giardia]] parasitic infection, [[hepatitis]], chronic [[pancreatitis]], or [[cirrhosis]]. [[Bile]] salts from the [[liver]] give stool its brownish color. If there is decreased bile output, stool is much lighter in color.

==== Black or red ====
:Feces can be black due to the presence of red blood cells that have been in the intestines long enough to be broken down by digestive enzymes. This is known as [[melena]], and is typically due to [[bleeding]] in the upper digestive tract, such as from a bleeding [[peptic ulcer]]. Conditions that can also cause blood in the stool include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulitis, [[colon cancer]], and ulcerative colitis. The same color change can be observed after consuming foods that contain a substantial proportion of animal blood, such as [[black pudding]] or [[tiết canh]]. Black feces can also be caused by a number of medications, such as [[bismuth subsalicylate]] (the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol), and dietary [[iron supplements]], or foods such as [[beetroot]], black [[liquorice]], or blueberries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003130.htm | title =Bloody or tarry stools | access-date = 2009-11-30 | date = 2009-11-01 | last = Dugdale | first = David | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Hematochezia]] is similarly the passage of feces that are bright red due to the presence of undigested blood, either from lower in the digestive tract, or from a more active source in the upper digestive tract. [[Alcoholism]] can also provoke abnormalities in the path of blood throughout the body, including the passing of red-black stool. Hemorrhoids can also cause surface staining of red on stools, because as they leave the body the process can compress and burst hemorrhoids near the anus.

==== Blue ====
:[[Prussian blue]], or blue, a coloring used in the treatment of [[radiation poisoning|radiation]], [[cesium]], and [[thallium]] poisoning,  can turn the feces blue. Substantial consumption of products containing blue food dye, such as blue [[curaçao (liqueur)|curaçao]] or grape soda, can have the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/prussianblue.asp | title = Fact Sheet: Prussian Blue | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | access-date = 2009-11-30 | date = 2006-05-10 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020123050/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/prussianblue.asp | archive-date = 2013-10-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silver ====
:A tarnished-silver or aluminum paint-like feces color characteristically results when [[biliary obstruction]] of any type (white stool) combines with [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] from any source ([[melena|black stool]]). It can also suggest a [[carcinoma]] of the [[ampulla of Vater]], which will result in gastrointestinal bleeding and biliary obstruction, resulting in silver stool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnx.org/content/m14979/latest/ OpenStax CNX&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Green ====
:Feces can be green due to having large amounts of unprocessed bile in the digestive tract and strong-smelling [[diarrhea]]. This can occasionally be the result from eating [[liquorice]] candy, as it is typically made with [[anise]] oil rather than liquorice herb and is predominantly sugar. Excessive sugar consumption or a sensitivity to anise oil may cause loose, green stools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestrong.com/article/472989-can-licorice-cause-discolored-stools/ Can Licorice Cause Discolored Stools? | LIVESTRONG.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also result from consuming excessive amounts of blue or green dye, such as were found in [[Burger King]]'s Halloween Whopper.&lt;ref name="hallowhopper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/10/08/why-black-whopper-turns-your-poop-green/73623596/|title=Why the black Whopper turns your poop green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Violet or purple ====
:Violet or purple feces is a symptom of [[porphyria]].

===Odor===
Feces possess physiological odor, which can vary according to diet and health status. For example, meat protein contains a lot of the sulfur-containing amino acid [[methionine]], which is a precursor of the sulfur-containing odorous compounds listed below.&lt;ref name="Hiele 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiele M, Ghoos Y, Rutgeerts P, Vantrappen G, Schoorens D | title = Influence of nutritional substrates on the formation of volatiles by the fecal flora | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 1597–602 | date = June 1991 | pmid = 2019366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tangerman 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tangerman A | title = Measurement and biological significance of the volatile sulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide in various biological matrices | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 877 | issue = 28 | pages = 3366–77 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19505855 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2009.05.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chavez 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavez C, Coufal CD, Carey JB, Lacey RE, Beier RC, Zahn JA | title = The impact of supplemental dietary methionine sources on volatile compound concentrations in broiler excreta | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 901–10 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15206616 | doi = 10.1093/ps/83.6.901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geypens 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geypens B, Claus D, Evenepoel P, Hiele M, Maes B, Peeters M, Rutgeerts P, Ghoos Y | title = Influence of dietary protein supplements on the formation of bacterial metabolites in the colon | journal = Gut | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–6 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9274475 | pmc = 1027231 | doi = 10.1136/gut.41.1.70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otto 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Otto ER, Yokoyama M, Hengemuehle S, von Bermuth RD, van Kempen T, Trottier NL | title = Ammonia, volatile fatty acids, phenolics, and odor offensiveness in manure from growing pigs fed diets reduced in protein concentration | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 81 | issue = 7 | pages = 1754–63 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12854812 | doi = 10.2527/2003.8171754x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The odor of human feces is suggested to be made up from the following odorant volatiles:&lt;ref name="Tangerman 2009" /&gt;

** [[skatole]]
* [[Hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)
(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is the most common volatile sulfur compound in feces.&lt;ref name="Tangerman 2009" /&gt; The odor of feces may be increased when various pathologies are present, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dugdale|first=David C.|title="Stools - foul smelling" on Medline Plus|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003132.htm|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Malabsorption]]
* [[Short bowel syndrome]]
Attempts to reduce the odor of feces (and [[flatus]]) are largely based on animal research carried out with industrial applications, such as reduced environmental impact of pig farming. See also: [[Flatulence#Management]], odor. Many dietary modifications/supplements have been researched, including:
* [[Activated charcoal]]&lt;ref name="Suarez 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suarez FL, Furne J, Springfield J, Levitt MD | title = Failure of activated charcoal to reduce the release of gases produced by the colonic flora | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 208–12 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9934757 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.00798.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this study it was found that activated charcoal at a dose of 0.52g four times a day did not appreciably influence the liberation of fecal gases.)

===Average chemical characteristics===
On average humans eliminate 128 g of fresh feces per person per day with a [[pH value]] of around 6.6. Fresh feces contains around 75% water and the remaining solid fraction is 84–93% organic solids.

These organic solids consist of: 25–54% bacterial biomass, 2–25% protein or nitrogenous matter, 25% carbohydrate or undigested plant matter and 2–15% fat. Protein and fat come from the colon due to secretion, epithelial shedding and gut bacterial action. These proportions vary considerably depending on many factors such as mainly [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[Human body weight|body weight]].&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose C, Parker A, Jefferson B, Cartmell E | title = The Characterization of Feces and Urine: A Review of the Literature to Inform Advanced Treatment Technology | journal = Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 17 | pages = 1827–1879 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26246784 | doi = 10.1080/10643389.2014.1000761 | url = https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/1826/9736/1/The_characterization_of_feces%20and%20_urine-2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining solids are composed of calcium and iron phosphates, intestinal secretions, small amounts of dried [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells, and [[mucus]].&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015" /&gt;

The [[Fecal pH test]] for healthy humans is a pH of 6.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osuka A, Shimizu K, Ogura H, Tasaki O, Hamasaki T, Asahara T, Nomoto K, Morotomi M, Kuwagata Y, Shimazu T | title = Prognostic impact of fecal pH in critically ill patients | journal = Critical Care | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = R119 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22776285 | pmc = 3580696 | doi = 10.1186/cc11413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undigested food remnants===
Sometimes food may make an appearance in the feces. Common undigested foods found in human feces are seeds, nuts, corn, and beans, mainly because of their high [[dietary fiber]] content. Beets may turn feces different hues of red. Artificial food coloring in some processed foods, such as highly colorful packaged breakfast cereals, can cause unusual coloring of feces if eaten in sufficient quantities.

Undigested objects such as seeds can pass through the human digestive system, and later [[germinate]]. One result of this is [[tomato]] plants growing where treated [[sewage sludge]] has been used as [[fertilizer]].

== Analytical tools ==

===Stool analysis (stool sample)===
Clinical laboratory examination of feces, usually termed as stool examination or [[stool test]], is conducted for the sake of diagnosis; for example, to detect the presence of parasites such as [[pinworm]]s and their eggs (ova) or to detect disease-spreading bacteria. A [[microbiological culture|stool culture]]—the controlled growth of microbial organisms in [[culture media]] under laboratory conditions—sometimes is performed to identify specific pathogens in stool. The [[stool guaiac test]] (or guaiac fecal occult blood test) is conducted to detect the presence of blood in stool that is not apparent to the unaided eye.

The main pathogens that are commonly looked for in feces include:

* ''[[Bacteroides]] species''
* ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]''
* ''[[Yersinia]]'' tends to be incubated at {{convert|30|°C}}, which is cooler than usual
* ''[[Campylobacter]]'' incubated at {{convert|42|°C}}, in a special environment
* ''[[Aeromonas]]''
* ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' if the person is immunosuppressed (e.g., undergoing cancer treatment)
* [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157]] if blood is visible in the stool sample
* ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''
* ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''

[[Intestinal parasite]]s and their [[Ovum|ova]] (eggs) can sometimes be visible to the [[naked eye]].

===Fecal markers===
The feces can be analyzed for various markers that are indicative of various diseases and conditions. For example, [[faecal calprotectin|fecal calprotectin]] levels indicate an inflammatory process such as [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[neoplasms]] ([[cancer]]).

|}
Also, feces may be analyzed for any [[fecal occult blood]], which is indicative of a [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].

===Analysis of ''E. coli'' bacteria in water sources===
A quick test for fecal contamination of water sources or soil is a check for the presence of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' [[bacteria]] performed with the help of [[MacConkey agar]] plates or [[Petri dish]]es. ''E. coli'' bacteria uniquely develop red colonies at temperature of approximately {{convert|43|°C}} overnight. Although most strains of ''E. coli'' are harmless, their presence is indicative of fecal contamination, and hence an increased possibility of the presence of more dangerous organisms.

Fecal contamination of water sources is highly prevalent worldwide, accounting for the majority of unsafe [[drinking water]]. In [[developing countries]] most sewage is discharged without treatment. Even in [[developed countries]] events of [[sanitary sewer overflow]] are not uncommon and regularly pollute the [[Seine River]] ([[France]]) and the [[River Thames]] ([[England]]), for example.

== Diseases and conditions ==

===Diarrhea===
{{Main|Diarrhea}}
Diarrhea (or diarrhoea in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the condition of having three or more loose or liquid [[bowel movement]]s per day.&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/diarrhoea/en/ |title=Diarrhoea |work=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition can be a symptom of injury, [[disease]] or [[foodborne illness]] and is usually accompanied by abdominal pain.  There are other conditions which involve some but not all of the symptoms of diarrhea, and so the formal medical definition of diarrhea involves defecation of more than 200 grams per day (though formal weighing of stools to determine a diagnosis is never actually carried out).

It occurs when insufficient fluid is absorbed by the colon. As part of the [[digestion]] process, or due to fluid intake, [[food]] is mixed with large amounts of water. Thus, digested food is essentially liquid prior to reaching the colon. The colon absorbs water, leaving the remaining material as a semisolid stool. If the colon is damaged or inflamed, however, absorption is inhibited, and watery stools result.

Diarrhea is most commonly caused by a myriad of [[virus (biology)|viral]] infections but is also often the result of [[bacteria]]l toxins and sometimes even infection.  In sanitary living conditions and with ample food and water available, an otherwise healthy patient typically recovers from the common viral infections in a few days and at most a week.  However, for ill or malnourished individuals diarrhea can lead to severe [[dehydration]] and can become life-threatening without treatment.

===Constipation===
{{Main|Constipation}}
Constipation refers to [[bowel movement]]s that are infrequent or hard to pass.&lt;ref name=Review09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatoor D, Emmnauel A | title = Constipation and evacuation disorders | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research. Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–30 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19647687 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpg.2009.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constipation is a common cause of painful defecation. Severe constipation includes obstipation (failure to pass stools or gas) and [[fecal impaction]], which can progress to [[bowel obstruction]] and become life-threatening.

===Others===
[[Bile]] overload is very rare, and not a health threat. Problems as simple as serious [[diarrhea]] may cause blood in one's stool. Black stools caused by the presence of blood usually indicate a problem in the intestines (the black color is a sign of digested blood), whereas red streaks of blood in stool usually are caused by bleeding in the rectum or anus.

==Uses==
{{see also|Reuse of excreta}}

===Use as fertilizer===
[[File:Faeces- fresh (2946449535).jpg|thumb|Fresh feces collected from a child for a drying experiment]]
Human feces have historically been used as [[fertilizer]] for centuries in the form of [[night soil]], [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]], and [[sewage sludge]]. The use of untreated human feces in agriculture poses significant health risks and has contributed to widespread infection with [[Human parasites|parasitic worms]]—a disease called [[helminthiasis]], affecting over 1.5 billion people in developing countries. 
[[File:Faeces after drying in the oven (in the lab) (3110634841).jpg|thumb|Feces after drying in an experiment to determine moisture content]]
There are methods available to safely reuse human feces in [[agriculture]] as per the "multiple barrier concept" described by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater] - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to "close the loop" between human excreta ([[sanitation]]) and agriculture is also called [[ecological sanitation]]. It may involve certain types of [[dry toilet]]s such as [[Urine-diverting dry toilets|urine-diversion dry toilets]] or [[composting toilets]].

===Fecal transplants===
In humans, fecal transplants (or [[stool transplant]]) is the process of transplantation of fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into a recipient who is suffering from a certain disease, such as [[irritable bowel syndrome]]. The resulting [[inoculation]] of healthy [[gut flora]] can sometimes improve the physiology of the recipient gut.

[[Fecal bacteriotherapy]]—also known as a fecal transplant—is a medical procedure wherein fecal bacteria are transplanted from a healthy individual into a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/poop-transplants-may-combat-bacterial-infections-130609662.html |title='Poop Transplants' May Combat Bacterial Infections |first=Karen |last=Rowan |publisher=LiveScience.com |date=20 October 2012 |access-date=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakken JS, Borody T, Brandt LJ, Brill JV, Demarco DC, Franzos MA, Kelly C, Khoruts A, Louie T, Martinelli LP, Moore TA, Russell G, Surawicz C | title = Treating Clostridium difficile infection with fecal microbiota transplantation | journal = Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 1044–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21871249 | pmc = 3223289 | doi = 10.1016/j.cgh.2011.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research indicates that this may be a valuable method to re-establish normal gut cultures that have been destroyed through the use of antibiotics or some other medical treatments.

===Biogas production===

The [[biogas]] produced from feces when it is contained in [[sewage]] and treated in an [[anaerobic digestion]] process could be worth as much as 9.5 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Paleofeces==
{{Main|Paleofeces}}
[[Paleofeces]], also known as coprolites, are ancient human feces, often found as part of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations or surveys. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions. These are studied to determine the diet and health of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. They also may be analyzed chemically for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using [[lipid analysis]] and [[DNA analysis]]. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==
=== Disgust and shame ===
In all human cultures, feces elicit varying degrees of [[disgust]]. Disgust is experienced primarily in relation to the sense of taste (either perceived or imagined) and, secondarily to anything that causes a similar feeling by sense of smell, touch, or vision. As such, human feces is regarded as something to be avoided diligently: expelled in private and disposed of immediately and without a trace. It often is considered an unacceptable topic in polite conversation and its mere mention may cause offence in certain contexts.

An example of repulsion by feces from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]  is found in the writings called [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] used by [[Jews]] and [[Christian]]s:&lt;blockquote&gt;Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement. For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you.&lt;ref&gt;''Deuteronomy'' 23:12-14, [[The Bible]],  [[New International Version]] (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Anal cleansing ===
{{main|Anal cleansing}}
People from different cultures employ a variety of personal cleansing practices after defecation. The [[anus]] and [[buttocks]] may be either washed with liquids or wiped with [[toilet paper]] or other solid materials. In many [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] cultures, as well as [[Southeast Asia]] and Southern Europe, water is usually used for anal cleansing using a jet, as with a [[bidet]], or most commonly, splashed and washed with the hand. In other cultures (such as many [[Western countries]]), cleaning after defecation is generally done with [[toilet paper]] only.

===Terminology and other terms used===
{{Further|Feces#Terminology}}

There are many synonyms in informal [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] for human feces. Many are [[euphemism]]istic, [[colloquialism|colloquial]], or both; some are [[profanity|profane]] (such as ''[[shit]]''), whereas most belong chiefly to [[baby talk|child-directed speech]] (such as ''poo'' or ''poop''&lt;!-- That is enough examples; this list is not meant to be exhaustive --&gt;) or to [[off-color humor|crude humor]] (such as ''turd''&lt;!-- That is enough examples; this list is not meant to be exhaustive --&gt;).

Human feces together with human [[urine]] are collectively referred to as [[human waste]] or human [[Excretion|excreta]].

An '''isometric exercise tool''' is a device used to exercise most body parts including the [[wrist]] and is often used as part of [[physical therapy]] or in order to build muscle strength in a low impact manner. Devices can range in size from large bulky machines used by physicians to small hand-held devices that can be used by an individual. Isometric devices have been used for centuries. The first devices did not display the users' output; nowadays there are devices that can digitally output the users force. Before that some devices used an analog format.

==How it works==
Isometric exercise tools perform exercises or strength test using static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/isometric-exercises.html Article on static strength training]&lt;/ref&gt;  as compared to ''isotonic contractions'' ("tonos" means "tension" in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does. New isometric exercise tools often used force gauges and a micro processor and then output the force onto an LCD screen or store the information later to be downloaded onto a computer.

==Medical uses==
Isometric exercises can also be used at the bedside to differentiate various [[heart murmur]]s; the murmur of [[mitral regurgitation]] gets louder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | title = Evaluation of Cardiac Murmurs in the Clinic Setting | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Ching | first = W }}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the quieter murmur of [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy J, Aronow WS, Prakash R |title=The effect of isometric exercise on the systolic murmur of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis |journal=Chest |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1168115 |doi=10.1378/chest.67.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with dynamic exercises==
Isometric exercises have some differences in training effect as compared to dynamic exercises. While isometric training increases strength at the specific joint angles of the exercises performed and additional joint angles to a lesser extent, dynamic exercises increase strength throughout the full [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindh M |title=Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles |journal=Scand J Rehabil Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–6 |year=1979 |pmid=419396 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking however, people who train isometrically don't train through a full range of motion as the strength gained at the training joint angle is where they require it. While dynamic exercises are slightly better than isometric exercises at enhancing the twitch force of a muscle, isometrics are significantly better than dynamic exercises at increasing maximal strength at the joint angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duchateau J, Hainaut K |title=Isometric or dynamic training: differential effects on mechanical properties of a human muscle |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=296–301 |year=1984 |pmid=6706740 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flexibility may be increased when isometrics are performed at joint range of motion extremes.  These isometric contractions recruit muscle fibers that are often neglected in some dynamic exercises.  For example, gymnasts are extremely strong at great ranges of motion through the practice of isometric holds.

'''James Makittrick Adair''' M.D. (1728–1802), a native of [[Inverness]], and youngest son of [[James Makittrick]], held several occupations but is best remembered for his medical ethics and treatment of slaves and the poor.  He was educated at the grammar school and [[University of Edinburgh]].  Early in life he was an officer in the army.  Having wasted his own fortune and that of his wife, a descendant of the Adair family, he became an officer in the revenue department at Edinburgh and was later appointed surgeon's mate of the ''Porcupine'' [[sloop]] of war, bound to the [[Leeward Islands]].

Shortly thereafter, he returned to England and soon decided to proceed to [[Antigua]], where he became assistant to a relative, and began to study the medical profession. He also undertook the management of an estate on Antigua, becoming familiar with the condition of the slaves.  Although he was anxious for the improvement of the conditions of the slaves, he was opposed to emancipation. He published a tract in 1789 on the subject of the abolition of slavery, in which he tried to depict the real state of slavery in the [[West Indies]], the probable consequences of the abolition of the slave trade; to point out some grievances of the slave, the means by which they might be relieved, and, he added, the necessary regulations of the hospital for the management of the sick. He held that humanity to slaves and religious instruction were the only securities upon which the West India planter could safely rely. His own conduct towards slaves was very kind. He protected and nurtured them as his own children, and they were friendly in return.

In a few years he left the West Indies, took a voyage to America, and made the acquaintance of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. After a tour in the [[United States]], he returned to Edinburgh, took his degree of M.D., and then settled as a physician at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], in [[Hampshire]].

After the war with America had commenced, he returned to the West Indies on short notice, at the request of a friend.  Upon his arrival he was appointed physician to [[Monk's Hill]] and to the commander-in-chief of the troops, and also as one of the assistant judges of the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas. At this time he adopted the name of Adair, having become the next male heir to the estate of his mother's family.

In 1783 he left the West Indies, returned to England, and settled at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he became in volved in many disputes with his professional colleagues and others. These arose partly from his determined opposition to quacks and [[quackery]]—his attempts to expose and suppress quackery may be seen as [[Quixotism|quixotic]], but they were no less laudable. His temper was, however, altogether unfit for the warfare which he brought about.  He was naturally querulous, hot, and irascible, and his disposition had been soured by disappointments in domestic life. He was, however, a man of an affectionate nature, and endowed with lively sensibility. He was generous to the poor, and the profits of the work he published were all given to support the Bath hospital. His professional acquirements were of no mean description, and he appears to have been a close and rational observer.

He became [[hypochondriac]]al, and died at [[Harrogate]] in 1802.

==Works==
He published the following works.

*''Medical Cautions for the consideration of Invalids'', Bath, 1786, 8vo. second edition, 1787. These specially relate to diet and regimen, and there is a table of the relative digestibility of foods; also essays on fashionable diseases; the dangerous effects of hot and crowded rooms; an inquiry into the use of medicine during a course of mineral waters; and on quacks, quack medicines, and lady doctors.
*''A Philosophical and Medical Sketch of the Natural History of the Human Body and Mind'', Bath, 1787, 8vo. To this work is subjointed an ''Essay on the Difficulties of attaining Medical Knowledge''.
*''Unanswerable Arguments against the Abolition of the Slave Trade'', Bath, 1789, 8vo.
*''Essays on Fashionable Diseases'', Bath, 1790, 8vo.
*''Essay on a Nondescript, or Newly-invented Disease'', 1790, 8vo. He published some papers in the Medical Commentaries, especially one in vol. viii on [[smallpox]] in the West Indies, and in vol. xvii on the successful use of [[cuprum vitriolatum]] and [[conium]], in two cases of [[tuberculosis]]; some strange memoirs relative to himself, etc., under the title of P. Paragraph and R. Goosequill; and also some remarks on Philip Thicknesse, under the same title; and two sermons addressed to sailors and slaves in the West Indies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17970">'''Marina Valeryevna Karaseva ''' ({{lang-ru|Марина Валериевна Карасёва}}, born August 8, 1958, [[Moscow]]) is a Russian musicologist, [[Honoured Art Worker of the Russian Federation]], Professor of [[Moscow Conservatory]], Department of Music Theory, Grand Doctor in Art, Ph.D. in [[Musicology]], Member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers Union]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]], Advisor to the Rector (since 2010).

==Pedagogical contribution==
Karaseva is the author of a new approach to the modern [[ear training]] system. In the 1980s she created a complex methodological system of ear training using [[20th century music]]. She has disclosed basic intonational patterns of modern post major-minor music (its melodics, new modal scales, chord system, rhythm, etc.) and has developed  systematic ways for their study in ear-training courses - from music-school to conservatory level.

Karaseva's course combines the best features of the traditional Russian ear-training system with a new investigation into the area of modern [[harmony]] (particularly, her scientific teacher, Dr. [[Yuri Kholopov]] researches) as well as with a new psychological approach based on [[synesthesia|synesthetic]] listening training. This combination makes Karaseva's course an original one, unique in the world of contemporary [[music education]].

The ear training system created by Karaseva allows students dealing with intonationally and rhythmically complicated music patterns of [[contemporary music]] to be able to clearly select by ear (not only by theoretical analysis) interrelationships between new modes, non-third chords, and new functional tonal system. This method improves sight-singing and listening of [[20th century music]].

Karaseva's course, "Modern [[solfeggio]]" in 3 Volumes (1st vol - music pattern selection and instructive exercises, 2nd - [[20th century music]] examples, 3d Harmonical Solfeggio), was published in 1996. It is considered one of the most effective practical courses in ear training, and, worldwide, it is the first of its kind.
  
"Modern Solfeggio" has been approved for use throughout the Russian music educational system (colleges and conservatories) for more than 20 years.  It has also been used abroad during Karaseva's seminars, master classes and conference papers in the US, Europe and Japan.

In 1999, Karaseva took up a Senior Fulbright Scholarship in the United States.  Her Fulbright Program research project was entitled "Music Psychotechnology as a New Approach at the Cross-Roads of Sciences: Cognitive [[Musicology]] and Practical [[Psychology]]" (School of Music, [[University of Maryland, College Park]], 1999-2000).

In the same year, she wrote a monograph, "Solfeggio - a [[Psychotechnique]] of [[Ear training]]" (371 pp.) where she explaines the core of her methodology. This book became the first complex scientific investigation in the field of practical music [[cognition]]. Karaseva obtained a degree of Grand Doctor in Art (the highest academic degree in Russia) for this book in October 2000. A second edition was published in 2002. Her books and courses on Modern [[Solfeggio]] can be found in many libraries in the USA, Europe, and Japan.

In 2005 she created a new course in music timbre dictations, which is published with a CD containing various natural and synthetic instrumental and vocal timbres.

The second area of Karaseva's innovative activities is the creation of interdisciplinary academic courses new to the Russian musical and academic system (in Russia [[music education]] is not part of the general university system). She has devised, and now delivers, an academic course on [[Social Psychology]] of Music for [[Moscow State University]] (Adjunct Professor of the [[MSU Department of Psychology]], from 2001) and a course on "Music Sociology" at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) (Adjunct Professor of the Department of [[Sociology]] from 2006).

Karaseva's latest research is in the field of language learning.  She is investigating the application of musical notation for the improvement of intonation in foreign-language study. She has written a course in the musical decoding of the intonation of Japanese and English speech. In 2006 her innovative interdisciplinary approach was approved at the Congress for Japanese Language Study in The Institute for Asian and African Studies affiliated with Moscow State University and at the International Congress of Asia [[TEFL]] Society in Fukuoka, Japan (her paper contribution was awarded by special TEFL grant).

== Professional biography ==
Karaseva undertook her basic professional music education at the Moscow Conservatory College (1973-1977), the Moscow Conservatory, Department of Music Theory and Composition (1977-1982) and then completed Postdoctoral-Fellowship study at the Moscow Conservatory (1982-1988).

The main subject of her undergraduate and doctoral research were contemporary systems of ear training around the world.  This research was undertaken under the supervision of [[Yuri Kholopov]]. She completed an M.A. on: "Toward the Problem of Ear training and Sight Singing of the XX Century Music. The Systematization of Solfeggio Methods" (1982). Her Ph.D. thesis researched "The Theoretical Problems of the Modern Ear training" (1989).
 
In 1982 Karaseva became a teacher at the Central Music School of Moscow Conservatory (1982-1996, Music Theory, Harmony and Ear training) and a professor at the Moscow Conservatory (Department of Music Theory, from 1982 to present time, from 2002 - Full Professor position).

In 2004 she began studying Japanese and investigating methodological investigations on the problem of Japanese intonation and its music notation (at The Japan Embassy Cultural Center in Moscow). In 2005 and 2006 she obtained the JLPT Certificate (4th and 3rd level) from the [[Japan Foundation]].

Dr. Karaseva actively participates in international musicological and interdisciplinary conferences in Russia, Europe, America, and Japan. She is the author of more than 50 books, manuals and metholological papers on music (music theory, ear training) and language education, [[music psychology]] and cultural policy.

'''Maxillary hypoplasia''' is an underdevelopment of the [[maxillary bone]]s, which produces midfacial retrusion and creates the illusion of protuberance (jutting forward) of the lower jaw. It is associated with [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Angelman syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2986680 | pmid=19455185 | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.67 | volume=17 | title=Angelman syndrome (AS, MIM 105830) | year=2009 | author=Van Buggenhout G, Fryns JP | journal=Eur J Hum Genet | pages=1367–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]. It can also be associated with [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]]. Some people could develop it due to poor dental extractions.&lt;ref name="wisegeekhealth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-maxillary-hypoplasia.htm|title=What Is Maxillary Hypoplasia? (with picture)|website=Wisegeekhealth.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The underdevelopment of the bones in the upper jaw, which gives the middle of the face a sunken look and makes the lower jaw seem like it is sticking out, even if anatomically it is normal.&lt;ref name="wisegeekhealth.com"/&gt; This makes it difficult to eat and can cause future problems for the patient, such as, [[Nasopharyngeal airway]] restriction, which can then lead to back pain, neck pain, and numbness in the hands and arms, due to constant forward head posture. This restriction can also lead to [[Sleep apnea]] and snoring. Sleep apnea can lead to heart problems, endocrine problems, increased weight, [[cognition]] problems, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkbetterlife.com/maxillary-hypoplasia-a-cosmetic-problem-with-postural-physiologic-implications-including-sleep-apnea/|title=Maxillary Hypoplasia|date=26 September 2014|website=Thinkbetterlife.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Corrective surgery is the most common treatment to correct this disorder. It involves the repositioning of the upper jaw to align with the lower jaw, to provide symmetry. It is best performed during childhood, if possible, to allow the jaw to recover and develop. The surgery may be performed in consultation with an [[Orthodontics|Orthodontist]] who works on repositioning the teeth in the mouth.&lt;ref name="wisegeekhealth.com"/&gt;

===Recovery===
The recovery time after the surgery depends on the extent of the surgery itself. Patients are usually advised to eat soft foods for days, or sometimes weeks, to allow their jaw time to heal. They also require regular checkups with the doctor to monitor bone displacement, signs of infection, or other issues.&lt;ref name="wisegeekhealth.com"/&gt;

==Physiology of the photomotor reflex==
Light entering the eye strikes three different [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the [[retina]]: the familiar [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]] used in image forming and the more newly discovered [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s.  The ganglion cells give information about ambient light levels, and react sluggishly compared to the rods and cones.  Signals from photosensitive ganglion cells have multiple functions including acute suppression of the hormone [[melatonin]], [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the body's [[circadian rhythm]]s and regulation of the size of the pupil.

The retinal photoceptors convert light stimuli into electric impulses.  Nerves involved in the resizing of the pupil connect to the [[Pretectum|pretectal nucleus]] of the high [[Mesencephalon|midbrain]], bypassing the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the primary [[visual cortex]]. From the pretectal nucleus neurons send axons to neurons of the [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]] whose [[Motor neuron|visceromotor]] axons run along both the left and right [[oculomotor nerve]]s. Visceromotor nerve axons (which constitute a portion of [[cranial nerve]] III, along with the somatomotor portion derived from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus) synapse on [[ciliary ganglion]] neurons, whose parasympathetic axons innervate the [[iris sphincter muscle]], producing '''miosis'''.  This occurs because sympathetic activity from the ciliary ganglion is ''lost'' thus parasympathetics are not inhibited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">A '''multiple of the median''' ('''MoM''') is a measure of how far an individual test result [[Deviation (statistics)|deviates]] from the [[median]].  MoM is commonly used to report the results of [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]] tests, particularly where the results of the individual tests are highly [[Statistical dispersion|variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wald|first=Nicholas|date=1976|chapter=The detection of neural tube defects by screening maternal blood.|url=|title=Prenatal Diagnosis|volume=Les Colloques d'inserm|issue=61|doi=|pages=227-38|isbn=2855981484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wald|first=Nicholas|date=1977|title=Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement in antenatal screening for anencephaly and spina bifida in early pregnancy|url=|journal=Lancet|volume=|issue=1|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(77)92549-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=All MoMs are not equal: some statistical properties associated with reporting results in the form of multiples of median| pmid=7679245 | volume=52|issue=2|pmc=1682205|journal=Am J Hum Genet|pages=425-30|author=Bishop JC, Dunstan FD, Nix BJ, Reynolds TM, Swift A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoM was originally used as a method to normalize data from participating laboratories of [[Alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP) so that individual test results could be compared. 35 years later, it is the established standard for reporting maternal serum screening results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphl.org/conferences/proceedings/Documents/2013/2013-Newborn-Screening-Symposium/23Berberich.pdf|title=Using Multiples of the Median (MoM) for Normalization of TREC Results Meets the Need for Standardized SCID Reporting|last=Berberich|first=Stanton L.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An MoM for a test result for a patient can be determined by the following:
:&lt;math&gt;MoM(Patient) = \frac{Result(Patient)}{Median(PatientPopulation)}&lt;/math&gt;

As an example, [[Alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP) testing is used to screen for a [[neural tube defect]] (NTD) during the second trimester of pregnancy. If the median AFP result at 16 weeks of gestation is 30&amp;nbsp;ng/mL and a pregnant woman's AFP result at that same gestational age is 60&amp;nbsp;ng/mL, then her MoM is equal to 60/30 = 2.0. In other words, her AFP result is 2 times higher than "normal."

'''Nabiximols''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]],&lt;ref&gt;United States Adopted Names Council: [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/nabiximols.pdf Statement on a nonproprietary name]&lt;/ref&gt; trade name '''Sativex''') is a specific extract of ''[[Cannabis]]'' that was approved as a [[botanical drug]] in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray to alleviate [[neuropathic pain]], [[spasticity]], [[overactive bladder]], and other symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]]; it was developed by the UK company [[GW Pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;UK Medicines Online [http://www.ukmi.nhs.uk/applications/ndo/record_view_open.asp?newDrugID=3919 Nabiximols] Page accessed Feb 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Trust. October 2014 [http://www.mstrust.org.uk/information/publications/factsheets/sativex.jsp Sativex (nabiximols) - factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is a pharmaceutical product standardised in composition, formulation, and dose.  Its principal active cannabinoid components are the cannabinoids: [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and [[cannabidiol]] (CBD). Each spray delivers a dose of 2.7&amp;nbsp;mg THC and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg CBD.

In May 2003 GW Pharmaceuticals and [[Bayer]] entered into an exclusive marketing agreement for GW's cannabis-based medicinal extract product, to be marketed under the brand name Sativex. "Bayer has obtained exclusive rights to market Sativex in the UK. In addition, Bayer has the option for a limited period to negotiate the marketing rights in other countries in European Union and selected other countries around the world."

In April 2011, GW licensed to [[Novartis]] the rights to commercialise nabiximols in Asia (excluding China and Japan), Africa and the Middle East (excluding Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|title=GW signs Sativex cannabis-based drug deal with Novartis |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/8443914/GW-signs-Sativex-cannabis-based-drug-deal-with-Novartis.html|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
In June 2010, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] of the United Kingdom licensed nabiximols as a prescription-only medicine for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. This regulatory authorization represents the world's first full regulatory approval for the medicine. The spray is being marketed in the UK by Bayer Schering Pharma. Many people with MS cannot receive nabiximols due to local [[National Health Service]] (NHS) resistance to its funding;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sussex MS sufferers call for drug funding |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9064713.Sussex_MS_sufferers_call_for_drug_funding/|last=Ryan|first=Siobhan|accessdate=8 June 2011|newspaper=Argus (Sussex,UK)|date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sativex rejected by healthcare provider|work=Lincolnshire|date=20 June 2011|url=http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Cannabis-based-MS-drug-rejected-NHS-Lincolnshire/story-12801496-detail/story.html|accessdate=20 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622021412/http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Cannabis-based-MS-drug-rejected-NHS-Lincolnshire/story-12801496-detail/story.html|archivedate=22 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in August 2014, the NHS in Wales agreed to fund Sativex for people with multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wales NHS to offer MS cannabis drug Sativex |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-28810407|accessdate=18 August 2014|date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabiximols was also approved in Spain for MS spasticity in the second half of 2010 and was launched in that country in March 2011. It was approved in the Czech Republic in April 2011, in Germany in May 2011, in Denmark in June 2011 and in Sweden in January 2012 to people with MS who have not responded adequately to other medication for spasticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/malgrupp/Halso---sjukvard/Monografier-varderingar/Humanlakemedel-/Sativex-nabiximols/ Sativex (nabiximols), Swedish Medical Products Agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101072522/http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/malgrupp/Halso---sjukvard/Monografier-varderingar/Humanlakemedel-/Sativex-nabiximols/ |date=2014-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been recommended for approval in Italy and Austria with formal approvals expected in these countries during 2011. In Spain and other European markets (excluding the UK), nabiximols will be marketed by [[Almirall]].

In Canada, nabiximols has been approved by [[Health Canada]] for the treatment of MS spasticity. It has also received a licence with conditions (NOC/c) for two additional uses: as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis,&lt;ref&gt;GW Pharmaceuticals.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabiximols is available in a number of countries as an unlicensed medicine, which enables doctors to prescribe the product to people who they consider may benefit. The product has been exported from the UK to a total of 28 countries to date.

In February 2007, GW and [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.|Otsuka Pharmaceutical]] announced an exclusive agreement for Otsuka to develop and market the drug in the United States.  The first large scale US Phase IIb trial, Spray Trial, for people with cancer reported positive results in March 2010. GW and Otsuka have now commenced the Phase III development of nabiximols in [[cancer pain]].

In December 2012, Sativex was approved in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olszewska|first1=Dorota|last2=Kidawa Michał|title=Sativex - lek z marihuany|url=http://www.kbpn.gov.pl/portal?id=2451557|publisher=Krajowe Biuro Do Spraw Przeciwdziałania Narkomanii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, France legalized the use of cannabinoids in medicine, Sativex is the first one to be sold under prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/10/france-marijuana-based-drug-legalizes-multiple-sclerosis_n_4575780.html | title=France Legalizes Marijuana-Based Drug To Treat Multiple Sclerosis | publisher=HunffingtonPost | accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at least until June 2016, this drug was never actually sold in pharmacies there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/20160405.OBS7854/cannabis-therapeutique-pourquoi-le-sativex-n-est-il-toujours-pas-vendu-en-france.html | title=Cannabis thérapeutique : pourquoi le Sativex n'est-il toujours pas vendu en France ? | publisher=Sciences et Avenir | accessdate=6 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510022254/http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/20160405.OBS7854/cannabis-therapeutique-pourquoi-le-sativex-n-est-il-toujours-pas-vendu-en-france.html | archive-date=2016-05-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Of the two preliminary Phase III studies investigating the treatment of people with MS, one showed a reduction of spasticity of 1.2 points on the 0–10 points rating scale (versus 0.6 points under [[placebo]]), the other showed a reduction of 1.0 versus 0.8 points. Only the first study reached statistical significance. The Phase III approval study consisted of a run-in phase where the response of individuals to the drug was determined. The responders (42% of subjects) showed a significant effect in the second, placebo controlled, phase of the trial.&lt;ref name="Schubert"&gt;Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, ''Neue Arzneimittel 2011/2012'' {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 meta-analysis of six studies found large variations of effectiveness, with a – statistically non-significant – trend towards a reduction of spasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review|first1=Shaheen E|last1=Lakhan|first2=Marie|last2=Rowland|journal=BMC Neurol|year=2009|volume=9|page=59|pmid=19961570|pmc=2793241|doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review in 2014 by the American Academy of Neurology found that nabiximols was 'probably effective' for spasticity, pain, and urinary dysfunction, but wasn't supported for tremor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Systematic review: efficacy and safety of medical marijuana in selected neurologic disorders: report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal = Neurology|date = 2014-04-29|issn = 1526-632X|pmc = 4011465|pmid = 24778283|pages = 1556–1563|volume = 82|issue = 17|doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000363|first = Barbara S.|last = Koppel|first2 = John C.

== Licensing ==
GW Pharmaceuticals were issued a unique license to cultivate cannabis for the manufacturing of Sativex in the UK, granting them the sole legal right to research in aerosolized cannabis derived therapeutics, which in April 2013 became commercially viable when the UK Government scheduled the Sativex formulation to part IV of the UK Drugs Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwpharm.com/GW%20Pharmaceuticals%20cannabinoid-medicine%20Sativex%20moved%20to%20Schedule%204%20of%20UK%20Drugs%20Act.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204821/http://www.gwpharm.com/GW%20Pharmaceuticals%20cannabinoid-medicine%20Sativex%20moved%20to%20Schedule%204%20of%20UK%20Drugs%20Act.aspx |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment''' ({{lang-nl|Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu}} or simply ''RIVM''),  is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] research institute that is an independent agency of the Dutch [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]].

RIVM performs tasks to promote [[public health]] and a safe living [[Natural environment|environment]] by conducting research and collecting knowledge worldwide. The results are used to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy. RIVM's primary tasks are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/organisatie/ORG1236213/ Search of the Dutch Research Data Base (NOD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ About RIVM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221023446/http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*research 
*policy support

*provision of reliable information to the general public and to professionals working in health care, infectious diseases, the environment, nutrition and safety.

RIVM is located in [[Bilthoven]] and employs over 1500 people, many of whom work in multidisciplinary fields.

==History==

RIVM was founded in 1910 when the Central Laboratory for Public Health was created and the present size of the institute is the result of a merger between three government institutes in 1984. RIVM has now become a large, complex organisation with many different international links and a range of activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciesin.org/IC/rivm/about.html The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)] (at Columbia University, New York, USA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

The RIVM organisation consists of three domains with specific knowledge and expertise: Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology (Centre for Infectious Disease Control), Environment and Safety (including environmental incident service), Public Health and Health Services (including food and food safety).

''' The Norwegian Health Economics Administration''' (Norwegian: Helseøkonomiforvaltningen HELFO),&lt;ref&gt;http://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=986965610&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known by its Norwegian acronym '''HELFO''' is a governmental institution, subordinate{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} to [[Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs]]. HELFO is in charge of The regular GP scheme, which entitles one to have a regular GP, and issuance of The European Health Insurance Card (Europeisk helsetrygdkort).

== Budget ==
Its annual budget is about 23 billion [[Norwegian kroner]] (NOK), which includes  direct payments to various health service providers, individual reimbursment for certain medicines, dental services and health services abroad. The institution currently has about 600 employees distributed among the Main Office, 6 Regional Offices, HELFO Patient Referral Unit and HELFO Service centre.

== General practitioners ==
HELFO organizes the GP scheme (fastlegeordningen), which ensures that all residents in Norway can seek a medical consultation with a general practitioner. The scheme is voluntary. Residents are entitled to swap their GP if they wish, for example if they wish to be listed with a GP in different municipality to where they live. The GP can be changed on the Internet.

== European health insurance card ==
A European health insurance card entitles the holder to health services when staying temporarily in another EU/EEA country or in [[Switzerland]]. When the insurance card is presented to the person/institution treating the holder, he or she will be entitled to medical treatment in the country he or she is staying in on the same conditions as the people living there. This also means that he or she must pay the same patient charges as them.

To be entitled to a European health insurance card, the primary condition is that one is a member of the Norwegian National Insurance scheme, and that the person is a Norwegian citizen or a citizen of another EU/EEA country or Switzerland. The European health insurance card is a plastic card the size of a regular bank card. The scheme also covers family members, i.e. spouses and children under the age of 25. They are entitled to European health insurance cards regardless of citizenship and of whether they are members of the National Insurance scheme. Each family member must carry their own European health insurance card. The insurance card is issued for three years, provided that conditions are still met.

== Patient charges and exemption card ==
Members of the Norwegian National Insurance scheme, only pay a fixed part of the cost of public health services, called patient charges. This applies to medical treatment, buying medicines on a refundable prescription, physiotherapy, seeing a psychologist and travel expenses to consultations and treatment appointments. If a person has paid a certain amount in patient charges, he or she is eligible for an exemption card. This means he or she is exempt from paying patient charges for the rest of the calendar year. There are two types of exemption cards. The amounts are set annually by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting.

The exemption card for user fee group 1 covers approved patient charges paid to doctors, psychologists and outpatient clinics and for x-rays, patient travel and blue prescription medicine and equipment. The exemption card for user fee 2 covers approved patient charges paid for physiotherapy, certain dental diseases, approved rehabilitation institutions and travel for treatment abroad organised by Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet HF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">'''Nosokinetics''' is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in [[health care|health]] and [[social care]] systems.&lt;ref name=nosok&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/ Nosokinetics website]&lt;/ref&gt;'' Nosokinetics'' brings together the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''noso'': disease and ''kinetics'': movement.

[[Black box]] models are currently used to plan changes in health and social care systems. These input-output models overlook the process of inpatient care, as a result suboptimal decisions are made. Nosokinetics, (analogous to [[Pharmacokinetics]]), seeks to develop dynamic methods which measure and model the process of inpatient care. The aim is to develop a scientific base to underpin the planning of sustainable health and social care systems.
== Establishment ==
Nosokinetics is a new ''science'' that was established in the UK in the early 1990s by Prof [[Peter H Millard]] after publishing his PhD thesis. In 2004 Nosokinetics group newsletter was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html Peter Millard Resume &amp; Photo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172724/http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Prof [[Peter  H Millard]] writes about Nosokinetics : "If the random forces of wind and tide can make such a beautiful statue (referring to an [[iceberg]]), how much better could [[human|mankind]] do if a new [[science]] was developed which explains the complex processes of health and social care. Until new methods of planning health and social care services to meet the needs of an [[ageing]] population are introduced, service delivery will stumble on from [[crisis]] to crisis. The world population is ageing and sustainable systems of health care need to be developed."&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

He has established the nosokinetics group of interested [[researcher]]s. The group collaborates to organize [[Academic conference|conferences]] and disseminates [[news]] of nosokinetics and other researchers' research and practical use of modelling to enhance decision making in health and social care systems.&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

== Network ==
The Nosokinetics Group has succeeded in attracting a lot of researchers. Nosokinetics interested people are present in many countries including [[Australia]], [[UK]] &amp; [[Egypt]]. They are from different disciplines ranging from health care providers to management scientists. The news related to nosokinetics is shared to the network through the bimonthly newsletter ''Nosokinetics News''&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/newsletter.htm Nosokinetics newsletter archive]&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to communicate papers, conferences and events of interest to the Nosokinetics network.

'''PKIDs,'''  which stands for '''Parents of Kids with Infectious Diseases,''' is a national nonprofit organization based in the [[United States]] that serves families of children living with chronic, viral infectious diseases and educates the public on various methods of disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=80572 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074357/http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=80572 |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }} The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on PKIDs&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1996 by a handful of parents, the group became a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortherecordmag.com/archives/ftr_050304p34.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111184802/http://www.fortherecordmag.com/archives/ftr_050304p34.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, thousands of families have been helped and millions of individuals around the country have received PKIDs’ health messages.

==History==
PKIDs started in 1996, when parents adopting internationally were bringing home babies and children with unexpected infections.  Parents, wondering what their families were facing, searched for information on the Internet and, while doing so, found each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Green |first= William Finley |author2=Hari Conjeevaram  |title= [[The First Year: Hepatitis B: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed]] |publisher= [[Marlowe &amp; Company]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 1-56924-533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the nonprofit was officially formed and incorporated in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  In that same year, the families served grew to include all sorts of families – adoptive, biological, foster and so on.

==Mission==
PKIDs’ mission is to educate the public about infectious diseases, the methods of prevention and transmission, and the latest advances in medicine; to eliminate the social stigma borne by the infected; and to assist the families of children living with [[HIV/AIDS]], [[hepatitis]], or other chronic, viral [[infectious diseases]] with emotional, financial, and informational support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=746&lt;/ref&gt;

PIA is rumored to be a serotonergic neurotoxin on the account of that being reported to be the case for [[para-chloroamphetamine|''para''-chloroamphetamine]].

However, PIA is a much weaker 5-HT neurotoxin than is the case for PCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Phytic acid''' (known as '''inositol hexakisphosphate''' ('''IP6'''), '''inositol polyphosphate''', or '''phytate''' when in [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form) is the phosphate ester of [[inositol]]. It contains six phosphate groups.  At physiological pH, these phosphates are partially ionized.  The resulting anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of [[phosphorus]] in many [[plant]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, especially [[bran]] and [[seed]]s.&lt;ref name="schlemmer"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19774556|year=2009|last1=Schlemmer|first1=U.|title=Phytate in foods and significance for humans: Food sources, intake, processing, bioavailability, protective role and analysis|journal=Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research|volume=53 Suppl 2|pages=S330–75|last2=Frølich|first2=W.|last3=Prieto|first3=R.

[[Catabolism|Catabolites]] of phytic acid are called lower inositol polyphosphates. Examples are inositol penta- (IP5), tetra- (IP4), and triphosphate (IP3).

==Significance in agriculture==
Phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not, in general, [[bioavailability|bioavailable]] to non[[ruminant]] animals because these animals lack the digestive [[enzyme]] [[phytase]] required to hydrolyze (break) the inositol-phosphate linkages. [[Ruminant]]s are readily able to digest phytate because of the phytase produced by [[rumen]] [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="CAST"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Terry J. |last1=Klopfenstein |first2=Rosalina |last2=Angel |first3=Gary |last3=Cromwell |first4=Galen E. |last4=Erickson |first5=Danny G. |last5=Fox |first6=Carl |last6=Parsons |first7=Larry D. |last7=Satter |first8=Alan L. |last8=Sutton |first9=David H. |last9=Baker | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 2002 |title=Animal Diet Modification to Decrease the Potential for Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution |journal=Council for Agricultural Science and Technology |volume=21 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/animalscifacpub/518/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most commercial [[agriculture]], non-ruminant [[livestock]], such as [[swine]], [[fowl]], and [[fish]],&lt;ref name="CASTI"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Romarheim OH, Zhang C, Penn M, Liu YJ, Tian LX, Skrede A, Krogdahl Å, Storebakken T  |year=2008 |journal=Aquaculture Nutrition|title=Growth and intestinal morphology in cobia (Rachycentron canadum) fed extruded diets with two types of soybean meal partly replacing fish meal |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=174–180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2095.2007.00517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; are fed mainly [[grain]]s, such as [[maize]], [[legume]]s, and [[soybean]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Because phytate from these grains and beans is unavailable for absorption, the unabsorbed phytate passes through the [[gastrointestinal tract]], elevating the amount of phosphorus in the manure.&lt;ref name="CAST" /&gt; Excess phosphorus excretion can lead to environmental problems, such as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023690824045 |jstor=27503850| year = 2003 |title=Industrialized Animal Production—A Major Source of Nutrient and Microbial Pollution to Aquatic Ecosystems| vauthors = Mallin MA | journal = Population and Environment| volume = 24| issue = 5| pages = 369–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sprouted grains will reduce the quantity of phytic acids in feed, with no significant reduction of nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01092036 |title=Nutritive value of malted millet flours |year=1986 |last1=Malleshi |first1=N. G. |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition |volume=36 |pages=191–6 |last2=Desikachar |first2=H. S. R.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, viable low-phytic acid mutant lines have been developed in several crop species in which the seeds have drastically reduced levels of phytic acid and concomitant increases in inorganic phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Guttieri MJ, Peterson KM, Souza EJ |doi=10.2135/cropsci2006.03.0137 |title=Milling and Baking Quality of Low Phytic Acid Wheat | journal=Crop Science |volume=46 |pages=2403–8|issue=6|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, germination problems have reportedly hindered the use of these cultivars thus far. This may be due to phytic acid's critical role in both phosphorus and metal ion storage.{{Citation needed|date=April  2007}} Phytate variants also have the potential to be used in soil remediation, to immobilize [[uranium]], nickel and other inorganic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seaman JC, Hutchison JM, Jackson BP, Vulava VM | title = In situ treatment of metals in contaminated soils with phytate | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 153–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12549554 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2003.0153 }}{&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological and physiological roles==
Although indigestible for many animals, phytic acid and its metabolites as they occur in seeds and grains have several important roles for the seedling plant.

Most notably, phytic acid functions as a phosphorus store, as an energy store, as a source of cations and as a source of myoinositol (a cell wall precursor). Phytic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Reddy NR, Sathe SK, Salunkhe DK | title = Phytates in legumes and cereals | journal = Advances in Food Research | volume = 28 | pages = 1–92 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6299067 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-2628(08)60110-x | isbn = 9780120164288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animal cells, myoinositol polyphosphates are ubiquitous, and phytic acid (myoinositol hexakisphosphate) is the most abundant, with its concentration ranging from 10 to 100 µM in mammalian cells, depending on cell type and developmental stage.&lt;ref name="Szwergold"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szwergold BS, Graham RA, Brown TR | title = Observation of inositol pentakis- and hexakis-phosphates in mammalian tissues by 31P NMR | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 874–81 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3426614 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(87)90489-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasakawa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasakawa N, Sharif M, Hanley MR | title = Metabolism and biological activities of inositol pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–46 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7543266 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00059-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This compound is not obtained from the animal diet, but must be synthesized inside the cell from phosphate and inositol (which in turn is produced from glucose, usually in the kidneys). The interaction of intracellular phytic acid with specific intracellular proteins has been investigated ''in vitro'', and these interactions have been found to result in the inhibition or potentiation of the physiological activities of those proteins.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanakahi LA, Bartlet-Jones M, Chappell C, Pappin D, West SC | title = Binding of inositol phosphate to DNA-PK and stimulation of double-strand break repair | journal = Cell | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–9 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030616 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00061-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris FA, Ungewickell E, Majerus PW | title = Inositol hexakisphosphate binds to clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP-3/AP180) and inhibits clathrin cage assembly in vitro | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 214–7 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7814377 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.1.214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence from these studies suggests an intracellular role for phytic acid as a cofactor in DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"/&gt; Other studies using yeast mutants have also suggested intracellular phytic acid may be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = York JD, Odom AR, Murphy R, Ives EB, Wente SR | title = A phospholipase C-dependent inositol polyphosphate kinase pathway required for efficient messenger RNA export | journal = Science | volume = 285 | issue = 5424 | pages = 96–100 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10390371 | doi = 10.1126/science.285.5424.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shears1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shears SB | title = Assessing the omnipotence of inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11282453 | doi = 10.1016/S0898-6568(01)00129-2 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260121 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inositol hexaphosphate facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick RA, Zadrozny KK, Xu C, Schur FK, Lyddon TD, Ricana CL, Wagner JM, Perilla JR, Ganser-Pornillos BK, Johnson MC, Pornillos O, Vogt VM | title = Inositol phosphates are assembly co-factors for HIV-1 | journal = Nature | volume = 560 | issue = 7719 | pages = 509–512 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30069050 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0396-4 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0396-4#article-info }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply cooking the food will reduce the phytic acid to some degree. More effective methods are soaking in an acid medium, [[sprouting]] and [[lactic acid fermentation]] such as in [[sourdough]] and [[pickling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US9032841 "Phytates in cereals and legumes"]. fao.org.&lt;/ref&gt; No detectable phytate (less than 0.02% of wet weight) was observed in vegetables such as scallion and cabbage leaves or in fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, or pears.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillippy BQ, Wyatt CJ | title = Degradation of phytate in foods by phytases in fruit and vegetable extracts. | journal = Journal of Food Science | date = May 2001 | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 53–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary mineral absorption===
Phytic acid has a strong binding affinity to the [[dietary minerals]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]], inhibiting their [[Small_intestine#Absorption|absorption]].&lt;ref name=schlemmer/&gt;&lt;ref name="gupta"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4325021|year=2013|last1=Gupta|first1=R.

K.|pmid=25694676|doi=10.1007/s13197-013-0978-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phytochemical]]s like [[polyphenol]]s and [[tannins]] also influence the binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prom-u-thai C, Huang L, Glahn RP, Welch RM, Fukai S, Rerkasem B |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2471 |title=Iron (Fe) bioavailability and the distribution of anti-Fe nutrition biochemicals in the unpolished, polished grain and bran fraction of five rice genotypes |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |year=2006 |volume=86 |pages=1209–15|issue=8|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=19315&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; When iron and zinc bind to phytic acid, they form insoluble precipitates and are far less absorbable in the intestines. This process can therefore contribute to iron and zinc deficiencies in people whose diets rely on these foods for their mineral intake, such as those in [[developing countries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurrell RF | title = Influence of vegetable protein sources on trace element and mineral bioavailability | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 9 | pages = 2973S–7S | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12949395 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.9.2973S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12949395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = Phytates | title = Toxicants Occurring Naturally in Foods | author = Committee on Food Protection | author2 = Food and Nutrition Board | author3 = National Research Council | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | year = 1973 | isbn = 978-0-309-02117-3 | pages = 363–371 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lIsrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vegetarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 103 | issue = 6 | pages = 748–65 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12778049 | doi = 10.1053/jada.2003.50142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human nutrition===
Because phytic acid can affect the absorption of iron, it has been proposed that "dephytinization should be considered as a major strategy to improve iron nutrition during the weaning period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurrell RF, Reddy MB, Juillerat MA, Cook JD | title = Degradation of phytic acid in cereal porridges improves iron absorption by human subjects | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 77 | issue = 5 | pages = 1213–9 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12716674 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/77.5.1213 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.333.4941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 [[UNICEF]] report covering 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, [[Ethiopia]] had the region's highest total number of women that have undergone FGM (27.2 million), while [[Somalia]] had the highest percentage ([[prevalence]]) of FGM (98%).&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt;

The world's first known campaign against FGM took place in Egypt in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; FGM prevalence in Egypt in 1995 was still at least as high as Somalia's 2013 world record (98%), despite dropping significantly since then among young women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/brussels/en/home/ourwork/sustainable-development/successstories/the-taboo-has-been-broken--fighting-female-genital-mutilation-in.html The taboo has been broken: Fighting Female Genital Mutilation in Egypt]. According to this UNDP report, FGM prevalence among 15 to 30-year-olds dropped to 72% already in 2008 after having been 96% in 1995, which means that the prevalence among all women in 1995 was even higher than 76%.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary according to source.

==Classifications of FGM==
{{main|Female genital mutilation}}
The WHO identifies four types of FGM:
*'''Type I''': removal of the [[clitoral hood]], the skin around the [[clitoris]] (''Ia''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''Ib'');
*'''Type II''': removal of the [[labia minora]] (''IIa''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''IIb'') and the [[labia majora]] (''IIc'');
*'''Type III''': removal of all or part of the labia minora (''IIIa'') and labia majora (''IIIb''), and the stitching of a seal across the vagina, leaving a small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood ([[infibulation]]);
*'''Type IV''': other miscellaneous acts, might or might not include cauterization of the clitoris, cutting of the vagina ([[gishiri cutting]]), and introducing corrosive substances into the vagina to tighten it (extreme and rare cases) &lt;ref name=Momoh6&gt;Momoh, Comfort (ed). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&amp;pg=PA5 "Female Genital Mutilation"], Radcliffe Publishing, 2005, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[prevalence]]" is used to describe the proportion of women and girls now living in a country who have undergone FGM at some stage in their lives. This is distinct from the "[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]" of FGM which describes the proportion of women and girls who have undergone the procedure within a particular time period, which could be contemporary or historical. FGM is practiced in Africa, the Middle East,&lt;ref name="FGM - Where is it practiced"/&gt; Indonesia and Malaysia,&lt;ref name="World Health Organization 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William G.

In a 2013 UNICEF report based on surveys completed by select countries, FGM is known to be prevalent in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, where 125 million women and girls have undergone FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp. 3–26. *For Iraqi Kurdistan, also see Yasin, Berivan A. et al.

Other reports claim the prevalence of FGM in countries not discussed by the 2013 UNICEF report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/emro/tp/EMRO_TP_2_vol2_(part2).pdf Female Circumcision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318011449/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/emro/tp/EMRO_TP_2_vol2_(part2).pdf# |date=2012-03-18 }} World Health Organization, United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/first/hosken.html FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION: STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION] Fran P.

As a result of immigration, FGM has also spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States, with some families having their daughters undergo the procedure while on vacation overseas. As Western governments become more aware of FGM, legislation has come into effect in many countries to make the practice a criminal offense. In 2006, [[Khalid Adem]] became the first man in the United States to be prosecuted for mutilating his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/02brfs-001.html?_r=1 "Georgia: Man Convicted in Daughter’s Mutilation"], Associated Press, 2 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has called for elimination of the practice by 2030. A 2017 [[UCLA Fielding School of Public Health]] study, measuring trends in the prevalence of FGM over the course of three decades, found that they dropped significantly in 17 of the 22 countries surveyed. The researchers found a 2–8 percentage points increase in Chad, Mali and Sierra Leone during the 30-years period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koski |first1=Alissa |last2=Heymann |first2=Jody |date=25 November 2017 |title=Thirty-year trends in the prevalence and severity of female genital mutilation: a comparison of 22 countries |url=http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000467 |journal=BMJ Global Health |publisher=BMJ Journals |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e000467 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data reliability==
Much of the FGM prevalence data currently available is based on verbal surveys and self-reporting.&lt;ref name=b2013&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2013/680926 | volume=2013 | title=Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone: Forms, Reliability of Reported Status, and Accuracy of Related Demographic and Health Survey Questions | year=2013 | journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International | pages=1–14 | author=Bjälkander Owolabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical examinations are uncommon. The assumption is that women respond truthfully when asked about their FGM status and that they know the type and extent of FGM that was performed on their genitalia. Many FGM procedures are performed at a very young age, many cultures feel a taboo about such discussions, and a number of such factors raise the possibility that the validity of survey responses might be incorrect, potentially underreported.&lt;ref name=b2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rahman and N. Toubia, Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Worldwide Laws and Policies, Zed Press, London, UK, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oman]], for example, some do not wish to discuss FGM from the fear that such discussion is showing their culture's dirty laundry to the world, causing criticism of a practice that they believe is purely religious.&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307034607/http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/The-issue-of-female-genital-mutilation-in-Oman-1xye The issue of female genital mutilation in Oman] Susan Mubarak, Muscat Daily (January 01, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where FGM has been outlawed, fear of prosecution of family members or self, and social disapproval from elders may cause women to deny that they underwent or were subjected to FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-10-20 | volume=10 | title=Factors associated with female genital mutilation in Burkina Faso and its policy implications | year=2011 | journal=International Journal for Equity in Health | page=20 | author=Karmaker Bue, Kandala Ngianga-Bakwin, Chung Donna, Clarke Aileen}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the self-reported circumcision status of women aged 15–49 was verbally surveyed in 1995 in northern Ghana. The same women were interviewed again in 2000 after the enactment of a law that criminalized FGM and Ghana-wide public campaigns against the practice. This study discovered that 13% of women who reported in 1995 that they had undergone FGM denied it in the 2000 interview, with youngest age group girls denying at rates as high as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;E.

===General===
Although estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary, sources have consistently found the practice to be undergone by the majority of women in the [[Horn of Africa]], in the [[West Africa]]n countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as in Sudan and Egypt.
Of these countries, all have laws or decrees against the practice, with the exception of Sierra Leone, Mali and some states of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change - UNICEF DATA|date=22 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34921135|title=Gambia's Yahya Jammeh bans female genital mutilation|date=25 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thirds of the women claimed tradition and religion as the primary motivation for undergoing FGM.&lt;ref name=mogdji/&gt; A predominantly Muslim country, Islamic clerics in Djibouti have been divided on the FGM issue, with some actively supporting the practice and others opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2313097.html Female Circumcision: Rite of Passage Or Violation of Rights?] Frances Althaus, International Family Planning Perspectives, Volume 23, Number 3, September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/51997/djibouti-fgm-still-a-major-challenge DJIBOUTI: FGM still a major challenge] IRIN, UN news service (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; FGM was outlawed in the country's revised Penal Code that went into effect in April 1995. Article 333 of the Penal Code provides that persons found guilty of this practice will face a five-year prison term and a fine of one million Djibouti francs (approximately US$5,600). Djibouti ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]]'s [[Ministry of Health and Population (Egypt)|Ministry of Health and Population]] has banned all forms of female genital mutilation since 2007.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; The ministry's order declared it is 'prohibited for any doctors, nurses, or any other person to carry out any cut of, flattening or modification of any natural part of the female reproductive system'. Islamic authorities in the nation also stressed that Islam opposes female genital mutilation. The Grand Mufti of Egypt, [[Ali Gomaa]], said that it is "Prohibited, prohibited, prohibited."&lt;ref name = "badour shaker"&gt;Michael, Maggie.

There had previously been provisions under the Penal Code involving "wounding" and "intentional infliction of harm leading to death", as well as a ministerial decree prohibiting FGM. In December 1997, the Court of Cassation (Egypt's highest appeals court) upheld a government banning of the practice providing that those who did not comply would be subjected to criminal and administrative punishments. In Egypt's first trial for committing female genital mutilation, two men were acquitted in November 2014; the doctor was ordered to pay the girl's mother compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kingsley, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/20/egypt-first-female-genital-mutilation-fgm-trial-not-guilty "Egypt's first female genital mutilation trial ends in not guilty verdict"], ''The Guardian'', 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 after an appeal the doctor was sentenced to more than two years in prison and the father was given a three-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30983027|title=BBC News - Egypt FGM trial 'convicts doctor of manslaughter'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2018, the [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah]], a governmental body which advises on Islamic law, declared FGM 'religiously forbidden'.

A study in 2000 found that 97% of Egypt's population practiced FGM. A 2005 study found that over 95% of Egyptian women have undergone some form of FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL30168862 "Egypt death sparks debate on female circumcision"], Reuters, 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence had dropped to 91%.&lt;ref name=childinfo/&gt; The 2016 UNICEF report stated that the share of girls aged 15 to 19 who had undergone FGM dropped from 97% in 1985 to 70% in 2015.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; The percentage of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who had

===Gambia===
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|250 px|Anti-FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Gambia]].&lt;ref name="fgmnetwork1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; In a 2013 report, an estimated 76.3% of girls and women have been subjected to FGM/C.&lt;ref name=kapgh&gt;Kaplan et al., [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/851 Knowledge, attitudes and practices of female genital mutilation/cutting among health care professionals in The Gambia: a multiethnic study], BMC Public Health 2013, 13:851&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 UNICEF survey found a 78.3% prevalence rate in Gambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/gambia/MICS_III_Main_Report_final_version.pdf The Gambia MICS 2005-2006 Report] UNICEF and Gambia Bureau of Statistics (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The age when FGM is done on Gambian girls ranges from 7 days after birth up to pre-adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Hernlund Y: Cutting without ritual and ritual without cutting: female circumcision and the Re-ritualization of initiation in The Gambia.

Gambia's predominant religion is Islam (90%), and it has many ethnic groups. Prevalence rates of FGM/C vary significantly between the ethnic groups: Sarahule (FGM rate of 98%), Mandinka (97%), Djola (87%), Serer (43%), and Wolof (12%). Urban areas report FGM/C rates of about 56%, whereas in rural areas, rates exceed 90%. A majority of Gambian women who underwent FGM/C claimed they did it primarily because religion mandates it.&lt;ref name=kapgh/&gt; 

A 2011 clinical study reports 66% FGMs in Gambia were Type I, 26% were Type II and 8% Type III.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2011), [http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1742-4755-8-26.pdf Health consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting in the Gambia, evidence into action] Reproductive Health, 8:26&lt;/ref&gt; About a third of all women in Gambia with FGM/C, including Type I, suffered health complications because of the procedure. In 2015, Gambia's president [[Yahya Jammeh]] has banned FGM.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; As FGM is less prevalent among younger women according to [[City University London]] in 2015, this suggested a decline in the practice.&lt;ref name="CUL_Prevalence_FGM_Jul2015" /&gt;

===Ghana===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt; According to the WHO, its prevalence is 3.8%. In 1989, the head of the government of Ghana, President Rawlings, issued a formal declaration against FGM. Article 39 of Ghana's Constitution also provides in part that traditional practices that are injurious to a person's health and well being are abolished. The Criminal Code was amended in 1994 to outlaw FGM, and the law was strengthened in 2007.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Ghana ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Guinea===
[[Guinea]] has the second highest FGM prevalence rate in the world.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In a 2005 survey, 96% of all Guinea women aged between 15 and 49 had been cut.&lt;ref name=fgmgui2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-guinea-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Guinea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050527/http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-guinea-2011.pdf |date=2013-10-03 }} Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; That is a slight decline in the practice from the 1999 recorded FGM rate of 98.6%. Among the 15- to 19-year-olds the prevalence was 89%, among 20- to 24-year-olds 95%. About 50% of the women in Guinea believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; Guinea is predominantly a Muslim country, with 90% of the population practicing Islam. The high FGM rates are observed across all religions in Guinea; FGM is prevalent in 99% of Muslim women, 94% of Catholics and Protestants, and 93% of Animist women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

FGM is illegal in Guinea under Article 265 of the Penal Code. The law sentences death to the perpetrator if the girl dies within 40 days after the FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Berhane%20Ras-Work%20revised_.pdf LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM)] Berhane Ras-Work, United Nations (May 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the Guinean Constitution, which outlaws cruel and inhumane treatment, could be interpreted to include these practices, should a case be brought to the Supreme Court. Guinea signed the Maputo Protocol in 2003 but has not ratified it.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; 

Article 305 of Guinea’s penal code also bans FGM, but nobody has yet been sentenced under any of Guinea's FGM-related laws.&lt;ref name=fgmgui2011/&gt; In Guinea, instead of stopping FGM, the trend is towards medicalisation of FGM, where the mutilation is advertised under hygienic conditions by medically trained staff, who see FGM practice an additional source of income. Per the above 2005 survey, 27% of girls were cut by medically trained staff.

===Guinea-Bissau===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Guinea-Bissau]], and have been estimated at a 50% prevalence rate in 2000.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; A law banning the practice nationwide was adopted by Parliament in June 2011 with 64 votes to 1. At the time, 45% of women aged 15 to 49 years were affected by FGM. According to a survey, 33% of women favoured a continuation of genital cutting, but 50% of the overall population wanted to abandon the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/guineabissau_59787.html |title=New law prohibits practice of female genital mutilation in Guinea-Bissau &amp;#124; At a glance: Guinea-Bissau |publisher=UNICEF |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) estimated the national prevalence of FGM to be 21% among women age 15-49, down from 27% in the 2008/09 survey and 32 percent in the 2003 survey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR308/FR308.pdf|title=Kenya DHS 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of FGM in 2014 varied widely by age, location, ethnic group, and religion. Prevalence of FGM increases with age. It is lowest among women ages 15–19 at 11.4%, and highest among women aged 45–49 at 40.9%. This trend underscores the declining trend in FGM over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

By region, prevalence is highest in the former provinces of North Eastern (97.5%), Nyanza (32.4%), Rift Valley (26.9%), and Eastern (26.4%), and lower in Central (16.5%), Coast (10.2%), Nairobi (8.0%), and Western (0.8%). It is more common in rural areas (25.9%) than urban (13.8%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By ethnic group, FGM is most prevalent among women in the Somali (93.6%), Samburu (86.0%), Kisii (84.4%), and Maasai (77.9%) ethnic groups. By religion, it is more prevalent in Muslim women (51.1%) and women listing no religion (32.9%) and less prevalent in Roman Catholic (21.5%) and Protestant or other Christian women (17.9%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2001 Kenya enacted the Children’s Act, under the provisions of which FGM was criminalized when practiced on girls younger than 18.&lt;ref name="fgmken2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-kenia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Kenya] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was made illegal nationwide in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2011/sep/08/women-africa "FGM: Kenya acts against unkindest cut"], The Guardian, 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; Genital mutilation is a taboo subject in Liberia. It is difficult to get accurate data on FGM prevalence rate. The FGM procedure is mandatory for initiation of women into the secret Liberia and Sierra Leone society called the [[Sande society]], sometimes called Bondo. A 2007 demographic survey asked women if they belonged to Sande society. It was assumed that those who were part of Sande society had undergone FGM. Based on this estimation method, the prevalence of FGM in Liberia has been estimated as 58%.&lt;ref name=fgmlib2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-liberia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Liberia] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol.

===Libya===
Female genital mutilation is rarely practiced in Libya. Likely to be found in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ecoi"/&gt;

===Malawi===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in Malawi mostly in the following districts of Malawi. Southern Malawi: Mulanje, Thyolo, Mangochi and parts of Machinga and Chiradzuro District. In the Northern part of Malawi: Nkhatabay. This custom is common among the Tonga tribe, Yao tribe and Lomwe tribe. It is a custom which has been there for generation. In some villages it is deeply routed compared to others . Every FGM camp has its own degree of how deep they want to conduct the custom but the motive is the same. It is shrouded in silence. Not even the government authorities can trace the roots because the high powers are given to the local authorities of the village and clan.&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt;

===Mali===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Mali]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The WHO gives a prevalence of 85.2% for women aged 15–49 in 2006 in Mali.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; In a 2007 report,&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt; 92% of all Mali women between the ages of 15 and 49 had been subjected to FGM. The rates of FGM are lower only among the Sonrai (28%), the Tamachek (32%) and the Bozo people (76%). Nearly half are Type I, another half Type II.&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/en/dokumente/en-fgm-countries-mali.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Mali] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence varies with religion in Mali; FGM is prevalent in 92% of Muslim women, 76% of Christians.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

About 64% of the women of Mali believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 2002, Mali created a government program aimed at discouraging FGM (''Ordinance No. 02-053 portant creation du programme national de lutte contre la pratique de l’excision'' [Ordinance creating a National Program to Fight the Practice of Female Genital Mutilation]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.k4health.org/sites/default/files/pub_bo_GG_appendA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific legislation criminalizing FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt;

===Mauritania===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to 2001 survey, 71% of all women aged between 15 and 49 had undergone FGM. A 2007 demographic cluster study found no change in FGM prevalence rate in Mauritania.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmmau2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-mauritania-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Mauritania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050515/http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-mauritania-2011.pdf |date=2013-10-03 }} Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Type II FGM is most frequent. About 57% of Mauritania women believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; Mauritania is 99% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by ethnic groups: 92% of Soninke women are cut, about 70% of Fulbe and Moorish women, but only 28% of Wolof women have undergone FGM.&lt;ref name=fgmmau2011/&gt; Mauritania has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol.

===Niger===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; In a 2006 survey, about 2% of Niger women had undergone FGM/C.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 1998, Niger reported a 4.5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glow-boell.de/media/de/txt_rubrik_2/FGM_Statistic_UNICEF_2005.pdf FGM/C - 2005 Statistics] UNICEF, see page 32&lt;/ref&gt; This survey data is potentially incorrect because, adjusted for age group, the women who claimed to have experienced FGM at the previous survey still are, albeit in a different age group. The 2006 survey implies more women had never experienced FGM than previously reported. The DHS surveyors claim the adoption of criminal legislation and fear of prosecution may explain why Niger women did not want to report having ever been circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR193/FR193-NI06.pdf Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples 2006] RÉPUBLIQUE DU NIGER; page 281 (in French, use an internet translator if you are not fluent in French)&lt;/ref&gt;  A WHO report estimates the prevalence rate of FGM in Niger to be 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.who.int/dsa/cat98/fgmbook.htm Female Genital Mutilation: An overview] WHO, Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, including a UNICEF 2009 report, claim FGM rates are high in Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/niger_49292.html Ten villages unite to say 'no’ to female genital mutilation/cutting in Niger] UNICEF (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engenderhealth.org/files/pubs/maternal-health/report/section/niger.pdf NIGER] Nathalie Maulet, UNFPA (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=48483 NIGER: Legal ban on female circumcision widely ignored] IRIN, UN News Service (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A law banning FGM was passed in 2003 by the Niger government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/WCARO_Niger_Factsheet-11.pdf PRIORITIES IN CHILD SURVIVAL, EDUCATION AND PROTECTION - Niger] UNICEF (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation in Nigeria}}
A 2008 demographic survey found 30% of all [[Nigeria]]n women have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-nigeria-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Nigeria] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with 25% reported by a 1999 survey, and 19% by 2003 survey. This suggests no trend, unreliable past or most recent survey data in some regions, as well as the possibility that a number of women are increasingly willing to acknowledge having undergone FGM. Another possible explanation for higher 2008 prevalence rate is the definition of FGM used, which included Type IV FGMs. In some parts of Nigeria, the vagina walls are cut in new born girls or other traditional practices performed - such as the ''angurya'' and ''gishiri'' cuts - which fall under Type IV FGM classification of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011" /&gt; Over 80% of all FGMs are performed on girls under one year of age. The prevalence varies with religion in Nigeria; FGM is prevalent in 31% of Catholics, 27% of Protestant and 7% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name="unicefstat2010" /&gt; FGM was banned throughout the country in 2015.&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;

===Republic of the Congo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in the [[Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; and has been estimated at a 5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt;

===Senegal===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to 2005 survey, FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49.&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-senegal-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Senegal] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences in regional prevalence. FGM is most widespread in the Southern Senegal (94% in Kolda Region) and in Northeastern Senegal (93% in Matam Region). FGM rates are lower in other regions: Tambacounda (86%), Ziguinchor (69%), and less than 5% in Diourbel and Louga Regions. Senegal is 94% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by religion: 29% of Muslim women have undergone FGM, 16% of Animists, and 11% of Christian women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt; 

A law that was passed in January 1999 makes FGM illegal in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/10107.htm "Senegal: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)"], Released by the Office of the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues, US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; President Diouf had appealed for an end to this practice and for legislation outlawing it. The law modifies the Penal Code to make this practice a criminal act, punishable by a sentence of one to five years in prison. A spokesperson for the human rights group RADDHO (The African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights) noted in the local press that "Adopting the law is not the end, as it will still need to be effectively enforced for women to benefit from it. Senegal ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to a 2008 survey, 91% of women in Sierra Leone between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM. The highest rate of prevalence is in the Northern Sierra Leone (97%).&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-sierraleone-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Type II is most common, but Type I is known as well as Type III. In a 2013 report, researchers first conducted verbal surveys followed by clinical examination. They found that the verbal disclosure were not completely reliable, and clinical examination showed greater extent of FGM. These researchers report 68% Type II and 32% Type I in Sierra Leone women.&lt;ref name="b2013"/&gt; 

Like Liberia, Sierra Leone has the traditional secret society of women, called Bondo or [[Sande society]], which uses FGM as part of the initiation rite. 70% of the population is Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% as traditional religions.&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011/&gt; Only Creole Christians of Sierra Leone are known to not practice FGM. There is no federal law against FGM in Sierra Leone; and the ''Soweis'' - those who do FGM excision - wield considerable political power during elections.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Somalia===
According to a 2005 WHO estimate, about 97.9% of [[Somalia]]'s women and girls underwent FGM. This was at the time the world's highest prevalence rate of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=Prevalence of FGM |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 UNICEF report also noted that Somalia had the world's highest rate of Type III FGM, with 79% of all Somali women having undergone the procedure; another 15% underwent Type II FGM.&lt;ref name="prb.org"/&gt; The prevalence rate varies considerably by region and is on the decline in the northern part of the country. In 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the FGM prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign.&lt;ref name="Jpsfgmd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Female genital mutilation down|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/16/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-down.html|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via The Jakarta Post|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Federal Constitution]] adopted in August 2012 also prohibits female circumcision.&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution |url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228121925/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Sudan===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[South Sudan]], but its exact prevalence is unknown. A 2015 UNICEF report claimed 1% of women aged 15–49 had been subjected to FGM, but as of May 2018 there were no recent data confirming this figure. FGM has been reported to be practiced in some Christian and Muslims communities, and has been noted in some refugee camps in [[Upper Nile State]]. South Sudanese law has banned female genital mutilation, but the government has not enacted a clear plan to eradicate the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.28toomany.org/static/media/uploads/Law%20Reports/south_sudan_law_report_v1_(may_2018).pdf |title=South Sudan: the law and FGM |author= |work=28 Too Many 2018 |publisher=Thomas Reuters Foundation |date=May 2018 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
The prevalence of FGM in Sudan is 90%.&lt;ref name="applications.emro.who.int"&gt;http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/High_Level_Exp_Meet_Rep_2013_EN_14808.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Only some [[states of Sudan]] have laws against FGM;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/pdf14/progress-ending-fgm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; currently there is no national law forbidding FGM, although Sudan was the first country to outlaw it in 1946, under the British. Type III was prohibited under the 1925 Penal Code, with less severe forms allowed. Outreach groups have been trying to eradicate the practice for 50 years, working with NGOs, religious groups, the government, the media and medical practitioners. Arrests have been made but no further action seems to have taken place.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; Sudan signed the Maputo Protocol in June, 2008 but no ratification has yet been deposited with the African Union.

===Tanzania===
According to 2015-16 survey in [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; FGM prevalence rate is 10% of all women aged between 15 and 49 and 4.7% for those aged 15–19. In contrast, the 1996 survey reported 17.6, suggesting a drop of 7.6% over 20 years or unwillingness to disclose. Type II FGM was found to be most common. There are significant differences in regional prevalence; FGM is most widespread in Manyara (81%), Dodoma (68%), Arusha (55%), Singida (43%) and Mara (38%) regions.&lt;ref name=fgmtanz2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-tansania-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Tanzania] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice varies with religion, with reported prevalence rates of 20% for Christian and 15% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

Section 169A of the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act of 1998 prohibits FGM in Tanzania. Punishment is imprisonment of from five to fifteen years or a fine not exceeding 300,000 shillings (approximately US$250) or both. Tanzania ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007. As with Kenya, Tanzania 1998 Act protects only girls up to the age of 18 years. The FGM law is being occasionally implemented, with 52 violations have been reported, filed and prosecuted. At least 10 cases were convicted in Tanzania.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Togo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in [[Togo]]. In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence is 1.8% in girls 15-19.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; The WHO puts its prevalence at 5.8% in 2006.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Other sources cite 12%&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and 50%&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; as prevalence. Type II is usually practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On October 30, 1998, the National Assembly unanimously voted to outlaw the practice of FGM. Penalties under the law can include a prison term of two months to ten years and a fine of 100,000 francs to one million francs (approximately US$160 to 1,600). A person who had knowledge that the procedure was going to take place and failed to inform public authorities can be punished with one month to one year imprisonment or a fine of from 20,000 to 500,000 francs (approximately US$32 to 800). Togo ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

==Europe==
In recent years the increase in immigration for individuals from countries which practice [[FGM]], has led to the introduction of FGM in European and North American societies. FGM prevalence rate has been difficult to quantify among immigrants to European countries.&lt;ref name=Leye2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Leye | first1= Els | last2= Powell | first2= Richard A. | last3= Nienhuis | first3= Gerda | last4= Claeys | first4= Patricia | last5= Temmerman | first5= Marleen | title = Health care in Europe for women with genital mutilation | journal = [[Health Care for Women International]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 362–378 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/07399330500511717 | date = March 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07399330500511717 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; A case study which investigated FGM in groups of migrant women from [[Northern Africa]] to European regions like Scandinavia, noted that a majority of these women had FGM before their migration to Europe.&lt;ref name=Elgaali2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elgaali|first1=Mahoud | last2= Strevens | first2= Helena  | last3= Mårdh | first3= Per-Anders |title= Female genital mutilation – an exported medical hazard |journal= [[The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care]] |year=2005|volume=10 | issue =2|pages=93–97 | publisher = [[Informa]] | doi = 10.1080/13625180400020945 |pmid = 16147813}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been established that African communities in European countries continue the practice of FGM on their daughters after migrating to Europe.

===Italy===
After a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrant community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n°7/2006 was passed on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning "Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice"; the Act is also known as the ''Legge Consolo'' ("Consolo Act") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-''Bis'' and 583-''Ter'', punishing any practice of female genital mutilation "not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty can be reduced up to {{frac|2|3}} if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to {{frac|3}} if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
FGM is considered mutilation and is punishable as a criminal offense under Dutch law. There is no specific law against FGM: the act is subsumed under the general offense of inflicting harm (''"mishandeling"'' in Dutch, art. 300–304 Dutch Criminal Code). The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of 12 years. The sentence can be higher if the offender is a family member of the victim. It is also illegal to assist or encourage another person to perform FGM. A Dutch citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in the Netherlands can be punished even if the offense is committed abroad. Doctors have the obligation to report suspected cases of FGM and may break patient confidentiality rules if necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A study on female genital mutilation practiced in [[Dagestan]], made public in 2016 by Legal Initiative for Russia, revealed that FGM is widespread in [[Dagestan]].

=== Iran ===
National data on FGM in Iran are unknown. Various studies have been conducted on prevalence in provinces and counties, suggesting significant regional differences.&lt;ref name="OrchidIran"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orchidproject.org/country/iran/ |title=Iran  |publisher=[[Orchid Project]] |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kameelahmady.com/wp-content/uploads/Kameel%20-%20EN%20Final.pdf |title=A comprehensive research study on female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Iran |author=Kameel Ahmady |publisher=Kameel Ahmady |date=2015 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is known to be prevalent in four provinces: [[West Azerbaijan Province]] (mostly the Kurdish populated southern part), [[Kurdistan Province]] and [[Kermanshah Province]] in the Kurdish-dominated northwest, and [[Hormozgan Province]] and islands near it in the south.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM in Iran is primarily associated with Sunni Muslims following the [[Shafi‘i]] [[madhhab]], especially those living in certain Kurdish-populated rural areas in northwestern Iran, adjacent to the Kurdish-speaking regions in northeastern Iraq where FGM also has a relatively high presence compared to the non-Kurdish areas around it. There is strong disparity even within the Kurdish communities, and the prevalence may differ considerably from one village to the next.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] government, which has implemented a relatively successful anti-FGM campaign, official representatives as well as nationalist individuals or groups tend to deny FGM even exists in Iran.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"/&gt; In the southern province of Hormozgan, FGM is mostly practiced by (Persian) Sunnis, but also a small minority of Shias living near them.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"/&gt;

The issue is rarely discussed in public; the national Shia religious establishment claims it as an exclusively Sunni practice in which it should not get involved, and generally sees no reason to try and end it. It is also rarely the subject of research in academia, with the government neither permitting nor funding any public engagement projects for the affected regions.&lt;ref name="Ahmady15"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Susie Latham reported that FGC had been abandoned around the capital of the south-western province Khuzestan in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17496535.2016.1167227 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=The campaign against Female Genital Cutting: empowering women or reinforcing global inequity? | year=2016 | journal=Ethics and Social Welfare | pages=108–121 | author=Latham Susie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Kameel Ahmady (2005–2015) also revealed the practice had been abandoned in several other parts of Iran, such as among Shia Kurdish women in parts of Kermanshah and [[Ilam Province]].&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"/&gt;

Some studies estimate the Type I and II FGM among Iraqi migrants and other Kurdish minority groups to be variable, ranging from 40% to 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopfgmmideast.org/countries/iran/ |title=» Iran |publisher=Stopfgmmideast.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golnaz Esfandiari (2009-03-10).

The practice is foreign to the rest of the country, experts speculate that this practise was introduced through descendants of tribes that came from neighbouring [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Beer Sheba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Nov/13/The-Jordanian-town-that-still-circumcises-women.ashx#axzz2g5h5CT28 The Jordanian town that still circumcises women] Rana Sabbagh-Gargour, The Star (Lebanon)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml Female circumcision/genital cutting] BBC Guide, United Kingdom (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oman===
The practice is very prevalent in [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="meforum1"&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/1629/is-female-genital-mutilation-an-islamic-problem "Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?"], ''Middle East Quarterly'', accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article by journalist Susan Mubarak describes FGM practice in Oman, and claims the practice is very common in [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]] in the southwest. The author went on to say that a previous article on the topic received both positive feedback for spreading awareness of what some considered a 'horrific tradition', as well as negative feedback from others for 'hanging Dhofar’s dirty washing for the world to see and criticising a practice that they believe is purely Islamic,' commenting that she 'paid little attention to these criticisms because I know the practice is harmful and primitive', and 'our religion neither encourages the practice nor condemns it.'&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"/&gt; 

According to a small survey by human rights activist and statistician Habiba Al Hinai conducted in October 2013 and published in January 2014, 78% of 100 women interviewed living in the capital city of [[Muscat]] had undergone FGM. These women came from all parts of the country, each region showing a very high prevalence, and even though fewer women from Muscat itself had undergone FGM, they were still in the majority. Her findings contradicted the common belief that FGM was only widespread in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/news/new-study-oman-shows-high-prevalence-fgm-all-over-country |title=New study in Oman shows high prevalence of FGM all over the country &amp;#124; Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures |publisher=Wluml.org |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Type I is mostly performed in southern Oman and typically performed within a few weeks of a girl's birth, while Type IV is observed in other parts of northern Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.om/printCon.aspx?Cval=6181 FOCUS ON FGM] Victoria Cuthbert, The Week (Oman), (April 25, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain communities of Indonesia, mass female circumcision (''khitanan massal'') ceremony are organized by local Islamic foundations around Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Some FGM are Type IV done with a pen knife, others are Type I done with scissors. Two Indonesian nationwide studies in 2003 and 2010 found over 80% of the cases sampled involved cutting, typically of newborns through the age of 9. The surveys demonstrated that circumcision among girls and boys is a universal practice in the study sites, in all of which Islam was the primary religion. Across the sites, among all the children aged 15–18, 86-100% of the girls were reported already circumcised. More than 90% of families visited in the studies claimed they wanted the practice to continue.&lt;ref name=ahin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACU138.pdf Female Circumcision in Indonesia] Population Council and USAID, September 2003; see pages 24-27 and full report&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records suggest female circumcision in Indonesia started and became prevalent with the arrival of Islam in the 13th century as part of its drive to convert people to Islam.

'''POB Trust''' was established and registered by Trust Act in July, 2007 as a leading volunteer eye care organization with the sole mission of preventing blindness and preserving sight. 
POB Trust was declared exempted from tax in 2012 by [[Federal Board of Revenue (Pakistan)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pobtrust.org/pobdownloads/category/11-tax-exemption&lt;/ref&gt; 
POB Trust endeavors to develop strategies for prevention and control of blindness and visual impairment. The prime objective of POB Trust is to promote and sustain a global campaign against all forms of avoidable blindness with emphasis on deprived communities. This initiative brings with it a great challenge and an exciting hope for all who work towards this goal. It is also a member of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness for the VISION 2020: The Right to Sight.&lt;ref&gt;http://pobtrust.org/about-pobtrust/core-values-and-strategy&lt;/ref&gt;

POB Trust organizes free eye camps in remote areas of the country. Every camp lasts for 2 to 4 days according to the location. During each free eye camp 1000-3000 patients are screened for cataracts and if diagnosed, they are referred for diagnostic tests including Hepatitis B,C Screening. Tests are performed free of cost in the camp. After passing these test patient goes towards surgery, and about 100-300 patients undergo the surgery in three days. Cataract-surgeries are done with Intra-ocular Lens implantation with small incision &amp; Phaco-emulsification. In the out-patients reading glasses and eye drops are also distributed.

'''Remote Area Medical Volunteer Corps''' (RAM) is a non-profit provider of mobile medical clinics delivering free dental, vision, and medical care (as well as veterinary services when available) to under-served and uninsured individuals.

== History ==
RAM was founded in 1985 by Englishman [[Stan Brock (philanthropist)|Stan Brock]], who worked as an assistant to [[Marlin Perkins]] on ''[[Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0110633/ IMDB entry for Stan Brock]&lt;/ref&gt; RAM's work was originally confined to Third World countries, but it later shifted towards the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pelley |first= Scott |authorlink= Scott Pelley |date=  February 28, 2008 |title= US Health Care gets boost from charity |journal= [[60 Minutes]] |volume= |series= |issue= |page= 4 |publisher= [[CBS News]] |id= |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/28/60minutes/main3889496.shtml |accessdate= 2009-08-22 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today RAM works domestic operations around the United States and internationally when need arises.

The clinic in [[Wise, Virginia]] was recently recognized as the nation's largest pop-up free clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/us/healthcare-uninsured-rural-poor-affordable-care-act-republicans.html|title=When Health Law Isn’t Enough, the Desperate Line Up at Tents|last=Gabriel|first=Trip|date=2017-07-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 clinic in Wise hosted over 1,000 volunteers and served 2,300 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/remote-area-medical-health-care-republican.html|title=No Insurance, but for 3 Days, Health Care Is Within Reach|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas|date=2017-07-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAM completed its 900th clinic in Knoxville Tennessee in 2018.

RAM were featured on an episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on CBS.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Headquarters ==
On March 31, 2014, Remote Area Medical's headquarters moved from an old school building in Knox County to the previous [[Henniges Automotive]] facility in Blount County. The previous school building was utilized by RAM for 19 years and was rented by the organization for $1 a year from Knox County.

== Funding ==
RAM is funded through donations and relies on volunteers from the community, as well as professionals including physicians, dentists, optometrists, nurses, pilots and veterinarians to provide care in poorer communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/apr/04/remote-area-medical-can-be-lifeline/?local Remote Area Medical can be a lifeline], Chattanooga Times Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mobile medical unit aids uninsured, [[The Washington Times]], July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal services ==
Remote Area Medical's Veterinary Program provides animal health services to those who live in underserved, impoverished, and isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ramusa.org/about/ "What We Do" Veterinary|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=2015-02-17|work=Remote Area Medical|access-date=2017-08-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disaster relief ==
Remote Area Medical's Disaster Relief arm responds to disasters by land, sea, and air, delivering medical relief and other humanitarian aid when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ramusa.org/disaster-relief/|title=Disaster Relief|date=2015-04-28|work=Remote Area Medical|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
In 2017 Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, filed a bill that would provide $1 million to any state that allows licensed medical professionals to travel from other states and offer their services to those in need. The money would be a one-time allocation with the intent to help states pay any costs associated with allowing outside doctors to volunteer within their borders. The legislation, called the Healthier Act, specifies that out-of-state medical personnel could work only at weekend clinics. That would prevent them from moving into a state and setting up a permanent or semi-permanent practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/06/23/jimmy-duncan-charities-bill/423253001/|title=Knoxville group spawns push in Congress to ease rules on charitable health care providers|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul''' were founded on May 11, 1849, when the four founding Sisters of Charity arrived in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], from [[New York City]]; this has been designated a [[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=12033|title=Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, Halifax National Historic Event|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The story of the Canadian foundation begins when four American ladies, black-robed, black-capped, landed in Halifax from the Cunard liner "Cambria" on May 11, 1849. They came from New York City, these first Sisters of Charity, in response to a standing request by Bishop [[William Walsh (archbishop)|William Walsh]] of Halifax to his friend Archbishop [[John Hughes (archbishop of New York)|John Hughes]] of New York for Sisters to work in his diocese in the care of orphans and in education. Halifax had a population of 20,000 when the four "American ladies" arrived. The Bishop gave them a house on [[Barrington Street]], near the cathedral, where they took in a little orphan girl on the very first day. They immediately opened a school to teach Catholic children, many of them Irish immigrants, victims of the potato famine. By the end of the school year (July) their classes held 400 children. By that time the Sisters were also caring for twenty little girls in their own house.&lt;ref name="ogallagher"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1980/O'Gallagher.html|title=Marianna O'Gallagher, "The Sisters of Charity of Halifax - The Early and Middle Years"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They would be the first religious community in this maritime city. Mother Basilia McCann, leader of the original four Sisters who arrived here in 1849, became the first Superior of the Halifax Congregation. Mother Basilia was a pupil of [[Elizabeth Ann Seton|Elizabeth Seton]], founder of the first Sisters of Charity in 1809. She served as Superior for three years, then returned to the New York community. The second Superior to serve in Halifax was Sister Mary Rose McAleer, also one of the original group to come to Halifax in 1849.&lt;ref name=antigonish/&gt;

Shortly after their arrival the Sisters opened their first school, housed at St. Mary's Convent in the heart of the city. Halifax was still a growing city, and with no hospital yet established, the need for assistance spanned beyond education. The Sisters responded to this need. Within a short time they were also caring for the sick.&lt;ref name=antigonish&gt;[http://www.antigonishdiocese.com/charities.html "Sisters of Charity - Halifax", Archdiocese of Antigonish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330011223/http://www.antigonishdiocese.com/charities.html |date=2013-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1856, the order in Halifax was accepted as a separate congregation by [[Pope Pius IX]] and took on their new official name, the "Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Halifax."&lt;ref name=antigonish/&gt; Sister Mary Rose McAleer and two novices began teaching girls in St. Patrick's Parish in the North end of the city. At first they travelled daily to teach in the church basement. A house was soon rented for them, and thus began St. Patrick's Convent – and High School and Elementary School. St. Patrick's was the first of more than a hundred missions that would eventually be opened by the Sisters of Charity. When St Patrick’s moved to larger quarters in 1888, the former convent was converted into a refuge for unmarried mothers and their babies, named the Home of the Guardian Angel.&lt;ref name="dcb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=6146|title=Biography – HARRINGTON, JOANNA, Sister Mary Benedicta – Volume XII (1891-1900) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866 victims of cholera were landed from an immigrant ship on McNab's Island in the harbour and when the Archbishop asked for helpers, all the Sisters volunteered. He chose three. That summer the increase in the number of orphans led to expansion of facilities. By September 1873, the Sisters moved into the newly built Motherhouse named Mount Saint Vincent.just outside Halifax. 

Sisters from the order first came to Boston, Massachusetts, in August 1887, called to staff a new school for girls at St. Patrick’s Parish in Roxbury.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/11/19/sisters-charity-celebrate-years-archdiocese-boston/UmczR2JC6MlD7VjluaRA2N/story.html|title=Sisters of Charity celebrate 125 years in Archdiocese of Boston - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1880, Leo XIII issued a document removing from the Archbishop of Halifax "any jurisdiction" he had held over the Sisters of Charity, and placing the Congregation under the Pope's immediate control.&lt;ref name=ogallagher/&gt;

The order founded Canada's best known women's university, now co-educational, [[Mount Saint Vincent University]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Mount Saint Vincent received its own college charter in 1925.&lt;ref name=ogallagher/&gt; A long tradition ended in 2006 when Sister Sheilagh Martin, a chemistry professor, retired as the last member of the congregation to teach there.

The charism of the Sisters of Charity of Halifax is rooted in the tradition of Saints [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]], [[Vincent de Paul]], and Louise de Marillac.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.schalifax.ca/our-mission-2/# |title="Our Mission", Sisters of Charity - Halifax |access-date=2013-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213004533/http://www.schalifax.ca/our-mission-2/# |archive-date=2015-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
The areas of education, health care, pastoral ministry, and social services are still paramount, though the ways in which the sisters work within a given field has changed. While the congregation once operated hospitals, schools, senior citizen homes, and the only women's university in Canada, sisters now serve in a variety of areas in Canada and throughout the eastern [[United States]], in [[Bermuda]], [[Peru]], and the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rcav.org/srs-of-charity-of-st-vincent-de-paul-halifax-sch/|title=Sisters of Charity of St Vincent De Paul-Halifax (S.C.H.) - Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver|website=rcav.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, at the beatification of [[Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]], there were approximately 1700 sisters in the organization and 97 missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/stories/sisters_of_charity.htm|title=A Short History of the Sisters of Charity|website=www.emmitsburg.net|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, there are approximately 500 sisters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schalifax.ca/sub/01about/01who.html About the Sisters of Charity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315053708/http://www.schalifax.ca/sub/01about/01who.html |date=March 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the [[religious institute]] is located in Halifax's [[Rockingham, Nova Scotia|Rockingham]] neighbourhood at the Sisters of Charity Centre. The original Motherhouse building, which also incorporated Mount Saint Vincent Academy and College (the precursors to the current University) was built around the time of the Academy's founding in 1873 and destroyed by fire in 1951. Rebuilt separately in the early 1950s, it housed retired sisters of the order as well as visiting religious and laypeople. It also housed for Mount Saint Vincent University a student residence called Vincent Hall until the residence was closed by the University in 1992. The building, once the largest in all of Atlantic Canada, was demolished in 2008. In 2011 the property was sold to developer Southwest Propoerties, Ltd. The first phase of the development includes residential and retail components. The development is to be known as Seton Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1228693-pete-s-to-anchor-rockingham-development-on-former-motherhouse-site|title=Pete’s to anchor Rockingham development on former Motherhouse site|date=2014-08-11|work=The Chronicle Herald|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order is part of the [[Sisters of Charity Federation]]. Two growing interests for the order are ecological projects and helping victims of human trafficking, issues they are working on with the Leadership Conference of Women Religious.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

'''Subacromial bursitis''' is a condition caused by [[inflammation]] of the [[Synovial bursa|bursa]] that separates the superior surface of the [[supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus]] tendon (one of the four tendons of the [[rotator cuff]]) from the overlying [[coraco-acromial ligament]], acromion, and coracoid (the acromial arch) and from the deep surface of the [[deltoid muscle]].&lt;ref name=Salzman97/&gt; The [[subacromial bursa]] helps the motion of the supraspinatus tendon of the rotator cuff in activities such as overhead work.

Musculoskeletal complaints are one of the most common reasons for primary care office visits, and rotator cuff disorders are the most common source of shoulder pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arcuni SE |title=Rotator cuff pathology and subacromial impingement |journal=Nurse Pract |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=58, 61, 65–6 passim |year=2000 |pmid=10826138 |doi= 10.1097/00006205-200025050-00005|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary inflammation of the subacromial bursa is relatively rare and may arise from autoimmune inflammatory conditions  such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]; crystal deposition disorders such as [[gout]] or [[pseudogout]]; calcific loose bodies, and infection.&lt;ref name=Salzman97&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salzman KL, Lillegard WA, Butcher JD |title=Upper extremity bursitis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1797–806, 1811–2 |year=1997 |pmid=9371010 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, subacromial [[bursitis]] arises as a result of complex factors, thought to cause shoulder [[Impingement syndrome|impingement]] symptoms. These factors are broadly classified as intrinsic (intratendinous) or extrinsic (extratendinous). They are further divided into primary or secondary causes of impingement. Secondary causes are thought to be part of another process such as shoulder instability or nerve injury.&lt;ref name=Bigliani97&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bigliani LU, Levine WN |title=Subacromial impingement syndrome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=1854–68 |year=1997 |pmid=9409800 |doi= |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9409800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Neer described three stages of impingement syndrome.&lt;ref name=Neer1983&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neer CS |title=Impingement lesions |journal=Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. |volume= |issue=173 |pages=70–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6825348 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0009-921X&amp;volume=173&amp;spage=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that "the symptoms and physical signs in all three stages of impingement are almost identical, including the 'impingement sign'..., arc of pain, crepitus, and varying weakness". The Neer classification did not distinguish between partial-thickness and full-thickness rotator cuff tears in stage III.&lt;ref name=Neer1983/&gt; This has led to some controversy about the ability of physical examination tests to accurately diagnose between bursitis, impingement, impingement with or without rotator cuff tear and impingement with partial versus complete tears.

In 2005, Park et al. published their findings which concluded that a combination of clinical tests were more useful than a single physical examination test. For the diagnosis of impingement disease, the best combination of tests were "any degree (of) a positive [[Hawkins–Kennedy test]], a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side", to diagnose a full thickness [[rotator cuff tear]], the best combination of tests, when all three are positive, were the painful arc, the drop-arm sign, and weakness in external rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park HB, Yokota A, Gill HS, El Rassi G, McFarland EG |title=Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for the different degrees of subacromial impingement syndrome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=1446–55 |year=2005 |pmid=15995110 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.D.02335 |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15995110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms ==
Subacromial bursitis often presents with a constellation of symptoms called [[impingement syndrome]]. Pain along the front and side of the shoulder is the most common symptom and may cause weakness and stiffness.&lt;ref name=Bigliani97/&gt; If the pain resolves and weakness persists other causes should be evaluated such as a tear of the rotator cuff or a neurological problem arising from the neck or entrapment of the suprascapular nerve. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual and may or may not be related to trauma. Night time pain, especially sleeping on the affected shoulder, is often reported. Localized redness or swelling are less common and suggest an infected subacromial bursa. Individuals affected by subacromial bursitis commonly present with concomitant shoulder problems such as [[arthritis]], rotator cuff [[tendinitis]], [[rotator cuff tear]]s, and [[cervical radiculopathy]] (pinched nerve in neck).

Impingement may be brought on by sports activities, such as overhead throwing sports and swimming, or overhead work such as painting, carpentry, or plumbing. Activities that involve repetitive overhead activity, or directly in front, may cause shoulder pain. Direct upward pressure on the shoulder, such as leaning on an elbow, may increase pain.

==Pathophysiology==
The literature on the pathophysiology of bursitis describes inflammation as the primary cause of symptoms. Inflammatory bursitis is usually the result of repetitive injury to the bursa. In the subacromial bursa, this generally occurs due to microtrauma to adjacent structures, particularly the supraspinatus tendon. The inflammatory process causes synovial cells to multiply, increasing collagen formation and fluid production within the bursa and reduction in the outside layer of lubrication.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii et al., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Less frequently observed causes of subacromial bursitis include hemorrhagic conditions, crystal deposition and infection.

Many causes have been proposed in the medical literature for subacromial impingement syndrome. The bursa facilitates the motion of the rotator cuff beneath the arch, any disturbance of the relationship of the subacromial structures can lead to impingement. These factors can be broadly classified as intrinsic such as tendon degeneration, rotator cuff muscle weakness and overuse. Extrinsic factors include bone spurs from the [[acromion]] or [[AC joint]], shoulder instability and neurologic problems arising outside of the shoulder.&lt;ref name=Bigliani97/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
It is often difficult to distinguish between pain caused by bursitis or that caused by a rotator cuff injury as both exhibit similar pain patterns in the front or side of the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Subacromial bursitis can be painful with resisted abduction due to the pinching of the bursa as the deltoid contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Buschbacher &amp; Braddom, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; If the therapist performs a treatment direction test and gently applies joint traction or a caudal glide during abduction (MWM), the painful arc may reduce if the problem is bursitis or adhesive capsulitis (as this potentially increases the subacromial space).

The following clinical tests, if positive, may indicate bursitis: 
*The patient actively abducts the arm and a painful arc occurs between 80° and 120°. This is due to the compression of the supraspinatus tendon or subacromial bursa between the anterior acromial arch and humeral head. When lowering from full abduction there is often a painful "catch" at midrange. If the patient can achieve adequate muscle relaxation, passive motion tends to be less painful.&lt;ref&gt;Starr &amp; Harbhajan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The patient performs an isometric flexion contraction against resistance of the therapist (Speed’s Test). When the therapist’s resistance is removed, a sudden jerking motion results and latent pain indicates a positive test for bursitis.&lt;ref&gt;Buschbacher &amp; Braddom, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Neer’s Sign: If pain occurs during forward elevation of the internally rotated arm above 90°. This will identify impingement of the rotator cuff but is also sensitive for subacromial bursitis.&lt;ref&gt;Starr &amp; Harbhajan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irritation or entrapment of the [[lower subscapular nerve]], which innervates the [[subscapularis]] and [[teres major]] muscles, will produce muscle guarding at the shoulder that will restrict motion into external rotation, abduction, or flexion. The aforementioned tests will assist in diagnosing bursitis over other conditions. The diagnosis of impingement syndrome should be viewed with caution  in people who are less than forty years old, because such individuals may have subtle glenohumeral instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jobe FW, Kvitne RS, Giangarra CE |title=Shoulder pain in the overhand or throwing athlete. The relationship of anterior instability and rotator cuff impingement |journal=Orthop Rev |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=963–75 |year=1989 |pmid=2797861 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging===
X-rays may help visualize [[bone spur]]s, acromial anatomy and arthritis. Further, [[calcification]] in the subacromial space and rotator cuff may be revealed. [[Osteoarthritis]] of the [[acromioclavicular]] (AC) joint may co-exist and is usually demonstrated on radiographs.

MRI imagining can reveal fluid accumulation in the bursa and assess adjacent structures. In chronic cases caused by impingement tendinosis and tears in the rotator cuff may be revealed. At [[Medical ultrasonography|US]], an abnormal bursa may show
# fluid distension, 
# synovial proliferation, and/or 
# thickening of the bursal walls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free chapter on ultrasound findings of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis at [http://www.shoulderus.com/ultrasound-of-the-shoulder/ultrasound-subacromial-subdeltoid-bursa/ ShoulderUS.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In any case, the magnitude of pathological findings does not correlate with the magnitude of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Special considerations===
In patients with bursitis who have [[rheumatoid arthritis]], short term improvements are not taken as a sign of resolution and may require long term treatment to ensure recurrence is minimized. Joint contracture of the shoulder has also been found to be at a higher incidence in type two diabetics, which may lead to frozen shoulder (Donatelli, 2004).

==Treatment==
Many non-operative treatments have been advocated, including rest; oral administration of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s; [[physical therapy]]; [[chiropractic]]; and local modalities such as [[cryotherapy]], [[ultrasound]], electromagnetic radiation, and subacromial injection of [[corticosteroid]]s.&lt;ref name=Blair96&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blair B, Rokito AS, Cuomo F, Jarolem K, Zuckerman JD |title=Efficacy of injections of corticosteroids for subacromial impingement syndrome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=78 |issue=11 |pages=1685–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8934482 |doi= |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8934482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoulder bursitis rarely requires surgical intervention and generally responds favorably to conservative treatment. Surgery is reserved for patients who fail to respond to non-operative measures. Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as arthroscopic removal of the bursa allows for direct inspection of the shoulder structures and provides the opportunity for removal of bone spurs and repair of any [[rotator cuff tear]]s that may be found.

==Prognosis==
In 1997 Morrison et al.&lt;ref name=Morrison1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morrison DS, Frogameni AD, Woodworth P |title=Non-operative treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=732–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9160946 |doi= |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9160946}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a study that reviewed the cases of 616 patients (636 shoulders) with impingement syndrome (painful arc of motion) to assess the outcome of non-surgical care. An attempt was made to exclude patients who were suspected of having additional shoulder conditions such as, full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, degenerative arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint, instability of the glenohumeral joint, or adhesive capsulitis. All patients were managed with anti-inflammatory medication and a specific, supervised physical-therapy regimen. The patients were followed up from six months to over six years. They found that 67% (413 patients) of the patients improved, while 28% did not improve and went to surgical treatment. 5% did not improve and declined further treatment.

Of the 413 patients who improved, 74 had a recurrence of symptoms during the observation period and their symptoms responded to rest or after resumption of the exercise program.

The Morrison study shows that the outcome of impingement symptoms varies with patient characteristics. Younger patients (20 years or less) and patients between 41 and 60 years of age, fared better than those who were in the 21 to 40 years age group. This may be related to the peak incidence of work, job requirements, sports and hobby related activities, that may place greater demands on the shoulder. However, patients who were older than sixty years of age had the "poorest results". It is known that the rotator cuff and adjacent structures undergo degenerative changes with ageing.

The authors were unable to posit an explanation for the observation of the bimodal distribution of satisfactory results with regard to age. They concluded that it was "unclear why (those) who were twenty-one to forty years old had less satisfactory results". The poorer outcome for patients over 60 years old was thought to be potentially related to "undiagnosed full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff".&lt;ref name=Morrison1997/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="416">A '''vaccine bath''' is an apparatus used in [[vaccine]] production. As vaccines are very heat labile but inevitably need to be heated to some extent, these devices are used. These are basically [[Heated bath|water baths]], with a temperature set very low. A long time is taken to sterilize vaccines by this method.

Bacterial vaccine are sterilized at 60°C for an hour.
