In 928 Abu'l-Musafir was invested with the government of Azerbaijan by the caliph after Abu'l-Musafir's uncle [[Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] was killed. After only one and a half years of rule, however, he was poisoned in [[Ardabil]] by one of his slaves. The Sajid dynasty came to an end with his death; he was succeeded as governor by [[Wasif al-Shirvani]].

'''Albert Cocksedge''' (30 January 1884 – 25 January 1928), known in the early years of his career as '''Young Cocksedge''', was a British [[Boxing|boxer]] of the early [[20th century]], who held English titles at various weights, and fought for a world title, in the era before weights were standardised, fighting at weights between 98 and 112lbs.

==Career==
Born in [[Leicester]] in 1884, Cocksedge won his first title in 1901, knocking out [[Young Tiddler]] in December that year to win the English 7-stone title. In October 1904 he fought a draw against [[Frank Morcombe]] for the latter's English 106lbs title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing: Cosmopolitan Sporting Club: Frank Morcambe Draws With Albert Cocksedge |work=Sporting Life|date=28 October 1904 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/19041028/091/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning a rematch the following month to take the title. In December he was beaten by the Australian [[Tibby Watson]], who would win the 108lbs world title the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watson Defeats Cocksedge |work=The Sportsman|date=16 December 1904 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001055/19041216/074/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1905 he lost in a fight for the 7st 8lbs championship belt of the world to [[Johnny Hughes (boxer)|Johnny Hughes]], a man who had also beaten him eight months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Albert Cocksedge |work=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=26 January 1905 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000337/19050126/098/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Assault at Arms at the Corn Exchange |work=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=28 January 1905 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000337/19050128/088/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnny Hughes Whips Albert Cocksedge |work=The Sportsman|date=3 May 1904 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001055/19040503/089/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1906 he beat [[Charlie Dew]] on points to take the English 104lbs title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Albert Cocksedge Beats Charlie Dew |work=Sporting Life|date=23 October 1906 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/19061023/076/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; successfully defending against Dew two months later but losing it to Bert Chatterton in February 1907. He regained it in June that year, stopping Chatterton in the fourth round. In October 1907 he beat [[Charlie Exall]] for the 106lbs title, and in February 1908 beat [[Harry McDermott]] on points for the 108lbs title. In April 1908 he fought a draw with [[Sid Smith (boxer)|Sid Smith]] before successfully defending his 106lbs title two months later against Harry Badger. On 7 December 1908 he beat [[Jack Guyon]] on points at the [[National Sporting Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing: National Sporting Club: Albert Cocksedge and Jack Guyon Put Up a Fine Bout |work=Sporting Life|date=8 December 1908 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/19081208/066/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1909 he beat Smith and Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contests at Leicester: Albert Cocksedge Beat Tibby Watson |work=Sporting Life|date=21 January 1909 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/19090121/080/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; before losing his 108lbs title to Smith in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing: The Small Brigade |work=Illustrated Police News|date=13 February 1909 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000072/19090213/070/0010| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought Smith again in March, also ending as loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sid Smith Beat Albert Cocksedge |work=Sporting Life|date=25 March 1909 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/19090325/094/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1909 he fought a draw against [[Sam Kellar]] for the English 112lbs title. The two met again in October, with referee Tom Gamble stopping the fight in the fourth round, deciding neither man was trying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing Contests at the Theatre Royal |work=The Northern Whig|date=14 October 1909 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000434/19091014/194/0011| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1910 he beat McDermott on points over 20 rounds to take the English 110lbs title, losing it two months later to [[Bill Kyne]]. In October 1911 he challenged [[Bill Ladbury]] for the 112lbs title, Ladbury stopping him in the seventh round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing: Albert Cocksedge v.

Cocksedge continued to fight regularly until around 1914, and continued in both competitive and exhibition bouts, having possibly his final competitive fight in 1922 (beating Billy Shephard), and an exhibition against [[Jimmy Wilde]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxing |work=Sheffield Daily Telegraph|date=21 February 1922 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000250/19220221/196/0007| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Boxers's Fate at Leicester |work=Nottingham Journal|date=27 January 1928 |accessdate=25 December 2017 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001898/19280127/115/0005| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years he was resident at 1, Paradise Lane in Leicester, and worked as a shoe scourer.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt;

Cocksedge was walking to a [[whist drive]] in Leicester on 25 January 1928, when he was knocked down and killed by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] car.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt; He was 43.

'''Apocalypse''' ('''En Sabah Nur''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is one of the world's first [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], and was originally a principal villain for the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team and now for the [[X-Men]] and related spinoff teams. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]], Apocalypse first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #5 (May 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=50581 |title=Walt Simonson Remasters "Star Slammers," Talks "X-Men: Apocalypse" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his introduction, the character has appeared in a number of ''[[X-Men]]'' titles, including [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s and several [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. Apocalypse has also been featured in various forms of [[Apocalypse in other media|media]]. In 2016, [[Oscar Isaac]] portrayed the villain in the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.&lt;ref name="OscarIsaac"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-isaac-x-men-apocalypse-casting-1201342774/ | title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Oscar Isaac Nabs Villain Role | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=November 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Apocalypse was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 24th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/24 Top 100 Comic Book Villains] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 19-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and creation==
While writing the first five issues of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', [[Bob Layton]] dropped hints of a villain operating behind the scenes and leading the [[Alliance of Evil]] (mentioned in ''X-Factor'' #4, May 1986). Layton intended to reveal this character to be the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] villain the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] on the final page of ''X-Factor'' #5.&lt;ref name="back29"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Timothy |title=Nightcrawler's Two Dads and the Owl that Could Have Been|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|pages=58–61 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Layton left the book after writing this issue and was replaced by writer [[Louise Simonson]]. Editor [[Bob Harras]] said that the character arose because of storytelling needs: "All I had communicated to Louise was my desire that an A-level, first class character be introduced. I wanted a [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]-level villain who would up the stakes and give the X-Factor team reason to exist."&lt;ref name=CBR2009/&gt;

In a 2011 interview with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', explained that when the ''X-Factor'' series was created, the original five X-Men were pulled out of the purview of [[Chris Claremont]], who was writing ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]''. However, Simonson felt that the series need an archenemy, or what Simonson called "a big, bad villain", and conceived of Apocalypse.&lt;ref name=PhillyEnquirer&gt;Maida, Jerome (May 27, 2016). [http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20160527_Louise_Simonson_discusses_the_creation_of_Apocalypse.html "Louise Simonson discusses the creation of Apocalypse"]. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Simonson described the character thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "When ''X-Factor'' was created, it caused a split in the "Mutant World" [and] several seminal characters were pulled out of [writer] [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''X-Men''."

"Apocalypse is the first mutant – a brilliant shape-shifter who is virtually immortal – and sees himself as the father of mutantkind…In his early years, which I covered in the ''X-Factor Forever'' miniseries . . . Apocalypse encountered the Celestials and realized there was a time when humanity might be judged unworthy and destroyed. Consequently, he's been using Darwinian principles - survival of the fittest - to kill off the weak and force the survivors to grow stronger, to push humanity to get better and more powerful. He considers himself the Apocalypse of modern man and the father of what humanity will come next - Mutantkind. Where Magneto sees mutants as the next step of evolution and strives to protect all mutants, Apocalypse believes in absolute survival of the fittest - so if the Hulk, for example, is stronger than [the X-Men's] Colossus...well, in Apocalypse's world he would say, 'Bye, bye, comrade.'"&lt;ref name=PhillyEnquirer/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harras also commented, "As soon as I saw the sketch by Walter [Simonson] and heard Louise's take on him, I knew we had the character I wanted. [[Jackson Guice|Jackson [Guice]]] redrew the page, patching in the [[unseen character|shadowy]] Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's."&lt;ref name=CBR2009&gt;Callahan, Timothy (September 28, 2009). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=23092 "When Words Collide"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt; Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe there was even a character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern."&lt;ref name=CBR2009/&gt; Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5.&lt;ref name="back29"/&gt; Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels at the end of one of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit."&lt;ref&gt;Papadimitropoulos, Thomas (March 6, 2012). [http://www.comicdom.gr/2012/03/06/interview-corner-83-walt-simonson/ "INTERVIEW CORNER #83: Walt Simonson"]. Comicdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Harras said on the character of Apocalypse:

{{quote|He looked fantastic. Also, the name is dynamic. It tells you right off this character means trouble. And he came with a clear-cut agenda: '[[survival of the fittest]].' He didn't care if you were a mutant—if you were weak, you would be destroyed. He was merciless, but his philosophy was easy to grasp and it fit in with the harder edge of evolution which is part and parcel of the mutant story. Isn't that what humans fear about mutants? That they are the next step? Now, we had given mutants something new to fear: a character who would judge them on their genetic worthiness. [...] To his own mind he wasn't evil (despite his leadership of the Alliance of Evil, which I think we dropped pretty soon after Apocalypse's introduction); he believed he was doing the right thing. He was ensuring evolution. To me, he was the perfect next step in the mutant story.&lt;ref name=CBR2009/&gt;}}

Although the character first appeared in 1986, he was retroactively said to have been present during previously published stories. The unnamed benefactor of the [[Living Monolith]] in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #17 (1985) was later identified as Apocalypse in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #376 (January 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Classic X-Men'' #25 revealed that years earlier, Apocalypse encountered the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]] and granted him superhuman power.

During his run on ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]] planned a story to reveal that Apocalypse was the third Summers brother, a mysterious sibling to the mutants Cyclops and Havok. But Weinberg left the book before he could go along with his plan and the third Summers brother was revealed to be the mutant Gabriel Summers, aka [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QchZYEKr?url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/archive/index.php/t-24515.html |archivedate=2007-07-26 |work=Comixfan Forums &gt; Comixfan Discussions &gt; Comixfan Columns |title=No Prisoners #3: The Third Summers Brother |publisher=''Comixfan.com'' |date=December 22, 2003 |accessdate=2014-05-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalypse was the principal adversary in the mid-1980s ''[[X-Men]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (1986–1991), until being apparently killed at the climax of issue #68 (July 1991). Since then, the character has died and been resurrected several times thanks to his power and advanced alien technology. His name En Sabah Nur was revealed in Cable #6 (Dec 1993) and his [[birthplace]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) and the origin of his technology, were revealed in ''[[X-Force]]'' #37 (August 1994). According to Marvel, the name translates as "The First One" (although, in reality, the translation is considered grammatically incorrect, as it means "The First/Morning Light" [En-("The") + Sabah- ("Morning") + Nur- ("Light")] ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Apocalypse_%28En_Sabah_Nur%29 |title=Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) - Marvel Universe Wiki: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed in the origin story ''[[Rise of Apocalypse]]'' that he is possibly the first mutant (meaning, in this case, a human being born with the X-gene), born 5,000 years ago. The character gained greater popularity in 1995 when the storyline "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" featured an [[alternate timeline]] in which Apocalypse has conquered much of planet Earth.
 
The character was reincarnated in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #1 as a small boy with no memory of his previous incarnation. The boy was named Evan Sabahnur.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #1. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the adult, villainous version of Apocalypse returned in the series ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19309/uncanny_avengers_liveblog |title=Uncanny Avengers Liveblog &amp;#124; Avengers &amp;#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His origins are further explored in the storyline "[[All-New X-Men#Apocalypse Wars|Apocalypse Wars]]".

==Fictional character biography==
===''Rise of Apocalypse''===
[[Image:Ensabnur.jpg|185px|left|thumb|En Sabah Nur as featured on the cover of ''Rise of Apocalypse'' #1, by [[Adam Pollina]]]]
The being who would later be called Apocalypse was born thousands of years ago in [[Aqaba]]. He was born with the mutant X-gene, and possibly the first living being on Earth to express it. Because of his gray skin and blue lips, his people abandoned him as an infant. He was rescued by [[Baal (comics)|Baal]] of the Sandstormers who saw the child's potential power and will to survive. Baal named him En Sabah Nur, which Marvel translates as "The First One". The Sandstormers lived by the credo of [[survival of the fittest]], believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life.&lt;ref&gt;Rise of Apocalypse #1&lt;/ref&gt; It is also revealed during the Apocalypse Wars that, while still a young boy, En Sabah Nur was very generous and selfless, to the chagrin of Baal. A time-displaced Evan Sabah Nur and All-New X-Men Beast tried to save En Sabah Nur, but he allowed himself to be captured to help them escape.&lt;ref&gt;All New X-Men Vol. 2 Issue #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, the time-traveller [[Kang the Conqueror]] arrived in Egypt and assumed the identity of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]] and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, left behind by the deity-like aliens known as [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself [[Apocalypse]]. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.&lt;ref&gt;''Rise of Apocalypse'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

It is revealed in the series ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' that Apocalypse at some point in the days of Ancient Egypt joined forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield to successfully fend off a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] invasion. Also present were [[Imhotep]] and a man who was either the moon god called [[Khonsu|Khonshu]] or his first [[Moon Knight]] avatar/champion.&lt;ref&gt;''S.H.I.E.L.D'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
As the millennia pass, Apocalypse travels around planet Earth, convincing civilizations that he is a [[deity]] (inspiring different myths as a result) and manipulating them into fighting wars. He justifies that this encourages "growth, judgment, and destruction".&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #24&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse's progeny become the [[Clan Akkaba]]. Apocalypse encounters the near-immortal human offshoot race known as [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], primarily the members [[Ikaris]] and [[Sersi]], who refer to him as their "Ancient Nemesis".&lt;ref&gt;''New Eternals: Apocalypse Now!''&lt;/ref&gt;  At different points, Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to enter periods of [[suspended animation]], leaving Clan Akkaba and Ozymandias to act in his stead.

In 1013 AD, Apocalypse seeks to destroy the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who he knows will cause him trouble in the future, according to information obtained from Rama-Tut,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #6 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; yet the plans are foiled by Odin. In the 12th century, Apocalypse encounters the Eternal Sersi again while awakening latent mutant powers in a crusader named Bennet du Paris, also known as [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Black Knight: Exodus''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1459, Apocalypse defeats [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler)]] in Romania, who later becomes the vampire more popularly known as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Count Dracula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse vs Dracula'' #1 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Apocalypse encounters British scientist Nathaniel Essex and learns more about the nature of mutants. Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to transform Essex into the superhuman being [[Mister Sinister]]. He then coerces Sinister and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] into aiding his plans for global conquest, but Sinister concludes that these plans are madness and betrays Apocalypse, forcing him back into hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, Count Dracula attacks the Clan Akkaba in revenge for his defeat at Apocalypse's hands, forcing the Clan to revive their master from suspended animation. Apocalypse defeats the vampire again, this time with help from [[Abraham Van Helsing]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Apocalypse enters hibernation again, expecting to remain so for possibly two centuries, by which point mutants should be more common on Earth.

===Modern era===
[[Image:Archangeapoc.png|thumb|right|185px|Apocalypse with Warren Worthington III a.k.a. Archangel as the Horseman of Death in ''X-Factor'' #24 (January 1988). Art by [[Walter Simonson]] and [[Bob Wiacek]].]]
After many years of suspended animation, Apocalypse awakens nearly a century earlier than planned due to the arrival of the time-traveling mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (ironically, Cable had traveled to this point in time hoping to prevent the ancient mutant from awakening).&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' vol. 1, #1 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse decides the Earth is ready for further examination and testing. He grants superhuman powers to the terrorist known as [[Moses Magnum]],&lt;ref&gt;''Classic X-Men'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; who then tests the X-Men and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Apocalypse later briefly employs the [[Alliance of Evil]] to capture the mutant Michael Nowlan, who can boost the power of other mutants. This plan brings Apocalypse into direct conflict with the first incarnation of X-Factor, when the team comprised the original X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalypse then recruits mutants to serve as his personal guard, known as the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. Among them is Angel, AKA [[Warren Worthington III]], whom Apocalypse has corrupted and turned into a cyborg called Death.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; Warren Worthington regains his identity and helps his friends defeat Apocalypse, adopting the new codename Archangel. Apocalypse escapes with his new recruit, the Morlock called [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]], while X-Factor then takes his Celestial spaceship as a base.&lt;ref name="X-Men #25"&gt;''X-Men'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''[[The Evolutionary War]]'', the [[High Evolutionary]] plans to rid the Earth of those he feels are preventing evolution. Believing this disrupts the natural order and his own plans, Apocalypse battles the High Evolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor Annual'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Following the genetic manipulation of Caliban, Apocalypse declines an alliance with the Asgardian villain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and other villains conspiring to unleash "[[Acts of Vengeance]]". This results in a brief fight between Apocalypse and Loki.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sins of the Futures===
[[Image:Nathaninfectedbyapoc.png|thumb|left|185px|Apocalypse infecting Nathan with a techno-organic virus, as depicted in ''Cable'' vol. 2, #64 (Feb, 1999). Pencils by [[José Ladrönn]].]]
Apocalypse learns of Sinister's intention to create an adversary powerful enough to destroy him: Nathan Christopher Charles Summers, the son of Scott Summers and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Apocalypse, viewing him as a threat and realizing that Nathan's energy is the very energy that awoke him all those months earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #75&lt;/ref&gt; sends his newly formed group, the Riders of the Storm, to abduct the Summers child. Apocalypse at this time had conquered the city of [[Attilan]], home of the [[Inhumans]], as well as enslaved part of its population. X-Factor, alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, attacks Apocalypse's lunar stronghold. Although Apocalypse is severely defeated, the young Nathan is infected with a [[techno-organic virus]] and is sent to the future with a woman named Askani to be cured.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #65-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, Apocalypse has conquered the Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse's body had grown feeble:&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Phoenix'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; he becomes aware of the young Nathan's presence in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone's stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan grows up to become the warrior [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as [[Stryfe]]) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse's future domination of the planet.

In the present, Apocalypse is prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his Riders (now calling themselves The [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]), who inform their master that his Horsemen have kidnapped Cyclops and Jean Grey, supposedly under his instructions (in actuality, Mister Sinister, who was posing as Apocalypse).&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #14&lt;/ref&gt; When attempting to rejuvenate himself again, Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe who had arrived in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. After a battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dark Riders' new leader, [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Genesis]] (the adopted son of Cable, who had traveled to the present to ensure Apocalypse's rise and exact revenge on his father), plans to resurrect Apocalypse by sacrificing the lives of the people in villages neighboring Akkaba. During this time, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is held captive by Genesis, who attempts to restore Wolverine's lost [[adamantium]] skeleton and turn him into a Horseman as a gift for Apocalypse. Wolverine breaks free and kills Genesis along with nearly all of the Dark Riders. Genesis had built a [[sarcophagus]] with Apocalypse's likeness (which is empty,&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #100&lt;/ref&gt; since Apocalypse had already revived&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' vol. 2, #19 (January 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Further schemes===
After a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at his side and quickly learns of the present danger: [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #335 (August 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He observes the conflict between the psionic entity and Earth's heroes with [[Uatu the Watcher]], who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one who hated him the most, Cable.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #336 (September 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught would be most vulnerable through the [[astral plane]] and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse would remove the captive [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the [[Invisible Woman]], who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #35&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of the ''Onslaught'' saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two separate entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards' [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|pocket universe]]. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk's nexus-energy to overcome the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against the New World Order, a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the planet. The New World Order in turn set the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and the [[Absorbing Man]] against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which the New World Order had obtained, destroying their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #455-457&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellfire Club later awakens Apocalypse's long-hidden [[Harbinger of Apocalypse|Harbinger]] from its deep sleep: originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to [[incubation period|incubate]] for 100 years. Apocalypse releases his Horseman (Caliban) and his scribe Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves, if they were to survive the coming events.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #53&lt;/ref&gt; Cable with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battles the Harbinger, but are unable to stop it. Apocalypse then appears, activating a bomb inside the Harbinger which would destroy all of New York, but Cable manages to prevent this disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable'' #66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] is disrupting Earth's [[magnetic field]], Apocalypse sends a [[Skrull]] impersonating the mutant [[Astra (comics)|Astra]] (having dealt with the original Astra) to stop the Master of Magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;''Magneto War''&lt;/ref&gt;

Intending to start an all-out war between the humans and the subterranean-dwelling [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] as part of his plan to test the strong, Apocalypse sets off [[nuclear warheads]] at [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]], causing the Deviants to further mutate (which also restores Ikaris' father [[Virako]] to life). Apocalypse launches an attack at [[San Francisco]], using a mentally controlled Deviant, [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]], now a gigantic monster, that the Eternals are forced to battle. Apocalypse is confronted by his centuries-old foe, Ikaris, who now is a [[Prime Eternal]]. Although Apocalypse defeats Ikaris, the Eternal still succeeds in destroying his ship and thwarting his plan.&lt;ref&gt;New Eternals #1: Apocalypse Now, February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Twelve===

[[Image:ApocalypseTwelve.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Apocalypse merges with Cyclops in ''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97 (February 2000). Art by [[Alan Davis]] and [[Mark Farmer]].]]
Supposedly lost diaries of the mutant seer [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] surfaced, telling of twelve beings that could defeat Apocalypse once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #94, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Various mutants, all listed in the prophecy, are abducted by Apocalypse's Horsemen including a faction of the Skrulls. The Twelve legend was in fact a ruse, orchestrated by Apocalypse himself: once the Twelve are assembled, Apocalypse intended to use them to transform himself into a deitylike entity beyond the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #377, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed at the end of this story arc, that Apocalypse's physical form has been burned out due to the vast amount of energies he has under his control, forcing him to wear a bio-armor (like his future counterpart) and now plans to use [[Nate Grey]] as a host body for him to move his energy and consciousness into. The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #97&lt;/ref&gt; While the merge is successful, Apocalypse's aim for unlimited power is not and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios (see [[Ages of Apocalypse]]). Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #98&lt;/ref&gt;

An amnesiac and powerless cyborg Cyclops regains control of the merged form, but Apocalypse begins to re-emerge. Jean and Cable are alerted to his location in Egypt, where Jean in the end manages to free Cyclops by telepathically tearing out Apocalypse's essence from her husband's body, rendering Apocalypse in an incorporeal [[astral plane|astral]] form, which Cable apparently destroys using his Psimitar.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The Search of Cyclops'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
[[Image:Xmen182vol.2.jpg|185px|thumb|left|''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182 (April 2006). Cover art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]
In the aftermath of the 2005 "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, in which most of the mutants lost their powers, Apocalypse was revealed to be alive and well. The techno-organic virus, with which he long ago infected Cable, was revealed to be the means by which Apocalypse's spirit reconstituted itself. With only a drop of his blood into a vat of organs and blood, the virus would rewrite the genetic code of the material within to form a body for Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable and Deadpool'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse awakes from a slumber in a tomb in Akkaba, recalling:&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #181&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Across the world—helpless mutants slaughtered. Pogroms. Horror. ...Something has woken me from my slumber. Once, a sudden surge in worldwide mutant power stirred me from a similar sleep. Now—a plummet in global mutant capacity—has opened my eyes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apocalypse finds himself on a planet with its mutant population reduced to a fraction of what it had been, only a few hundred remaining out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable's hands. Reappearing inside a [[Sphinx]]-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the [[X-Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #182&lt;/ref&gt; The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #183&lt;/ref&gt; Bent on becoming the new [[messiah]] for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the [[United Nations]] in New York and issues an [[ultimatum]]: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book|last = Sanderson |first=Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City| publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Apocalypse's horsemen are lost, Ozymandias betrays him, and he is forced to retreat by a combined assault of the X-Men and the Avengers. Ultimately, it is discovered that the Celestials ''lent'' their technology to Apocalypse, requiring as payment ''greater sufferings later''. He attempts to embrace death as an escape from his lifelong pact, only to find himself instantly resurrected and hearing a voice: "''We cannot let you die. Not yet. It is time Apocalypse… it is time''".&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2, #186&lt;/ref&gt;

In a future timeline seen in the 2009 storyline "[[Messiah War]]", a greatly weakened Apocalypse is attacked by [[Stryfe]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], but he survives the attack. Afterward, Apocalypse contacts [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] in the future and begs him to kill him. Archangel refuses and instead hands over some of his techno organic wing blades to him, telling Apocalypse he no longer holds any control over him. Coming into contact with the blades rejuvenates Apocalypse and he offers to join forces with Archangel to kill Stryfe who is on the verge of killing X-Force, Cable, Bishop, as well as [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' Vol.2 #15&lt;/ref&gt; Archangel takes Apocalypse to a Celestial ship, where Apocalypse is then fully restored and wants to avenge what Stryfe did to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable #15''&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Stryfe is on the verge of taking Hope for himself, Apocalypse and Archangel confront and defeat Stryfe. Apocalypse releases Hope into Cable's care, but says that he will return for her eventually. Apocalypse then drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' Vol.2 #16&lt;/ref&gt; Stryfe manages to escape and travels back in time to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Cable &amp; X-Force #18&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In the 2010 "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, versions of Apocalypse and his Horsemen from a possible future appear in the Avengers Tower after Kang breaks time itself. After a fight with the Avengers, he and his Horsemen disappear.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 2 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalypse's followers, the [[Clan Akkaba]], manage to bring about Apocalypse's return, albeit in the form of a child they will indoctrinate. Upon learning of Apocalypse's return, X-Force seeks to kill him, but when they discover he is a child, Psylocke decides to protect him, believing they can rehabilitate him and train him as a force for good. To the shock of the rest of the team, Fantomex fatally shoots the child.&lt;ref&gt;

In a 2011 storyline, as X-Force succeed in stopping the Deathloks inside [[Weapon Plus#The World|the World]], the home of all Weapon projects, it is revealed that [[Ultimaton]], guardian of the World, is keeping watch over an incubating young boy labeled En Sabah Nur, aged 847 days.&lt;ref&gt;

During the 2012 storyline "[[Dark Angel Saga]]", it is revealed that Apocalypse had fathered a [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|son]] with [[Famine (comics)|Autumn Rolfson]] and she kept this a secret from Apocalypse out of fear of what he would do to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the storyline, it is revealed that Fantomex creates a clone Apocalypse which he helps raise to the age of a teenager in an artificial world, where the clone knows Fantomex as the kindly "Uncle Cluster" who taught him to use his abilities for good. The boy, code-named Genesis, helps X-force fight Archangel and when the battle is over, Fantomex enrolls him in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evan Sabahnur====
In ''Wolverine &amp; the X-Men'' #4 (March 2012), Evan Sabahnur a.k.a. Genesis is admitted as a student to the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, where his classmates notice his resemblance to Apocalypse. En is worried when a visiting [[Deathlok]], who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs him that this is what Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Aaron]] (w), [[Nick Bradshaw]] (a). "Just Another Day in Westchester County".

After being called Kid Apocalypse by [[Kid Omega]], Evan begins learning about Apocalypse and is saddened that he himself looks like the villain, raising the possibility of a future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine &amp; the X-Men'' #10. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] son [[Daken]], kidnaps Evan during a field trip to [[Genosha]]'s remains. Hoping to sway the boy into becoming Apocalypse, the Brotherhood reveals to him that he is a clone and tells him of X-Force's assassination of the child En Sabah Nur from which he was cloned and the falsehood of his life under the tutelage of [[Fantomex]]. After the Brotherhood reveals that they have killed Fantomex and further tortures Evan, Daken tells En that he has a choice: either immediately ascend as Apocalypse and kill the Brotherhood as revenge for the death of "Uncle Cluster", or let the rest of X-Force die at the Brotherhood's hands to avenge the death of the original boy En Sabah Nur and to prevent X-Force from killing Evan the way they killed Apocalypse and Archangel.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #25-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken offers Evan a suit of Apocalypse's Celestial armor to do with what he will, secretly planning to control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the [[Shadow King]]. After Deadpool's failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine's death at Daken's hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse's armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool will always be there for him when he needs him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #35. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Deadpool enlists Evan and Quentin's help to help him saving his daughter Eleanor Camacho from the [[Flag-Smasher]], with Evan promising Quentin a bloodbath and some action to motivate him. He manages to save Ellie's life and proposes Deadpool to let Quentin erase from the girl's mind every memory of the ordeal. Deadpool loudly refuses and to Evan's surprise, he hugs him and tells him to stay in school.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' #33 (2014) Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Evan is one of many mutants captured by the [[Red Skull]] on the island of Genosha.&lt;ref&gt;''Magneto'' (vol. 3) #9. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; During a fierce battle between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the united X-Men, as well as a group of villains who all attempt to defeat the Red Onslaught, Evan assists Kid Omega in preventing Red Onslaught's telepathy from affecting the combined combatants.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #3. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; In the energy released when the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Doctor Doom]] use the combined power of order and chaos spells to suppress the Red Skull's personality in favor of the sliver of Professor X's that still exists in his brain, Evan ascends to adulthood, stepping out of the rubble with a looming, muscular body and the presence and appearance of Apocalypse. Deadpool even comments on how changed Evan is. When [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and Cyclops argue with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and the new [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] over who should take custody of the body of Red Skull, Evan convinces the Summers brothers that Professor X is dead and they have other problems to deal with.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #4. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting as Apocalypse, 'En' vows to lead the mutants in an uprising, rallying the converted X-Men into helping him take Avengers Tower—now disregarded by the inverted Avengers after they captured almost all other heroes using [[Pym particles]]—to use as the site where he will detonate a Celestial-based 'gene-bomb' to wipe out all humans not carrying the X-gene.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #6. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; With only the inverted villains present at the original confrontation to oppose the inverted X-Men and Avengers, the gene bomb is nearly detonated,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #7. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; but is contained thanks to the sacrifice of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #8. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; As Apocalypse broods on his failure, the decapitated Deadpool—converted to a peaceful version of himself by the inversion—convinces Apocalypse that now is the time to be heroic, proclaiming that nobody liked En Sabah Nur but everyone appreciated Evan, as he represented the hope that nurture could beat nature. Inspired by Deadpool's words, Apocalypse turns on the X-Men and the Avengers, allowing the Astonishing Avengers (along with non-inverted heroes Steve Rogers and [[Spider-Man]]) to retrieve the White Skull and undo the inversion. At the conclusion of the storyline, Evan is shown on the run with Deadpool.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apocalypse Wars===
During the Apocalypse Wars, the Extraordinary X-Men travel thousands of years into Earth's future in order to rescue Colossus and his team of young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse's rule as he functioned as the Omega World's heart, keeping it alive, while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler.&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undo the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. It's left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new host body.&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;
Apocalypse was kept at X-Haven, inside a cell specially built to contain him by Forge,&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; and later after again retrieving Colossus, Forge tried to find a way to cure him by reverse engineering Apocalypse's powers but failed.&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; During the World-Eater's attack on Limbo, Nightcrawler agreed to free Apocalypse in exchange for a cure for his friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; After returning Colossus to his normal self, Nightcrawler indeed released Apocalypse from his prison, however what Apocalypse didn't expect was that Nightcrawler would throw him into the vortex created by the World-Eater to consume Limbo, seemingly killing him in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Extraordinary X-Men'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degeneration===
Apocalypse is later revealed back on Earth, no details about what the Celestials did to him were revealed, and is shown performing experiments to create an immortal vessel which he can then use as a host for his vast power and consciousness by utilizing a modified ancient Celestial technology known as the Finch, which can repair genetic decay. His efforts are not in vain, as he begins to impose his own consciousness onto a human test subject, the fourth attempt, lending it his own regenerative powers to withstand the assault. However, the test subject resists the process, causing a massive chain reaction that bathes Apocalypse and the subject in a wave of energy. Apocalypse's mind and body are torn apart. He finds his mind wandering to that of his birth before his being is fused, mixed, and exploded along with this human form. Once the wave subsides, Apocalypse finds himself in a strange new land that he deduces was the result of the explosion within the Celestial machine that must have caused a dimensional rift which threw him into another dimension. He also discovers that his body has changed as well. Not only does he discover that he can bleed, something that should be impossible with his injury-resistant mutant physiology, but after a fight against a resident of the twisted dimension, which he was able to defeat, Apocalypse learns that his body is actively refusing physiological mutation. Needing to breathe air for the first time in centuries, he comes to a shocking truth as he watches his hand turn from its usual mutated appearance back to a human form. He's becoming Human.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Black - Magneto'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; After degenerating into an ape form, he is taken out by his previous human test subjects who unlike him, had ascend in form after been empowered by Apocalypse's own DNA. He and other apes are tortured with the Finch, which was recovered and repaired by the human test subjects. When test subject D experiments on Apocalypse, he uses the last of his mutant power to try to transfer his mind into D and is finally able to possess him which restores Apocalypse to his former glory. &lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Black - Emma Frost'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalypse was soon afterward captured by some mysterious force and is being held captive along with Kitty Pryde and anti-mutant senator Ashton Allen.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Apocalypse is an ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with a variety of superhuman abilities who further augmented himself after merging with [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] technology. He is an immortal being,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' (vol 1.) #37 (August 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; with total control over the molecules of his body, enabling him to alter his form as it suits him,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #6 (July 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; such as allowing his body to become extremely malleable and flexible, enhance his physical abilities, transform his limbs into weapons, wings, or jets, regenerate from fatal injuries, generate a wide range of powers at will, and adapt his body to apparently any disease or hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #68 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; He can also project and absorb energy and is capable of [[technopathy]], being able to directly interface with the various technologies he has at his disposal. Thanks to the aid of his mutant abilities allowing him complete control over his body, special "regeneration" chambers,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15 (December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Celestial technology,&lt;ref&gt;''Heroic Age: X-Men'' (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and changing bodies, Apocalypse has further enhanced his abilities and now he can generate almost any mutant power at his will.

Aside from his superhuman powers, Apocalypse is extraordinarily intelligent&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #51&lt;/ref&gt; and a scientific genius with knowledge in various areas of science and technology including [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[genetics]], and [[biology]], all of which are more advanced than conventional science.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #86&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse has knowledge of Celestial technology that he uses for his own applications, such as altering mutants or humans. Apocalypse is also a skilled [[demagogue]] and a master strategist.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #377&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalypse's blood can heal other mutants, but is fatal for humans. Apocalypse's blood can also restore his de-powered mutant descendants as is seen when a large dose of Apocalypse's blood regenerates the lost body part of [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and gave him a look similar to Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;''New Excalibur'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', his powers are portrayed slightly differently. Like most so-called "Class 5 Mutants," Apocalypse is near-[[demigod|godlike]] in his abilities and their applications. Among his more aggressive powers is the apparent ability to create matter (including enormous buildings and structures but also clothing, weapons, armor, etc.) from [[dust]] within seconds and also to turn matter into dust, also within seconds. Another of his major powers is his ability to augment the powers of other mutants, a power he uses very selectively and chiefly as a means to recruit co-conspirators for his plans for [[world domination]]. The mutants whose powers he augments are sometimes taken with him as [[apprentice]]s and eventual [[acolyte]]s, and are treated as his children; however, even in such a role, a given mutant might suddenly be deemed unfit by Apocalypse and ejected from his confidence, at any time.

==Other versions==
[[File:Apocalypse AoA.jpg|185px|right|thumb|''Apocalypse'', as depicted in the pages of ''X-Men Alpha'' (February 1995), during the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline. Art by [[Roger Cruz]].]]
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, Apocalypse awakens ten years before Cable would arrive, witnessing the accidental death of Charles Xavier, attacks humanity and conquers much of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Alpha''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this universe, his son is [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]].

In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, Apocalypse is an ally of the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X'' #322. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] title features an alternate version of Apocalypse who is an entity worshiped by Sinister.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #49. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a series of tasks, Sinister is transformed into Apocalypse who intends to conquer the planet. The heroes are unable to defeat him until the Phoenix Force appears and destroys him. Although his abilities are never directly stated in total, he is shown to be capable of negating other mutant powers, adapting mutant powers into his own by exposure to them and "evolving" as he is fought. Following a heavy assault by the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and SHIELD forces, he emerges from an explosion in a red and silver version of his traditional blue cybernetic battle armor. He is also capable of adapting to and overcoming Professor Xavier's psychic assault despite his training during his time in the future with Cable. Cable makes the most concrete implication that evolving is the major element of his powers when he remarks that Xavier must kill Apocalypse quickly before he adapts to his attacks and becomes immune to the telepathy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #92. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypse is finally dispelled by [[Jean Grey (comics)|Phoenix]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #93. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; while leaving an alive Mr. Sinister. His actual nature is unknown: he proclaims himself to be the first mutant (like in the mainstream series) and Phoenix readings portray him as an ancient being, but this is later contradicted by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]]'s revelation in [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]],&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimatum'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; that explains mutants are a recent creation of the humans. He later appears again as part of Sinister's psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[House of M]]'' universe created by [[Scarlet Witch]], Apocalypse was installed as the ruler of North Africa by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He was apparently killed by [[Black Bolt]] after a failed attempt to assassinate [[Black Panther (comics)|King T'Challa]] at Magneto's behest.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' (vol. 4) #7&lt;/ref&gt;

The character appears in a number of ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' issues.&lt;ref&gt;''What If...?'' (vol. 2) #46, 65, 69, 77, 101 and 111. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, AstraZeneca's drug [[tremelimumab]] was approved as an [[orphan drug]] for the treatment of [[mesothelioma]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="mesothelioma"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/15/astrazeneca-cancer-idUSL5N0XB3C220150415 |date=15 April 2015 |title=AstraZeneca immune system drug wins orphan status in rare cancer |location=London |accessdate=13 July 2015 |work=Reuters |first=Ben |last=Hirschler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016, AstraZeneca announced that a [[clinical trial]] of tremelimumab as a treatment for mesothelioma failed to meet its primary endpoint.&lt;ref name="tremelimumab"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-company/media-centre/press-releases/2016/astrazeneca-reports-top-line-result-of-tremelimumab-monotherapy-trial-in-mesothelioma-29022016.html |date=29 February 2016 |title=AstraZeneca reports top-line result of tremelimumab monotherapy trial in mesothelioma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senior management==

As of 2008, David Brennan was paid $1,574,144 for his role as chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Executive directors' salaries 2009 |url=http://www.astrazeneca-annualreports.com/2008/remuneration_report/exec_directors_exec_team.html#basic-salary |work=Remuneration Report – AstraZeneca Annual Report 2008 |publisher=AstraZeneca |accessdate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211155349/http://www.astrazeneca-annualreports.com/2008/remuneration_report/exec_directors_exec_team.html#basic-salary |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2012 it was announced that Brennan was to retire early in the June of that year&lt;ref name=brennangoes&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/26/astrazeneca-boss-quits-boardroom-coup?newsfeed=true AstraZeneca boss David Brennan quits under pressure from investors] ''The Guardian'', 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2012, [[Pascal Soriot]] was named CEO of AstraZeneca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/9504462/AstraZeneca-appoints-Roches-Pascal-Soriot-as-new-chief.html|title=Astra Zeneca appoints Roches Pascal Soriot as new chief|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also announced that [[Leif Johansson (businessman)|Leif Johansson]] would succeed [[Louis Schweitzer (CEO)|Louis Schweitzer]] as Non-Executive chairman on 1 June 2012, three months earlier than previously announced, and would become Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee after (the 2012) Annual General Meeting.&lt;ref name= brennangoes/&gt;

== Controversies ==

===Seroquel===

In April 2010 AstraZeneca settled a ''[[qui tam]]'' lawsuit brought by [[Stefan P. Kruszewski]] for $520&amp;nbsp;million to settle allegations that the company defrauded [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and other government-funded health care programs in connection with its marketing and promotional practices for the blockbuster atypical antipsychotic, [[Seroquel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/April/10-civ-487.html Pharmaceutical Giant AstraZeneca to Pay $520 Million for Off-label Drug Marketing] U.S. Department of Justice, 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, AstraZeneca settled a [[lawsuit]] in the United States totalling $68.5&amp;nbsp;million to be divided up to 38 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20110311/BUSINESS/103110347/1017/SPORTS06/?odyssey|title=Drugmaker settles lawsuits over Seroquel| publisher=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=1 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nexium===
The company's most commercially successful medication is [[esomeprazole]] (Nexium). The primary uses are treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], treatment and maintenance of [[erosive esophagitis]], treatment of [[duodenal ulcers]] caused by ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', prevention of [[gastric ulcers]] in those on chronic [[NSAID]] therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with [[Crohn's disease]]. When it is manufactured the result is a mixture of two [[enantiomer|mirror-imaged molecules]], R and S. Two years before the omeprazole patent expired, AstraZeneca patented S-omeprazole in pure form, pointing out that since some people metabolise R-omeprazole slowly, pure S-omeprazole treatment would give higher dose efficiency and less variation between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F5877192 United States Patent 5,877,192] USPTO Patent Database, 11 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2001, the company began to market [[Esomeprazole|Nexium]], as it would a brand new drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/25/041025crat_atlarge?currentPage=all|title=High Prices|date=25 October 2004|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (R)-entantiomer of omeprazole is metabolized exclusively by the enzyme CYP2C19, which is expressed in very low amounts by 3% of the population.  Treated with a normal dose of the enantiomeric mixture, these persons will experience blood levels five-times higher than those with normal CYP2C19 production. In contrast, esomeprazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, providing less-variable drug exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke TL, Williams DA, Roche VF, Zito SW. Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry, 7th edition, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; While omeprazole is approved only at doses of up to 20&amp;nbsp;mg for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/019810s098,022056s014lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; esomeprazole is approved for doses up to 40&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/021153s046,021957s015,022101s012lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Marcia Angell]], former [[editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and a lecturer in [[social medicine]] at the [[Harvard Medical School]], said in ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', a German-language weekly newsmagazine, that AstraZeneca's scientists had misrepresented their research on the drug's efficiency, saying "Instead of using presumably comparable doses [of each drug], the company's scientists used Nexium in higher dosages. They compared 20 and 40 mg Nexium with 20 mg [[Prilosec]]. With the cards having been marked in that way, Nexium looked like an improvement – which however was only small and shown in only two of the three studies."&lt;ref&gt;Grill, Markus and Hansen, Hans (2007): ''"Vorsicht, Pharma! Wie die Industrie Ärzte manipuliert und Patienten täuscht."'' ('Caution, Pharma! How the industry manipulates physicians and deceives patients.') Published in the 16 August 2007 issue of ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (Germany; ''pp. 100–107''). Available as an e-paper [http://www.stern.de/magazin/heft/595225.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013162711/http://www.stern.de/magazin/heft/595225.html |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bildman fraud===
On 4 February 1998, Astra USA sued Lars Bildman, its former president and chief executive officer, seeking $15&amp;nbsp;million for [[Fraud|defrauding]] the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb1998/nf80204e.htm Astra hauls ex-CEO Lars Bildman into court] Business Week, 4 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The sum included $2.3&amp;nbsp;million in company funds he allegedly used to fix up three of his homes, plus money the company paid as the result of the EEOC investigation. Astra's lawsuit alleged Bildman sexually harassed and intimidated employees, used company funds for [[yacht]]s and prostitutes, destroyed [[document]]s and [[business record|record]]s, and concocted "tales of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] involving ex-[[KGB]] [[espionage|agent]]s and competitors. This was in a last-ditch effort to distract attention from the real wrongdoer, Bildman himself." Bildman had already [[pleaded guilty]] in [[US District Court]] for failing to report more than $1&amp;nbsp;million in income on his [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]s; in addition, several female co-workers filed personal sexual-harassment lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/astra-boss-hit-with-7m-fine-for-sex-harassment-reps-share-memories-of-bonkers-ceo/|title=Astra Boss Hit With $7M Fine for Sex Harassment; Reps Share Memories of Bonkers CEO|date=6 October 2009|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[University of Minnesota]] research participant [[Death of Dan Markingson|Dan Markingson committed suicide]] while enrolled in an industry-sponsored pharmaceutical trial comparing three FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics: [[Quetiapine|Seroquel (quetiapine)]], [[Olanzapine|Zyprexa (olanzapine)]], and [[Risperidone|Risperdal (risperidone)]]. University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics [[Carl Elliott (philosopher)|Carl Elliott]] noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution.&lt;ref name=mj&gt;Elliott, Carl (September/October 2010). "The deadly corruption of clinical trials." Mother Jones: https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/dan-markingson-drug-trial-astrazeneca?page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation revealed financial ties to AstraZeneca by Markingson's psychiatrist, Stephen C. Olson, oversights and biases in AstraZeneca's trial design, and the inadequacy of university [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Board (IRB)]] protections for research subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markingson.blogspot.com/|title=Dan Markingson Investigation|author=Carl|publisher=|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=July 2018}} A 2005 FDA investigation cleared the university. Nonetheless, controversy around the case has continued. A [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']] article&lt;ref name=mj/&gt; resulted in a group of university faculty members sending a public letter to the university Board of Regents urging an external investigation into Markingson's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49659724/U-of-M-Board-of-Regents-Markingson-Letter|title=U of M Board of Regents Markingson Letter|work=Scribd|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer mispricing===
In 2010 AstraZeneca agreed to pay £505&amp;nbsp;million to settle a UK tax dispute related to transfer mispricing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/23/astrazeneca-tax-uk-pharmaceuticals AstraZeneca agrees to pay £505m to settle UK tax dispute], ''The Guardian'' 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doping in cycling===
On July 27, 2015, [[Fabio Taborre]] ([[Androni-Sidermec]]) returned a positive doping test result for the banned blood-booster [[FG-4592]] in an out-of-competition control on June 16, 2015. FG-4592 ([[Roxadustat]]) is in phase 3 clinical trials and has not yet been commercialised. The drug was developed jointly by FibroGen and AstraZeneca. Unlike [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO), which directly stimulates the production of red blood cells, FG-4592 is taken orally, and stimulates natural production of EPO in a manner similar to altitude training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/taborre-positive-for-novel-epo-stimulating-drug-fg-4592/|title=Taborre positive for novel EPO stimulating drug FG-4592|author=Cycling News|work=Cyclingnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Gulf Daily News'' on 1 February 2012, King Hamad's media affairs adviser Nabeel Al Hamer revealed plans for new talks between the opposition and the government on his Twitter account. He said that talks with political societies "had already begun to pave the way clear for a dialogue that would lead to a united Bahrain". The move was supported by Al Wefaq National Islamic Society former MP [[Abduljalil Khalil]], who said that the society was "ready for serious dialogue and this time had no preconditions". He reiterated that "People want serious reforms that reflect their will and what they really want for their future." However the National Unity Assembly board member Khalid Al Qoud said that his society would not participate in talks "until those behind the acts of violence were arrested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Torr|title=Second dialogue chance for unity|date= 1 February 2012|publisher=Gulf Daily news|url =http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=322833|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call for dialogue was echoed by Crown Prince [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]], who backed the initiative.&lt;ref name=amid&gt;{{cite news|title=Ray of hope amid statements about national solution|date=31 January 2012|work=Gulf News|url= http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/bahrain/ray-of-hope-amid-statements-about-national-solution-1.973923|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahrain Debate is an initiative organised "by the youth for the youth" that brings together young people from across the spectrum of Bahraini society to debate the political and social problems confronting the country, and their solutions. The debate is not funded or organised by any political group.&lt;ref name=amid/&gt; "In light of what has happened in Bahrain, people need to express themselves in a constructive way and listen to others' views," said Ehsan Al Kooheji, one of the organisers. "The youth are the country's future because they have the power to change things. They are extremely dynamic and energetic but have felt that they don't have a platform to express their opinions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahraindebate.com/ Bahrain Debate 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahraini independents worried that the island will slide into sectarian violence also began an effort to break the political stalemate between pro-government and opposition forces. Dr. [[Ali Fakhro]], a former minister and ambassador "respected across the political spectrum", told Reuters that he hoped to get moderates from both sides together at a time when extremists are making themselves felt throughout the Gulf Arab state. Fakhro said the initiative, launched at a meeting on 28 January 2012, involved persuading opposition parties and pro-government groups meeting outside a government forum and agreeing on a list of basic demands for democratic reform. He launched the plan at a meeting of prominent Bahrainis with no official political affiliations or memberships, called the National Bahraini Meeting. A basic framework for discussion is the seven points for democratic reform announced by Crown Prince Salman in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|title = Worried Bahrainis seek talks as clashes worsen|date=2 February 2012| publisher=Arabain Business|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/worried-bahrainis-seek-talks-as-clashes-worsen-443277.html |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2012, the government banned all protests, threatening legal action against anyone who attempted to organize a rally or demonstration.

According to a report by a Bahraini human rights body, the country saw 745 protests in just December alone. The government's reaction to dissent included arrests of 31 children, home raids and enforced disappearances. Out of the 745 "sporadic protests", more than a half were suppressed by security forces, according to a report by the Liberties and Human Rights Department in [[Al Wefaq National Islamic Society]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Controversies===

====Mohamed Ramadan====
[[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Al Khalifa regime]] in [[Bahrain]], knowingly refused for more than two years to investigate complaints regarding the torture of [[Mohamed Ramadan (Victim)|Mohamed Ramadan]]—a father-of-three on [[death row]] who was [[tortured]] into making a false confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belfast to Bahrain: the torture trail|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BelfastToBahrain.pdf|website=Reprieve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Mohammed was arrested from Bahrain International Airport, where he worked as a police officer. He was accused of involvement in an attack on other police officers, despite a total [[Evidence|lack of evidence]] tying him to the crime. In reality, Mohammed is an innocent man who was arrested in [[retaliation]] for his attendance at [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations]].&lt;ref name="Mohammad Ramadan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Ramadan|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/case-study/mohammed-ramadan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his arrest, Mohammed was [[Torture|brutally tortured]] by police into signing a '''false confession''', despite his innocence. During his initial detention, police officers ''told Mohammed outright that they knew he was innocent'', but were punishing him as a [[traitor]] for attending pro-democracy demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Mohammad Ramadan" /&gt;

During his entire [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]], Mohammed has never been allowed to meet with his lawyer. The day Mohammed's trial began was the first time he ever saw his lawyer's face. In that trial, he was convicted and [[sentenced to death]] almost solely on the basis of confessions extracted through prolonged torture.&lt;ref name="Mohammad Ramadan" /&gt;

====7 men under Capital punishment (2016)====
[[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] a [[human rights]] defender organisation published an investigative report about [[British government|Britain]] involvement in [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahrain's]] regime atrocity in 2016. The report says that seven innocent men are facing the [[death penalty]] in Bahrain after being [[tortured]] into the false confessions of crimes.&lt;ref name="english.voiceofbahrain.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain Funded Torture Training in Bahrain|url=http://english.voiceofbahrain.org/?p=6744|website=Voice of Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sami Mushaima, Ali Al-Singace, Abbas Al-Samea (2017) Executed====
On 15 January 2017, [[Cabinet of Bahrain]] passed a [[capital punishment]] sentence of three Shia protesters convicted of orchestrating a bomb attack which killed 1 Emirati policeman from the [[Peninsula Shield Force]] and 2 Bahraini policemen on 3 March 2014. 42 year old [[Sami Mushaima]], 21 year old [[Ali Al-Singace]], and 27 year old [[Abbas Al-Samea]] confessed of orchestrating the bomb attack and were [[execution by firing squad|executed]] by firing squad.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/15/bahraini-authorities-execute-three-shia-muslim-men-convicted/|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain]], Bahrain security forces arrested Sami Mushaima in March 2014 and held him [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] for at least 11 days. Security officials subjected Mushaima to [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[electrocution]], [[sexual assault]], and severely damaged his front teeth. Mushaima's family believes he was [[coerced]] into falsely confessing through the use of torture. Sami Mushaima, Ali Al-Singace and Abbas Al-Samea executions have sparked protests from members of the opposition in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="adhrd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain Executes Stateless Torture Victims Following King Hamad's Authorization|url=http://www.adhrb.org/2017/01/bahrain-executes-stateless-torture-victims-following-king-hamads-authorisation/|agency=Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsions===
''Al-wasat'' reported on 12 April, Issue no. 3139, that sixteen Lebanese nationals were requested by the Bahraini security services to leave the country. No details or reasons for the request were given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alwasatnews.com/3139/news/read/536876/1.html|script-title=ar:السلطات الأمنية تطلب من 16 لبنانياً مغادرة البحرين|language=Arabic|work=[[Alwasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Alwasat]]|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Bahraini government claimed in a confidential report to the UN in April 2011 that Lebanese political organisation [[Hezbollah]], considered a terrorist group by the US, is present in Bahrain and is actively involved in the organisation of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Elise Labott [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-25/world/bahrain.hezbollah_1_wefaq-hezbollah-camps-hassan-nasrallah?_s=PM:WORLD "Bahrain government accuses Hezbollah of aiding opposition groups"].

''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 Bahrain expelled the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, [[Tom Malinowski]], after he had met members of the leading [[Shia Islam|Shia]] opposition group, [[Al Wefaq|Al-Wefaq]], a move that the Foreign ministry of Bahrain said 'intervened in the country's domestic affairs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28204511|title=US Diplomat Tom Malinowski Expelled from Bahrain|last=|first=|date=7 July 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, in May 2011, pro government websites and newspapers targeted US embassy's human rights officer, Ludovic Hood, and published information on where he and his family lived after accusing him of training and provoking demonstrations, being a Zionist and working in cooperation with Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/20116816139147194.html|title=The US and Bahrain.

The US government subsequently withdrew Hood from Bahrain.

===Incarcerations===
Amongst the more prominent opposition figures, the Al-Khawaja family has been intermittently in and out of prison, even before the uprising began. Since the start of the uprising, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, the former president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was placed on trial for his part in the uprising. On 22 June, he was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/22/bahrain-activist-zainab-al-khwaja | title= Bahraini activist's father jailed for life | author=Peter Walker | date= 22 June 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK| accessdate=24 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110626232733/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/22/bahrain-activist-zainab-al-khwaja| archivedate= 26 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughters and sons-in-law have also been intermittently in and out of prison since the counter-revolutionary crackdown by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/bahrain-sentences-activists-to-life-in-jail/ | title= Bahrain Sentences Activists to Life in Jail | author=Robert Mackey | date= 22 June 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK| accessdate=24 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185911/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/bahrain-sentences-activists-to-life-in-jail/| archivedate= 23 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayat Al-Qurmezi was also found guilty of organising protests and assembling at the Pearl Roundabout and reading a poem critical of government policy. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak, her spokesman, said that the poem "caused incitement and hatred to his majesty the king and to the prime minister" with lines such as "we are people who kill humiliation" and "assassinate misery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/12/bahrain.unrest/ | title= Bahrain tries ex-lawmakers, imprisons poet | author=[[Nic Robertson]] | date= 12 June 2011| publisher=CNN| accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"So they rely on foreign recruits to unquestioningly carry out orders of violently suppressing protests", he said.&lt;ref name="AJE 30.7.2011"/&gt; Bruce Riedel, a leading American expert on South Asia said "when the very serious demonstrations began and it looked like the regime might even be toppled at a certain point, their hiring of mercenaries went up substantially".&lt;ref name="VOA 17.8.2012"/&gt;

{{Main|Casualties of the Bahraini uprising of 2011 and its aftermath}}

As of 2014, the uprising had resulted in about 164 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=164 Protesters Killed in Bahrain since Start of Uprising: Opposition|url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/English/Home/Single/373903|publisher=Tasnim News Agency|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of injuries is hard to determine due to government clamp-down on hospitals and medical personnel. The last accurate estimate for injuries is from 16 March 2011 and sits at about 2,708. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that many detainees were subjected to torture and other forms of physical and psychological abuse while in police custody, leading to the death of five detainees. The BICI report finds the government responsible for 20 deaths (November 2011). Opposition activists say that the current number is about 78&lt;!--This number is for those who opposition activist blame the government for their death and not the total number of deaths--&gt; including 34 who allegedly died as a result of excessive use of tear gas.

===Injuries===
The total number of injured since the start of the uprising is not known. This is due to protesters fear of being arrested while receiving treatment at hospitals for injuries sustained during the protest.&lt;ref name="MSF 3.8.2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain: MSF Condemns Armed Raid On Office and Detention of Staff Member |date=3 August 2011 |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=5484&amp;cat=press-release |accessdate=10 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008175432/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=5484&amp;cat=press-release |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 16 March 2011, the total number is, at least 2,708.&lt;ref&gt;4 on 14 February (BICI page 68), 25 on 15 February [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121571645551445.html Deaths heighten Bahrain tension – Al Jazeera English], 600+ on 17 February [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/opinion/18kristof.html?_r=2 Blood Runs Through the Streets of Bahrain – NYTimes.com], 774 on 11 March [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/03/11/bahrain.clashes/index.html?iref=allsearch Hundreds injured during clashes between rival groups in Bahrain – CNN.com], 905+ on 13 March [http://www.alwasatnews.com/3111/news/read/532288/1.html] [http://www.alwasatnews.com/3110/news/read/532142/1.html] [http://www.alwasatnews.com/3110/news/read/532149/1.html], 250 on 15 March [http://www.alwasatnews.com/3113/news/read/532534/1.html] and 150+ on 16 March [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/03/16/bahrain.protests/index.html?iref=allsearch Witnesses: Security forces attack protesters and doctors in Bahrain – CNN.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another 200 injuries were treated by Médecins Sans Frontières outside hospitals,&lt;ref name="MSF 3.8.2011"/&gt; for a total of 2,908.

The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry found that there were 35 deaths between 14 February and 15 April 2011 linked to the uprising. The Commission found the government responsible for 20 of these deaths, protesters responsible for 3, and mobs responsible for 2. The Commission could not attribute the remaining 10 deaths to a perpetrator. Additionally, the Commission found that there were another 11 deaths potentially linked to the uprising between 16 April and 6 October 2011. Between 7 October 2011 and 5 April 2012, the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) reported 32 deaths linked to the uprising, for a total of 78 deaths. The total number, counting all related incidents, even those not mentioned in the BICI report and BCHR is 90 deaths as of 21 April 2012.

==Media coverage of the uprising==
[[File:Reuters photographer Hamad I Mohamed wearing a gas mask while covering a protest.JPG|thumb|Reuters photographer Hamad I Mohamed wearing a gas mask while covering a protest]]

Coverage of the uprising within Bahrain has been controversial and confusing, with numerous incidents where media outlets reported conflicting reports of deaths and violence both by government forces and anti-government protesters. Both national and international journalists have had difficulty gaining access to protests and allegations of bias have caused scandals in two leading Arabic new sources, Al Jazeera and [[Al Arabiya]].

===International coverage===
International correspondents from several major news outlets had difficulty gaining entry to Bahrain or, once there, having the freedom to pursue stories. The Information Affairs Authority (IAA) lists a number of media outlets that would be allowed access to Bahrain, including the BBC, [[Financial Times]] and news agencies such as [[Reuters]] and the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassel|first=Matthew|title=Suppressing the narrative in Bahrain|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/02/201229153055296176.html|accessdate=21 February 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, claiming that the western media published and broadcast false and biased reports, the government of Bahrain denied visas to several international journalists.&lt;ref name="Al-Khal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Khal|first=Abdulla|title=International Media in Bahrain: Balanced of Biased?|url=http://www.mbrsc.aud.edu/MBRSCPost/index.php?op=ViewArticle&amp;articleId=111&amp;blogId=1|publisher=MBRSC Post|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP), [[The New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[The Christian Science Monitor]], and the UK's [[Channel 4]] and Al Jazeera all applied for media visas but had their applications denied.

In addition to refusing to grant visas, Bahraini authorities had detained several journalists. On 31 March 2011, four CNN journalists were detained on a charge of not having proper documents. The journalists stated they did possess the correct documents, however, they were not able to conduct the interviews they had scheduled because of their source's fear of being arrested. When the same journalists attempted to interview the president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Rajab, at his home, six military vehicles arrived and 20 masked men surrounded the CNN team and Rajab and deleted all of the photos. Another CNN reporter, Mohammed Jamjoom, was expelled from Bahrain on 16 March, the same day he arrived. He said he was asked to leave without any explanation and a government official escorted him to the airport. CNN produced a documentary about the use of Internet technology and social media in the Arab Spring, including a 13-minute segment on the Bahraini uprising that reported repressive conduct by the government; CNN aired the documentary only once in the United States and not at all on [[CNN International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =Greenwald| first =Glenn| author-link =Glenn Greenwald| title =Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?| newspaper =[[The Guardian]]| date =4 September 2012| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression?newsfeed=true| accessdate = 8 September 2012| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters correspondent Frederik Richter, was expelled on 10 May for what the Bahraini government said was biased reporting. On at least two occasions the Bahraini government has commenced or announced legal action against news sources or reporters for articles targeting Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Al-Khal"/&gt;

The Bahrain Freedom Movement posted on their website that, in the second week of February, many journalists were banned from entering the country to report on the deteriorating situation-especially as the regime increased its cracked down on the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain: More martyrs, international activists deported, revolution continues|url=http://www.vob.org/en/index.php?show=news&amp;action=article&amp;id=1242|work=Bahrain Freedom Movement|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to evaluate the situation of freedom of expression in the country, a delegation of international NGOs was supposed to make a visit from 5 to 10 May 2012. The delegation received permission from the Bahraini government on 11 April. The government, however, withdrew its permission on 30 April, claiming that new regulations had taken effect that prevented the presence of more than one international NGO in any one week. The delegation was to have consisted of representatives of NGOs including [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Freedom House]], the [[Gulf Centre for Human Rights]], [[Index on Censorship]], [[PEN International]] and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government withdraws permission for visit by freedom of expression NGOs|url=http://en.rsf.org/bahrain-government-withdraws-permission-04-05-2012,42554.html|work=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the BBC admitted making "major errors" in its coverage of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC admits errors in Bahrain unrest coverage|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MEDIA_219748.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Trade Arabia|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 89-page report, 9 pages were devoted to the BBC's coverage of Bahrain and included admissions that the BBC had "underplayed the sectarian aspect of the conflict" and "not adequately conveyed the viewpoint of supporters of the monarchy" by "[failing] to mention attempts by Crown Prince His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to establish dialogue with the opposition". The report added that "the government appears to have made a good-faith effort to de-escalate the crisis" in particular during a period when the BBC's coverage of the unrest dropped substantially and that many people had complained that their coverage was "utterly one-sided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC admits errors in unrest coverage|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=333054|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Gulf News Daily|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media associated with the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], keep labeling the Shia-majority population in opposition to the ruling Sunni regime as "terrorists", "anarchists" and "trouble makers." At the same time, the Bahraini regime is presented as non-secterian, tolerant and merciful.

===CNN controversy===
On 29 September 2012, US journalist [[Amber Lyon]], who was covering the uprising for CNN, described her investigation of how the US ally Bahrain was committing human rights abuses, but said that CNN and the US government pressured her to suppress the news. A documentary on which she had been working was never aired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?], TheGuardian, September 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Jazeera controversy===
Despite extensive, and sometimes even non-stop coverage of the revolutions in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]], Al Jazeera's coverage of Bahrain was much less comprehensive.

{{Quote|"Despite being banned in Egypt, Al Jazeera went to great lengths to provide non-stop live coverage of events. It did not do that in Bahrain."|[[Ghanem Nuseibeh]]|Reuters&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;}}

In February 2011, several key personnel in Al Jazeera's Beirut office resigned in protest, citing the channel's 'biased' coverage of the uprisings in Syria and Bahrain. This includes Bureau managing director Hassan Shaaban and correspondent Ali Hashem. Hashem stated that the channel refused to show photos which might favor the Syrian government's position and would not air material that showed violence in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera exodus: Channel losing staff over 'bias'|url=http://rt.com/news/al-jazeera-loses-staff-335/|publisher=RT|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ghassan bin Jiddo|Ghassan Ben Jeddo]], who had been the head of the Beirut Bureau before resigning in April 2011, said that Al Jazeera was biased in covering the Arab Spring, especially in Syria and Bahrain.

{{Quote|"I do believe that Al Jazeera and other channels were not balanced in dealing with the events," he said. "For instance, with respect to the events in Syria and Bahrain, we started to invite guests from America who only criticize the regime in Syria and support the regime in Bahrain and persons who justify NATO intervention. This is unacceptable."|Ghassan Ben Jeddo|[[RT (TV network)|RT]]&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;}}

[[California State University|California State University, Stanislaus]] politics professor [[As'ad AbuKhalil]] noted that Al Jazeera avoided inviting Bahraini or Omani or Saudi critics of the Bahraini regime to speak on the air, alluding to the also scant coverage of protests in [[Oman]] and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

In April 2011, David Pollack at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], noted that, "Al jazeera Arabic did not report on the hardening of the Bahraini opposition on March 8, when the Coalition for a Bahraini Republic called for an end to the monarchy, nor did it cover protests held there on March 9, 10, and 13, the critical days leading to Saudi Arabia's decision to send troops into Bahrain." In one extreme example Pollack noted that at one point Al Jazeera English had a picture of Saudi troops headed across the causeway connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain while Al Jazeera Arabic ran a completely different headline proclaiming "Bahrain's Government Rejects Foreign Intervention" — alluding to a rejection Iranian interference.

In 2010, a [[WikiLeaks]] document mentioned Al Jazeera several times. One such document revealed that the Qatari government referred to Al Jazeera as "a bargaining tool to repair relationships with other countries, particularly those soured by Al Jazeera's broadcasts, including the United States." This was confirmed by another WikiLeaks document stating "Relations [between Qatar and Saudi Arabia] are generally improving after Qatar toned down criticism of the [[House of Saud]] on Al Jazeera." Another WikiLeaks document indicated that Al Jazeera "has proved itself a useful tool for the station's political masters.".&lt;ref name="Kianpars"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kianpars |title=Al-Jazeera in the Crosshairs: Balanced Reporting or Sectarian Bias? |url=http://www.aslanmedia.com/the-connection/2580-al-jazeera-in-the-crosshairs-balanced-reporting-or-sectarian-bias |accessdate=7 April 2012 |newspaper=Aslan Media |date=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402165405/http://www.aslanmedia.com/the-connection/2580-al-jazeera-in-the-crosshairs-balanced-reporting-or-sectarian-bias |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Jazeera's leadership told Reuters in mid-April 2011 that it faced a "challenging terrain" in Bahrain and that "Editorial priorities are weighed on a number of factors at any given moment.".&lt;ref name="Kianpars"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}

Journalist Don Debar, who has Al Jazeera experience, confirmed that the station has been heavily guided by the Qatari government in its policies. Stating, "The head of the bureau in Beirut quit, many other people quit because of the biased coverage and outright hand of the government in dictating editorial policy over Libya, and now Syria".&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

Critics did note that Al Jazeera coverage of the crisis in Bahrain did increase in May and June 2011 and conceded that the severe press restrictions in Bahrain made coverage extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="Kianpars"/&gt;

The Qatar-based Al Jazeera has been heralded as one of the few networks who gave comprehensive and unbiased coverage of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The network is widely credited with helping protests maintain the momentum which resulted in the overthrow of the entrenched regimes of Tunisia's [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] and Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Al Jazeera was able to subvert government bans on its coverage by soliciting images from people on the ground, even providing them with a special address where they could send mobile phone images. When social unrest began in Yemen and Al Jazeera turned their focus east, Yemeni President, [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], accused the network of running an "operations room to burn the Arab nation." and revoked the Al Jazeera correspondents' licenses.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

===Al Arabiya controversy===
The Saudi-owned channel Al Arabiya has also been conservative in its coverage. When former Tunisian President Ben Ali sought refuge in Saudi Arabia after fleeing unrest in his own country, Al Arabiya referred to the revolution in Tunisia as "the change".

The popular talk show "Studio Cairo" was cancelled in February after its host, [[Hafez al-Mirazi]] said on the air he would host a discussion on Gulf political reform on his next show. al-Mirazi defended his actions, saying,

{{Quote|"I said there was no excuse for anyone at Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya to discuss Egypt while not being able to talk about the Emir of Qatar or Qatari politics or King Abdullah and Saudi politics,"&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Gulf media find their red line in uprisings:Bahrain|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/oukwd-uk-mideast-protests-media-idAFTRE73D1HB20110414?sp=true|agency=Reuters Africa|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al Arabiya's coverage has been less conservative in covering the Arab revolutions in Libya and Syria. Both of which have poor relationships with Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

===Coverage within Bahrain===
Media coverage from within Bahrain has been problematic. Some cases produced only gone unconfirmed or contradictory reports, such as the death of an elderly taxi driver on 13 March 2011. The Gulf Daily News reported that the driver had been beaten to death by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="Track down my father's killers"/&gt; Other Bahraini media reported the driver as killed by terrorists.&lt;ref name="Martyrs' Families Visited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alayam.com"/&gt; Independent newspaper [[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Al-Wasat]] reported the cause of death as a simple traffic accident and cited witnesses.&lt;ref name="alwasatnews.com"/&gt; The Commission of Inquiry did not report any deaths like this connected to the uprisings.&lt;ref name="amnestylink"&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/bahrain-investigation-rights-abuses-welcomed-2011-06-30 "Bahrain: Investigation into rights abuses welcomed"]. Amnesty International. 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in med-February 2011, Bahrain's main television station, BTV, launched a series of talk shows whose sole purpose appears to have been the incitement of public opinion against opposition sympathizers. Protesters were described by talk-show hosts as 'terrorists', 'foreign agents' and 'thugs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring|last=Fakhro|first=Elham|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198749028|location=|pages=103|chapter=Revolution in Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance was the supposed death of a Saudi Arabian soldier on 15 March 2011, reported by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com" /&gt; The information was said to have come from a Saudi official, but Bahrain news organizations denied the report and the Commission of Inquiry, again, found no proof of it.

Bahraini newspapers have given substantial coverage to the protests, although many of them tend to self-censor and adopt the government point of view, avoiding criticism of the king and the Royal family.&lt;ref name="Attacks on the Press 2004: Bahrain"&gt;{{cite web|author=Attacks on the Press 2004: Bahrain |url=http://cpj.org/2005/03/attacks-on-the-press-2004-bahrain.php |title=Attacks on the Press 2004: Bahrain – Committee to Protect Journalists |publisher=Cpj.org |date=14 March 2005 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent events against Bahraini media led [[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters without Borders]] to issue this statement:

{{Quote|The Kingdom of Bahrain (173rd) plunged 29 places to become one of the world's 10 most repressive countries. Bahraini and foreign journalists were systematically hounded from February onwards. An entire arsenal of measures were taken to prevent information circulating about the evolving situation in the country. At the same time, the authorities made extensive use of the media to put out pro-government propaganda. The creation of an independent commission of enquiry did not end the abuses against journalists. It just helped to ensure that, as a result of the undertakings given by the authorities, the rest of the world stopped talking about Bahrain.&lt;ref name="PFI 2011-2012"&gt;{{cite report |title=Press Freedom Index 2011–2012 |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |url=http://en.rsf.org/IMG/CLASSEMENT_2012/C_GENERAL_ANG.pdf |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over the phone, opposition activist [[Mohammed al-Maskati]] alleged that pro-government media falsely claimed that Shia clerical leaders were behind the mass demonstrations over the last month.&lt;ref name="Cockburn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockburn|first=Patrick|title=The footage that reveals the brutal truth about Bahrain's crackdown|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-footage-that-reveals-the-brutal-truth-about-bahrains-crackdown-2245364.html|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat pro-government media bias citizen reporters became an active part of the protest movement.

YouTube footage shows unarmed protesters getting shot. The uploader of one of the videos commented that the individual who had been shot was refused medical treatment at the hospital. Another video shows him receiving medical treatment in a local home.&lt;ref name="Cockburn"/&gt; The Bahrain government attempted to block information from citizen reporters and sites used by protesters. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said that Bahraini authorities were blocking a Facebook group being used for planned protests on 14 February, and that its own website had been blocked for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blocking a Facebook Group that Calls People to go Down the Streets and Demonstrate against the Authority's Policy |url=http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/3721 |work=Bahrain Centre for Human Rights |accessdate=21 February 2012 |date=6 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wNUbTPmx?url=http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/3721 |archivedate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula One race coverage===
Media coverage surrounding the [[Formula One]] race, held 22 April 2012, once again raised the issue of media coverage and press freedom in Bahrain. It was impossible for international news organizations to cover the race without also covering the many protests arranged by democratic advocates in an effort to expose their fight to the world. The increasingly western media coverage of the race had more criticism of the Bahraini regime in the previous periods of the uprising.

Reuters had an article stating that the race would continue as planned, despite the protests and violence, but also highlighted the cancellation of the race in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Hamad|title=Formula 1 says Bahrain race to go ahead despite tension|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/13/us-bahrain-race-idUSBRE83C0SE20120413|accessdate=4 May 2012|agency=Reuters|date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CNN opinion article touted the race as an insult to democratic reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Maran|title=Bahrain's Formula 1 is an insult to country's democratic reformers|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-20/opinion/opinion_bahrain-f1-hunger-strike_1_abdulhadi-al-khawaja-bahraini-government-bahrain-s-formula?_s=PM:OPINION|accessdate=4 May 2012|publisher=CNN|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; British newspaper, The Guardian, ran an editorial criticizing Formula One managers for continuing with the race with the current conditions in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial|title=Bahrain Grand Prix: Formula One demeans itself with this event|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/15/editorial-boycott-bahrain-grand-prix|accessdate=4 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 April 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahrain government denounced news coverage of the protests, saying they were isolated incidents. The government also barred some foreign journalists who had been sent to cover the race, possibly fearing they would report on the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mekhennet|first=Souad|title=Bahrain's Formula One Gala Not going as Planned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/world/middleeast/bahrain-protests-intensify-before-formula-1-race.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=4 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many international media had to work without press accreditation visas. Reporters Without Borders reported that several foreign journalists working for British and Japanese news agencies respectively were briefly arrested and released during the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media freedom flouted during Grand Prix, government PR operation flops|work=Reporters Without Borders|url=http://en.rsf.org/bahrain-government-measures-to-muzzle-20-04-2012,42340.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic responses==

===Executive===
Prior to the outbreak of the larger scale protests and the first domestic crackdown, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa made a series of announcements to appease protesters. The government was to give {{currency|1000|BHD}} to each family,&lt;ref name="AFP_3kdollars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazbahrain" /&gt; which was interpreted by ''Al Jazeera'' as a favour to all Bahraini citizens.&lt;ref name="aljazbahrain" /&gt; The King also offered to increase social spending and to release minors jailed after the August 2010 protests.&lt;ref name="aljazbahrain"/&gt; On 15 February, King Hamad appeared on television and offered condolences for the deaths of two protesters, said that a parliamentary committee to investigate the deaths would be created, and stated that peaceful protests are legal.&lt;ref name="aljaz_protestdeaths" /&gt; The following day the president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, Nabeel Rajab, said that the King's response was not enough to satisfy protesters' demands.&lt;ref name="alj_16Feb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain Protesters Hold Ground |date=16 February 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121635518925202.html |accessdate=15 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wY7a5QCD?url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121635518925202.html |archivedate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the government crackdown with the support of Saudi Arabia, the king said that "An external plot has been fomented for 20 to 30 years until the ground was ripe for subversive designs...I here announce the failure of the fomented plot."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/21/bahrain-protests-king-idUSLDE72K01O20110321 "Bahrain King Says Forces Have Foiled Foreign Plot"].

He said talks would also cover electoral and governmental reforms, as well as looking into claims of corruption and [[sectarianism]].&lt;ref name="AJBahr13Mar"/&gt;

King Hamad took a series of steps aimed at initiating a period of reconciliation following the unrest in February and March 2011. He established the Bahrain national dialogue on 1 July 2011 as a forum for the discussion and promotion of reform. The National Dialogue aims to establish "common principles for the relaunch of the political reform process," according to chairman [[Khalifa Al Dhahrani]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13999741 "Bahrain: Sunni leaders begin talks with Shia groups"].

The King also established the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), chaired by noted human rights lawyer [[M. Cherif Bassiouni]], on 29 June 2011 to investigate the events of February and March 2011 and their consequences. The report was released on 23 November and confirmed the Bahraini government's use of torture and other forms of physical and psychological abuse on detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bici.org.bh/ |title=Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |publisher=BICI |date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized for not disclosing the names of individual perpetrators of abuses and extending accountability only to those who actively carried out human rights violations.&lt;ref name="FP 23 November 2011"/&gt;

===Legislative===
Abdul Jalil Khalil, an Al Wefaq National Islamic Society member of parliament, described the 17 February pre-dawn police raid on the Pearl Roundabout encampment as "real terrorism", stating that "whoever took the decision to attack the protest was aiming to kill."&lt;ref name="aljaz_bahr17Feb" /&gt; Its MP Jassim Hussein said that "I don't think the regime is willing to meet most of our demands.

==United Kingdom role==
In 2011, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] approved the sale of military equipment valued at more than £1m to [[Bahrain]], following the violent crackdown on demonstrators.&lt;ref name="mileqpt"&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/bahrain-military-equipment-uk |title=Bahrain receives military equipment from UK despite violent crackdown |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included licenses for [[Suppressor|gun silencers]], [[Sight (device)|weapons sights]], [[rifle]]s, [[artillery]] and components for [[military]] [[Trainer (aircraft)|training aircraft]]; at least some of the equipment used by [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Al Khalifa regime]] to suppress demonstrations was imported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="mileqpt"/&gt; The [[UK]] subsequently revoked many of its export licenses to [[Bahrain]], amidst [[Public opinion|public pressure]].&lt;ref name="mileqpt"/&gt;

The 2012 status of these licenses has not been substantially documented. The [[United Kingdom]] has close ties with the Bahraini regime; indeed, in late 2012, the United Kingdom signed a defense cooperation agreement with the Bahraini government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/528759 |title=Bahrain and UK Sign Defence Cooperation Agreement |publisher=Bna.bh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=3182&amp;ItemId=1990 |title=Bahrain &amp; UK sign Defense Cooperation Agreement |publisher=Mofa.gov.bh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NI-CO is embedded in Bahrain's internal security apparatus: a victim could be abused by NI-CO trained police, tortured in prison by NI-CO trained guards, and then have their torture allegation investigated and dismissed by the NI-CO trained ombudsman. In 2015–16, the UK Foreign Office awarded NI-CO over £900,000 out of a £2 [[million]] aid package to promote purported [[human rights]] reform in Bahrain, which is a close [[United Kingdom|British]] ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Belfast to Bahrain: the torture trail|journal=Reprieve|date=September 2016|volume=Reprieve's investigation into the work of NI-CO|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BelfastToBahrain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Northern Ireland Assembly – Minutes of Proceedings|date=5 October 2016|page=3|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/economy/minutes-of-proceedings/2016-2017/20161005-minutes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahraini government's decision to establish an independent inquiry to investigate the unrest won praise from many western governments, such as the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=624443882 "Bahrain – Alistair Burt welcomes independent commission Bahrain – Alistair Burt welcomes independent commission"].

In January, Brian Dooley of [[Human Rights First]] and [[Courtney C.

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The '''''Bardo Thodol''''' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}, "Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State") is a text from a larger corpus of teachings, the ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro''{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}}}} revealed by [[Karma Lingpa]] (1326–1386). It is the best-known work of [[Nyingma]] literature,{{sfn|Coleman|2005}} and is known in the West as the '''''Tibetan Book of the Dead'''''.

The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the [[bardo]], the interval between death and the next [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. The text also includes chapters on the [[signs of death]] and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place.

==Etymology==
''Bar do thos grol'' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}) translates as:

* ''bar do'': "[[bardo|intermediate state]]", "transitional state", "in-between state", "[[Liminality|liminal]] state" (which is synonymous with the [[Sanskrit]] ''antarabhāva''). Valdez: "Used loosely, the term "bardo" refers to the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}} Valdez: "[The] concept arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}}
* ''thos grol'': "liberation", which is synonymous with the Sanskrit word ''[[bodhi]]'', "awakening", "understanding",  "enlightenment", and synonymous with the term ''nirvana'', "blowing out", "extinction", "the extinction of illusion".{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=21}}

==Original text==

===Origins and dating===
[[File:Zhi-Khro Bardo Thodol.jpg|thumb|265x265px|Centuries old [[Zhi-khro|Zhi-Khro]] [[mandala]], a part of the Bardo Thodol's collection, a text known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which comprises part of a group of bardo teachings held in the [[Nyingma]] (Tibetan tradition) originated with [[guru]] [[Padmasambhava]] in the [[8th century|8th Century]].]]
According to Tibetan tradition, the ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' was composed in the 8th century by [[Padmasambhava]], written down by his primary student, [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a [[Tibet]]an [[terton]], [[Karma Lingpa]], in the 14th century.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960|p=liv}}{{sfn|Fremantle|Fremantle|Trungpa|2003|p=xi}}{{sfn|Forbes|Henley|2013}}

===''bar do thos grol''===
The Tibetan title is ''bar do thos grol'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}} ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State''.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} It consists of two comparatively long texts:{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata" (''chos nyid bar do'i gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of dharmata (including the bardo of dying); 
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo of Existence" (''strid pa'i bar do ngo sprod gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of existence. 
Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as ''Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo'', ''Great Liberation through Hearing'', or just ''Liberation through Hearing''.{{refn|group=note|In Tibetan, ''bar do thos grol,'' ''thos grol chen mo'', and ''thos grol''}}

It is part of a larger terma cycle, ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}} popularly known as "Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones."{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

The ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation'' is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the ''bar do thos grol'' that are concerned with the bardo-state.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

===Three bardos===
{{main|Bardo}}
The ''Bardo Thodol'' differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: 
# The ''chikhai bardo'' or "bardo of the moment of death", which features the experience of the [[Ösel (yoga)|"clear light of reality"]], or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable;
# The ''chonyid bardo'' or "bardo of the experiencing of reality", which features the experience of [[Dzogchen#Tögal|visions]] of various [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] forms, or the nearest approximations of which one is capable;
# The ''sidpa bardo'' or "bardo of rebirth", which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth, typically [[Yab-Yum|yab-yum]] imagery of men and women passionately entwined.

The ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' also mentions three other bardos:{{refn|group=note|See also [[Trikaya]], [[Kosha]] and [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)]]}}
# "Life", or ordinary waking consciousness; 
# "Dhyana" (meditation); 
# "Dream", the dream state during normal sleep.

Together these "six bardos" form a classification of [[state of consciousness|states of consciousness]] into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of "intermediate state", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.

===Evans-Wentz's ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''===

The ''bar do thos grol'' is known in the west as ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', a title popularized by [[Walter Evans-Wentz]]'s edition,{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} but as such virtually unknown in Tibet.{{sfn|Lopez|2011|p=127}}{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was first published in 1927 by [[Oxford University Press]]. Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]].{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960}}

According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' introduced a number of misunderstandings about [[Dzogchen]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} In fact, Evans-Wentz' collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as "The Tibetan Book of Death." Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=72–73, 78}} Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was "fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist."{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=78}} He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical beliefs]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.&lt;ref&gt;Paul van der Velde&lt;/ref&gt;

C. G. Jung’s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz ed.|1965}} The commentary also appears in the Collected Works.{{sfn|Jung|1977}} Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically.{{sfn|Coward|1985|}} He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung’s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.{{sfn|Coward|1985|p=79-92}}

===''The Psychedelic Experience''===
{{See also|Ego death}}

''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'', published in 1964, is a guide for [[LSD|LSD-trips]], written by [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Richard Alpert]], loosely based on Evan-Wentz's translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} [[Aldous Huxley]] introduced the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Timothy Leary.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert, the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' is 
{{quote|... a key to the innermost recesses of the human mind, and a guide for initiates, and for those who are seeking the spiritual path of liberation.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=11}}}}

They construed the effect of LSD as a "stripping away" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and the stages of psychological "death" and "rebirth" which Leary had identified during his research.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218-219}} 
According to Leary, Metzner and Albert it is:
{{quote|... one of the oldest and most universal practices for the initiate to go through the experience of death before he can be spiritually reborn. Symbolically he must die to his past, and to his old ego, before he can take his place in the new spiritual life into which he has been initiated.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Albert|1964|p=12}}}}

The '''Blue Brain''', a Swiss national brain initiative, aims to create a digital reconstruction of the brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] mammalian brain circuitry. The mission of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'' (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to use biologically-detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mammalian brain ([[brain simulation]]) to identify the fundamental principles of brain structure and function in health and disease.

The project is headed by the founding director [[Henry Markram]], who also launched the European [[Human Brain Project]], and co-directed by [[Felix Schürmann]] and [[Sean Hill (scientist)|Sean Hill]]. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s,&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan.

There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories.

==Goal==

===Neocortical column modelling===
The initial goal of the project, completed in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the simulation of a rat [[cortical column|neocortical column]], which is considered by some researchers to be the smallest functional unit of the [[neocortex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1569491 | pmid=15937015 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1623 | volume=360 | title=The cortical column: a structure without a function | date=April 2005 | journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. | pages=837–62 | last1 = Horton | first1 = JC | last2 = Adams | first2 = DL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author: Rakic, P.  | Journal: National Academy of Sciences |105[34] | pp: 12099-12100 |  web: http://www.pnas.org/content/105/34/12099.full&lt;/ref&gt; (the part of the brain thought to be responsible for higher functions such as conscious thought). In humans, each column is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm in length, has a diameter of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and contains about 60,000 [[neuron]]s; [[Brown Rat|rat]] neocortical columns are very similar in structure but contain only 10,000 neurons (and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[synapse]]s). Between 1995 and 2005, Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column.

==Progress==
In November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|title=News and Media information|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919051656/http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|archivedate=2008-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project reported the end of the first phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column.

By 2005, the first single cellular model was completed. The first artificial cellular neocortical column of 10,000 cells was built by 2008. By July 2011, a cellular mesocircuit of 100 neocortical columns with a million cells in total was built. A cellular rat brain is planned{{update after|2015|7|31}} for 2014 with 100 mesocircuits totalling a hundred million cells. Finally a cellular human brain is predicted possible by 2023 equivalent to 1000 rat brains with a total of a hundred billion cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/henry-markram-simulating-the-brain-next-decisive-years|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years, video [3/3] 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn_gEoQ8nQI#!|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years - 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the column is finished, the project is currently busying itself with the publishing of initial results in scientific literature, and pursuing two separate goals:
# construction of a simulation on the ''molecular level'',&lt;ref name="Brainsim"/&gt; which is desirable since it allows studying the effects of [[gene expression]];
# simplification of the column simulation to allow for parallel simulation of large numbers of connected columns, with the ultimate goal of simulating a whole neocortex (which in humans consists of about 1 million cortical columns).

In 2015, scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) developed a quantitative model of the previously unknown relationship between the glial cell astrocytes and neurons.  This model describes the energy management of the brain through the function of the neuro-glial vascular unit (NGV).  The additional layer of neuron-glial cells is being added to Blue Brain Project models to improve functionality of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Multi-timescale Modeling of Activity-Dependent Metabolic Coupling in the Neuron-Glia-Vasculature Ensemble.

Recently,Blue Brain Project releases first-ever digital 3D brain cell atlas:- The Blue Brain Cell Atlas is like 'going from hand-drawn maps to Google Earth' -- providing previously unavailable information on major cell types, numbers and positions in all 737 brain regions. This comprehensive, interactive and dynamic online resource allows anyone to visualize every region in the mouse brain, cell-by-cell and in 3D, and freely download data for new analyses and modelling. It can also be continuously be updated with new findings.&lt;ref&gt;Science-Daily https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128082718.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The project is funded primarily by the [[Swiss]] government and the [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] (FET) Flagship grant from the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/billion-euro-brain-simulation-and-graphene-projects-win-european-funds-1.12291|title=Billion-euro brain simulation and graphene projects win European funds|work=Nature, January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondarily by grants and some donations from private individuals. The [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] bought the Blue Gene computer at a reduced cost because at that stage it was still a prototype and IBM was interested in exploring how different applications would perform on the machine. BBP was viewed a validation of the Blue Gene supercomputer concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology-report.com/2009/01/blue-brain-project-ibm-has-not-withdrawn-support/|title=Blue Brain Project - IBM has not withdrawn support|work=Henry Markram, Project Director as quoted by IBM Switzerland to Technology Report on January 19, 2009| accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary===

A 10-part documentary is being made by film director Noah Hutton, with each installment detailing the year-long workings of the project at the EPFL. Having started filming in 2009, the documentary is planned to be released in 2020, after the years of filming and editing have finished. Regular contributions from Henry Markram and the rest of the team provide an insight into the Blue Brain Project, while similar research tasks across the world are touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrainfilm.com/bb/|title= Blue Brain Film Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DNA damage theory of aging''' proposes that [[aging]] is a consequence of unrepaired accumulation of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damages]]. Damage in this context is a DNA alteration that has an abnormal structure. Although both [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] and [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] DNA damage can contribute to aging, nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis. Nuclear DNA damage can contribute to aging either indirectly (by increasing [[apoptosis]] or [[Hayflick limit|cellular senescence]]) or directly (by increasing cell dysfunction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging | journal=Rejuvenation Research | volume=12 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=199–208 | url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitas&gt;{{cite journal | author=Freitas AA, de Magalhães JP | title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing | journal= [[Mutation Research (journal)|Mutation Research]] | volume=728 | issue=1–2 | year=2011 | pages=12–22 | doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001 | id= | pmid=21600302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18055498 "&gt;{{cite journal | author=Burhans WC1, Weinberger M  | title=DNA replication stress, genome instability and aging | journal= [[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume=35 | issue=22 | year=2007 | pages=7545–7556 | url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/22/7545.long | doi=10.1093/nar/gkm1059 | pmc=2190710 | pmid=18055498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several review articles have shown that deficient DNA repair, allowing greater accumulation of DNA damages, causes premature aging; and that increased DNA repair facilitates greater longevity.  Mouse models of nucleotide-excision–repair syndromes reveal a striking correlation between the degree to which specific DNA repair pathways are compromised and the severity of accelerated aging, strongly suggesting a causal relationship.&lt;ref name="pmid19812404"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoeijmakers JH |title=DNA damage, aging, and cancer |journal=N.

Overall, they concluded that while the complexity of responses to DNA damage remains only partly understood, the idea that DNA damage accumulation with age is the primary cause of aging remains an intuitive and powerful one.&lt;ref name=Freitas /&gt;

In humans and other mammals, DNA damage occurs frequently and [[DNA repair]] processes have evolved to compensate.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In estimates made for mice, DNA lesions occur on average 25 to 115 times per minute in each [[Cell (biology)|cell]], or about 36,000 to 160,000 per cell per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vilenchik | first1 = MM | last2 = Knudson | first2 = AG | date = May 2000 | title = Inverse radiation dose-rate effects on somatic and germ-line mutations and DNA damage rates | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 97 | issue = 10| pages = 5381–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.090099497 | pmid = 10792040 | pmc=25837| bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.5381V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some DNA damage may remain in any cell despite the action of repair processes. The accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage is more prevalent in certain types of cells, particularly in non-replicating or slowly replicating cells, such as cells in the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscle.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==DNA damage and mutation==

{{further|DNA repair|DNA damage (naturally occurring)|Mutation}}
To understand the DNA damage theory of aging it is important to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|Damage]] and [[mutation]] are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, [[8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine]] residues and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.

In contrast to DNA damage, a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce. Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often cause errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair and these errors are a major source of mutation.

Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation, it can be seen that DNA damages are a special problem in [[G0 phase|non-dividing or slowly dividing cells]], where unrepaired damages will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly [[Cell division|dividing cells]], unrepaired DNA damages that do not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell’s survival. Thus, in a population of cells comprising a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to [[cancer]]. Thus DNA damages in frequently dividing cells, because they give rise to mutations, are a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]] in [[G0 phase|infrequently dividing cells]] are likely a prominent cause of aging.

The first person to suggest that DNA damage, as distinct from mutation, is the primary cause of aging was Alexander in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4860956 | volume=21 | title=The role of DNA lesions in the processes leading to aging in mice. | year=1967 | pages=29–50 | journal=Symp Soc Exp Biol | last1 = Alexander | first1 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1980s there was significant experimental support for this idea in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gensler | first1 = HL | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = H | date = Sep 1981 | title = DNA damage as the primary cause of aging | url = | journal = Q Rev Biol | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 279–303 | doi = 10.1086/412317 | pmid = 7031747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1990s experimental support for this idea was substantial, and furthermore it had become increasingly evident that oxidative DNA damage, in particular, is a major cause of aging.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H.

In a series of articles from 1970 to 1977, PV Narasimh Acharya, Phd. (1924–1993) theorized and presented evidence that cells undergo "irreparable DNA damage," whereby DNA crosslinks occur when both normal cellular repair processes fail and cellular apoptosis does not occur.  Specifically, Acharya noted that double-strand breaks and a "cross-linkage joining both strands at the same point is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair.  The cell will die in the next mitosis or in some rare instances, mutate."&lt;ref name="pmid5055816"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Acharya PV |title=The isolation and partial characterization of age-correlated oligo-deoxyribo-ribonucleotides with covalently linked aspartyl-glutamyl polypeptides |journal=Johns Hopkins Med.

== Age-associated accumulation of DNA damage and decline in gene expression ==
{{further|DNA damage (naturally occurring)}}
In tissues composed of non- or infrequently replicating cells, DNA damage can accumulate with age and lead either to loss of cells, or, in surviving cells, loss of gene expression.

=== Brain ===
{{further|Aging brain}}
The adult brain is composed in large part of terminally differentiated non-dividing neurons. Many of the conspicuous features of aging reflect a decline in neuronal function. Accumulation of DNA damage with age in the mammalian brain has been reported during the period 1971 to 2008 in at least 29 studies.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2008&gt;Bernstein H, Payne CM, Bernstein C, Garewal H, Dvorak K (2008).

Increasing DNA damage with age has been reported in the brains of the mouse, rat, gerbil, rabbit, dog, and human.

This led to the identification of a set of genes whose expression was altered after age 40.  These genes play central roles in synaptic plasticity, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function. In the brain, promoters of genes with reduced expression have markedly increased DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Lu /&gt; In cultured human neurons, these gene promoters are selectively damaged by [[Reactive oxygen species|oxidative stress]]. Thus Lu et al.&lt;ref name=Lu /&gt; concluded that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival, initiating a program of brain aging that starts early in adult life.

=== Muscle ===
{{further|Muscle}}
Muscle strength, and stamina for sustained physical effort, decline in function with age in humans and other species. [[Skeletal striated muscle|Skeletal muscle]] is a tissue composed largely of multinucleated myofibers, elements that arise from the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts. Accumulation of DNA damage with age in mammalian muscle has been reported in at least 18 studies since 1971.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2008"/&gt; We will mention here only two of the more recent studies in rodents plus one in humans. Hamilton et al.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = ML | last2 = Van Remmen | first2 = H | last3 = Drake | first3 = JA | last4 = Yang | first4 = H | last5 = Guo | first5 = ZM | last6 = Kewitt | first6 = K | last7 = Walter | first7 = CA | last8 = Richardson | first8 = A | date = Aug 2001 | title = Does oxidative damage to DNA increase with age? | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 18| pages = 10469–74 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.171202698 | pmid = 11517304 | pmc=56984| bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810469H }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG accumulates in heart and skeletal muscle (as well as in brain, kidney and liver) of both mouse and rat with age.

In mice, when catalase expression is increased specifically in mitochondria, oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) in skeletal muscle is decreased and lifespan is increased by about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schriner | first1 = SE | last2 = Linford | first2 = NJ | last3 = Martin | first3 = GM | last4 = Treuting | first4 = P | last5 = Ogburn | first5 = CE | last6 = Emond | first6 = M | last7 = Coskun | first7 = PE | last8 = Ladiges | first8 = W | last9 = Wolf | first9 = N | last10 = Van Remmen | first10 = H | last11 = Wallace | first11 = DC | last12 = Rabinovitch | first12 = PS | date = Jun 2005 | title = Extension of murine life span by overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria | url = | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5730| pages = 1909–11 | doi = 10.1126/science.1106653 | pmid = 15879174 | bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1909S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linford | first1 = NJ | last2 = Schriner | first2 = SE | last3 = Rabinovitch | first3 = PS | date = Mar 2006 | title = Oxidative damage and aging: spotlight on mitochondria | url = | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 66 | issue = 5| pages = 2497–9 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3163 | pmid = 16510562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that mitochondria are a significant source of the oxidative damages contributing to aging.

Protein synthesis and protein degradation decline with age in skeletal and heart muscle, as would be expected, since DNA damage blocks gene transcription. In a recent study Piec et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Piec | first1 = I | last2 = Listrat | first2 = A | last3 = Alliot | first3 = J | last4 = Chambon | first4 = C | last5 = Taylor | first5 = RG | last6 = Bechet | first6 = D | date = Jul 2005 | title = Differential proteome analysis of aging in rat skeletal muscle | url = | journal = FASEB J | volume = 19 | issue = 9| pages = 1143–5 | doi = 10.1096/fj.04-3084fje | pmid = 15831715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found numerous changes in protein expression in rat skeletal muscle with age, including lower levels of several proteins related to myosin and actin. Force is generated in striated muscle by the interactions between myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments.

=== Liver ===
{{further|Liver}}
Liver hepatocytes do not ordinarily divide and appear to be terminally differentiated, but they retain the ability to proliferate when injured. With age, the mass of the liver decreases, blood flow is reduced, metabolism is impaired, and alterations in microcirculation occur. At least 21 studies have reported an increase in DNA damage with age in liver.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2008 /&gt; For instance, Helbock et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9419368 | pmc=18204 | volume=95 | issue=1 | title=DNA oxidation matters: the HPLC-electrochemical detection assay of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-guanine | date=January 1998 | pages=288–93 | journal=Proc.

=== Kidney ===
{{further|Kidney}}
In kidney, changes with age include reduction in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, and impairment in the ability to concentrate urine and to conserve sodium and water. DNA damages, particularly oxidative DNA damages, increase with age (at least 8 studies).&lt;ref name=Bernstein2008 /&gt; For instance Hashimoto et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17785942 | volume=32 | issue=3 | title=DNA damage measured by comet assay and 8-OH-dG formation related to blood chemical analyses in aged rats. | date=Aug 2007 | journal=J Toxicol Sci | pages=249–59 | doi=10.2131/jts.32.249 | last1 = Hashimoto | first1 = K | last2 = Takasaki | first2 = W | last3 = Sato | first3 = I | last4 = Tsuda | first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 8-OHdG accumulates in rat kidney DNA with age.

=== Long-lived stem cells ===
{{further|Stem cell|Stem cell theory of aging}}
Tissue-specific stem cells produce differentiated cells through a series of increasingly more committed progenitor intermediates. In hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), the process begins with long-term hematopoietic stem cells that self-renew and also produce progeny cells that upon further replication go through a series of stages leading to differentiated cells without self-renewal capacity. In mice, deficiencies in DNA repair appear to limit the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate and self-renew with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossi | first1 = DJ | last2 = Bryder | first2 = D | last3 = Seita | first3 = J | last4 = Nussenzweig | first4 = A | last5 = Hoeijmakers | first5 = J | last6 = Weissman | first6 = IL | date = Jun 2007 | title = Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145| pages = 725–9 | doi = 10.1038/nature05862 | pmid = 17554309 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..725R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpless and Depinho reviewed evidence that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as stem cells in other tissues, undergo intrinsic aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpless | first1 = NE | last2 = DePinho | first2 = RA | date = Sep 2007 | title = How stem cells age and why this makes us grow old | url = | journal = Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 703–13 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2241 | pmid = 17717515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They speculated that stem cells grow old, in part, as a result of DNA damage. DNA damage may trigger signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that contribute to depletion of stem cell stocks. This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.&lt;ref&gt;Freitas AA1, de Magalhães JP. A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing.

==Mutation theories of aging==
{{further|Evolution of ageing}}
A popular idea, that has failed to gain significant experimental support, is the idea that mutation, as distinct from DNA damage, is the primary cause of aging. As discussed above, mutations tend to arise in frequently replicating cells as a result of errors of DNA synthesis when template DNA is damaged, and can give rise to cancer. However, in mice there is no increase in mutation in the brain with aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dollé | first1 = ME | last2 = Giese | first2 = H | last3 = Hopkins | first3 = CL | last4 = Martus | first4 = HJ | last5 = Hausdorff | first5 = JM | last6 = Vijg | first6 = J | date = Dec 1997 | title = Rapid accumulation of genome rearrangements in liver but not in brain of old mice | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 431–4 | doi = 10.1038/ng1297-431 | pmid = 9398844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10757770 | pmc=1460990 | volume=154 | issue=3 | title=Mutation frequency and specificity with age in liver, bladder and brain of lacI transgenic mice | date=March 2000 | pages=1291–300 | journal=Genetics | last1 = Stuart | first1 = GR | last2 = Oda | first2 = Y | last3 = de Boer | first3 = JG | last4 = Glickman | first4 = BW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = KA | last2 = Halangoda | first2 = A | last3 = Heinmoeller | first3 = PW | last4 = Gonzalez | first4 = K | last5 = Chitaphan | first5 = C | last6 = Longmate | first6 = J | last7 = Scaringe | first7 = WA | last8 = Wang | first8 = JC | last9 = Sommer | first9 = SS | date = Jun 2005 | title = Tissue-specific time courses of spontaneous mutation frequency and deviations in mutation pattern are observed in middle to late adulthood in Big Blue mice | url = | journal = Environ Mol Mutagen | volume = 45 | issue = 5| pages = 442–54 | doi = 10.1002/em.20119 | pmid = 15690342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mice defective in a gene (Pms2) that ordinarily corrects base mispairs in DNA have about a 100-fold elevated mutation frequency in all tissues, but do not appear to age more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9096356 | volume=94 | issue=7 | title=Elevated levels of mutation in multiple tissues of mice deficient in the DNA mismatch repair gene Pms2. | date=Apr 1997 | pages=3122–7 | doi=10.1073/pnas.94.7.3122 | pmc=20332 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | last1 = Narayanan | first1 = L | last2 = Fritzell | first2 = JA | last3 = Baker | first3 = SM | last4 = Liskay | first4 = RM | last5 = Glazer | first5 = PM| bibcode=1997PNAS...94.3122N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, mice defective in one particular DNA repair pathway show clear premature aging, but do not have elevated mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dollé | first1 = ME | last2 = Busuttil | first2 = RA | last3 = Garcia | first3 = AM | last4 = Wijnhoven | first4 = S | last5 = van Drunen | first5 = E | last6 = Niedernhofer | first6 = LJ | last7 = van der Horst | first7 = G | last8 = Hoeijmakers | first8 = JH | last9 = van Steeg | first9 = H | last10 = Vijg | first10 = J | date = Apr 2006 | title = Increased genomic instability is not a prerequisite for shortened lifespan in DNA repair deficient mice | url = | journal = Mutat.

One variation of the idea that mutation is the basis of aging, that has received much attention, is that mutations specifically in mitochondrial DNA are the cause of aging. Several studies have shown that mutations accumulate in mitochondrial DNA in infrequently replicating cells with age. DNA polymerase gamma is the enzyme that replicates mitochondrial DNA. A mouse mutant with a defect in this DNA polymerase is only able to replicate its mitochondrial DNA inaccurately, so that it sustains a 500-fold higher mutation burden than normal mice. These mice showed no clear features of rapidly accelerated aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vermulst | first1 = M | last2 = Bielas | first2 = JH | last3 = Kujoth | first3 = GC | last4 = Ladiges | first4 = WC | last5 = Rabinovitch | first5 = PS | last6 = Prolla | first6 = TA | last7 = Loeb | first7 = LA | date = Apr 2007 | title = Mitochondrial point mutations do not limit the natural lifespan of mice | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 540–3 | doi = 10.1038/ng1988 | pmid = 17334366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the observations discussed in this section indicate that mutations are not the primary cause of aging.

==Dietary restriction==
{{further|Calorie restriction}}
In rodents, caloric restriction slows aging and extends lifespan. At least 4 studies have shown that caloric restriction reduces 8-OHdG damages in various organs of rodents. One of these studies showed that caloric restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and in mouse brain, heart, kidney and liver.&lt;ref name=Hamilton /&gt; More recently, Wolf et al.&lt;ref name=Wolf /&gt; showed that dietary restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Thus reduction of oxidative DNA damage is associated with a slower rate of aging and increased lifespan.

==Inherited defects that cause premature aging==
{{further|DNA repair-deficiency disorder}}
If DNA damage is the underlying cause of aging, it would be expected that humans with inherited defects in the ability to repair DNA damages should age at a faster pace than persons without such a defect. Numerous examples of rare inherited conditions with DNA repair defects are known. Several of these show multiple striking features of premature aging, and others have fewer such features. Perhaps the most striking premature aging conditions are [[Werner syndrome]] (mean lifespan 47 years), [[Huchinson-Gilford Progeria]] (mean lifespan 13 years), and [[Cockayne syndrome]] (mean lifespan 13 years).

Werner syndrome is due to an inherited defect in an enzyme (a helicase and exonuclease) that acts in [[base excision repair]] of DNA (e.g. see Harrigan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrigan | first1 = JA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = DM | last3 = Prasad | first3 = R | last4 = Opresko | first4 = PL | last5 = Beck | first5 = G | last6 = May | first6 = A | last7 = Wilson | first7 = SH | last8 = Bohr | first8 = VA | date = Jan 2006 | title = The Werner syndrome protein operates in base excision repair and cooperates with DNA polymerase beta | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 745–54 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkj475 | pmid = 16449207 | pmc=1356534}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In addition to these three conditions, several other human syndromes, that also have defective DNA repair, show several features of premature aging. These include [[ataxia telangiectasia]], [[Nijmegen breakage syndrome]], some subgroups of [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], [[trichothiodystrophy]], [[Fanconi anemia]], [[Bloom syndrome]] and [[Rothmund-Thomson syndrome]].

Six specific signs of aging were examined, and the three mutant mice were found to display the same aging signs as the control mice, but at a much earlier age.  Cancer incidence was not increased in the mutant mice.  Ku70 and Ku80 form the heterodimer [[Ku (protein)|Ku protein]] essential for the [[non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)]] pathway of DNA repair, active in repairing DNA double-strand breaks.  This suggests an important role of NHEJ in longevity assurance.

==Lifespan in different mammalian species==
{{further|Maximum life span}}
Studies comparing DNA repair capacity in different mammalian species have shown that repair capacity correlates with lifespan. The initial study of this type, by Hart and Setlow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4526202 | volume=71 | issue=6 | title=Correlation between deoxyribonucleic acid excision-repair and life-span in a number of mammalian species. | date=Jun 1974 | pages=2169–73 | doi=10.1073/pnas.71.6.2169 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmc=388412 | last1 = Hart | first1 = RW | last2 = Setlow | first2 = RB| bibcode=1974PNAS...71.2169H }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ability of skin fibroblasts of seven mammalian species to perform DNA repair after exposure to a DNA damaging agent correlated with lifespan of the species. The species studied were shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human. This initial study stimulated many additional studies involving a wide variety of mammalian species, and the correlation between repair capacity and lifespan generally held up. In one of the more recent studies, Burkle et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bürkle | first1 = A | last2 = Brabeck | first2 = C | last3 = Diefenbach | first3 = J | last4 = Beneke | first4 = S | date = May 2005 | title = The emerging role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in longevity | url = | journal = Int J Biochem Cell Biol | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 1043–53 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2004.10.006 | pmid = 15743677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the level of a particular enzyme, [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase]], which is involved in repair of single-strand breaks in DNA. They found that the lifespan of 13 mammalian species correlated with the activity of this enzyme.

The DNA repair [[transcriptome]]s of the liver of humans, [[naked mole-rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]] were compared.&lt;ref name="pmid26729707"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacRae SL, Croken MM, Calder RB, Aliper A, Milholland B, White RR, Zhavoronkov A, Gladyshev VN, Seluanov A, Gorbunova V, Zhang ZD, Vijg J |title=DNA repair in species with extreme lifespan differences |journal=Aging |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=1171–84 |year=2015 |pmid=26729707 |pmc=4712340 |doi=10.18632/aging.100866 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum lifespans of humans, [[naked mole-rat]], and [[mouse]] are respectively ~120, 30 and 3 years.  The longer-lived species, humans and naked mole rats expressed DNA repair genes, including core genes in several DNA repair pathways, at a higher level than did mice.  In addition, several DNA repair pathways in humans and naked mole-rats were up-regulated compared with mouse.  These findings suggest that increased DNA repair facilitates greater longevity.

==Menopause==
{{primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
As women age, they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to [[menopause]].  This decline is tied to a decline in the number of [[ovarian follicle]]s.   Although 6 to 7 million [[oocyte]]s are present at mid-gestation in the human [[ovary]],&lt;ref name=pmid27382229 &gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Hum Reprod Sci. |date=Apr–Jun 2016 |volume=9|issue=2|pages=63–9|doi=10.4103/0974-1208.183514 |title=Poor ovarian reserve |author=Jirge PR |pmid=27382229 |pmc=4915288}}&lt;/ref&gt; only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these [[Ovulation|ovulate]], and the rest are lost.  The decline in [[ovarian reserve]] appears to occur at an increasing rate with age,&lt;ref name="pmid18192670"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen KR, Knowlton NS, Thyer AC, Charleston JS, Soules MR, Klein NA |title=A new model of reproductive aging: the decline in ovarian non-growing follicle number from birth to menopause |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=699–708 |year=2008 |pmid=18192670 |doi=10.1093/humrep/dem408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27382229/&gt; and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 51.  As ovarian reserve and [[fertility]] decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and [[meiosis|meiotic]] errors resulting in [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomally abnormal]] conceptions.

Titus et al.&lt;ref name=Titus&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Titus S, Li F, Stobezki R, Akula K, Unsal E, Jeong K, Dickler M, Robson M, Moy F, Goswami S, Oktay K |title=Impairment of BRCA1-related DNA double-strand break repair leads to ovarian aging in mice and humans |journal=Sci Transl Med |volume=5 |issue=172 |pages=172ra21 |year=2013 |pmid=23408054 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3004925 |pmc=5130338}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed an explanation for the decline in [[ovarian reserve]] with age.  They showed that as women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their [[Folliculogenesis#Phases of development|primordial follicles]].  Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of [[granulosa cell]]s.  An enzyme system is present in oocytes that normally accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks.  This repair system is referred to as [[homologous recombination]]al repair, and it is especially active during [[meiosis]].  Titus et al.&lt;ref name=Titus /&gt; also showed that expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair (''[[BRCA1]]'', ''[[MRE11A|MRE11]]'', ''[[Rad51]]'' and ''[[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]]'') decline in [[oocyte]]s with age.  This age-related decline in ability to repair double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, which then likely contributes to the decline in ovarian reserve.

Women with an inherited mutation in the DNA repair gene ''[[BRCA1]]'' undergo menopause prematurely,&lt;ref name="pmid16773440"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rzepka-Górska I, Tarnowski B, Chudecka-Głaz A, Górski B, Zielińska D, Tołoczko-Grabarek A |title=Premature menopause in patients with BRCA1 gene mutation |journal=Breast Cancer Res.

==Atherosclerosis==
The most important risk factor for cardiovascular problems is chronological [[aging]].  Several research groups have reviewed evidence for a key role of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in vascular aging.&lt;ref name="pmid23953979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu H, Roks AJ |title=Genomic instability and vascular aging: a focus on nucleotide excision repair |journal=Trends Cardiovasc.

Atherosclerotic plaque contains [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells, [[macrophage]]s and [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] and these have been found to accumulate [[8-Oxoguanine|8-oxoG]], a common type of oxidative DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid26174609"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Uryga AK, Bennett MR |title=Ageing induced vascular smooth muscle cell senescence in atherosclerosis |journal=J Physiol |volume=594 |issue=8 |pages=2115–24 |date=15 April 2016 |pmid=26174609 |doi=10.1113/JP270923 |pmc=4933105}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA strand breaks also increased in atherosclerotic plaques, thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation.&lt;ref name="pmid26174609" /&gt;
  
[[Werner syndrome]] (WS), a premature aging condition in humans, is caused by a genetic defect in a [[RecQ helicase]] that is employed in several [[DNA repair]] processes.  WS patients develop a substantial burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their [[Coronary circulation|coronary arteries]] and [[aorta]].&lt;ref name="pmid27213333" /&gt;  These findings link excessive unrepaired DNA damage to premature aging and early atherosclerotic plaque development.

==DNA damage and the epigenetic clock==

Endogenous, [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damages]] are frequent, and in humans include an average of about 10,000 oxidative damages per day and 50 double-strand DNA breaks per cell cycle [see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]].

Several reviews&lt;ref name=Haganreview&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mrrev.2017.09.005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiba&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiba T, Marusawa H, Ushijima T |title=Inflammation-associated cancer development in digestive organs: mechanisms and roles for genetic and epigenetic modulation |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=143 |issue=3 |pages=550–563 |year=2012 |pmid=22796521 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2012.07.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26280003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishida N, Kudo M |title=Alteration of Epigenetic Profile in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Its Clinical Implications |journal=Liver Cancer |volume=3 |issue=3–4 |pages=417–27 |year=2014 |pmid=26280003 |pmc=4531427 |doi=10.1159/000343860 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarize evidence that the methylation enzyme [[DNMT1]] is recruited to sites of oxidative DNA  damage.  Recruitment of DNMT1 leads to DNA methylation at the promoters of genes to inhibit transcription during repair.  In addition, the 2018 review&lt;ref name=Haganreview /&gt; describes recruitment of DNMT1 during repair of DNA double-strand breaks.  DNMT1 localization results in increased DNA methylation near the site of recombinational repair, associated with altered expression of the repaired gene.  In general, repair-associated hyper-methylated promoters are restored to their former methylation level after DNA repair is complete. However, these reviews also indicate that transient recruitment of epigenetic modifiers can occasionally result in subsequent stable epigenetic alterations and gene silencing after DNA repair has been completed.

In [[human]] and [[mouse]] DNA, cytosine followed by guanine (CpG) is the least frequent [[dinucleotide]], making up less than 1% of all dinucleotides (see [[CG suppression]]).  At most CpG sites [[cytosine]] is [[DNA methylation|methylated]] to form [[5-methylcytosine]].  As indicated in the article [[CpG site]], in mammals, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated.  However, in [[vertebrate]]s there are [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG islands]], about 300 to 3,000 base pairs long, with interspersed DNA sequences that deviate significantly from the average genomic pattern by being CpG-rich.  These CpG islands are predominantly nonmethylated.&lt;ref name="pmid21576262"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deaton AM, Bird A |title=CpG islands and the regulation of transcription |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1010–22 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21576262 |pmc=3093116 |doi=10.1101/gad.2037511 |url= |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, about 70% of [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] located near the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start site of a gene (proximal promoters) contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]] (see [[CpG site#CpG islands in promoters|CpG islands in promoters]]).  If the initially nonmethylated CpG sites in a CpG island become largely methylated, this causes stable silencing of the associated gene.

For humans, after adulthood is reached and during subsequent aging, the majority of CpG sequences slowly lose methylation (called epigenetic drift).  However, the CpG islands that control promoters tend to gain methylation with age.&lt;ref name="pmid25913071"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones MJ, Goodman SJ, Kobor MS |title=DNA methylation and healthy human aging |journal=Aging Cell |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=924–32 |date=December 2015 |pmid=25913071 |pmc=4693469 |doi=10.1111/acel.12349 |url= |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gain of methylation at CpG islands in promoter regions is correlated with age, and has been used to create an [[epigenetic clock]] (see article [[Epigenetic clock]]).

There may be some relationship between the epigenetic clock and epigenetic alterations accumulating after DNA repair.  Both unrepaired DNA damage accumulated with age and accumulated methylation of CpG islands would silence genes in which they occur, interfere with protein expression, and contribute to the aging [[phenotype]].

{{Nihongo|'''Destoroyah'''|デストロイア|Desutoroia|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] who first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1995 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Destoroyah]]''.

==Overview==
Destoroyah originated as a colony of microscopic [[Precambrian]] [[crustacean]]s that had been awakened and mutated in [[Tokyo Bay]] when the Oxygen Destroyer was detonated to kill the original Godzilla in 1954. In 1996, the Destoroyahs eventually mature into man-sized creatures which repel a [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]] assault. The Destoroyahs later combine into a flying form which fights [[Godzilla Junior]]. Destoroyah is defeated, but then morphs into an even larger form that dwarfs Godzilla. The creature proceeds to kill Godzilla Junior and faces Godzilla in [[Haneda Airport]], but is finally killed through the combined efforts of Godzilla and army.&lt;ref name="GvD"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Destoroyah]]'' (1995). Directed by [[Takao Okawara]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Heisei Godzilla Perfection - Barubaroi.jpg|thumb|Early "Barubaroi" concept art]]
In conceptualizing [[Godzilla]]'s final adversary, screenwriter [[Kazuki Ōmori]] initially proposed having the current Heisei Godzilla fight Ghost Godzilla, the specter of the original 1954 Godzilla, though this idea was scrapped, as Godzilla had already fought several [[doppelgänger]]s ([[Biollante]], [[Mechagodzilla]] and [[SpaceGodzilla]]). It was however decided to maintain references to the original film by bringing back the Oxygen Destroyer, the weapon that killed the first Godzilla.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=305-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was initially going to be named "Barubaroi", though this was rejected on account of it sounding too similar to [[Berbers|Berber]], and thus could have been considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;東宝特撮映画大全集 ["Toho special effects movie Complete Works"], Village Books, 2012, pp. 248-251. {{ISBN|9784864910132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barubaroi designs were much more squid-like than the finalized Destoroyah look, though they shared Destoroyah's trait of surpassing Godzilla in height.&lt;ref name="kawakita2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=平成ゴジラパーフェク [''Heisei Godzilla Perfection'']|last=Kawakita|first=Koichi |year=2012 |publisher=Dengeki Hobby Books |isbn=4048861190 |pages=|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Destoroyah's forms were designed by Minoru Yoshida, who'd been instructed to make the creature a [[crustacean]]. His design for Destoroyah's final form was given to illustrator [[Noriyoshi Ohrai]], who incorporated it into the movie poster. Ohrai's depiction was later used as the basis for the 3D model used in constructing the creature's suit.&lt;ref name="kawakita"&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/kawakit2.htm "Koichi Kawakita Interview II"], ''Kaiju Conversation'' (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Akira Ifukube]] had initially wanted to give each of Destoroyah's forms their own motif, though he subsequently chose to give them all the same theme. He chose not to use the Oxygen Destroyer theme from the original 1954 film, as he felt that the theme expressed the tragedy of the weapon's creator, and thus was inappropriate for a monster.&lt;ref&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/ifukub3.htm "Akira Ifukube Interview III"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Along with the film receiving positive reviews, Destoroyah is often considered to be one of the best Godzilla villains. Miles Imhoff of [[Toho Kingdom]] called Destoroyah "perhaps the most heartless and cruel of any kaiju to ever exist." He said "the props and suit look amazing, and are really an excellent choice for Godzilla's final Heisei foe. The reddish hues, the jagged features, and the demonic appearance of the many forms of Destoroyah are handled nicely. In fact, its wild and deadly features, coupled with its personality and several stages, can easily be seen as a loose remake of [[Hedorah]]. Destoroyah's many forms are portrayed as vicious, but it is the final form that is shown to be truly cold. The portrayal of its ruthless murder of Junior is a form of cruelty truly unseen since the vicious tooth-and-claw battles of the latter Showa entries, and it is this one act that best sums up the character Destoroyah as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Miles Imhoff, [http://www.tohokingdom.com/reviews/vega/gvsdestoroyah.htm "Review: Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)"], ''Toho Kingdom'' (April 16, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #3 on its "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list,&lt;ref&gt;Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; while [[WatchMojo.com]] listed Destoroyah as #3 on their "Top 10 Godzilla Villains" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zR__HFvn0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Top 10 Godzilla Villains|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=Youtube|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle described Destoroyah as a "laughable" mix of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] and [[SpaceGodzilla]] which "should be placed alongside [[Megalon]] and [[Gigan]] in the back rooms of the Toho monster gallery."&lt;ref name="ryfle1998"/&gt;

The '''Draconians''' are a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] race from the planet Draconia. They were featured in the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Their only television appearance to date was in the 1973 serial ''[[Frontier in Space]]''. Unlike many "monster" races in ''Doctor Who'', the Draconians were articulate and portrayed as having a sophisticated and advanced culture like [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|feudal Japan]]. In later interviews,{{attribution needed|date=June 2018}}{{when|date=June 2018}} actor [[Jon Pertwee]] cited the Draconians as his favourite of all the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|monsters]] he had encountered during his time as the [[Third Doctor]].

== Appearances ==
=== Television ===
In ''[[Frontier in Space]]'' (1973), the sole television appearance of the Draconians, the [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] escalates war between the humans and the Draconians' galactic empires in the 26th century, by using a sonic [[hypnosis]] device to make the human crews see the [[Ogron]] mercenaries as Draconians and the Draconian crews see them as humans. The Master allies himself with the [[Dalek]]s, who launch another bid for galactic conquest and hope to pick up the pieces after the war. The plot is revealed by the time traveller the [[Third Doctor]], and instead of going to war against each other, the two empires unite against the Daleks.

Backstory in the serial mentions that the Doctor had dealt with a space plague 500 years before the serial, causing him to be made a noble of Draconia by the 15th Emperor. 20 years before the serial, the human General Williams is mentioned as having triggered war between humans and Draconians after seeing an unarmed battlecruiser on a peace mission whose communications device wrecked by a neutron storm and was thus unable to respond to Williams. Williams had incorrectly assumed that the battlecruiser was hostile and about to fire on his own damaged ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=Frontier in Space |title-link=Frontier in Space |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |last=Hulke |first=Malcolm (writer) |author-link=Malcolm Hulke |last2=Bernard |first2=Paul (director) |author-link2=Paul Bernard (director) |credits= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |date=24 February – 31 March 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Satan Pit]]" (2006), the [[Tenth Doctor]] says that Draconia, in common with other planets, has myths of a horned beast being the ultimate embodiment of evil.

The Draconians are mentioned in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' serial ''[[Secrets of the Stars]]'' (2008). The Draconians are said to have their own celestial zodiac.

[[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] mentions the Draconians in the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010).

In "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013), the town of Christmas' children surround the [[Eleventh Doctor]] showing him pictures of his countless "victories" on Trenzalore. The Doctor points out one image and responds, "That's me arm-wrestling a Draconian. I remember that."

=== Other appearances ===
In addition to ''Frontier in Space'', the Draconians have appeared in [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, including comics, novels and [[radio drama|audio plays]], in which they were players in the galactic politics surrounding the Earth Empire period of human history.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The Draconians also featured in [[Reeltime Pictures]]' ''[[Mindgame (Doctor Who)|Mindgame]]'' video series, and are a major presence in the [[Bernice Summerfield]] audio adventures and books, including ''[[The Draconian Rage]]''. In 2007, a Draconian ambassador called Kothar became a regular character in the Bernice Summerfield range. He made his first appearance in ''[[The Judas Gift]]''. They meet the [[Sixth Doctor]] in the audio story ''[[Paper Cuts (Doctor Who audio)|Paper Cuts]]''.
[[File:Draconian Mask (14866959967).jpg|thumb|left|A Draconian mask, on display at the National Space Centre]]
The [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel  ''[[Love and War (Doctor Who)|Love and War]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]] mentions that the Draconians call the Doctor "Karshtakavaar", or "The Oncoming Storm".

"Draconian space" is mentioned in the [[New Series Adventures|New Series Adventure]] ''[[The Price of Paradise]]''.

In IDW ''Doctor Who'' comic "Fugitive" the Tenth Doctor meets the Draconian diplomat Kraden, who is on his way to peace talks but was arrested on false charges. He, along with the [[Sontaran]] Stomm and [[Ogron]] Brarshak, helps the Doctor.

In ''[[Prisoner of the Daleks]]'', set during a Dalek War with humanity during the 26th century, it is mentioned that Space Major Jon Bowman is a veteran of the Draconian Wars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33202">In [[ecology]], '''extinction debt''' is the future [[extinction]] of [[species]] due to events in the past. The phrases '''dead clade walking''' and '''survival without recovery''' express the same idea.&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;

Extinction debt occurs because of time delays between impacts on a species, such as destruction of [[habitat]], and the species' ultimate disappearance. For instance, long-lived [[trees]] may survive for many years even after reproduction of new trees has become impossible, and thus they may be committed to extinction.  Technically, extinction debt generally refers to the ''number of species'' in an area likely to become extinct, rather than the prospects of any one species, but [[colloquially]] it refers to any occurrence of delayed extinction.

Extinction debt may be local or global, but most examples are local as these are easier to observe and model. It is most likely to be found in long-lived species and species with very specific habitat requirements (specialists).&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt; Extinction debt has important implications for conservation, as it implies that species may become extinct due to past habitat destruction, even if continued impacts cease, and that current reserves may not be sufficient to maintain the species that occupy them. Interventions such as habitat restoration may reverse extinction debt.

''Immigration credit'' is the corollary to extinction debt. It refers to the number of species likely to immigrate to an area after an event such as the [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration of an ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Jackson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = S.

==Terminology==

Extinction debt is also known by the terms ''dead clade walking'' and ''survival without recovery''&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt; when referring to the species affected. The phrase "dead clade walking" was coined by [[David Jablonski]] as early as 2001&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonski |first1=David |title=Lessons from the past: Evolutionary impacts of mass extinctions |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=2001 |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5393–5398 |doi=10.1073/pnas.101092598 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5393.full/ |pmid=11344284 |pmc=33224}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]'',&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jablonski | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Survival without recovery after mass extinctions | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/12/8139 | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 8139–8144 | doi=10.1073/pnas.102163299 | pmid=12060760 | pmc=123034}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film whose title is based on American [[prison slang]] for a condemned prisoner's last walk to the execution chamber.

In discussions of [[Conservation biology#Threats to biodiversity|threats to biodiversity]], extinction debt is analogous to the "[[climate commitment]]" in [[climate change]], which states that [[inertia]] will cause the earth to continue to warm for centuries even if no more [[greenhouse gasses]] are emitted. Similarly, the [[Holocene extinction|current extinction]] may continue long after [[Human impacts on the environment|human impacts]] on species halt.

== Causes ==
Jablonski recognized at least four patterns in the fossil record following mass extinctions:&lt;ref name=Jablonski2001/&gt;
;(1) survival without recovery: also called “''dead clade walking''” – a group dwindling to extinction or relegation to precarious, minor ecological niches
;(2) continuity with setbacks: patterns disturbed by the extinction event but soon continuing on the previous trajectory
;(3) unbroken continuity: large-scale patterns continuing with little disruption
;(4) unbridled diversification: an increase in diversity and species richness, as in the mammals following the [[end-Cretaceous extinction event]]

Extinction debt is caused by many of the same drivers as [[extinction]]. The most well-known drivers of extinction debt are [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[habitat destruction]].&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuussaari | first1 = M. | last2 = Bommarco | first2 = R. | last3 = Heikkinen | first3 = R.

Under [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions, species may become extinct in one [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patch]], yet continues to survive because it can [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to other patches. However, as other patches have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible due to fragmentation, this "insurance" effect is reduced and the species may ultimately become extinct.

[[Pollution]] may also cause extinction debt by reducing a species' [[birth rate]] or increasing its [[death rate]] so that its population slowly declines.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; Extinction debts may be caused by [[invasive species]]&lt;ref name=Sax2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D.

Extinction debt may also occur due to the loss of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] species. In New Zealand, the local extinction of several species of pollinating birds in 1870 has caused a long-term reduction in the reproduction of the shrub species ''[[Rhabdothamnus solandri]]'', which requires these birds to produce seeds. However, as the plant is slow-growing and long-lived, its populations persist.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = S.

Jablonski found that the extinction rate of marine [[invertebrate]]s was significantly higher in the [[Geologic timescale|stage]] (major subdivision of an [[Geologic timescale|epoch]] &amp;ndash; typically 2&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;million years' duration) following a mass extinction than in the stages preceding the mass extinction. His analysis focused on marine [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s since they constitute the most abundant group of fossils and are therefore the least likely to produce [[sampling error]]s. Jablonski suggested that two possible explanations deserved further study:
* Post-extinction physical environments differed from pre-extinction environments in ways which were disadvantageous to the "dead clades walking".
* [[Ecosystem]]s that developed after recoveries from mass extinctions may have been less favorable for the "dead clades walking".&lt;ref name="Jablonski2002" /&gt;

== Time scale ==
The time to "payoff" of extinction debt can be very long. Islands that lost habitat at the end of the last [[ice age]] 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago still appear to be losing species as a result.&lt;ref name=Diamond1972 /&gt; It has been shown that some [[bryozoa]]ns, a type of microscopic marine organism, became extinct due to the [[volcano|volcanic]] rise of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. This event cut off the flow of nutrients from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean]] 3–4.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. While bryozoan populations dropped severely at this time, extinction of these species took another 1–2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=Jackson2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Dea | first1 = A. | last2 = Jackson | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.0844 | title = Environmental change drove macroevolution in cupuladriid bryozoans | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 276 | issue = 1673 | pages = 3629–34 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19640882| pmc = 2817302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction debts incurred due to human actions have shorter timescales. Local extinction of birds from rainforest fragmentation occurs over years or decades,&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000 /&gt; while plants in fragmented grasslands show debts lasting 50–100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004/&gt; Tree species in fragmented temperate forests have debts lasting 200 years or more.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006 /&gt;

== Theoretical development ==
===Origins in metapopulation models===
Tilman et al. demonstrated that extinction debt could occur using a mathematical [[ecosystem model]]  of species [[metapopulations]]. [[Metapopulations]] are multiple populations of a species that live in separate [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|habitat patches]] or islands but interact via immigration between the patches.  In this model, species persist via a balance between random local extinctions in patches and [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]] of new patches.  Tilman ''et al.'' used this model to predict that species would persist long after they no longer had sufficient habitat to support them. When used to estimate extinction debts of tropical tree species, the model predicted debts lasting 50–400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Tilman1994 /&gt;

One of the assumptions underlying the original extinction debt model was a trade-off between species' [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] ability and colonization ability. That is, a species that competes well against other species, and is more likely to become dominant in an area, is less likely to colonize new habitats due to evolutionary trade-offs. One of the implications of this assumption is that better competitors, which may even be more common than other species, are more likely to become extinct than rarer, less competitive, better dispersing species.  This has been one of the more controversial components of the model, as there is little evidence for this trade-off in many ecosystems, and in many empirical studies dominant competitors were least likely species to become extinct.&lt;ref name=McCarthy1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Lindenmayer | first2 = D.

E. | title = Do Imperfect Trade-Offs Affect the Extinction Debt Phenomenon? | journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 1597–1601| year = 1997 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1597:DITOAT]2.0.CO;2 | issn = 0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development in other models===
Further theoretical work has shown that extinction debt can occur under many different circumstances, driven by different mechanisms and under different model assumptions. The original model predicted extinction debt as a result of habitat destruction in a system of small, isolated habitats such as islands. Later models showed that extinction debt could occur in systems where habitat destruction occurs in small areas within a large area of habitat, as in [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture in forests, and could also occur due to decreased growth of species from pollutants.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loehle | first1 = C. | last2 = Li | first2 = B. L. | title = Habitat Destruction and the Extinction Debt Revisited | doi = 10.2307/2269483 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–789 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2269483 | url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc667129/ | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predicted patterns of extinction debt differ between models, though. For instance, habitat destruction resembling slash-and-burn agriculture is thought to affect rare species rather than poor colonizers. Models that incorporate [[Stochastic process|stochasticity]], or random fluctuation in populations, show extinction debt occurring over different time scales than classic models.&lt;ref name=Etienne2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Etienne | first1 = R. | last2 = Nagelkerke | first2 = C. | title = Non-equilibria in Small Metapopulations: Comparing the Deterministic Levins Model with its Stochastic Counterpart | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3135 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 219 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12425979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, extinction debts have been estimated through the use models derived from [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]]. Neutral theory has very different assumptions than the metapopulation models described above. It predicts that the abundance and distribution of species can be predicted entirely through random processes, without considering the traits of individual species. As extinction debt arises in models under such different assumptions, it is robust to different kinds of models. Models derived from neutral theory have successfully predicted extinction times for a number of bird species, but perform poorly at both very small and very large spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Halley2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Halley | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Iwasa | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011217108 | title = Neutral theory as a predictor of avifaunal extinctions after habitat loss | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 2316–21 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21262797| pmc = 3038702|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.2316H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical model]]s have also shown that extinction debt will last longer if it occurs in response to large habitat impacts (as the system will move farther from equilibrium), and if species are long-lived. Also, species just below their [[extinction threshold]], that is, just below the population level or habitat occupancy levels required sustain their population, will have long-term extinction debts. Finally, extinction debts are predicted to last longer in landscapes with a few large patches of habitat, rather than many small ones.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002 /&gt;

== Detection ==
Extinction debt is difficult to detect and measure. Processes that drive extinction debt are inherently slow and highly variable (noisy), and it is difficult to locate or count the very small populations of near-extinct species. Because of these issues, most measures of extinction debt have a great deal of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009/&gt;

===Experimental evidence===
Due to the logistical and ethical difficulties of inciting extinction debt, there are few studies of extinction debt in controlled experiments. However, experiments [[Microcosm: Model / experimental ecosystem|microcosms]] of [[insects]] living on moss habitats demonstrated that extinction debt occurs after habitat destruction. In these experiments, it took 6–12&amp;nbsp;months for species to die out following the destruction of habitat.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00171.x | title = Community relaxation in fragmented landscapes: the relation between species richness, area and age | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–448 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational methods===
====Long-term observation====
Extinction debts that reach equilibrium in relatively short time scales (years to decades) can be observed via measuring the change in species numbers in the time following an impact on habitat. For instance, in the [[Amazon rainforest]], researchers have measured the rate at which bird species disappear after forest is cut down.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = P. C. | last2 = Strong | first2 = C. | last3 = Naka | first3 = L.

====Comparing the past and present====
Most studies of extinction debt compare species numbers with habitat patterns from the past and habitat patterns in the present. If the present populations of species are more closely related to past habitat patterns than present, extinction debt is a likely explanation. The magnitude of extinction debt (i.e., number of species likely to become extinct) can not be estimated by this method.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

If one has information on species populations from the past in addition to the present, the magnitude of extinction debt can be estimated. One can use the relationship between species and habitat from the past to predict the number of species expected in the present. The difference between this estimate and the actual number of species is the extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;

This method requires the assumption that in the past species and their habitat were in equilibrium, which is often unknown.   Also, a common relationship used to equate habitat and species number is the [[species-area curve]], but as the species-area curve arises from very different mechanisms than those in [[metapopulation]] based models, extinction debts measured in this way may not conform with metapopulation models' predictions.&lt;ref name=Loehle1996 /&gt; The relationship between habitat and species number can also be represented by much more complex models that simulate the behavior of many species independently.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vellend | first1 = M. | last2 = Verheyen | first2 = K. | last3 = Jacquemyn | first3 = H. | last4 = Kolb | first4 = A. | last5 = Van Calster | first5 = H. | last6 = Peterken | first6 = G. | last7 = Hermy | first7 = M. | doi = 10.1890/05-1182 | title = Extinction Debt of Forest Plants Persists for More Than a Century Following Habitat Fragmentation | journal = Ecology | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 542–8 | year = 2006 | pmid =  
16602283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparing impacted and pristine habitats====
If data on past species numbers or habitat are not available, species debt can also be estimated by comparing two different habitats: one which is mostly intact, and another which has had areas cleared and is smaller and more fragmented.  One can then measure the relationship of species with the condition of habitat in the intact habitat, and, assuming this represents equilibrium, use it to predict the number of species in the cleared habitat.  If this prediction is lower than the actual number of species in the cleared habitat, then the difference represents extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt;  This method requires many of the same assumptions as methods comparing the past and present.

=== Examples ===

==== Grasslands ====
Studies of European grasslands show evidence of extinction debt through both comparisons with the past and between present-day systems with different levels of human impacts. The species diversity of [[grasslands]] in [[Sweden]] appears to be a remnant of more connected landscapes present 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=Lindborg2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lindborg | first1 = R. | last2 = Eriksson | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1890/04-0367 | title = Historical Landscape Connectivity Affects Present Plant Species Diversity | journal = Ecology | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 1840 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Alvar|alvar grasslands]] in [[Estonia]] that have lost area since the 1930s, 17–70% of species are estimated to be committed to extinction.&lt;ref name=Helm2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Helm | first1 = A. | last2 = Hanski | first2 = I. | last3 = Partel | first3 = M. | title = Slow response of plant species richness to habitat loss and fragmentation | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00841.x | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 0 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–7 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16958870| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of similar grasslands in [[Belgium]], where similar impacts have occurred, show no evidence of extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Adriaens2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adriaens | first1 = D. | last2 = Honnay | first2 = O. | last3 = Hermy | first3 = M. | title = No evidence of a plant extinction debt in highly fragmented calcareous grasslands in Belgium | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.06.006 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 212 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due to differences in the scale of measurement or the level of specialization of grass species.&lt;ref name=Cousins2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.009 | last1 = Cousins | first1 = S.

==== Forests ====
Forests in [[Vlaams-Brabant]], Belgium, show evidence of extinction debt remaining from [[deforestation]] that occurred between 1775 and 1900. Detailed modeling of species behavior, based on similar forests in [[England]] that did not experience deforestation, showed that long-lived and slow-growing species were more common than equilibrium models would predict, indicating that their presence was due to lingering extinction debt.&lt;ref name=Vellend2006/&gt;

In Sweden, some species of [[lichens]] show an extinction debt in fragments of ancient forest. However, species of lichens that are habitat [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists, rather than specialists]], do not.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berglund | first1 = H. | last2 = Jonsson | first2 = B.

==== Insects ====
Extinction debt has been found among species of [[butterflies]] living in the grasslands on [[Saaremaa]] and [[Muhu]] – islands off the western coast of Estonia.

On the islands of the [[Azores]] [[Archipelago]], more than 95% of native forests have been destroyed in the past 600&amp;nbsp;years.

80–90% of extinction from past [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] has yet to occur, based on modeling based on species-area relationships.

Countries in [[Africa]] are estimated to have, on average, a local extinction debt of 30% for forest-dwelling [[primates]].

The time scale for these extinctions has not been estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowlishaw | first1 = G. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98433.x | title = Predicting the Pattern of Decline of African Primate Diversity: an Extinction Debt from Historical Deforestation | journal = [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–1193 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historical species-area relationships, [[Hungary]] currently has approximately nine more species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]] than are thought to be able to be supported by current nature reserves.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldi | first1 = A. | last2 = Voros | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.baae.2005.09.005 | title = Extinction debt of Hungarian reserves: A historical perspective | journal = Basic and Applied Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 289 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to conservation==
The existence of extinction debt in many different ecosystems has important implications for [[conservation biology|conservation]].   It implies that in the absence of further habitat destruction or other environmental impacts, many species are still likely to become extinct. Protection of existing [[habitats]] may not be sufficient to protect species from extinction.&lt;ref name=Baldi2006/&gt; However, the long time scales of extinction debt may allow for habitat [[restoration ecology|restoration]] in order to prevent extinction,&lt;ref name=Kuussaari2009 /&gt; as occurred in the slowing of extinction in Amazon forest birds above.&lt;ref name=Stouffer2009 /&gt; In another example, it has been found that [[grizzly bears]] in very small reserves in the [[Rocky Mountains]] are likely to become extinct, but this finding allows the modification of reserve networks to better support their populations.&lt;ref name=Carroll2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = C. | last2 = Noss | first2 = R. F. | last3 = Paquet | first3 = P. C. | last4 = Schumaker | first4 = N.

The extinction debt concept may require revision of the value of land for species conservation, as the number of species currently present in a habitat may not be a good measure of the habitat's ability to support species (see [[carrying capacity]]) in the future.&lt;ref name=Berglund2005 /&gt; As extinction debt may last longest near extinction thresholds, it may be hardest to detect the threat of extinction for species that conservation could benefit the most.&lt;ref name=Hanski2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanski | first1 = I. | last2 = Ovaskainen | first2 = O. | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00342.x | title = Extinction Debt at Extinction Threshold | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 666 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic analyses have shown that including extinction in management decision-making process changes decision outcomes, as the decision to destroy habitat changes conservation value in the future as well as the present. It is estimated that in [[Costa Rica]], ongoing extinction debt may cost between $88 million and $467 million.&lt;ref name=Leroux2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leroux | first1 = A.

In function [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], '''fitness approximation''' is a method for decreasing the number of [[fitness function]] evaluations to reach a target solution. It belongs to the general class of [[evolutionary computation]] or [[artificial evolution]] methodologies.

==Approximate models in function optimization==

===Motivation===
In many real-world [[optimization problem]]s including engineering problems, the number of [[fitness function]] evaluations needed to obtain a good solution dominates the [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] cost. In order to obtain efficient optimization algorithms, it is crucial to use prior information gained during the optimization process. Conceptually, a natural approach to utilizing the known prior information is building a model of the fitness function to assist in the selection of candidate solutions for evaluation. A variety of techniques for constructing such a model, often also referred to as surrogates, metamodels or [[approximation]] models – for  computationally expensive optimization problems have been considered.

===Approaches===
Common approaches to constructing approximate models based on learning and interpolation from known fitness values of a small population include:
*[[Degree of a polynomial|low-degree]]
*[[Polynomial]]s and [[regression analysis|regression]] models
*[[Artificial neural networks]] including
**[[Multilayer perceptron]]s
**[[Radial basis function network]]s
**[[Support vector machines]]
Due to the limited number of training samples and high dimensionality encountered in engineering design optimization, constructing a globally valid approximate model remains difficult. As a result, evolutionary algorithms using such approximate fitness functions may converge to [[local optima]]. Therefore, it can be beneficial to selectively use the original [[fitness function]] together with the approximate model.

{{Wiktionary|fitness}}

==Adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation==
{{Notability|date=July 2010}}
'''Adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation (AFFG)''' is a proposed solution to constructing an approximate model of the fitness function in place of traditional computationally expensive large-scale problem analysis like (L-SPA) in the [[Finite element method]] or iterative fitting of a [[Bayesian network]] structure.

In adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation, an adaptive pool of solutions, represented by [[fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] granules, with an exactly computed fitness function result is maintained. If a new individual is sufficiently similar to an existing known fuzzy granule, then that granule’s fitness is used instead as an estimate. Otherwise, that individual is added to the pool as a new fuzzy granule. The pool size as well as each granule’s radius of influence is adaptive and will grow/shrink depending on the utility of each granule and the overall population fitness. To encourage fewer function evaluations, each granule’s radius of influence is initially large and is gradually shrunk in latter stages of evolution. This encourages more exact fitness evaluations when competition is fierce among more similar and converging solutions. Furthermore, to prevent the pool from growing too large, granules that are not used are gradually eliminated.

Actually AFFG mirrors two features of human cognition: (a) granularity (b) similarity analysis. This granulation-based fitness approximation scheme is applied to solve various engineering optimization problems including [[Watermark detection|detecting hidden information]] from a [[Digital watermarking|watermarked signal]] in addition to several structural optimization problems.

'''''Flowers in a Wan-Li Vase''''' is a circa 1620s floral painting by [[Balthasar van der Ast]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q30585921|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q30585921}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q30585921|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Tulips in the Aptekarsky Ogorod 04.JPG|thumb|''Flaming'' variety of tulip in the foreground, today a hardy variety and common enough for public garden planning]]
Balthasar van der Ast was a respected flower painter from [[Middelburg]], active in [[Utrecht]], and considered a member of the ''[[Ambrosius Bosschaert|Bosschaert dynasty]]'' and one of the great flower painters of his time. Little is known about Van der Ast's workshop and whether or not he worked on commission. Even less is known of the early provenance of his paintings. Besides what can be learned from his surviving paintings, archival evidence indicates he was active in Utrecht at the same time as [[Roelant Savery]].

The painting shows flowers of various seasons accompanied by various ''fauna'' in an arranged bouquet on a stone slab, often in an unusual vase, and in this case, a [[Chinese export porcelain]] vessel called a ''Wan-Li vase''. This motief was not his invention and was already quite common among his colleagues, and would remain popular for over a century, with [[Jan van Huysum]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]] still enjoying high prices for their flower bouquets crawling with bugs and reptiles such as this one.

The flaming red and gold tulip at the top is a variety quite common in Dutch gardens today, but is actually suffering from the [[tulip breaking virus]] that gives it that "flaming" striped effect. This painting is symbolic of the popular appreciation of tulips that would reach amazing heights in the so-called [[Tulip Mania]] that was yet to come.

Besides the tulip, the work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa gallica]], [[Anemone hepatica]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Tagetes]], [[Cyclamen]], [[lacerta agilis]], [[Cynthia cardui]], a fly, a dragonfly, and a grasshopper (on the vase).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/70105 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later provenance==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Ukrainian troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of the German Alice Siano who later emigrated to Canada in 1951 (when she married, she became Alice Tittel) with twelve paintings, presumably eight of which were from the Meissen storage depot, and this one appeared on the art market in 1954, where it was purchased by the Dutch art collector [[Sidney J. van den Bergh]] who sold it to a New York collector in 1972. In 1991 it was part of a visiting exhibition "Great Dutch Masters from America" which referred to it as being very similar to the lost Suermondt Museum piece. It has now been purchased back and returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parkstadactueel.nl/2017/06/10/nederlandse-museumdirecteur-haalt-roofkunst-terug-naar-aken/ Dutch museum director retrieves looted art in Aachen], article 10 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The museum had earlier recovered ''[[Flowers in a Glass Vase]]'' by Nicolaes Verendael, which had also been sold by Alice Tittel to a New York collector. About 200 paintings from the museum's collection were stolen in 1945. It is unknown how many are still missing.

A '''gladiator''' ({{lang-la|gladiator}}, "swordsman", from {{lang|la|[[gladius]]}}, "sword") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]] in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.

Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.

The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].

The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.  The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of Mérida]], Spain]]
Early literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16–17}}. Nicolaus cites [[Posidonius]]'s support for a [[Celt]]ic origin and Hermippus' for a [[Mantinea]]n (therefore [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) origin.&lt;/ref&gt; A generation later, [[Livy]] wrote that they were first held in 310 BC by the [[Campania]]ns in celebration of their victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–7}}. Futrell is citing Livy, 9.40.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer [[Isidore of Seville]] derived Latin ''[[wiktionary:lanista#Latin|lanista]]'' (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for "executioner," and the title of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from [[Charun]], [[psychopomp]] of the Etruscan underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted and repeated in most early modern, standard histories of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reappraisal of pictorial evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Campania hosted the earliest known gladiator schools (''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomb [[fresco]]es from the Campanian city of [[Paestum]] (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Paestum was colonized by Rome in 273 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=15, 18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome's [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]], when Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's "cattle market" Forum (''[[Forum Boarium]]'') to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18–19}}. Livy's account (summary 16) places beast-hunts and gladiatorial ''munera'' within this single ''[[wikt:munus|munus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A single, later source describes the gladiator type involved as [[Thraex|Thracian]]. See {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=19}}. Welch is citing Ausanius: Seneca simply says they were "war captives".&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ''munus'' and its [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]] was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for [[Hannibal]] and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. Evidence of "Samnite" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&amp;nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&amp;nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites. (Livy 9.40)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.&lt;/ref&gt; His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as "historicised" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
In 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.46.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, "small" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&amp;nbsp;— that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored "[[barbarian]] combat" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=6–7}}. Wiedemann is citing Valerius Maximus, 2.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private ''munera'' were often included in the state games (''[[ludi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;The games were always referred to in the plural, as ''ludi''. Gladiator schools were also known as ''ludi'' when plural; a single school was ''ludus''&lt;/ref&gt; that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional ''ludi'' had been dedicated to a deity, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ''munera'' could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor's divine or heroic ancestor.&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Lintott|2004|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak===
[[File:Retiarius stabs secutor (color).jpg|thumb|A ''[[retiarius]]'' stabs at a ''[[secutor]]'' with his [[trident]] in this mosaic from the villa at [[Nennig]], Germany, c. 2nd–3rd century AD.]]
Gladiator games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there. A politically ambitious ''[[privatus]]'' (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father's ''munus'' to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the [[plebeian]]s and their [[tribune]]s, whose votes might be won with the mere promise of an exceptionally good show.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|pp=32, 109–111}}. Approximately 12% of Rome's adult male population could actually vote; but these were the wealthiest and most influential among ordinary citizens, well worth cultivation by any politician.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulla]], during his term as [[praetor]], showed his usual acumen in breaking his own [[sumptuary]] laws to give the most lavish ''munus'' yet seen in Rome, on occasion of his wife's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; such as Caesar's Capua-based gladiators, brought to Rome as a private army to impress and overawe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=24}}. Gladiator gangs were used by Caesar and others to overawe and "persuade".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=61}}. Gladiators could be enrolled to serve noble households; some household slaves may have been raised and trained for this.&lt;/ref&gt; In 65 BC, newly elected [[curule aedile]] [[Julius Caesar]] held games that he justified as ''munus'' to his father, who had been dead for 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used 320 gladiator pairs in silvered armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}. For more details see Plutarch's ''Julius Caesar'', 5.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent [[Spartacus]] revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287}}. See also Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 33.16.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=280, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had staged a ''munus'' as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between ''munus'' and ''ludi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiatorial games, usually linked with beast shows, spread throughout the Republic and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Greece was keen to upstage his Roman allies, but gladiators were becoming increasingly expensive, and to save costs, all his were local volunteers.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-corruption laws of 65 and 63 BC attempted but failed to curb the political usefulness of the games to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=280}}. Kyle is citing Cicero's ''Lex Tullia Ambitu''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Caesar's assassination and the [[Roman Civil War]], [[Augustus]] assumed Imperial authority over the games, including ''munera'', and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on ''munera'', claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer, and restricted their performance to the festivals of [[Saturnalia]] and [[Quinquatria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}. Wiedemann is citing Cassius Dio, 54.2.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the ceiling cost for a [[praetor]]'s "economical" official ''munus'' employing a maximum 120 gladiators was to be 25,000 denarii; a "generous" Imperial ''ludi'' might cost no less than 180,000 denarii.&lt;ref&gt;Prices in denarii cited in "Venationes," [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/venationes.html ''Encyclopaedia Romana''].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Empire, the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state-sponsored [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], which furthered public recognition, respect and approval for the Emperor's divine [[numen]], his laws, and his agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=30}}. Augustus's games each involved an average 625 gladiator pairs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"/&gt; Between 108 and 109 AD, [[Trajan]] celebrated his [[Dacia]]n victories using a reported 10,000 gladiators and 11,000 animals over 123 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}. Brown is citing Dio Cassius, 68.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of gladiators and ''munera'' continued to spiral out of control. Legislation of 177 AD by [[Marcus Aurelius]] did little to stop it, and was completely ignored by his son, [[Commodus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The earliest ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]'' took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their ''munerator'' (who made the offering). Later games were held by an ''editor'', either identical with the ''munerator'' or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a ''lanista'' (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of ''editor'' was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by [[Claudius]] required that [[quaestor]]s, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities&amp;nbsp;– in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=440–446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gladiators==
{{Main|List of Roman gladiator types}}
The earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome's enemies of that time: the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]], [[Thraex|Thracian]] and [[List of Roman gladiator types#Gallus|Gaul]]. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]]  and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various "fantasy" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] ("net-man"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from [[Eques (ancient Rome)|horseback]].

The trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&amp;nbsp;– those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit. [[wiktionary:noxius#Latin|"hurtful ones"]]).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Jewish War'', 6.418, 7.37–40; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=93}}. ''noxii'' were the most obnoxious of criminal categories in Roman law.&lt;/ref&gt; The best&amp;nbsp;– the most robust&amp;nbsp;– were sent to Rome. In Rome's military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life. Their training as gladiators would give them opportunity to redeem their honour in the ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=120–125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso]]'' ("With a Turned Thumb"), an 1872 painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]

Two other sources of gladiators, found increasingly during the Principate and the relatively low military activity of the [[Pax Romana]], were slaves condemned to the arena (''damnati''), to gladiator schools or games (''ad ludum gladiatorium'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ludus'' meant both a game and a school&amp;nbsp;— see entries 1 to 2.C, at Lewis and Short ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=lu_dus Perseus Project]).&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for crimes, and the paid volunteers (''[[wiktionary:auctoro#Latin|auctorati]]'') who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately half&amp;nbsp;– and possibly the most capable half&amp;nbsp;– of all gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=124}}. See also Cassius Dio's accusation of entrapment by informers to provide "arena slaves" under Claudius; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. "the best gladiators", Futrell citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian ''munus'' of [[Scipio Africanus]]; but none of those had been paid.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9" /&gt;

For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. [[Mark Antony]] chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=129}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. [[Tiberius]] offered several retired gladiators 100,000 ''sesterces'' each to return to the arena.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-tiberius-rolfe.html 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence "equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs."&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Nero", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-nero-rolfe.html 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
{{main|Gladiatrix}}
From the 60s AD [[female gladiator]]s appear as rare and "exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle".&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153–156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 66 AD, [[Nero]] had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a ''munus'' to impress the King [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]] of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Cassius Dio, 62.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named "Mevia", hunting boars in the arena "with spear in hand and breasts exposed",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Juvenal's ''Saturae'', 1.22–1.23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose ''munus'' includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''munus'' of 89 AD, during [[Domitian]]'s reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as "Amazons".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 67.8.4, Suetonius's ''Domitianus'' 4.2, and Statius's ''Silvae'' 1.8.51–1.8.56: see also Brunet (2014) p.480.&lt;/ref&gt; In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named "Amazon" and "Achillia"; their match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century, an epigraph praises one of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]'s local elite as the first to "arm women" in the history of its games.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18" /&gt; Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. [[Cassius Dio]] takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor [[Titus]] used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156" /&gt;

Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, [[Septimius Severus]] may have attended the [[Antioch]]ene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor [[Commodus]] and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emperors===
[[Caligula]], [[Titus]], [[Hadrian]], [[Lucius Verus]], [[Caracalla]], [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Didius Julianus]] were all said to have performed in the arena, either in public or private, but risks to themselves were minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius]], characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish, fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2006|p=576}}. Fox is citing Pliny.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]] was a fanatical participant at the ''ludi'', and compelled Rome's elite to attend his performances as gladiator, ''[[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]'' or ''[[Venatio|venator]]''. Most of his performances as a gladiator were bloodless affairs, fought with wooden swords; he invariably won. He was said to have restyled Nero's colossal statue in his own image as "[[Hercules]] Reborn", dedicated to himself as "Champion of ''secutores''; only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.htm 73 (Epitome)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have killed 100 lions in one day, almost certainly from an elevated platform surrounding the arena perimeter, which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship. On another occasion, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart, carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbon|Womersley|2000|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As reward for these services, he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html 73 (Epitome)]. Commodus was assassinated and posthumously declared a public enemy but was later deified.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The games==
===Preparations===
Gladiator games were advertised well beforehand, on billboards that gave the reason for the game, its editor, venue, date and the number of paired gladiators (''ordinarii'') to be used. Other highlighted features could include details of ''venationes'', executions, music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators, such as an awning against the sun, water sprinklers, food, drink, sweets and occasionally "door prizes". For enthusiasts and gamblers, a more detailed program (''libellus'') was distributed on the day of the ''munus'', showing the names, types and match records of gladiator pairs, and their order of appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 101, 110}}. Based on fragmentary Pompeian remains and citing of Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 19.23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-handed gladiators were advertised as a rarity; they were trained to fight right-handers, which gave them an advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Kathleen|title=Gladiators: Heroes of the Roman Amphitheatre|work=BBC|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=21 April 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/gladiators_01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night before the ''munus'', the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs; Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic or sacramental "last meal".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Moral Essays'', 1099B (fully cited in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}): "Even among the gladiators, I see those who...find greater pleasure in freeing their slaves, and commending their wives to their friends, than in satisfying their appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; These were probably both family and public events which included even the ''noxii'', sentenced to die in the arena the following day; and the ''damnati'', who would have at least a slender chance of survival. The event may also have been used to drum up more publicity for the imminent game.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=86}}. Gladiatorial banquet on mosaic, El Djem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''ludi'' and ''munus''===
Official ''munera'' of the early Imperial era seem to have followed a standard form (''munus legitimum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A procession (''pompa'') entered the arena, led by [[lictors]] who bore the [[fasces]] that signified the magistrate-''editor'''s power over life and death. They were followed by a small band of trumpeters (''tubicines'') playing a fanfare. Images of the gods were carried in to "witness" the proceedings, followed by a scribe to record the outcome, and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors. The magistrate ''editor'' entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used; the gladiators presumably came in last.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. See ''[[pompa circensis]]'' for the similar procession before games were held in the circus.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The entertainments often began with ''venationes'' (beast hunts) and ''bestiarii'' (beast fighters).&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes beasts were simply exhibited, and left unharmed; see {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next came the ''ludi meridiani'', which were of variable content but usually involved executions of ''noxii'', some of whom were condemned to be subjects of fatal re-enactments, based on Greek or Roman myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators may have been involved in these as executioners, though most of the crowd, and the gladiators themselves, preferred the "dignity" of an even contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=94–95}}. Futrell is citing Seneca's ''On Providence'', 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also comedy fights; some may have been lethal. A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians, dressed as animals named ''Ursus tibicen'' (flute-playing bear) and ''Pullus cornicen'' (horn-blowing chicken), perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by ''[[List of Roman gladiator types|paegniarii]]'' during a "mock" contest of the ''ludi meridiani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wisdom|McBride|2001|p=18}}. Author's drawing.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Paegniarii gladiators (from Nennig mosaic).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A duel, using whip, cudgel and shields, from the Nennig mosaic (Germany)]]

The gladiators may have held informal warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weapons&amp;nbsp;– some ''munera'', however, may have used blunted weapons throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=43, 46–49}}. In the Eastern provinces of the later Empire the state ''archiereis'' combined the roles of ''editor'', Imperial cult priest and ''lanista'', giving ''gladiatoria munera'' in which the use of sharp weapons seems an exceptional honour.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''editor,'' his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (''probatio armorum'') for the scheduled matches.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius encouraged the use of blunted weapons: see Cassius Dio's ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#p51 71.29.4].&lt;/ref&gt; These were the highlight of the day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the ''editor'' could afford. Armatures could be very costly&amp;nbsp;– some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the ''munus'' was the ''editor'''s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=99–100}}; {{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
Lightly armed and armoured fighters, such as the [[retiarius]], would tire less rapidly than their heavily armed opponents; most bouts would have lasted 10 to 15 minutes, or 20 minutes at most.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late Republican ''munera'', between 10 and 13 matches could have been fought on one day; this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313" /&gt;

Spectators preferred to watch highly skilled, well matched ''ordinarii'' with complementary fighting styles; these were the most costly to train and to hire. A general ''[[melee]]'' of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the ''ordinarii'', match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a ''tertiarius'' ("third choice gladiator") by prearrangement; or a "substitute" gladiator (''suppositicius'') who fought at the whim of the ''editor'' as an unadvertised, unexpected "extra".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality,&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 69 – 71; Dunkle is discussing the use of a ''suppositicius'' (a substitute used only at need, probably to prolong a particular scheduled fight) and a ''tertiarius'', citing Petronius for the latter as offering a poor quality bout.&lt;/ref&gt; but the emperor [[Caracalla]] chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one ''supposicitius'', whom he beat, and then another, who killed him.&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 70 – 71&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional ''munus'' by Nero, in which no-one was killed, "not even ''noxii'' (enemies of the state)."&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }} Fagan speculates that Nero was perversely defying the crowd's expectations, or perhaps trying to please a different kind of crowd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained gladiators were expected to observe professional rules of combat. Most matches employed a senior referee (''summa rudis'') and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (''rudes'') to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected;&lt;ref&gt;Though not always: the gladiator Diodorus blames "murderous Fate and the cunning treachery of the ''summa rudis''" for his death, not his own error in not finishing off his opponent when he had the chance: see Robert, Gladiateurs, no. 79 = SgO 11/02/01&lt;/ref&gt; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}; based on mosaics and a Pompeian tomb relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludi and ''munera'' were accompanied by music, played as interludes, or building to a "frenzied crescendo" during combats, perhaps to heighten the suspense during a gladiator's appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts.&lt;ref&gt;The gravestones of several musicians and gladiators mention such modulations; see Fagan, pp. 225 – 226, and footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt; The [[Zliten mosaic]] in Libya (circa 80–100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, ''bestiarii'', or ''venatores'' and prisoners attacked by beasts). Their instruments are a long straight trumpet (''[[Lituus|tubicen]]''), a large curved horn (''[[Cornu (horn)|Cornu]]'') and a [[water organ]] (''hydraulis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar representations (musicians, gladiators and ''bestiari'') are found on a tomb relief in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=15}}. Wiedemann is citing Kraus and von Matt's ''Pompei and Herculaneum'', New York, 1975, Fig. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victory and defeat===
{{See also|Pollice verso}}
A match was won by the gladiator who overcame his opponent, or killed him outright. Victors received the palm branch and an award from the ''editor''. An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned ''ad ludum'' the greatest reward was manumission (emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (''rudis'') from the ''editor''. Martial describes a match between [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]] and [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]], who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, [[Titus]] awarded victory and a ''rudis'' to each.&lt;ref&gt;Martial. ''Liber de Spectaculis'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Flamma was awarded the ''rudis'' four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in [[Sicily]] includes his record: "Flamma, ''[[secutor]]'', lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] by nationality. Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade-in-arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=112}}. Kyle is citing Robert.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gladiator could acknowledge defeat by raising a finger (''ad digitum''), in appeal to the referee to stop the combat and refer to the ''editor'', whose decision would usually rest on the crowd's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest ''munera'', death was considered a righteous penalty for defeat; later, those who fought well might be granted remission at the whim of the crowd or the ''editor''. During the Imperial era, matches advertised as ''sine missione'' (without remission from the sentence of death) suggest that ''missio'' (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become common practice. The contract between ''editor'' and his ''lanista'' could include compensation for unexpected deaths;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this could be "some fifty times higher than the lease price" of the gladiator.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Carter, "Gladiatorial Combat: The Rules of Engagement",
''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 102, No. 2 (Dec. – Jan., 2006/2007), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus' rule, the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, and matches ''sine missione'' were officially banned; an economical, pragmatic development that happened to match popular notions of "natural justice". When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered. In general, gladiators who fought well were likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=144–145}}. Futrell is citing Suetonius's ''Lives'', "Augustus", 45, "Caligula", 30, "Claudius", 34.&lt;/ref&gt; At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. This is evidenced on a roughly inscribed libellus.&lt;/ref&gt; By common custom, the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a standing tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more rarely, perhaps uniquely, one stalemate ended in the killing of one gladiator by the ''editor'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=102}} (The evidence is on a stylised mosaic from Symmachus; the spectators praise the ''editor'' for "doing the right thing").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Carlin A.|date=1989|title=The Scandal of the Arena|jstor=2928482|journal=Representations|issue=27|pages= 27, 28, note 33|doi=10.2307/2928482}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the final decision of death or life belonged to the ''editor'', who signalled his choice with a gesture described by Roman sources as ''[[pollice verso]]'' meaning "with a turned thumb"; a description too imprecise for reconstruction of the gesture or its symbolism. Whether victorious or defeated, a gladiator was bound by oath to accept or implement his editor's decision, "the victor being nothing but the instrument of his [editor's] will."&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"/&gt; Not all ''editors'' chose to go with the crowd, and not all those condemned to death for putting on a poor show chose to submit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once a band of five ''[[retiarius|retiarii]]'' in tunics, matched against the same number of ''[[secutores]]'', yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors. [[Caligula]] bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Caligula", 30.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Death and disposal===
A gladiator who was refused ''missio'' was despatched by his opponent. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17.&lt;/ref&gt; A "good death" redeemed the gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. ''Epistles'', 30.8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca's "vital spot" seems to have meant the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008}}. Marks on the bones of several gladiators suggest a sword thrust into the base of the throat and down towards the heart.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GladiatorFeldflasche.jpg|thumb|A flask depicting the final phase of the fight between a ''[[murmillo]]'' (winning) and a ''[[thraex]]'']]
The body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of [[Libitina]] and removed with dignity to the arena morgue, where the corpse was stripped of armour, and probably had its throat cut to prove that dead was dead. The Christian author [[Tertullian]], commenting on ''ludi meridiani'' in Roman [[Carthage]] during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the "brother of Jove", [[Dis Pater]] (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], tests for life-signs with a heated "wand"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;By Tertullian's time, Mercury was identified with Greek [[Hermes#Epithets of Hermes|Hermes psychopompos]], who led souls into the underworld.  Tertullian describes these events as examples of hollow impiety, in which Rome's false deities are acceptably impersonated by low and murderous persons for the purposes of human sacrifice and evil entertainment. See {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=155–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether these victims were gladiators or ''noxii'' is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossschmidt|Kanz|2006|pp=207–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as ''noxii'', denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or ''familia'' is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=40, 155–168}}. ''Dis Pater'' and Jupiter Latiaris rituals in Tertullian's ''Ad Nationes'', 1.10.47: Tertullian describes the offering of a fallen gladiator's blood to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Latiaris]] by an officiating priest&amp;nbsp;– a travesty of the offering of the blood of martyrs&amp;nbsp;– but places this within a ''munus'' (or a festival) dedicated to Jupiter Latiaris; no such practice is otherwise recorded, and Tertullian may have mistaken or reinterpreted what he saw.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of ''noxii'', and possibly some ''damnati'', were thrown into rivers or dumped unburied;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=14 (including note #74)}}. Kyle contextualises Juvenal's ''panem et circenses''&amp;nbsp;– bread and games as a sop to the politically apathetic plebs (Satires, 4.10) &amp;nbsp;– within an account of the death and ''damnatio'' of [[Sejanus]], whose body was torn to pieces by the crowd and left unburied.&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (''manes'') of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful ''[[lemures|larva'' or ''lemur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", 75. Suetonius has the populace wish the same fate on [[Tiberius]]'s body, a form of ''damnatio'': to be thrown in the Tiber, or left unburied, or "dragged with the hook".&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of ''infamia'' was perpetual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=128–159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remembrance and epitaphs===
Gladiators could subscribe to a union (''collegia''), which ensured their proper burial, and sometimes a pension or compensation for wives and children. Otherwise, the gladiator's ''familia'', which included his ''lanista'', comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator's career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories  —  sometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath  —  defeats, career duration, and age at death. Some include the gladiator's type, in words or direct representation: for example, the memorial of a retiarius at Verona included an engraved trident and sword.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HOPE|first1=VALERIE|title=FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY: THE FUNERARY COMMEMORATION OF ITALIAN GLADIATORS*|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|date=January 2000|volume=44|issue=S73|pages=93–113|doi=10.1111/j.2041-5370.2000.tb01940.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=133, 149–153}}. The single name form on a gladiator memorial usually indicates a slave, two a freedman or discharged ''auctoratus'' and, very rare among gladiators, three (''"[[Roman naming conventions|tria nomina]]"'') a freedman or a full Roman citizen. See also [http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html vroma.org] on Roman names.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wealthy editor might commission artwork to celebrate a particularly successful or memorable show, and include named portraits of winners and losers in action; the Borghese [[Gladiator Mosaic]] is a notable example. According to Cassius Dio, the emperor [[Caracalla]] gave the gladiator Bato a magnificent memorial and State funeral;&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"/&gt; more typical are the simple gladiator tombs of the Eastern Roman Empire, whose brief inscriptions include the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor. Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Hermes. Paitraeites with his cell-mates set this up in memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #12, #24, and #109.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very little evidence survives of the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of "Imperial [[Fortuna]]" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other – including the ''munera''. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them. Having no personal responsibility for his own defeat and death, the losing gladiator remains the better man, worth avenging.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, ''Gladiators, combatants at games'', Oxford Classical Dictionary online, Jul 2015 DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.2845: "This refusal to concede honest defeat in the face of superior skill again speaks to professional pride and a certain braggadocio that is still operative today in combat sports."[http://classics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2845] (accessed April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, Victor, left-handed, lie here, but my homeland was in Thessalonica. Doom killed me, not the liar Pinnas. No longer let him boast. I had a fellow gladiator, Polyneikes, who killed Pinnas and avenged me. Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Life expectancy===
A gladiator might expect to fight in two or three munera annually, and an unknown number would have died in their first match. Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"/&gt; George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality "among all who entered the arena" at 19/100.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}. Futrell is citing George Ville.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18–25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Junkelmann|2000|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because ''missio'' was granted less often.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"/&gt; Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|Beard|2005|pp=92–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and training==
The earliest named gladiator school (singular: ''ludus''; plural: ''ludi'') is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua. He was ''lanista'' of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Few other ''lanistae'' are known by name: they headed their ''familia gladiatoria'', and had lawful power over life and death of every family member, including ''servi poenae'', ''auctorati'' and ancillaries. Socially, they were ''infames'', on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 149}}; {{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (''munerarius'' or ''editor'') of good family, high status and independent means;&lt;ref&gt;Ulpian. ''Edict'', Book 6; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=137–138}}. Futrell is citing ''Digest'', 3.1.1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop&amp;nbsp;– if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''Letters,'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Servile War|Spartacus revolt]] had originated in a gladiator school privately owned by [[Lentulus Batiatus]], and had been suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By [[Domitian]]'s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at [[Pergamum]], [[Alexandria]], [[Praeneste]] and Capua.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287, 312}}. This had probably began under Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Rome itself had four; the ''[[Ludus Magnus]]'' (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), ''[[Ludus Dacicus]]'', ''Ludus Gallicus'', and the ''Ludus Matutinus'', which trained ''bestiarii''.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80" /&gt;

In the Imperial era, volunteers required a magistrate's permission to join a school as ''auctorati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. Futrell is citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.133.&lt;/ref&gt; If this was granted, the school's physician assessed their suitability. Their contract (''auctoramentum'') stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (''novicius'') could negotiate with his  ''lanista'' or ''editor'' for the partial or complete payment of his debt. Faced with runaway re-enlistment fees for skilled ''auctorati'', Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12,000 ''[[sesterces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=133}}. See also Tiberius's inducement to re-enlist.&lt;/ref&gt;

All prospective gladiators, whether volunteer or condemned, were bound to service by a sacred oath (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacramentum|sacramentum]]'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Petronius. ''Satyricon'', 117: "He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword."&lt;/ref&gt; Novices (''novicii'') trained under teachers of particular fighting styles, probably retired gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades (singular: ''palus'') in which ''primus palus'' was the highest.&lt;ref&gt;''palus'': named after the training poles, 6 Roman feet high, erected in the training arena.&lt;/ref&gt; Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schools&amp;nbsp;– weighted, blunt wooden versions were probably used. Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed "numbers". An elegant, economical style was preferred. Training included preparation for a stoical, unflinching death. Successful training required intense commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=137}}. Futrell is citing Quintilian's ''Oratorical Institute'', 5.13.54; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=139}}. Futrell is citing Epictetus's ''Discourse'', 3.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those condemned ''ad ludum'' were probably [[Human branding|branded]] or marked with a [[History of tattooing|tattoo]] (''stigma'', plural ''stigmata'') on the face, legs and/or hands. These ''stigmata'' may have been text&amp;nbsp;– slaves were sometimes thus marked on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 AD. Soldiers were routinely marked on the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1987|pp=139–155}}. Facial ''stigmata'' represented extreme social degradation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena. [[Juvenal]] describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status, suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools: "even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule; even in prison they're separate". &lt;!-- In the following sentence, phrases in quote-marks are verbatim from English-language source. Please do not remove or substitute for "fag", unless you're prepared to find and cite another translation of the Juvenal passage from a reliable source  --&gt;''Retiarii'' were kept away from ''damnati'', and "fag targeteers" from "armoured heavies". As most ''ordinarii'' at games were from the same school, this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=142}}. Futrell is citing Juvenal's ''Satire'', 6 [Oxford Fragment 7.13], in the translation of [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]].&lt;/ref&gt; Discipline could be extreme, even lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}. The burning alive of a soldier who refused to become an ''auctoratus'' at a Spanish school in 43 BC is exceptional only because he was a citizen, technically exempt from such compulsion and penalty.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of a Pompeian ''ludus'' site attest to developments in supply, demand and discipline; in its earliest phase, the building could accommodate 15–20 gladiators. Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell, probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet and medical care===
[[File:Gladiadores después del combate, por José Moreno Carbonero.jpg|thumb|''Gladiators after the fight'', [[José Moreno Carbonero]] (1882)]]
Despite the harsh discipline, gladiators represented a substantial investment for their ''lanista'' and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, [[vegetarian]] diet consisted of [[barley]], boiled [[beans]], [[oatmeal]], ash and [[dried fruit]]. Gladiators were sometimes called ''hordearii'' ("eaters of barley)". Romans considered barley inferior to [[wheat]]&amp;nbsp;— a punishment for [[legionaries]] replaced their wheat ration with it&amp;nbsp;— but it was thought to strengthen the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Follain|first=John|title=The dying game: How did the gladiators really live?|work=Times Online|date=15 December 2002|accessdate=24 March 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429085905/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archivedate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of [[Galen]]'s medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long term health prospects of the gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=141–142}}; {{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=41–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and social status==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword." ''The gladiator's oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context of the ''gladiatoria munera''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools (''damnati ad ludum'') was a ''servus poenae'' (slave of the penalty), and was considered to be under sentence of death unless manumitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005}}. Manumission was seldom absolute. Terms of release were negotiated between master and slave; ''Digests'' 28.3.6.5–6 and 48.19.8.11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[rescript]] of Hadrian reminded magistrates that "those sentenced to the sword" (execution) should be despatched immediately "or at least within the year", and those sentenced to the ''ludi'' should not be discharged before five years, or three years if granted [[manumission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=123}}. Futrell is citing Ulpian's 8th book of Proconsular Functions, ''CMRL'', 11.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena; however, citizens found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship, formally enslaved, then sentenced; and slaves, once freed, could be legally reverted to slavery for certain offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arena punishment could be given for banditry, theft and arson, and for treasons such as rebellion, census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|loc=Preface, p. 81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenders seen as particularly obnoxious to the state (''noxii'') received the most humiliating punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, ''noxii'' were being condemned to the beasts (''[[damnati ad bestias]]'') in the arena, with almost no chance of survival, or were made to kill each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=40–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early Imperial era, some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment, culminating in their execution.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius. ''Metamorphoses'', 4.13; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those judged less harshly might be condemned ''ad ludum venatorium'' or ''ad gladiatorium''&amp;nbsp;– combat with animals or gladiators&amp;nbsp;– and armed as thought appropriate. These ''damnati'' at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect, and very rarely, survive to fight another day. Some may even have become "proper" gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=94}}. Survival and "promotion" would have been extremely rare for ''damnati''&amp;nbsp;– and unheard of for ''noxii''&amp;nbsp;– notwithstanding [[Aulus Gellius]]'s moral tale of [[Androcles]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Painting from the Amphitheatre. Hunter with lioness - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Mérida amphitheatre]], Spain; mural of beast hunt, showing a [[Venatio|venator]] (or [[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]) and lioness]]
Among the most admired and skilled ''auctorati'' were those who, having been granted manumission, volunteered to fight in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them. Their legal status – slave or free – is uncertain. Under Roman law, a freed gladiator could not "offer such services [as those of a gladiator] after manumission, because they cannot be performed without endangering [his] life."&lt;ref&gt;D.38.1.38 pr in {{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All contracted volunteers, including those of equestrian and senatorial class, were legally enslaved by their ''auctoratio'' because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All ''arenarii'' (those who appeared in the arena) were "''[[infamia|infames]]'' by reputation", a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship. Payment for such appearances compounded their ''infamia''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. London: John Murray, 1875, "[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Infamia.html Roman Law&amp;nbsp;– Infamia]".&lt;/ref&gt; The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy ''auctorati'' was thus marginal at best. They could not vote, plead in court nor leave a will; and unless they were manumitted, their lives and property belonged to their masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=131}}. Futrell is citing Tertullian's ''De Speculates'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary. Some "unfree" gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children, possibly via a sympathetic owner or ''familia''; some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}. Futrell is citing Plutarch's ''Moral Essays'', 1099B.&lt;/ref&gt; One gladiator was even granted "citizenship" to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=52–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's ''munus'' of 46 BC included at least one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and two volunteers of possible senatorial rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 43.23.4–5; Suetonius, in ''Caesar'' 39.1, adds the two Senators.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus, who enjoyed watching the games, forbade the participation of senators, equestrians and their descendants as fighters or ''arenarii'', but in 11 AD he bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because "the prohibition was no use".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 56.25.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Tiberius]], the Larinum decree&lt;ref&gt;David Potter (trans.), "[http://wSalii|priest of Marsww.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/db/E012.html The Senatus Consultum from Larinium]".&lt;/ref&gt; (19AD) reiterated Augustus' original prohibitions. Thereafter, [[Caligula]] flouted them and [[Claudius]] strengthened them.&lt;ref&gt;Under Caligula, participation by men and women of senatorial rank may have been encouraged, and sometimes enforced; Cassius Dio, 59.10, 13–14 and Tacitus, ''Caligula'', 15.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] and [[Commodus]] ignored them. Even after the adoption of Christianity as Rome's official religion, legislation forbade the involvement of Rome's upper social classes in the games, though not the games themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=153}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio, 62.17.3; see Cassius Dio, 59.10.13–14 and Tacitus's ''Caligula'', 15.32 for Caligula's extraordinary behaviour as ''editor''; ''Valentinian/Theodosius'', 15.9.1; Symacchus, ''Relatio,'' 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Rome's history, some volunteers were prepared to risk loss of status or reputation by appearing in the arena, whether for payment, glory or, as in one recorded case, to revenge an affront to their personal honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=115–116 (Note #102)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one extraordinary episode, an aristocratic descendant of the [[Gracchi]], already infamous for his marriage, as a bride, to a male horn player, appeared in what may have been a non-lethal or farcical match. His motives are unknown, but his voluntary and "shameless" arena appearance combined the "womanly attire" of a lowly ''[[retiarius|retiarius tunicatus]]'', adorned with golden ribbons, with the [[Apex (headdress)|apex]] headdress that marked him out as a [[Salii|priest of Mars]]. In Juvenal's account, he seems to have relished the scandalous self-display, applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=26}}. Barton is citing Juvenal, 8.199ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cerutti |first1=Steven M. |last2=Richardson |first2=L. |title=The Retiarius Tunicatus of Suetonius, Juvenal, and Petronius |journal=The American Journal of Philology |date=1989 |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=589 |doi=10.2307/295282 |jstor=295282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphitheatres==
{{Main|List of Roman amphitheatres}}
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

As ''munera'' grew larger and more popular, open spaces such as the [[Forum Romanum]] were adapted (as the Forum Boarium had been) as venues in Rome and elsewhere, with temporary, elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators; they were popular but not truly public events:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. [[Gaius Gracchus|Caius]] commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Caius Gracchus'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/gracchus.html 12.3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some Roman writers interpret the earliest attempts to provide permanent venues as populist political graft, rightly blocked by the Senate as morally objectionable; too-frequent, excessively "luxurious" ''munera'' would corrode traditional Roman values. The provision of permanent seating was thought a particularly objectionable luxury. See Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', 128; Livy, ''Perochiae'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Towards the end of the Republic, Cicero (''Murena'', 72–3) still describes gladiator shows as ticketed&amp;nbsp;— their political usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs, not the people of Rome ''en masse'' – but in Imperial times, poor citizens in receipt of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|corn dole]] were allocated at least some free seating, possibly by lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others had to pay. [[Ticket resale|Ticket scalpers]] (''Locarii'') sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices. [[Martial]] wrote that "Hermes [a gladiator who always drew the crowds] means riches for the ticket scalpers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=136}}. Futrell is citing Martial's ''Epigrams'', 5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Roman amphitheatre was built at [[Pompeii]] by [[Sulla]]n colonists, around 70 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=197}}. Welch is citing ''CIL'', X.852.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden amphitheatre of [[Gaius Scribonius Curio#Son|Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (built in 53 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Potter and Mattingly are citing Pliny the Elder, 36.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The first part-stone amphitheatre in Rome was inaugurated in 29–30 BC, in time for the triple triumph of Octavian (later Augustus).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}} (see also Pliny's ''Natural History'', 36.113–5). The amphitheatre was commissioned by T. Statilius Taurus. According to Pliny, its three storeys were marble-clad, housed 3,000 bronze statues and seated 80,000 spectators. It was probably wooden-framed in part.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after it burned down in 64 AD, [[Vespasian]] began its replacement, later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium ([[Colosseum]]), which seated 50,000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire. It was [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugurated]] by [[Titus]] in 80 AD as the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the imperial share of booty after the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=151–152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:arlesarena.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arena at [[Arles]], inside view]]
Amphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and ''editor'' could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (''theatralis licentia''). Petitions could be submitted to the ''editor'' (as magistrate) in full view of the community. ''Factiones'' and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre ''munus'' thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", pp. 184–185}}. Even emperors who disliked ''munera'' were thus obliged to attend them.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=37–42, 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres also provided a means of social control. Their seating was "disorderly and indiscriminate" until [[Augustus]] prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Augustus", 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factions and rivals===
[[File:Pompeii - Battle at the Amphitheatre - MAN.jpg|thumb|The Amphitheatre at [[Pompeii]], depicting the riot between the [[Nocera Inferiore|Nucerians]] and the [[Pompeian]]s]]

Popular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are in Martial's ''Epigrams'' 14, 213 and Suetonius's ''Caligula''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Augustan legislation, the Samnite type was renamed ''[[Secutor]]'' ("chaser", or "pursuer"). The secutor was equipped with a long, heavy "large" shield called a ''[[Scutum (shield)|scutum]]''); ''Secutores'', their supporters and any heavyweight ''secutor''-based types such as the [[Murmillo]] were ''[[secutor|secutarii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Also ''scutarii'', ''scutularii'', or ''secutoriani''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter types, such as the [[Thraex]], were equipped with a smaller, lighter shield called a ''[[Parma (shield)|parma]]'', from which they and their supporters were named ''parmularii'' ("small shields"). Titus and Trajan preferred the ''parmularii'' and Domitian the ''secutarii''; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 96, 104, 105"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=96,104–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also local rivalries. At Pompeii's amphitheatre, during Nero's reign, the trading of insults between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]n spectators during public ''ludi'' led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator ''munera'' (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in Pompeian graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii's "victory" over Nuceria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=107–108}}. See also Tacitus's ''Annals'', 14.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Roman life==
===Role in the military===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 45.32–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy. From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. ''[[Devotio]]'' (willingness to sacrifice one’s life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=81}}. It was notably fulfilled and celebrated in the battlefield ''devotio'' of two consular [[:Category:Decii|Decii]]; firstly by [[Publius Decius Mus (340 BC)|the father]] and later by his [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|son]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=19–45}}; Livy, 22.51.5–8, has wounded Romans at Cannae stretch out their necks for the death blow by comrades: ''cf'' Cicero's death in Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC&amp;nbsp;– in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae&amp;nbsp;– had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial ''munera''. In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal's Roman captives: instead, they consulted the [[Sibylline books]], then made drastic preparations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium&amp;nbsp;... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated&amp;nbsp;... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The account notes, uncomfortably, the bloodless human sacrifices performed to help turn the tide of the war in Rome's favour. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman ''munus''. The ''munus'' thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;  By the ''devotio'' of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (''Romanitas''), become the embodiment of true ''virtus'' (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted ''missio'' while remaining a slave.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 107 BC, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at Arausio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=126–128}}. Mattern is citing Tacitus's ''Annals'', 1.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], [[Otho]]'s troops at [[Bedriacum]] included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, [[Vitellius]]'s army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}. Mattern is citing Cassius Dio, 72, 73.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio" /&gt;

===Religion, ethics and sentiment===
Roman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the ''gladiatoria munera''. Even the most complex and sophisticated ''munera'' of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral ''dii manes'' of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of ''sacrificium''. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; [[Cicero]] acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=16}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Letters to Friends'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: "Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" His own death would later emulate this example.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero's admiration: ''Tusculan Disputations'', 2.41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=39}}. Barton is citing Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17 for Cicero's death.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]], publicly and scathingly, as a ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– literally, a "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. "Gladiator" could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and "Samnite" doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. For ''bustuarius'', with reference to Clodius's alleged impious disturbance at the funeral of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], see Cicero's ''In Pisonem'' (Against Piso). See {{harvnb|Bagnani|1956|p=26}}, for the bustuarius as a lower class of gladiator than one employed in the public ''munus''. Cicero's unflattering references to Marcus Antonius as ''gladiator'' are in his 2nd Philippic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silius Italicus]] wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate [[Campania#Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars|Campanians]] had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua."&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus, 11.51 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}. Tacitus, in ''Annals'' 15.44, describes the public repugnance towards Nero's punishment of Christians, which seemed based on his appetite for cruelty, rather than a desire for the public good.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|210px|Detail of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], 4th century AD]]

The ''munus'' itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}. Roman commentators associated ''munera'' with Capua's proverbial luxury and excess.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's 46 BC ''ludi'' were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives and of money that would have been better doled out to his legionary veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 43.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus Aurelius&amp;nbsp;– both professed [[Stoics]]&amp;nbsp;– the degradation of gladiators in the ''munus'' highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having "neither hope nor illusions", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}. Futrell is citing Lucian's ''Toxaris'', 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob's un-Stoical appetite for ''ludi meridiani'': "Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

These accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the ''munus'', but [[Ovid]]'s very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"/&gt; Augustan seating prescriptions placed women&amp;nbsp;– excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolate&amp;nbsp;– as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to. There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high-caste spectators and their heroes of the arena. Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=85}}. This should be considered scandalous and noteworthy, rather than common.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she see in him to make her put up with being called "the gladiator's moll"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal. ''Satires'', 6.102ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eppia&amp;nbsp;– a senator's wife&amp;nbsp;– and her Sergius eloped to Egypt, where he deserted her. Most gladiators would have aimed lower. Two wall ''[[graffiti]]'' in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as "the sigh of the girls" and "the glory of the girls"&amp;nbsp;– which may or may not have been Celadus' own wishful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=146}}. Futrell is citing ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', 4.4342 and 4.4345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Imperial era, Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as Cicero&amp;nbsp;– ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– for gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;Servius. ''Commentary on the "Aeneid" of Vergil'', 10.519.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian used it somewhat differently&amp;nbsp;– all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyes&amp;nbsp;– and expressed the paradox of the ''arenarii'' as a class, from a Christian viewpoint:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them; yes, further, they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation; they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber, rostrum, senate, knighthood, and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions. The perversity of it! They love whom they lower; they despise whom they approve; the art they glorify, the artist they disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}. ''Bustuarius'' is found in Tertullian's ''De Spectaculis'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Roman art and culture===
[[File:Borghese gladiator 1 mosaic dn r2 c2.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], displayed at the [[Galleria Borghese]]. It dates from approximately 320 AD. The Ø symbol (possibly Greek [[theta]], for [[thanatos]]) marks a gladiator killed in combat.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.&lt;ref&gt;Terence. ''Hecyra'', Prologue II.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Images of gladiators could be found throughout the Republic and Empire, among all classes. Walls in the 2nd century BC "Italian [[Agora]]" at [[Delos]] were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the ''munus''. Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples.&lt;ref name="Brown, 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]] displays several gladiator types, and the [[Bignor Roman Villa]] mosaic from [[Roman Britain|Provincial Britain]] shows [[Cupid]]s as gladiators. Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat; similar images of higher quality, were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic, glass or silver.

[[Pliny the Elder]] gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in [[Antium]] and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a [[freedman]] of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at [[Antium]], the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny. ''Natural History'', 30.32 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decline==
The decline of the ''munus'' was a far from straightforward process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crisis of the 3rd century]] imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse, from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered, and lesser magistrates found the obligatory ''munera'' an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office. Still, emperors continued to subsidize the games as a matter of undiminished public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|pp=30, 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century AD, the Christian writer [[Tertullian]] had acknowledged their power over the Christian flock, and was compelled to be blunt: the combats were [[murder]], their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of [[pagan]] human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] deplored the youthful fascination of his friend (and later fellow-convert and [[Bishop]]) [[Alypius of Thagaste]], with the ''munera'' [[spectacle]] as inimical to a Christian life and [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Augustine, ''Confessions'', 6.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice: in 315 [[Constantine the Great]] condemned child-snatchers ''[[ad bestias]]'' in the arena. Ten years later, he banned the gladiator ''munera'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In times in which peace and peace relating to domestic affairs prevail bloody demonstrations displease us. Therefore, we order that there may be no more gladiator combats. Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines. Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'', 9.18.1 and 15.12.1 (see also {{harvnb|Edwards|2007|p=215}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mosaic museum Istanbul 2007 011.jpg|thumb|A 5th-century mosaic in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] depicts two ''venatores'' fighting a tiger.]]
An imperially sanctioned ''munus'' at some time in the 330s suggests that yet again, imperial legislation failed to entirely curb the games, not least when Constantine defied his own [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 365, [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364–375) threatened to fine a [[judge]] who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384 attempted, like most of his predecessors, to limit the expenses of ''munera''.&lt;ref&gt;See Tertullian's ''Apologetics'', 49.4 for Tertullian's condemnation of officials who sought their own "glory" by sponsoring the martyrdom of Christians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=78}}. Compared to "pagan" ''noxii'', Christian deaths in the arena would have been few.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber09.htm 9.40.8 and 15.9.1]; Symacchus. ''Relatio'', 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 393, [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–395) adopted [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] Christianity as the [[state church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] and banned pagan festivals.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', 2.8.19 and 2.8.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ludi'' continued, very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan ''munera''. [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (r. 395–423) legally ended ''munera'' in 399, and again in 404, at least in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. According to [[Theodoret]], the ban was in consequence of [[Saint Telemachus]]' martyrdom by spectators at a ''munus.''&lt;ref&gt;Telemachus had personally stepped in to prevent the ''munus''. See Theoderet's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 5.26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valentinian III]] (r. 425–455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though ''venationes'' continued beyond 536.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'', 3.12.9.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, interest in ''munera'' had waned throughout the Roman world. In the [[Byzantine]] Empire, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical shows]] and [[chariot race]]s continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous Imperial subsidy.
 
It is not known how many ''gladiatoria munera'' were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.&lt;ref&gt;Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222–235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the [[Saturnalia]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn's]] festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reconstructions==
{{further|Roman-era historical reenactment|Combat reenactment|Historical European martial arts#Antiquity}}
Some Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes.  Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general.  These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.

===1940s–1960s peplum films===
Gladiator fights have been depicted in a number of [[peplum (film genre)|peplum films]] (also known as "sword-and-sandal" movies). This is a genre of largely Italian-made historical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. They can be immediately differentiated from the competing Hollywood product by their use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].  The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Inspired by the success of ''Spartacus'', there were a number of Italian peplums that emphasized the gladiatorial arena fights in their plots, with it becoming almost a peplum subgenre in itself;  One group of supermen known as "The Ten Gladiators" appeared in a trilogy, all three films starring [[Dan Vadis]] in the lead role.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">In [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[topology]] known as [[knot theory]], an '''invertible knot''' is a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] that can be [[ambient isotopy|continuously deformed]] to itself, but with its orientation reversed.  A '''non-invertible knot''' is any knot which does not have this property.  The '''invertibility''' of a knot is a [[knot invariant]]. An '''invertible link''' is the [[link (knot theory)|link]] equivalent of an invertible knot.

There are only five knot symmetry types, indicated by [[Chiral_knot|chirality]] and invertibility: fully chiral&lt;!--"chiral noninvertible"--&gt;, reversible&lt;!--"chiral invertible"--&gt;, positively amphichiral noninvertible, negatively amphichiral noninvertible, and fully amphichiral invertible.&lt;ref name="htw"&gt;{{citation

It has long been known that most of the simple knots, such as the [[trefoil knot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are invertible. In 1962 [[Ralph Fox]] conjectured that some knots were non-invertible, but it was not proved that non-invertible knots exist until [[Hale Trotter]] discovered an infinite family of [[pretzel link|pretzel knot]]s that were non-invertible in 1963.&lt;ref name="trotter"&gt;{{citation

==Invertible knots==
[[File:Knot-trefoil-dir-128.png|thumb|90px|The simplest non-trivial invertible knot, the [[trefoil knot]]. Rotating the knot 180 degrees in 3-space about an axis in the plane of the diagram produces the same knot diagram, but with the arrow's direction reversed.]]
All knots with [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] of 7 or less are known to be invertible. No general method is known that can distinguish if a given knot is invertible.&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Invertible Knot|urlname=InvertibleKnot}} Accessed: May 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem can be translated into algebraic terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

If a knot is invertible and [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]], it is fully amphichiral. The simplest knot with this property is the figure eight knot. A chiral knot that is invertible is classified as a reversible knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Strongly invertible knots===
A more abstract way to define an invertible knot is to say there is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the 3-sphere which takes the knot to itself but reverses the orientation along the knot.  By imposing the stronger condition that the homeomorphism also be an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], i.e. have period 2 in the homeomorphism group of the 3-sphere,  we arrive at the definition of a '''strongly invertible''' knot.  All knots with [[tunnel number]] one, such as the [[trefoil knot]] and [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]], are strongly invertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 3527–3532
 | title = There are knots whose tunnel numbers go down under connected sum
 | volume = 123
 | year = 1995}}. See in particular Lemma 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-invertible knots==
[[Image:8 17 Knot.svg|thumb|90px|The non-invertible knot 8&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;, the simplest of the non-invertible knots.]]
The simplest example of a non-invertible knot is the knot 8&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; (Alexander-Briggs notation) or .2.2 ([[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]]). The [[pretzel link|pretzel knot]] 7,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;3 is non-invertible, as are all [[pretzel link|pretzel knot]]s of the form (2''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1),&amp;nbsp;(2''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1),&amp;nbsp;(2''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), where ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are distinct integers, which is the infinite family proven to be non-invertible by Trotter.&lt;ref name="trotter"/&gt;

According to some observers, ISIL emerged from the ideology of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the first [[Ottoman Empire|post-Ottoman]] Islamist group dating back to the late 1920s in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=Ghaffar |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/iraq-crisis-what-does-the-isis-caliphate-mean-for-global-jihadism-9573951.html |title=Iraq crisis: What does the Isis caliphate mean for global jihadism? |date=30 June 2014 |website=Independent |accessdate=6 July 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adheres to global [[Jihadism|jihadist]] principles and follows the hard-line ideology of [[al-Qaeda]] and many other modern-day jihadist groups.{{r|ReutersHolmes_030214|ANS}} However, other sources trace the group's roots to [[Wahabbi movement|Wahhabism]].

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', dissidents in the former ISIL capital of [[Raqqa]] report that "all 12 of the judges who now run its court system ... are Saudis". Saudi practices also followed by the group include the establishment of [[Islamic religious police|religious police]] to root out "vice" and enforce attendance at [[salat]] prayers, the widespread use of capital punishment, and the destruction or re-purposing of any non-Sunni religious buildings.&lt;ref name="economist-behead"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Crime and punishment in Saudi Arabia: The other beheaders |magazine=The Economist |date=20 September 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21618918-possible-reasons-mysterious-surge-executions-other-beheaders |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Haykel]] has described ISIL leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's]] creed as "a kind of untamed Wahhabism".{{r|ISIS_NYT}} Senior Saudi religious leaders have issued statements condemning ISIL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writer |title='ISIS is enemy No. 1 of Islam,' says Saudi grand mufti |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/19/Saudi-mufti-ISIS-is-enemy-No-1-of-Islam-.html |accessdate=5 October 2017 |work=Al Arabiyah News English |date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempting to distance the group from official Saudi religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writer |title=Some Saudi clerics condemn Isil but preach intolerance |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/some-saudi-clerics-condemn-isil-but-preach-intolerance-1.1383191 |accessdate=5 October 2017 |work=Gulf News |agency=Reuters |issue=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL aims to return to the early days of Islam, rejecting all [[Bid'ah|innovations]] in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for deviating from what it calls pure Islam, and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi Arabian government in that category.&lt;ref name=Wahhabism /&gt;

Salafists such as ISIL believe that only a legitimate authority can undertake the leadership of [[jihad]], and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society. For example, ISIL regards the Palestinian Sunni group [[Hamas]] as apostates who have no legitimate authority to lead jihad and see fighting Hamas as the first step toward confrontation by ISIL with Israel.{{r|ISIS_NYT}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mamouri |first1=Ali |title=Why Islamic State has no sympathy for Hamas |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |date=29 July 2014 |work=Al-Monitor |accessdate=1 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801134410/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |archivedate=1 August 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic eschatology ===
{{see also|Islamic eschatology}}

One difference between ISIL and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including [[al-Qaeda]], is the group's emphasis on [[Islamic eschatology|eschatology]] and [[apocalypticism]] – that is, a belief in a final [[Last Judgment#Islam|Day of Judgment]] by God, and specifically, a belief that the arrival of one known as Imam [[Mahdi]] is near. ISIL believes that it will defeat the army of "Rome" at the town of [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]], in fulfilment of prophecy.&lt;ref name="what-isis-really-wants" /&gt; Following its interpretation of the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]], ISIL also believes that after al-Baghdadi there will be only four more legitimate caliphs.&lt;ref name="what-isis-really-wants" /&gt;

The noted scholar of militant Islamism [[Will McCants]] writes:

{{quote|text=References to the End Times fill Islamic State propaganda. It's a big selling point with foreign fighters, who want to travel to the lands where the final battles of the apocalypse will take place. The civil wars raging in those countries today [Iraq and Syria] lend credibility to the prophecies. The Islamic State has stoked the apocalyptic fire. [...] For Bin Laden's generation, the apocalypse wasn't a great recruiting pitch. Governments in the Middle East two decades ago were more stable, and sectarianism was more subdued. It was better to recruit by calling to arms against corruption and tyranny than against the Antichrist. Today, though, the apocalyptic recruiting pitch makes more sense than before. |first=William|last=McCants |source=''The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State |last=McCants |first=William |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-250-08090-5 |location=New York |page=147 |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-ISIS-Apocalypse-Strategy-Doomsday/dp/1250080908}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Goals ===

Since at least 2004, a significant goal of the group has been the foundation of a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref name="Beauchamp14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/isis-goal-theocracy |title=17 things about ISIS and Iraq you need to know |first=Zack |last=Beauchamp |date=2 September 2014 |website=Vox |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dni.gov"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abu Mohammad |title=Letter dated 9 July 2005 |url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/letter_in_english.pdf |accessdate=22 July 2014 |publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence |at=See page 2 onwards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522153638/http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/letter_in_english.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, ISIL has sought to establish itself as a [[caliphate]], an Islamic state led by a group of religious authorities under a supreme leader – the [[caliph]] – who is believed to be the successor to Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Johnson14 /&gt; In June 2014, ISIL published a document in which it claimed to have traced the lineage of its leader al-Baghdadi back to Muhammad,&lt;ref name="Johnson14" /&gt; and upon proclaiming a new caliphate on 29 June, the group appointed al-Baghdadi as its caliph. As caliph, he demands the allegiance of all devout Muslims [[worldwide caliphate|worldwide]], according to Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'').&lt;ref name="aj140707"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/inside-story/articles/2014/7/7/isil-s-leader-emergesfromtheshadowswhoisabubakralbaghdadi.html |title=Who is the U.S. targeting in Iraq air strikes? |date=7 July 2014 |first=Laith |last=Kubba |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has detailed its goals in its ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'' magazine, saying it will continue to seize land and take over the entire Earth until its:

{{quote|text=Blessed flag...covers all eastern and western extents of the Earth, filling the world with the truth and justice of Islam and putting an end to the falsehood and tyranny of jahiliyyah [state of ignorance], even if America and its coalition despise such. |source=5th edition of ''Dabiq'', the Islamic State's English-language magazine&lt;ref name="Joscelyn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=US counterterrorism efforts in Syria: A winning strategy? |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/09/us-counterterrorism-efforts-in-syria-a-winning-strategy.php |work=Long War Journal |date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to German journalist [[Jürgen Todenhöfer]], who spent ten days embedded with ISIL in Mosul, the view he kept hearing was that ISIL wants to "conquer the world", and that all who do not believe in the group's interpretation of the [[Quran]] will be killed.

When the caliphate was proclaimed, ISIL stated: "The legality of all emirates, groups, states and organisations becomes null by the expansion of the khilafah's [caliphate's] authority and arrival of its troops to their areas."&lt;ref name="Johnson14" /&gt; This was a rejection of the political divisions in [[Southwestern Asia]] that were established by the UK and France during [[World War I]] in the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tran |first1=Mark |last2=Weaver |first2=Matthew |date=30 June 2014 |title=Isis announces Islamic caliphate in area straddling Iraq and Syria |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/isis-announces-islamic-caliphate-iraq-syria |work=The Guardian |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGrath |first1=Timothy |title=Watch this English-speaking ISIS fighter explain how a 98-year-old colonial map created today's conflict |url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140702/watch-this-english-speaking-isis-fighter-explain-how-a-98-year-old-colonial-map-created-todays-conflict |accessdate=22 July 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=GlobalPost |date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=54017 |title=The Islamic State: Leaving al-Qaeda Behind |first=Romain |last=Caillet |date=27 December 2013 |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy ===

Documents found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the [[Iraqi Air Force]] before the US invasion who had been described as "the strategic head" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible "the group's later advances into Iraq". Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out "as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were". Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – "the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent". In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, "first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared".&lt;ref name=Reuter-4-18-2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuter |first1=Christoph |date=18 April 2015 |title=The Terror Strategist: Secret Files Reveal the Structure of Islamic State |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html |work=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security and intelligence expert Martin Reardon has described ISIL's purpose as being to psychologically "break" those under its control, "[...] so as to ensure their absolute allegiance through fear and intimidation," while generating, "[...]outright hate and vengeance" among its enemies.&lt;ref name=Reardon-6-7-15&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reardon |first1=Martin |title=ISIL and the management of savagery |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/07/isil-management-savagery-150705060914471.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Burke]], a journalist writing on [[Salafi jihadism]], has written that ISIL's goal is to "terrorize, mobilize [and] polarize".&lt;ref name=Gude-2015-3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Burke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/islamic-state-goes-global-paris-attacks |title=Islamic State 'Goes Global' with Paris Attacks |work=The Observer |date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its efforts to terrorise are intended to intimidate civilian populations and force governments of the target enemy "to make rash decisions that they otherwise would not choose". It aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with, for example, spectacular deadly attacks deep in Western territory (such as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]), to polarise by driving Muslim populations – particularly in the West – away from their governments, thus increasing the appeal of ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate among them, and to: "Eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination".&lt;ref name=Gude-2015-3&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gude |first1=Ken |title=Anti-Muslim Sentiment Is a Serious Threat to American Security |date=November 2015 |publisher=Center for American Progress |page=3 |url=https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25074358/ISISTrap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Harleen |last=Gambhir |url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/INTSUM_Summary_update.pdf |title=ISIS Global Intelligence Summary: January 7 – February 18 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Institute for the Study of War |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Rukmini Maria Callimachi]] also emphasises ISIL's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the "grey zone" between the black (non-Muslims) and white (ISIL).

According to Iraqis, Syrians and analysts who study the group, almost all of ISIL's leaders—including the members of its military and security committees and the majority of its [[emir]]s and princes—are former Iraqi military and intelligence officers, specifically former members of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath]] government who lost their jobs and pensions in the [[de-Ba'athification]] process after that regime was overthrown.&lt;ref name=Saddam&gt;{{cite news |last=Sly |first=Liz |title=How Saddam Hussein's former military officers and spies are controlling Isis |work=Independent |date=5 April 2015 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/how-saddam-husseins-former-military-officers-and-spies-are-controlling-isis-10156610.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liz |last=Sly |date=4 April 2015 |title=The hidden hand behind the Islamic State militants?

{{anchor|Equipment}}

==== Conventional weapons ====

ISIL relies mostly on captured weapons with major sources including [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraqi stockpiles from the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|2003–11 Iraq insurgency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insight into How Insurgents Fought in Iraq |url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/insight-into-how-insurgents-fought-in-iraq/ |date=17 October 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=22 August 2014 |first=John |last=Ismay}}&lt;/ref&gt; and weapons from government and opposition forces fighting in the [[Syrian Civil War]] and during the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–present)|post-US withdrawal Iraqi insurgency]].

The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the [[Shia]]-dominated south. Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200&amp;nbsp;km² of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up. The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Water and Violence Link: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East |url=http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf |publisher=Strategic Foresight |location=Mumbai, India |date=December 2014 |isbn=978-81-88262-24-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Mosul (2016–17)|Battle of Mosul]] it was reported that commercially available quadcopters and drones were being used by ISIL as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms using extemporised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20161012_drone_attacks.html |title=Weaponized Mini-Drones Entering the Fight |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |date=12 October 2016 |website=[[Defense Update]] |access-date=25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISIL drone facility became a target of Royal Air Force strike aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20170117_drones_attacked.html |title=RAF Strikes Daesh Drone Facility in Mosul |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |date=17 January 2017 |website=[[Defense Update]] |access-date=25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-combatant recruits ===

Although ISIL attracts followers from different parts of the world by promoting the image of holy war, not all of its recruits end up in combatant roles. There have been several cases of new recruits expecting to be ''[[mujihadeen|mujahideen]]'' who have returned from Syria disappointed by the everyday jobs that were assigned to them, such as drawing water or cleaning toilets, or by the ban imposed on use of mobile phones during military training sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Tomlinson |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2855780/Indian-IS-recruit-goes-home-having-clean-toilets.html |title='ISIS made me clean the toilets... and my iPod didn't work': How disenchanted Islamic fanatics are returning home because jihad isn't as glamorous as they hoped |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
ISIL publishes material directed at women. Although women are not allowed to take up arms, media groups encourage them to play supportive roles within ISIL, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become "good wives of jihad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-now-targeting-women-with-guides-on-how-to-be-the-ultimate-wives-of-jihad-9830562.html |title=Isis now targeting women with guides on how to be the 'ultimate wives of jihad' |date=31 October 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |location=London |work=Independent |first=Heather |last=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until 2016, women were generally confined to a "women's house" upon arrival which they were unallowed to leave. These houses were often small, dirty and infested with vermin and food supplyt was scarce. There they remained until they either had found a husband, or the husband they had arrived with had completed his training.After being allowed to leave the confinement, women still generally spent most of their days indoors where their lives are devoted to caring for their husbands and the vast majority of women in the conflict area have children. Mothers play an important role passing on ISIS ideology to their children.

In a document entitled ''Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study'' released by the media wing of ISIL's all-female [[Al-Khansaa Brigade|Al-Khanssaa Brigade]], emphasis is given to the paramount importance of marriage and motherhood (as early as nine years old).

====Traditional media====
In November 2006, shortly after the group's rebranding as the "Islamic State of Iraq", it established the Al-Furqan Foundation for Media Production, which produces CDs, DVDs, posters, pamphlets, and web-related propaganda products and official statements.&lt;ref name="LWJMmedia"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Roggio |title=US targets al Qaeda's al Furqan media wing in Iraq |work=Long War Journal |date=28 October 2007 |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/10/us_targets_al_qaedas.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began to expand its media presence in 2013, with the formation of a second media wing, Al-I'tisam Media Foundation, in March&lt;ref name="Bilger 2014 p1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bilger|2014|p=1}}.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jihadologymedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zelin |first=Aaron Y. |title=New statement from the Global Islamic Media Front: Announcement on the Publishing of al-I'tiṣām Media Foundation – A Subsidiary of the Islamic State of Iraq – It Will Be Released Via GIMF |url=http://jihadology.net/2013/03/08/new-statement-from-the-global-islamic-media-front-announcement-on-the-publishing-of-al-iti%E1%B9%A3am-media-foundation-a-subsidiary-of-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-it-will-be-released-via-gimf/ |work=Jihadology |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ajnad Foundation for Media Production, specialising in [[nasheed]]s and audio content, in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zelin |first=Aaron Y. |url=http://jihadology.net/2013/08/20/new-statement-from-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-and-al-sham-announcing-ajnad-foundation-for-media-production/ |title=New statement from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shām: "Announcing Ajnād Foundation For Media Production" |work=Jihadology |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2014, ISIL established the Al Hayat Media Center, which targets Western audiences and produces material in English, German, Russian and French.&lt;ref name="FreeBeaconMedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gertz |first=Bill |title=New Al Qaeda Group Produces Recruitment Material for Americans, Westerners |url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/new-al-qaeda-group-produces-recruitment-material-for-americans-westerners/ |work=The Washington Free Beacon |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEMRIMedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=ISIS Declares Islamic Caliphate, Appoints Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi As 'Caliph', Declares All Muslims Must Pledge Allegiance To Him |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/8049.htm |publisher=MEMRI |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ISIL announced its expansion to other countries in November 2014 it established media departments for the new branches, and its media apparatus ensured that the new branches follow the same models it uses in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name=wapo28jan&gt;{{cite news |title=The Islamic State's model |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/28/the-islamic-states-model/ |accessdate=30 March 2015 |work=The Washington Post |date=28 January 2015 |first=Aaron Y. |last=Zelin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then FBI Director [[James Comey]] said that ISIL's "propaganda is unusually slick," noting that, "They are broadcasting... in something like 23 languages".&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=8 December 2014 |title=Three American teens, recruited online, are caught trying to join the Islamic State |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-american-teens-recruited-online-are-caught-trying-to-join-the-islamic-state/2014/12/08/8022e6c4-7afb-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, al-Hayat began publishing a digital magazine called ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', in a number of different languages including English. According to the magazine, its name is taken from the town of [[Dabiq (town)|Dabiq]] in northern Syria, which is mentioned in a [[hadith]] about [[Islamic eschatology|Armageddon]].&lt;ref name="JamestownDabiq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dabiq: What Islamic State's New Magazine Tells Us about Their Strategic Direction, Recruitment Patterns and Guerrilla Doctrine |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/tm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42702&amp;cHash=0efbd71af77fb92c064b9403dc8ea838 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=1 August 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hayat also began publishing other digital magazines, including the Turkish language ''[[Konstantiniyye (magazine)|Konstantiniyye]]'', the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] word for Istanbul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Akkoc |first=Raziye |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11926022/Ankara-bombings-Islamic-State-is-main-suspect-says-Turkish-PM-Ahmet-Davutoglu.html |title=Ankara bombings: Islamic State is main suspect, says Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 October 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Isabel |last=Hunter |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/suruc-bombings-turkish-president-accused-of-not-doing-enough-to-help-kurds-fight-isis-threat-across-10408839.html |title=Suruc bombings: Turkish President accused of not doing enough to help Kurds fight Isis threat across its border in Syria |work=Independent |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French language ''[[Dar al-Islam (magazine)|Dar al-Islam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jihadists Release First Issue of Pro-IS French Magazine "Dar al-Islam" |publisher=SITE Intelligence Group |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2016 |url=https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Periodicals/jihadists-release-first-issue-of-pro-is-french-magazine-dar-al-islam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2016, these magazines had apparently all been discontinued, with Al-Hayat's material being consolidated into a new magazine called ''[[Rumiyah (magazine)|Rumiyah]]'' (Arabic for Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20The%20Virtual%20Caliphate%20Gambhir%202016.pdf |title=The Virtual Caliphate: ISIS'S Information Warfare |publisher=Institute for the Study of War|access-date=7 February 2017 |quote=As of late 2016, Rumiyah has apparently supplanted other internationally oriented publications, as al-Hayat has ceased publishing them}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
{{Main|Use of social media by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant}}

ISIL's use of [[social media]] has been described by one expert as "probably more sophisticated than [that of] most US companies".&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic socmedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Berger |first=J. M. |date=16 June 2014 |title=How ISIS Games Twitter |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/isis-iraq-twitter-social-media-strategy/372856/ |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It regularly uses social media, particularly [[Twitter]], to distribute its messages.&lt;ref name="Atlantic socmedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name=adl-2014-06-27&gt;{{cite web |title=ISIS Propaganda Campaign Threatens U.S. |url=http://blog.adl.org/extremism/isis-propaganda-campaign-threatens-u-s |date=27 June 2014 |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group uses the encrypted instant messaging service [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] to disseminate images, videos and updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/isis-telegram-channel-doubles-followers-172356843.html |title=Isis Telegram channel doubles followers to 9,000 in less than 1 week |date=12 October 2015 |via=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is known for releasing videos and photographs of executions of prisoners, whether beheadings, shootings, caged prisoners being burnt alive or submerged gradually until drowned.&lt;ref name=cnn-12-8-15&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Ian |last2=Hanna |first2=Jason |title=Croatian ISIS captive reportedly beheaded |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/12/middleeast/isis-croatian-hostage/ |accessdate=12 August 2015 |publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] described ISIL's media content as part of a "systematically applied policy". The escalating violence of its killings "guarantees" the attention of the media and public.&lt;ref name=NYRoB-7-9-2015 /&gt;

Along with images of brutality, ISIL presents itself as "an emotionally attractive place where people 'belong', where everyone is a 'brother' or 'sister'". The "most potent psychological pitch" of ISIL media is the promise of heavenly reward to dead jihadist fighters. Frequently posted in their media are dead jihadists' smiling faces, the ISIL 'salute' of a 'right-hand index finger pointing heavenward', and testimonies of happy widows.&lt;ref name=NYRoB-7-9-2015 /&gt; ISIL has also attempted to present a more "rational argument" in a series of videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist [[John Cantlie]]. In one video, various current and former US officials were quoted, such as the then US President [[Barack Obama]] and former [[CIA]] Officer [[Michael Scheuer]].&lt;ref name=nydailynews-2014-09-23&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=ISIS releases second 'lecture video' of British hostage John Cantlie |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/isis-releases-lecture-video-british-hostage-john-cantlie-article-1.1949195 |accessdate=6 October 2014 |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has encouraged sympathisers to initiate [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicle-ramming]] and [[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|attacks]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=AttackingTheWest&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Thomas |last1=Hegghammer |first2=Petter |last2=Nesser |title=Assessing the Islamic State's Commitment to Attacking the West |work=Perspectives on Terrorism |publisher=Terrorism Research Initiative |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=9 July 2015 |issn=2334-3745 |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
{{Main|Finances of ISIL}}
{{See also|Oil production and smuggling in ISIL}}

According to a 2015 study by the [[Financial Action Task Force]], ISIL's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):
* proceeds from the occupation of territory (including control of banks, petroleum reservoirs, taxation, extortion, and robbery of economic assets)
* kidnapping for ransom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34312450 |title=Inside the Islamic State kidnap machine |date=22 September 2015 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* donations from Saudi Arabia and Gulf states, often disguised as meant for "humanitarian charity"
* material support provided by foreign fighters
* fundraising through modern communication networks&lt;ref name = FATF&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Financing-of-the-terrorist-organisation-ISIL.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2015 |publisher=Financial Action Task Force |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, ISIL has produced annual reports giving numerical information on its operations, somewhat in the style of corporate reports, seemingly in a bid to encourage potential donors.&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5834068/the-iraqi-rebels-make-annual-reports-with-infographics-we-translated |title=The surreal infographics ISIS is producing, translated |date=24 July 2014 |publisher=Vox |last1=Matthews |first1=Dylan |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[RAND Corporation]] analysed ISIL's funding sources from documents captured between 2005 and 2010.&lt;ref name="ISIfunding" /&gt; It found that outside donations amounted to only 5% of the group's operating budgets,&lt;ref name="ISIfunding" /&gt; and that cells inside Iraq were required to send up to 20% of the income generated from kidnapping, extortion rackets and other activities to the next level of the group's leadership, which would then redistribute the funds to provincial or local cells that were in difficulties or needed money to conduct attacks.&lt;ref name="ISIfunding"&gt;{{cite news |last=Allam |first=Hannah |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/06/23/231223/records-show-how-iraqi-extremists.html |title=Records show how Iraqi extremists withstood U.S. anti-terror efforts |publisher=McClatchy News |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, RAND estimated that ISIL finances from its largest source of income — oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control — had fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to $870 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/opinion/man-without-an-isis-plan.html |title=Man Without an ISIS Plan |last=The Editorial Board |date=12 March 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=13 March 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2014, the [[Iraqi National Intelligence Service]] obtained information that ISIL had assets worth US$2 billion,&lt;ref name="isil-wealth"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chulov |first=Martin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |date=15 June 2014 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the richest jihadist group in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Jack |date=11 June 2014 |title=Mosul Seized: Jihadis Loot $429m from City's Central Bank to Make Isis World's Richest Terror Force |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mosul-seized-jihadis-loot-429m-citys-central-bank-make-isis-worlds-richest-terror-force-1452190 |newspaper=International Business Times |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About three-quarters of this sum was said to looted from Mosul's central bank and commercial banks in the city.&lt;ref name="WAPO richest"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCoy |first=Terrence |date=12 June 2014 |title=ISIS just stole $425 million, Iraqi governor says, and became the 'world's richest terrorist group' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/12/isis-just-stole-425-million-and-became-the-worlds-richest-terrorist-group |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carey |first1=Glen |last2=Haboush |first2=Mahmoud |last3=Viscusi |first3=Gregory |title=Financing Jihad: Why ISIS Is a Lot Richer Than Al-Qaeda |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/looted-banks-fund-iraq-fighters-eyeing-wealth-al-qaeda-never-had.html |accessdate=19 July 2014 |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, doubt was later cast on whether ISIL was able to retrieve anywhere near that sum from the central bank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Windrem |title=U.S. Official Doubts ISIS Mosul Bank Heist Windfall |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/u-s-official-doubts-isis-mosul-bank-heist-windfall-n139846 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |publisher=NBC News |date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even on whether the looting had actually occurred.&lt;ref name="ft bank"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daragahi |first1=Borzou |title=Biggest bank robbery that 'never happened' – $400m Isis heist |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0378d4f4-0c28-11e4-9080-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=21 July 2014 |work=Financial Times |date=17 July 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 1999 by Jordanian [[Salafist jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] under the name ''[[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Jamāʻat al-Tawḥīd wa-al-Jihād]]'' ({{Literal translation|"The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad"}}).&lt;ref name="winepJune14" /&gt; In a letter published by the Coalition in February 2004, Zarqawi wrote that jihadis should use bombings to start an open sectarian war so that Sunnis from the Islamic world would mobilize against assassinations carried out by Shia, specifically the Badr Brigade, against Ba'athists and Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/31694.htm "Zarqawi Letter"] ''State Dept. archives''&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Derek Harvey told Reuters that "the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that 'this stuff had to play itself out' – implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi'ite groups were to be expected."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Parker, [https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mideast-crisis-iraq-militias/ "Torture by Iraqi militias: The report Washington did not want you to see"] Reuters, 14 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Burke, an adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said that in 2005 a plan from him and several colleagues to surveil and stop suspected Badr Brigade death squads in the special police forces was rejected when it got to an American Flag (General) Officer.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Wing, [http://musingsoniraq.blogspot.com/2012/02/from-bad-to-worse-how-militias-moved.html "Part two of an interview with Jerry Burke] ''Musings on Iraq'', 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by Western forces, al-Zarqawi and ''Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad'' achieved notoriety in the early stages of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]] for their [[suicide attack]]s on [[Shia Islam|Shia]] mosques, civilians, Iraqi government institutions and Italian soldiers of the US-led '[[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Multi-National Force]]'.

In January 2006, AQI joined with several smaller Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups under an umbrella organisation called the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]] (MSC). According to counterterrorism researcher Brian Fishman, the merger was an attempt to give the group a more Iraqi flavour, and perhaps to distance al-Qaeda from some of al-Zarqawi's tactical errors, such as the [[2005 Amman bombings|2005 bombings]] by AQI of three hotels in Amman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fishman|2008|pp=48–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2006, a US airstrike killed al-Zarqawi, who was succeeded as leader of the group by the Egyptian militant [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Qaeda in Iraq names new head |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5073092.stm |work=BBC News|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Masri"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tran |first=Mark |title=Al-Qaida in Iraq leader believed dead |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/01/iraq.alqaida |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishman 2008 49–50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fishman|2008|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2013, al-Baghdadi released an audio statement in which he announced that the al-Nusra Front had been established, financed, and supported by ISI,&lt;ref name="globalpost"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130409/qaeda-iraq-confirms-syrias-nusra-part-network |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513193707/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130409/qaeda-iraq-confirms-syrias-nusra-part-network |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 May 2013 |title=Qaeda in Iraq confirms Syria's Nusra is part of network |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the two groups were merging under the name [[Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham]] (ISIL, Al-Sham also translates as the Levant).&lt;ref name="memri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7119.htm |title=ISI Confirms That Jabhat Al-Nusra Is Its Extension in Syria, Declares 'Islamic State of Iraq And Al-Sham' As New Name of Merged Group |website=MEMRI |publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=10 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085808/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7119.htm |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Abu Mohammad al-Julani]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger.

Meanwhile, the ISIL campaign to free its imprisoned members culminated in simultaneous raids on [[Taji]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] prisons in July 2013, freeing more than 500 prisoners, many of them veterans of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]].&lt;ref name="iswSeptember13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters23July13"&gt;{{cite news |title=Al Qaeda says it freed 500 inmates in Iraq jail-break |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/23/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda-idUSBRE96M0C720130723 |agency=Reuters |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, al-Zawahiri ordered the disbanding of ISIL, putting al-Nusra Front in charge of jihadist efforts in Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zawahiri disbands main Qaeda faction in Syria |url=http://dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Nov-08/237219-zawahiri-disbands-main-qaeda-faction-in-syria-jazeera.ashx |accessdate=8 November 2013 |work=The Daily Star |location=Beirut, Lebanon |date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but al-Baghdadi rejected al-Zawahiri's order,&lt;ref name="aljazeera150613" /&gt; and his group continued to operate in Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relations with ISIL.&lt;ref name="AlQaedaTiesEnd" /&gt;

According to journalist Sarah Birke, there are "significant differences" between al-Nusra Front and ISIL. While al-Nusra actively calls for the overthrow of the Assad government, ISIL "tends to be more focused on establishing its own rule on conquered territory". ISIL is "far more ruthless" in building an Islamic state, "carrying out sectarian attacks and imposing sharia law immediately". While al-Nusra has a "large contingent of foreign fighters", it is seen as a home-grown group by many Syrians; by contrast, ISIL fighters have been described as "foreign 'occupiers'" by many Syrian refugees.&lt;ref name="birke3"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Birke |first=Sarah |title=How al-Qaeda Changed the Syrian War |magazine=New York Review of Books |date=27 December 2013 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/dec/27/how-al-qaeda-changed-syrian-war/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign fighters in Syria include Russian-speaking jihadists who were part of [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]] (JMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal-neo.org/2014/01/18/rus-rost-mezhdunarodno-terroristicheskoj-ugrozy-s-territorii-sirii/ |title=Growth of International Terrorist Threat from Syria |first=Vladimir |last=Platov |journal=New Eastern Outlook |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, [[Abu Omar al-Shishani]], leader of the [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]] (JMA), swore an [[Bay'at|oath of allegiance]] to al-Baghdadi;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |title=Chechen-led group swears allegiance to head of Islamic State of Iraq and Sham |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/11/muhajireen_army_swea.php |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |work=Long War Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group then split between those who followed al-Shishani in joining ISIL and those who continued to operate independently in the JMA under new leadership.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25151104 |title=Syria crisis: Omar Shishani, Chechen jihadist leader |work=BBC News|date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL by February 2014, citing its failure to consult and "notorious intransigence".{{r|ReutersHolmes_030214}}&lt;ref name="AlQaedaTiesEnd"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/al-qaeda-disavows-any-ties-with-radical-islamist-isis-group-in-syria-iraq/2014/02/03/2c9afc3a-8cef-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1_story.html |title=Al-Qaeda disavows any ties with radical Islamist ISIS group in Syria, Iraq |work=The Washington Post |first=Liz |last=Sly |date=3 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, ISIL drove [[Government of Iraq|Iraqi government forces]] out of key cities in its [[Anbar campaign (2013–14)|Anbar campaign]],&lt;ref name=CNNanbar /&gt; which was followed by the [[Fall of Mosul|capture of Mosul]]&lt;ref name=NYTmosul /&gt; and the [[Sinjar massacre]].&lt;ref name=CapturedSinjar /&gt; The loss of control almost caused a collapse of the Iraqi government and prompted a renewal of [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|US military action in Iraq]]. In Syria, ISIL has conducted ground attacks on both the [[Syrian Arab Army]] and [[Syrian opposition|rebel factions]].

In 2016, according to the daily, [[La Stampa]], officials from [[Europol]] conducted an investigation into the trafficking of fake documents for ISIL.

==== Capture of territory ====

[[File:USAID Mt Sinjar.jpg|thumb|Yazidi refugees and American aid workers on Mount Sinjar in August 2014]]
On 3 August 2014, ISIL captured the cities of [[Zumar]], [[Sinjar]], and [[Wana, Iraq|Wana]] in northern Iraq.&lt;ref name=CapturedSinjar /&gt; Thousands of [[Yazidis]] fled up [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Sinjar]], fearful of the approaching hostile ISIL militants. The stranded Yazidis' need for food and water, the threat of [[genocide]] to them and to others announced by ISIL, along with the desire to protect US citizens in Iraq and support the Iraqi government in its fight against ISIL, were all reasons given for the [[2014 American intervention in Iraq]], which began on 7 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/07/statement-president |title=Statement by the President |publisher=The White House |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US aerial bombing campaign began the following day.

At the end of October 2014, 800 militants gained partial control of the Libyan city of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thus making Derna the first city outside Syria and Iraq to be a part of the "Islamic State Caliphate".&lt;ref name="Derna"&gt;{{cite news |first=Maggie |last=Michael |date=9 November 2014 |title=Libyan city declares itself part of Islamic State caliphate |publisher=CP24 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.cp24.com/world/libyan-city-declares-itself-part-of-islamic-state-caliphate-1.2093900}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2014, a major faction of the Egyptian militant group [[Ansar Bait al-Maqdis]] also pledged its allegiance to ISIL.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ammar |last1=Karim |first2=Samer |last2=al-Atrush |title=Egypt jihadists vow loyalty to IS as Iraq probes leader's fate |date=10 November 2014 |via=Yahoo!

In early February 2015, ISIL militants in Libya managed to capture part of the countryside to the west of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], and later, an area encompassing the cities of [[Sirte]], [[Fall of Nofaliya (2015)|Nofolia]], and a military base to the south of both cities. By March, ISIL had captured additional territory, including a city to the west of Derna, additional areas near Sirte, a stretch of land in southern Libya, some areas around [[Benghazi]], and an area to the east of [[Tripoli]].

==== Mass killings ====
On 30 August 2016, a survey conducted by the [[Associated Press]] found that around 72 mass graves have been discovered in areas that have been liberated from ISIL control. In total, these mass graves contain the bodies of approximately 15,000 people killed by ISIL. The report stated that the mass graves were evidence of genocides conducted by ISIL in the region, including the [[genocide of Yazidis by ISIL|genocide of Yazidis]]. Seventeen graves were discovered in Syria, with the rest being found in Iraq. At least 16 of the graves in Iraq contained remains that were not counted, as they are located in dangerous conflict zones. Instead, the number of dead in these graves has been estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forces in Iraq and Syria discovers 72 mass graves in areas freed from ISIS |publisher=Iraqi News |date=30 August 2016 |url=http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/forces-in-iraq-and-syria-discovers-72-mass-graves-areas-freed-from-isis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2018, a [[United Nations]] report revealed over 200 mass graves of thousands of ISIL's victims were discovered. The grave sites, which may contain up to 12,000 bodies, were found in the northern and western Iraqi provinces of [[Nineveh Governorate|Nineveh]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Saladin Governorate|Salah al-Din]] and [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/06/middleeast/mass-graves-isis-un-intl/index.html|title=200 mass graves of thousands of ISIS victims found|date=6 November 2018|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International criticism ===

The group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and [[Amnesty International]]. On 24 September 2014, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] stated: "As Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL – or Da'ish – have nothing to do with [[Islam]], and they certainly do not represent a state. They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'."&lt;ref name=BanKiMoonUnIslamic&gt;{{cite web |author=Ban Ki-Moon |title=Secretary-General's remarks to Security Council High-Level Summit on Foreign Terrorist Fighters |url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8040 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 November 2014 |date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL has been classified a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organisation]] by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries (see {{see section||Classification}}). Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see {{see section||Countries and groups at war with ISIL}}). The group was described as a [[cult]] in a [[Huffington Post]] column by notable cult authority [[Steven Hassan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Steven |title=ISIS Is a Cult That Uses Terrorism: A Fresh New Strategy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-hassan/isis-is-a-cult-that-uses-_b_6023890.html |work=The World Post |accessdate=10 November 2014 |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic criticism ===
{{See also|Khawarij}}
Around the world, [[Islamic religious leaders]] have overwhelmingly condemned ISIL's ideology and actions, arguing that the group has strayed from the path of true Islam and that its actions do not reflect the religion's real teachings or virtues.&lt;ref name="ns10Mar2015"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hasan |first=Mehdi |authorlink=Medhi Hasan |date=10 March 2015 |title=Mehdi Hasan: How Islamic is Islamic State? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/03/mehdi-hasan-how-islamic-islamic-state |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=7 July 2015 |quote=Consider the various statements of Muslim groups such as the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation, representing 57 countries (Isis has "nothing to do with Islam"); the Islamic Society of North America (Isis's actions are "in no way representative of what Islam actually teaches"); al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most prestigious seat of learning in the Sunni Muslim world (Isis is acting "under the guise of this holy religion ... in an attempt to export their false Islam"); and even Saudi Arabia's Salafist Grand Mufti, Abdul Aziz al ash-Sheikh (Isis is "the number-one enemy of Islam").}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century, to the [[Khawarij]]es. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death.&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi-[kha]"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |pages=xvii–xviii |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SheemaKhan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheema |last=Khan |date=29 September 2014 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/ |title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers' |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Usama |last=Hasan |title=The Balance of Islam in Challenging Extremism |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |publisher=Quilliam Foundation |date=July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism |title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism |first=Mohamad |last=Jebara |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij.&lt;ref name=SheemaKhan /&gt;&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi2|xvii-xviii+p.8"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |pages=xvii–xviii |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}} See also p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni critics, including [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] and jihadist [[muftis]] such as [[Adnan al-Aroor]] and [[Abu Basir al-Tartusi]], say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have stepped outside the mainstream of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.&lt;ref name="econ140906"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21615634-sunni-religious-authorities-turn-against-islamic-state-slow-backlash |title=The slow backlash – Sunni religious authorities turn against Islamic State |date=6 September 2014 |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has received severe criticism from Muslim religious scholars and theologians. In late August 2014, the [[Grand Mufti]] of Saudi Arabia, [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh]], condemned ISIL and [[al-Qaeda]] saying, "Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on Earth, destroying human civilization, are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims".&lt;ref name=SaudiGrandMuftiCondemn&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti denounces Islamic State group as un-Islamic |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2014/08/25/saudi-arabias-grand-mufti-denounces-islamic-state-group-as-un-islamic/ |agency=Reuters |accessdate=18 November 2014 |date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 2014, 126 Sunni [[imams]] and Islamic scholars—primarily [[Sufism|Sufi]]&lt;ref name=MM141001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muslimmatters.org/2014/10/01/muslim-scholars-letter-to-al-baghdadi-of-isis-or-isil-a-missed-opportunity/ |title=Muslim Scholars Letter to al-Baghdadi of ISIS or ISIL – A Missed Opportunity |date=1 October 2014 |first=Amad |last=Shaikh |work=Muslim Matters |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from around the Muslim world signed an [[open letter]] to the Islamic State's leader al-Baghdadi, explicitly rejecting and refuting his group's interpretations of Islamic scriptures, the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]], which it used in order to justify its actions.&lt;ref name="huffpost-bagh-openlet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Scholars Release Open Letter to Islamic State Meticulously Blasting Its Ideology |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/24/muslim-scholars-islamic-state_n_5878038.html |work=HuffPost |date=24 September 2013 |first=Lauren |last=Markoe |agency=Religious News Service |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christianpost-2014-09-25&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Samuel |title=International Coalition of Muslim Scholars Refute ISIS' Religious Arguments in Open Letter to al-Baghdadi |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/international-coalition-of-muslim-scholars-refute-isis-religious-arguments-in-open-letter-to-al-baghdadi-127032/ |accessdate=18 October 2014 |work=The Christian Post |date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[You] have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder ... this is a great wrong and an offence to Islam, to Muslims and to the entire world", the letter states.&lt;ref name=OpenLetToAlBagh /&gt; It rebukes the Islamic State for its killing of prisoners, describing the killings as "heinous [[war crime]]s" and its persecution of the [[Yazidis]] of Iraq as "abominable".

According to ''The New York Times'', "All of the most influential jihadist theorists are criticising the Islamic State as deviant, calling its self-proclaimed caliphate null and void" and they have denounced it for its beheadings of journalists and aid workers.{{r|ISIS_NYT}} ISIL is widely denounced by a broad range of Islamic clerics, including al-Qaeda-oriented clerics and Saudi clerics.{{r|HuffPost_Wahhabi|ISIS_NYT}} [[Muhammad al-Yaqoubi]] states, "It is enough of a proof of the extreme ideology of ISIS that the top leaders of Salafi-Jihadism have disclaimed it."&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |page=19 |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|Khawarij}} Other critics of ISIL's brand of Sunni Islam include Salafists who previously publicly supported jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda: for example, the Saudi government official [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]], known for his extremist views, who claims that ISIL is a creation of "Zionists, Crusaders and Safavids", and the Jordanian-Palestinian writer [[Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi]], the former spiritual mentor to [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], who was released from prison in Jordan in June 2014 and accused ISIL of driving a wedge between Muslims.&lt;ref name="econ140906" /&gt;

The group's declaration of a caliphate has been criticised and its legitimacy has been disputed by Middle Eastern governments, other jihadist groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/theyre-delusional-rivals-ridicule-isis-declaration-of-islamic-state |title="They're delusional": Rivals ridicule ISIS declaration of Islamic state |publisher=CBS News |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Sunni Muslim]] theologians and historians. Qatar-based TV broadcaster and theologian [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] stated: "[The] declaration issued by the Islamic State is void under [[sharia]] and has dangerous consequences for the Sunnis in Iraq and for the revolt in Syria", adding that the title of caliph can "only be given by the entire Muslim nation", not by a single group.&lt;ref name="Caliph address"&gt;{{cite news |last=Strange |first=Hannah |title=Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses Muslims in Mosul |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10948480/Islamic-State-leader-Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-addresses-Muslims-in-Mosul.html |accessdate=6 July 2014 |work=The Telegraph |date=5 July 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's execution of Muslims for breach of traditional ''[[sharia]]'' law while violating it itself (encouraging women to emigrate to its territory, travelling without a ''[[Wali]]''—male guardian—and in violation of his wishes) has been criticised;&lt;ref name=haykel-6-8-15&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Creswell |first1=Robyn |last2=Haykel |first2=Bernard |title=Battle Lines |magazine=The New Yorker |date=8 June 2015 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/08/battle-lines-jihad-creswell-and-haykel |accessdate=6 June 2015 |quote=In the most recent issue of Dabiq, ISIS's English-language magazine, a female writer encourages women to emigrate to "the lands of the Islamic State" even if it means travelling without a male companion, a shocking breach of traditional Islamic law.

An [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]] [[sharia]] court judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: "The legal reference is the Islamic Sharia. The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's our duty to look at any crime that comes to us... After the regime has fallen, we believe that the Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very important to point out that some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen [having a stable state], they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [IS] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [IS] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiyyWiO-IKY |title=Ghosts of Aleppo (Full Length) |date=30 September 2014 |publisher=VICE News |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.vice.com/video/ghosts-of-aleppo-full-length |title=Ghosts of Aleppo (Full Length) |work=VICE News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra have been trying to take advantage of ISIL's rise, by attempting to present themselves as "moderate" compared to "extremist" ISIL, although it has the same aim of establishing sharia and a caliphate but doing so in a more gradual manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=Al Qaeda appears 'moderate' compared to Islamic State, veteran jihadist says |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/10/al-qaeda-appears-moderate-compared-to-islamic-state-veteran-jihadist-says.php |work=Long War Journal |date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=26 October 2015 |title=A rare interview with an experienced Al Qaeda commander shows how the group is using ISIS to make itself look 'moderate' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-rare-interview-with-an-experienced-al-qaeda-commander-shows-how-the-group-is-using-isis-to-make-itself-look-moderate-2015-10 |newspaper=Business Insider |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=The Al Nusrah Front's 'inherited jihad' |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/06/inheritedjihad.php |work=Long War Journal |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=Officials from Al Nusrah Front, Ahrar al Sham vow to continue fight against Islamic State |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/07/officials-from-al-nusrah-front-ahrar-al-sham-vow-to-continue-fight-against-islamic-state.php |work=Long War Journal |date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=9 February 2015 |title=Al Qaeda Uses ISIS to Try to Present Itself as Respectable, Even Moderate |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/al-qaeda-uses-isis-try-present-itself-respectable-even-moderate_845194.html |newspaper=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nusra has criticised the way in which ISIL fully and immediately institutes sharia in the areas that fall under its control, since it alienates people too much.  It supports the gradual, slower approach favoured by al-Qaeda, preparing society to accept sharia and indoctrinating people through education before implementing the [[hudud]] aspects of sharia, such as throwing gays from the top of buildings, chopping limbs off, and public stoning.&lt;ref name="Joscelyn" /&gt; Al-Nusra and ISIL are both hostile towards the [[Druze]].

[[Mehdi Hasan]], a political journalist in the UK, said in the ''[[New Statesman]]'',

{{quote|Whether Sunni or Shia, Salafi or Sufi, conservative or liberal, Muslims – and Muslim leaders – have almost unanimously condemned and denounced ISIL not merely as un-Islamic but actively anti-Islamic.&lt;ref name="ns10Mar2015" /&gt;}}

Hassan Hassan, an analyst at the Delma Institute, wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that because the Islamic State "bases its teachings on religious texts that mainstream Muslim clerics do not want to deal with head on, new recruits leave the camp feeling that they have stumbled on the true message of Islam".&lt;ref name="guardian-traincamp" /&gt; In mid-February 2015, [[Graeme C.A.

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], an Egyptian [[Islamic theologian]] based in Qatar, said in his official website that the "United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the leaders of Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group are from one species and they are two sides of the same coin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writers |title=Al-Qaradawi: Rulers Of UAE And Daesh Leaders Are Two Sides Of The Same Coin {{!}} English – Middle East Press News Agency|url=http://middleeastpress.com/english/al-qaradawi-rulers-of-uae-and-daesh-leaders-are-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=Middle East News Agency|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many world leaders and government spokespeople have called ISIL a terrorist group or banned it, without their countries having formally designated it as such. The following are examples:

The Government of Germany banned ISIL in September 2014. Activities banned include donations to the group, recruiting fighters, holding ISIL meetings and distributing its propaganda, [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|flying ISIL flags]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eddy |first1=Melissa |title=Germany Bans Support for ISIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/europe/germany-bans-support-of-isis.html |accessdate=19 November 2014 |work=The New York Times |date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wearing ISIL symbols and all ISIL activities. "The terror organisation Islamic State is a threat to public safety in Germany as well", said German politician [[Thomas de Maizière]]. He added, "Today's ban is directed solely against terrorists who abuse religion for their criminal goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sixth-sense-newspaper.de/german-news/1943-isil-banned-in-germany |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103205324/http://www.sixth-sense-newspaper.de/german-news/1943-isil-banned-in-germany |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 January 2015 |title=ISIL banned in Germany |first=Janette |last=Roberts |work=Sixth Sense |date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a member of ISIL is also illegal in accordance with §&amp;nbsp;129a and §&amp;nbsp;129b of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German criminal code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/18/007/1800759.pdf |title=Drucksache 18/759 |website= |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Switzerland banned ISIL's activities in the country, including propaganda and financial support of the fighters, with prison sentences as potential penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/401536--switzerland-bans-isil |title=Switzerland bans ISIL |publisher=Anadolu Agency |date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December 2014, India banned ISIL after the arrest of an operator of a pro-ISIL Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Avaneesh |last=Pandey |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/india-bans-isis-after-government-raises-concerns-over-groups-online-presence-1759516 |title=India Bans ISIS After Government Raises Concerns Over Group's Online Presence |date=16 December 2014 |work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan designated ISIL as a banned organisation in late August 2015, under which all elements expressing sympathy for the group would be blacklisted and sanctioned.&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt;

Media sources worldwide have described ISIL as a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref name="ISIS or ISIL? The debate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes27Aug14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoyTop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indonesia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ListerTop"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lister |first=Tim |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/12/world/meast/who-is-the-isis/ |title=ISIS: The first terror group to build an Islamic state? |publisher=CNN |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Militia, territorial authority and other classifications ====

By 2014, ISIL was increasingly being viewed as a [[militia]] rather than just a terrorist group.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; As major Iraqi cities fell to ISIL in June 2014, Jessica Lewis, a former US Army intelligence officer at the [[Institute for the Study of War]], described ISIL at that time as

{{quote|text=not a terrorism problem anymore, [but rather] an army on the move in Iraq and Syria, and they are taking terrain. They have shadow governments in and around [[Baghdad]], and they have an aspirational goal to govern. I don't know whether they want to control Baghdad, or if they want to destroy the functions of the Iraqi state, but either way the outcome will be disastrous for Iraq.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vick |first1=Karl |last2=Baker |first2=Aryn |url=http://time.com/2859454/iraq-tikrit-isis-baghdad-mosul/ |title=Extremists in Iraq Continue March Toward Baghdad |work=Time |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:London protest 2015 Ankara bombings (2).jpg|thumb|Supporters of the Turkish Labour Party protesting in London following the [[2015 Ankara bombings]]]]
Lewis has called ISIL

{{quote|text=an advanced military leadership. They have incredible command and control and they have a sophisticated reporting mechanism from the field that can relay tactics and directives up and down the line. They are well-financed, and they have big sources of manpower, not just the foreign fighters, but also prisoner escapees.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;}}

Former US Defense Secretary [[Chuck Hagel]] saw an "imminent threat to every interest we have", but former top counter-terrorism adviser [[Daniel Benjamin]] derided such talk as a "farce" that panics the public.&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mazzetti |first1=Mark |first2=Eric |last2=Schmitt |first3=Mark |last3=Landler |date=10 September 2014 |title=Struggling to Gauge ISIS Threat, Even as U.S. Prepares to Act |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/world/middleeast/struggling-to-gauge-isis-threat-even-as-us-prepares-to-act.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] concluded that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused the creation of ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Porter |first1=Tom |date=10 August 2015 |title=Iraq War Created Isis, Concedes David Miliband |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-war-created-isis-concedes-david-miliband-1460557 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Pankaj Mishra]] rejects the idea that the group is a resurgence of medieval Islam, saying instead:

{{quote|text=In actuality, Isis is the canniest of all traders in the flourishing international economy of disaffection: the most resourceful among all those who offer the security of collective identity to isolated and fearful individuals. It promises, along with others who retail racial, national and religious supremacy, to release the anxiety and frustrations of the private life into the violence of the global.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/24/how-to-think-about-islamic-state |title=How to think about Islamic State |first=Pankaj |last=Mishra |work=The Guardian |date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A certain change of attitude occurred following the inauguration of US President Trump. On 28 January 2017, he issued a National Security Presidential Memorandum which called for a comprehensive plan to destroy ISIS to be formulated by the Defense Department within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-02/pdf/2017-02386.pdf |title=National Security Presidential Memorandum no. 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a June 2015 [[Reuters]] report that cited "jihadist ideologues" as a source, 90% of ISIL's fighters in Iraq are Iraqi, and 70% of its fighters in Syria are Syrian. The article stated that the group has 40,000 fighters and 60,000 supporters across its two primary strongholds in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name="saddam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam's former army is secret of Baghdadi's success |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-insight-idUSKBN0OW1VN20150616 |agency=Reuters |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to scholar [[Fawaz Gerges]] writing in ''ISIS: A History'', some "30 percent of the senior figures" in ISIL's military command are former army and police officers from the disbanded Iraqi security forces, drawn to ISIL by the US [[De-Ba'athification]] policy and turned towards Sunni Islamism, following the US invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref name="NYRoB-7-9-2015" /&gt;

[[Richard Dearlove]], former head of Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), said that the Saudis were "deeply attracted to any militancy that can effectively challenge [[Shia Islam|Shia-dom]] [Shia version of Islam]."&lt;ref name="Saudi" /&gt; Dearlove stated that, "For ISIS to be able to surge into the Sunni areas of Iraq in the way that it has done recently has to be the consequence of substantial and sustained funding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/saudis-deny-supporting-isis-after-former-mi6-head-speaks-substantial |title=Saudis Deny Supporting ISIS After Former MI6 Head Speaks of 'Substantial and Sustained Funding' |last=Goodenough |first=Patrick |date=9 July 2014 |publisher=CNSNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2014 email, leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], apparently from former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to then counselor to Barack Obama [[John Podesta]], a memo states that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar "are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Mattathias |title=Hillary Clinton acknowledges Saudi terror financing in hacked email, hinting at tougher approach |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/hillary-clinton-acknowledges-saudi-terror-financing-in-hacked-email-hinting-at-tougher-approach/ |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKernan 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=McKernan | first=Bethan | title=Hillary Clinton 'thinks Saudi Arabia funds Isis', leaked document claims | website=The Independent | date=11 October 2016 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-leak-wikileaks-saudi-arabia-qatar-isis-podesta-latest-a7355466.html | access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BelfastTelegraph.co.uk 2016"&gt;{{cite news | title=Boris Johnson's Saudi Arabia comments slapped down by PM but Hillary Clinton, German intelligence and the UN expressed similar views | website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk | date=8 December 2016 | url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/boris-johnsons-saudi-arabia-comments-slapped-down-by-pm-but-hillary-clinton-german-intelligence-and-the-un-expressed-similar-views-35279794.html | access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a senior Western official, documents and [[flash drives]] seized during the Sayyaf raid revealed links "so clear" and "undeniable" between Turkey and ISIL "that they could end up having profound policy implications for the relationship between us and Ankara".&lt;ref name="yahoonews" /&gt;

Journalist [[Patrick Cockburn]] wrote in November 2014 of "strong evidence for a degree of collaboration" between the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|Turkish intelligence services]] and ISIL, although the "exact nature of the relationship ... remains cloudy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Cockburn |first1=Patrick |authorlink1=Patrick Cockburn |title=Whose side is Turkey on? |magazine=[[London Review of Books]] |date=6 November 2014 |volume=36 |issue=21 |pages=8–10 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n21/patrick-cockburn/whose-side-is-turkey-on}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Cockburn stated that "Saudi Arabia has created a [[Frankenstein's monster]] over which it is rapidly losing control.

==== Qatar ====

[[Qatar]] has long been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to ISIL. While there is no proof that the Qatari government is behind the movement of funds from the gas-rich nation to ISIL, it has been criticised for not doing enough to stem the flow of financing. Private donors within Qatar, sympathetic to the aims of radical groups such as [[al-Nusra Front]] and ISIL, are believed to be channeling their resources to support these organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar and ISIS Funding: The U.S. Approach |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/qatar-and-isis-funding-the-u.s.-approach |publisher=The Washington Institute |date=August 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic State: Where does jihadist group get its support? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29004253 |publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]], a number of terrorist financiers have been operating in Qatar. Qatari citizen [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi]] has served as an interlocutor between Qatari donors and leaders of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (AQI). Nuaimi reportedly oversaw the transfer of US$2 million per month to AQI over a period of time. He is also one of several of Qatar-based al-Qaeda financiers sanctioned by the US Treasury in recent years. According to some reports, US officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar Is a U.S. Ally.

In August 2014, German minister [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]] accused Qatar of having links to ISIL, stating: "You have to ask who is arming, who is financing ISIS troops. The keyword there is Qatar." Qatari Foreign Minister [[Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah]] rejected this statement, saying: "Qatar does not support extremist groups, including [ISIL], in any way. We are repelled by their views, their violent methods and their ambitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=German minister accuses Qatar of funding Islamic State fighters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/us-iraq-security-germany-qatar-idUSKBN0GK1I720140820 |agency=Reuters |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar allows money to flow to Islamic State, other terrorists: report |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/10/qatar-allows-money-flow-isis-other-terrorists-repo/?page=all |website=The Washington Times |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who funds ISIS?

==== United States ====

[[Rand Paul]], junior U.S. Senator from Kentucky, has accused the U.S. government of indirectly supporting ISIL in the [[Syrian Civil War]], by arming their allies and fighting their enemies in that country.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shabad |first1=Rebeca |title=Paul: ISIS emboldened after US armed its allies in Syria |url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/210168-us-has-been-arming-isis-in-syria-sen-paul-claims |publisher=The Hill |date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US has assisted the moderate Syrian opposition (see [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-led [[Timber Sycamore]] operation), but whether that assistance has been commandeered by ISIS allies remains unclear.

On 12 September 2014, several media outlets began reporting that the Free Syrian Army had signed a "non-aggression pact" with ISIS in order to focus their attentions elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masi |first=Alessandria |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/us-backed-moderate-group-syria-signs-truce-isis-reports-1687662 |title=US-Backed Moderate Group in Syria Signs Truce With ISIS: Reports |work=International Business Times |date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-and-al-qaeda-truce-2014-11 |title=ISIS And Al Qaeda Truce – Business Insider |date=13 November 2014 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports later proved to be false, as opposition soldiers and activists on the ground reported continued fighting between the two groups. According to Mohammed Alaa Ghanem, director of government relations for the Syrian American Council, "The only report we have received on anything resembling a ceasefire was that ISIS and Sons of Golan, an FSA brigade outside Damascus, halted fighting for 24 hours to collect bodies before hostilities resumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/syrian-opposition-blasts-reports-it-signed-a-truce-with-isis.html |title=Syrian Opposition Blasts Reports It Signed a Truce With ISIS |work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; "FSA commanders declared that they will continue that fight until ISIS is completely eradicated in Damascus suburbs. No truce or cease fire with ISIS," said Syrian National Coalition spokesman Monzer Abkik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217652-syrian-opposition-no-isis-cease-fire |title=Syrian opposition: No ISIS cease-fire |work=TheHill}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, 64% of verifiable ISIS attacks in Syria targeted the FSA and other rebels.&lt;ref name="Assad_ISIL_Stats"/&gt;

A 2015 report by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University found 71 individuals charged in the United States with supporting ISIL, 250 travelling or attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq from the United States to join ISIL, and about 900 active domestic ISIL-related investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cchs.gwu.edu/isis-in-america |title=ISIS in America – Center for Cyber &amp; Homeland Security – The George Washington University |work=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Foreign nationals by country =====

===== Australia =====
In August 2018 Australia stripped the Australian citizenship from five terrorists who had travelled to fight with the Islamic State and barred them from entering Australia again. This was only possible because they had double citizenships because international law stops the measure from being used on individuals with only one citizenship. The five brought the total to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/five-islamic-state-terrorists-stripped-of-australian-citizenship-20180809-p4zwgp.html|title=Five Islamic State terrorists stripped of Australian citizenship|date=2018-08-09|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Netherlands ======
The [[Parliament of Netherlands]] voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIS or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister [[Ard van der Steur|Ard Van der Steur]] stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/212749|title=Dutch Jihadists to be stripped of dual citizenship|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/sep/13/netherlands-strip-four-jihadists-of-citizenship-1656702.html|title=Netherlands strip four jihadists of citizenship|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012-November 2018 period, above 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighers in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIS. The remaining quarter have joined [[Al-Qaeda]] affiliated groups such as [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] or [[Tanzim Hurras al-Deen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2018/11/09/the-legacy-of-syria-global-jihadism-remains-a-threat-to-europe|title=Syria’s Legacy - Global jihadism remains a threat to Europe|last=|first=|publisher=[[General Intelligence and Security Service]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201090804/https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2018/11/09/the-legacy-of-syria-global-jihadism-remains-a-threat-to-europe|archive-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Sweden ======
Up to 2018, an estimated 300 individuals had travelled from Sweden to join the civil war in Syria.&lt;ref name="ispi2018" /&gt; In March 2018 Kurdish authorities reported they had captured 41 IS supporters with either Swedish citizenship or residence permit in Sweden, of which 5 had key positions in the organisation and one was the head of the ISIL propaganda efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/kurdisk-kalla-41-is-svenskar-fangslade-i-syrien/|title=Kurdisk källa: 41 IS-svenskar fängslade i Syrien - DN.SE|date=24 March 2018|work=Dagens Nyheter|access-date=25 March 2018|language=sv-se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== United Kingdom ======
Cabinet minister [[William Hague]] stated in 2014 that up to 400 UK citizens had joined ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/16/400-uk-citizens-fighting-syria-isis-iraq-william-hague|title=Up to 400 British citizens may be fighting in Syria, says William Hague|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|last2=Watt|first2=Nicholas|date=16 June 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government instituted a practice where if those who had joined had double citizenships were stripped of their UK citizenship to prevent them from arriving back in the UK.

==== Groups expressing support for ISIL ====
The [[Terrorism Research &amp; Analysis Consortium|Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium]] (TRAC) has identified 60 jihadist groups in 30 countries that have pledged allegiance to or support for ISIL as of mid-November 2014. That many of these groups were previously affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]] suggests a shift in global jihadist leadership towards ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Riyadh |last=Mohammed |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/16/ISIS-Doubles-Down-Infidels-Boosted-60-New-Terror-Groups#sthash.eYktEthB.dpuf |title=ISIS Beheads Another American As 60 New Terror Groups Join |work=The Fiscal Times |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL's claims to territory have brought it into armed conflict with many governments, militias and other armed groups. International rejection of ISIL as a terrorist entity and rejection of its claim to even exist have placed it in conflict with countries around the world.

The Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also referred to as the Counter-ISIL Coalition or Counter-DAESH Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iraq/coalition-commanders-seek-plan-to-counter-daesh-advance-1.1398681 |title=Coalition commanders seek plan to counter Daesh advance |date=14 October 2014 |agency=Agence France-Presse |work=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a US-led group of nations and [[non-state actor]]s that have committed to "work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL/Daesh". According to a joint statement issued by 59 national governments and the European Union on 3 December 2014, participants in the Counter-ISIL Coalition are focused on multiple lines of effort:&lt;ref name=Anti-ISIL&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Statement Issued by Partners at the Counter-ISIL Coalition Ministerial Meeting |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/234627.htm |date=3 December 2014 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Supporting military operations, capacity building, and training;
# Stopping the flow of foreign terrorist fighters;
# Cutting off ISIL/Daesh's access to financing and funding;
# Addressing associated humanitarian relief and crises; and
# Exposing ISIL/Daesh's true nature (ideological delegitimisation).

[[Operation Inherent Resolve]] is the operational name given by the US to military operations against ISIL and Syrian al-Qaeda affiliates.
[[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF–OIR) is co-ordinating the military portion of the response.

The [[Arab League]], [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] are part of the Counter-ISIL Coalition:&lt;ref name=Anti-ISIL /&gt;

==== Al-Qaeda ====

[[Al-Nusra Front]] is a branch of [[al-Qaeda]] operating in Syria. Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and [[List of bombings during the Syrian Civil War|bombings]], mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Roggio |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/06/suicide_bombers_kill_14_in_dam.php |title=Suicide bombers kill 14 in Damascus |work=Long War Journal |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10067318/Syria-Jabhat-al-Nusra-split-after-leaders-pledge-of-support-for-al-Qaeda.html |title=Syria: Jabhat al-Nusra split after leader's pledge of support for al-Qaeda |work=The Telegraph |date=19 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, after continued tensions, al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relations with ISIL.&lt;ref name="AlQaedaTiesEnd" /&gt; However, ISIL and al-Nusra Front still cooperate with each other occasionally when they fight against the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/jabhat-al-nusra-isis-alliance-could-spread-beyond-damascus-1877819 |title=Jabhat Al-Nusra And ISIS Alliance Could Spread Beyond Damascus |first=Erin |last=Banco |newspaper=International Business Times |date=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eugenio |last=Lilli |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11230622/How-would-a-deal-between-al-Qaeda-and-Isil-change-Syrias-civil-war.html |title=How would a deal between al-Qaeda and Isil change Syria's civil war? |work=The Telegraph |location=London |date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mitchell |last=Prothero |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/03/04/6207631/isis-joins-other-rebels-to-thwart.html |title=ISIS joins other rebels to thwart Syria regime push near Lebanon |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The two groups [ISIL and al-Nusra] share a nihilistic worldview, a loathing for modernity, and for the West. They subscribe to the same perverted interpretations of Islam. Other common traits include a penchant for suicide attacks, and sophisticated exploitation of the internet and social media. Like ISIL, several Al Qaeda franchises are interested in taking and holding territory; AQAP has been much less successful at it. The main differences between Al Qaeda and ISIL are largely political—and personal. Over the past decade, Al Qaeda has twice embraced ISIL (and its previous manifestations) as brothers-in-arms. |first=Bobby|last=Ghosh |source="ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies", ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bobby |last=Ghosh |url=http://qz.com/324909/isil-and-al-qaeda-terrors-frenemies/ |title=ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies |work=Quartz |date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 10 September 2015, an audio message was released by al-Qaeda's leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] criticising ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate and accusing it of "sedition".

Human Rights Watch documented three apparent summary executions and at least ten public floggings by the Islamic Youth Shura Council, which joined ISIL in November. It also documented the beheading of three Derna residents and dozens of seemingly politically motivated assassinations of judges, public officials, members of the security forces and others. Sarah Leah Watson, Director of HRW Middle East and North Africa, said: "Commanders should understand that they may face domestic or international prosecution for the grave rights abuses their forces are committing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/27/libya-extremists-terrorizing-derna-residents |title=Libya: Extremists Terrorizing Derna Residents |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of ISIL's methods, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] has stated that the group "seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey".&lt;ref name=UNRuleOfTerror/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] has held ISIL responsible for the [[ethnic cleansing]] of ethnic and religious minority groups in northern Iraq on a "historic scale", putting entire communities "at risk of being wiped off the map of Iraq". In a special report released on 2 September 2014, the organization described how ISIL had "systematically targeted non-Arab and non-Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, of individuals and forcing more than 830,000 others to flee the areas it has captured since 10 June 2014". Among these people were Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shia, Shabak Shia, [[Kaka'i]], Yazidis and Sabean Mandeans, who have lived together for centuries in [[Nineveh Province|Nineveh]] province, large parts of which have come under ISIL's control.&lt;ref name=amnestyethnic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29026491 |date=2 September 2014 |title=Iraq crisis: Islamic State accused of ethnic cleansing |work=BBC News|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of civilians ===

During the Iraqi conflict in 2014, ISIL released dozens of videos showing its ill treatment of civilians, many of whom had apparently been targeted on the basis of their religion or ethnicity. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned of war crimes being committed in the Iraqi war zone, and disclosed a UN report of ISIL militants murdering Iraqi Army soldiers and 17 civilians in a single street in Mosul.

In Mosul, ISIL has implemented a [[sharia]] school curriculum which bans the teaching of art, music, national history, literature and [[Christianity]].

After capturing cities in Iraq, ISIL issued guidelines on how to wear clothes and veils.

In late 2014, ISIL released a pamphlet that focused on the treatment of female slaves.&lt;ref name="Smith – ISIS Publish Pamphlet"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amelia |last=Smith |url=http://www.newsweek.com/isis-release-questions-and-answers-pamphlet-how-treat-female-slaves-290511 |title=ISIS Publish Pamphlet On How to Treat Female Slaves |work=Newsweek |date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Our faith condones" /&gt; It claims that the [[Quran]] allows fighters to have sex with captives, including adolescent girls, and to beat slaves as discipline.

''[[The Independent]]'' reported in 2015 that the usage of Yazidi sex slaves had created ongoing friction among fighters within ISIL. Sajad Jiyad, a Research Fellow and Associate Member at the [[Iraqi Institute for Economic Reform]], told the newspaper that many ISIL supporters and fighters had been in denial about the trafficking of kidnapped Yazidi women until a ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'' article justifying the practice was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yazidi-sex-slaves-gangraped-in-public-by-isis-fighters-harrowing-accounts-reveal-10166875.html |title=Yazidi sex slaves 'gang-raped in public' by Isis fighters, harrowing accounts reveal |work=Independent |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |last=Saul |first=Heather |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-infighting-tensions-rise-over-use-of-yazidi-sex-slaves-loss-of-kobani-and-poor-services-in-areas-controlled-by-group-10061457.html |title=Isis infighting: Tensions rise over use of Yazidi sex slaves, loss of Kobani and poor services in areas controlled by group |work=Independent |date=21 February 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |last=Saul |first=Heather |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in August 2015 that "[t]he systematic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State in the year since the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution."&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt; The article claims that ISIL is not merely exonerating but sacralising rape, and illustrated this with the testimony of escapees. One 15-year-old victim said that, while she was being assaulted, her rapist "kept telling me this is [[ibadah]]"; a 12-year-old victim related how her assailant claimed that, "by raping me, he is drawing closer to God";&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt; and one adult prisoner told how, when she challenged her captor about repeatedly raping a 12 year old, she was met with the retort, "No, she's not a little girl, she's a slave and she knows exactly how to have sex and having sex with her pleases God."&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt;

In December 2013, two suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of TV station Salaheddin and killed five journalists, after accusing the station of "distorting the image of Iraq's Sunni community". Reporters Without Borders reported that on 7 September 2014, ISIL seized and on 11 October publicly beheaded Raad al-Azzawi, a TV Salaheddin cameraman from the village of Samra, east of Tikrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/reports-isil-executes-iraqi-journalist-20141010194149556427.html |title=ISIL 'publicly executes Iraqi journalist' |date=11 October 2014 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014|October|}}, according to the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, ISIL is holding nine journalists and has nine others under close observation in Mosul and Salahuddin province.&lt;ref name="en.rsf.org" /&gt;

During 2013 and part of 2014, an ISIL unit nicknamed [[The Beatles (terrorist cell)|the Beatles]] acquired and held 12 Western journalists hostage, along with aid workers and other foreign hostages, totalling 23 or 24 known hostages. A Polish journalist Marcin Suder was captured in July 2013 but escaped four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/horror-before-the-beheadings-what-isis-hostages-endured-in-syria.html |title=ISIS Hostages Endured Torture and Dashed Hopes, Freed Cellmates Say |work=The New York Times |first=Rukmini |last=Callimachi |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit [[ISIL beheadings|executed American journalists]] [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] and [[Steven Sotloff]] and released beheading videos. Eight of the other journalists were released for ransom: Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, French journalists Didier François, Edouard Elias, Nicolas Hénin, and Pierre Torres, and Spanish journalists Marc Marginedas, Javier Espinosa, and Ricardo García Vilanova. The unit continues to hold hostage British journalist [[John Cantlie]] and a female aid worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/24/world/middleeast/the-fate-of-23-hostages-in-syria.html |title=The Fates of 23 ISIS Hostages in Syria |first=Karen |last=Yourish |work=The New York Times |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber-security group the [[Citizen Lab]] released a report finding a possible link between ISIL and a digital attack on the Syrian citizen media group [[Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently]] (RSS). Supporters of the media group received an emailed link to an image of supposed airstrikes, but clicking on the link introduced malware to the user's computer that sends details of the user's IP address and system each time it restarts. That information has been enough to allow ISIL to locate RSS supporters. "The group has been targeted for kidnappings, house raids, and at least one alleged targeted killing. At the time of that writing, ISIL was allegedly holding several citizen journalists in Raqqa", according to the Citizen Lab report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Islamic State suspected of cyber-attack on Raqqa opponents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/19/islamic-state-cyber-attack-raqqa-opponents-isis-syria-malware |work=The Guardian |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of cultural and religious heritage ===
{{Main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was destroyed by ISIL in August 2015]]

[[UNESCO]]'s Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] has warned that ISIL is destroying Iraq's cultural heritage, in what she has called "[[cultural cleansing]]". "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it goes hand in hand with genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2014/11/02/iraqs-heritage-needs-protection-from-isl?videoId=346781460 |title=Iraq's heritage needs protection from Islamic State – UNESCO |date=2 November 2014 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saad Eskander]], head of Iraq's National Archives said, "For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief."&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Arraf |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/1108/Islamic-State-seeking-to-delete-entire-cultures-UNESCO-chief-warns-in-Iraq |title=Islamic State seeking to 'delete' entire cultures, UNESCO chief warns in Iraq |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finance its activities, ISIL is stealing artefacts from Syria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Franklin |last=Lamb |title=SYRIA: "Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently" |website=Intifada Palestine |url=http://www.intifada-palestine.com/2014/05/syria-raqqa-slaughtered-silently/ |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |quote=transcript of an interview conducted by the author at the National Museum of Syria with an employee of the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM).

UNESCO has asked for [[United Nations Security Council]] controls on the sale of antiquities, similar to those imposed after the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. UNESCO is working with [[Interpol]], national customs authorities, museums, and major auction houses in attempts to prevent looted items from being sold.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; ISIL occupied [[Mosul Museum]], the second most important museum in Iraq, as it was about to reopen after years of rebuilding following the Iraq War, saying that the statues were against Islam and threatening to destroy the museum's contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Melissa |last1=Block |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/09/330183802/the-plight-of-mosuls-museum-iraqi-antiquities-at-risk-of-ruin |title=The Plight of Mosul's Museum: Iraqi Antiquities At Risk Of Ruin |date=9 July 2014 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickey-7.7.14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Dickey |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/07/isis-is-about-to-destroy-biblical-history-in-iraq.html |title=ISIS Is About to Destroy Biblical History in Iraq |work=The Daily Beast |date=7 July 2014 |access-date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL considers worshipping at graves tantamount to [[idolatry]], and seeks to purify the community of unbelievers. It has used bulldozers to crush buildings and archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="Dickey-7.7.14" /&gt; [[Bernard Haykel]] has described al-Baghdadi's creed as "a kind of untamed [[Wahhabism]]", saying, "For Al Qaeda, violence is a means to an ends{{sic}}; for ISIS, it is an end in itself".{{r|ISIS_NYT}} The destruction by ISIL in July 2014 of the [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|tomb and shrine of the prophet Yunus]] – [[Jonah]] in Christianity – the 13th-century mosque of [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya Abu al-Qassimin]], the 14th-century shrine of prophet Jerjis – [[Saint George|St George]] to Christians – and the attempted destruction of the [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|Hadba]] minaret at the 12th-century [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|Great Mosque of Al-Nuri]] have been described as "an unchecked outburst of extreme Wahhabism".&lt;ref name=Al-Alawi&gt;{{cite web |last1=Al-Alawi |first1=Irfan |title=Extreme Wahhabism on Display in Shrine Destruction in Mosul |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4574/jonah-shrine-destruction |publisher=Gatestone Institute |accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were explosions that destroyed buildings dating back to the [[Assyria]]n era", said [[National Museum of Iraq]] director Qais Rashid, referring to the destruction of the shrine of Yunus. He cited another case where "Daesh (ISIL) gathered over 1,500 manuscripts from convents and other holy places and burnt all of them in the middle of the city square".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-30/islamic-state-pillaging-iraqi-artefacts2c-unesco-warns/5777990 |title=Islamic State: Jihadists destroying and looting Iraqi heritage sites for artefacts, UNESCO warns |publisher=ABC News |agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed the 13th-century BC Assyrian city of [[Nimrud]], believing its sculptures to be idolatrous. [[UNESCO]] head, [[Irina Bokova]], deemed this to be a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nimrud: Outcry as IS bulldozers attack ancient Iraq site |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31760656 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=BBC News|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from the various locations including the Central Library of Mosul (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |publisher=Ibtimes.co.in |date=24 February 2015 |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BCE and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul's establishment families." The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.

'''Isoschizomers''' are pairs of [[restriction enzyme]]s specific to the same [[recognition sequence]]. For example, SphI (CGTAC/G) and BbuI (CGTAC/G) are isoschizomers of each other. The first enzyme discovered which recognizes a given sequence is known as the prototype; all subsequently identified enzymes that recognize that sequence are isoschizomers.  Isoschizomers are isolated from different strains of [[bacteria]] and therefore may require different reaction conditions.

An enzyme that recognizes the same sequence but cuts it differently is a [[neoschizomer]].  Neoschizomers are a specific type (subset) of isoschizomer. For example, [[SmaI]] (CCC/GGG) and XmaI (C/CCGGG) are neoschizomers of each other. Similarly Kpn1 (GGTAC/C) and Acc651 (G/GTACC) are neoschizomers of each other. 
An enzyme that recognizes a slightly different sequence, but produces the same ends is an [[isocaudomer]].

In some cases, only one out of a pair of isoschizomers can recognize both the methylated as well as unmethylated forms of restriction sites. In contrast, the other restriction enzyme can recognize only the unmethylated form of the restriction site.
This property of some isoschizomers allows identification of methylation state of the restriction site while isolating it from a bacterial strain.
For example, the restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI are isoschizomers, as they both recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' when it is unmethylated. But when the second C of the sequence is methylated, only MspI can recognize it while HpaII cannot.

'''''Barbarigo''''' was a [[World War II]] Italian {{sclass-|Marcello|submarine}}. It was built by the [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]], and was commissioned on 19 September 1938.

After early peacetime training activity, and two fruitless missions in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the ''Barbarigo'' was assigned to the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic theater]], reaching its [[BETASOM|base]] in [[Bordeaux]] on 8 September 1940, after an unsuccessful patrol.

From October 1940 to May 1941, she went on three missions around [[Ireland|Irish]] waters, which obtained only the damaging of a merchantman. In July, she sailed to the west of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and obtained its first successes, sinking the British ship ''Macon'' (5135 tls) on 25 July, and then the oiler ''Horn Shell'' (8272 tls), before turning for port. On 22 October, ''Barbarigo'' sailed again, under the command of ''Capitano di Corvetta'' [[Enzo Grossi]], but the patrol was unsuccessful. On the next patrol, the submarine met a lighted ship, but Grossi torpedoed and sank her nonetheless (it was the neutral Spanish ship ''Navemar''), on 23 January 1941.

Afterwards, ''Barbarigo'' was sent to [[Brazil]]ian waters, departing Bordeaux on 30 April. She was responsible for the first Brazilian war action of World War II; she attacked the Brazilian merchant ship ''Comandante Lyra'' on 18 May 1942, without sinking her, and she was chased by Brazilian aero-naval forces for five days. The submarine managed to escape two attacks by Brazilian [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, 2013. Section ''"Amigos, amigos, guerra à parte (War is war)"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May, the ''Barbarigo'' met the cruiser {{USS|Milwaukee|CL-5|6}} and the destroyer {{USS|Moffett|DD-362|6}}; wrongly recognizing the former as a {{sclass-|Maryland|battleship}}, Grossi fired two torpedoes at the cruiser. With himself and his crew convinced to having seen and felt the battleship being struck and sinking, ''Barbarigo'' sailed away, while the American ships had not even been aware of the attack. Grossi reported his sinking, and, despite the doubts and misgivings of BETASOM commander [[Romolo Polacchini]], the action was widely publicized on Italian and German press; Grossi was awarded with a [[Gold Medal of Military Valour]] and promoted to ''Capitano di Fregata'' (Commander). On its way home, ''Barbarigo'' attacked and sank the ship ''Charlbury'' (4836 tls), 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giorgerini|first1=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo : storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi|date=2002|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|isbn=8804505370|pages=535–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August, the submarine sailed again, this time for a mission around the African coast. On the night of 6 October, ''Barbarigo'' met the [[corvette]] {{HMS|Petunia|K79|6}}, and Grossi "recognized" her as a {{sclass-|Mississippi|battleship}}; he fired four torpedoes, and again he was convinced he had successfully sunk the enemy battleship,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Italy Asserts Battleship of U.S. Destroyed: Sinking of 33,000 Ton Vessel By Submarine Not Confirmed From Any Other Source", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 7 October 1942, Volume 49, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Petunia'' had escaped unharmed. ''Barbarigo'' returned to port on the night of 29 October. Again, Grossi's success was widely reported, and he was promoted to ''Capitano di Vascello'' (Captain) and awarded a second Gold Medal; he left the submarine to replace Polacchini as BETASOM commander. After the war, Grossi's actions would be the object of two enquiries in 1949 and 1962, which concluded that he and his crew had been in good faith, but stripped him of his promotions and awards.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgerini, p. 539-43&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 1943, the submarine departed for its last mission as an attack submarine, in which it sunk the ships ''Monte Igueldo'' (3453 tls) on 24 February, ''Alfonso Pena'' (3540 tls) on 2 March, and ''Staghound'' on 3 March, before returning to Bordeaux on 3 April.

After a period of time for repairs, as well as some replacements and retraining of crew, the submarine was converted into a transport to carry [[materiel]] between Germany and Japan in 1943, with guns, torpedoes and all but one periscope being removed; it departed Bordeaux on 16 June, with 130 tons of valuable load, but disappeared. After the war, British records showed that an unidentified submarine had been attacked and presumed sunk between 17 and 19 June, in the area where ''Barbarigo'' might have been.

'''''I-26''''' was a Japanese [[B1 type submarine]] which saw service in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was completed and commissioned at the [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] Dockyard on 6 November 1941, under the command of Commander Yokota Minoru.

==Service history==

===Patrols on the US and Canadian West Coast===
On 7 December 1941, ''I-26'' sank the 2140-ton [[U.S. Army]] chartered lumber freighter ''Cynthia Olson''&lt;ref&gt;Artfiberglass.com, [http://www.artfiberglass.com/ship/co.html The SS ''Cynthia Olson'']&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|300|nmi|lk=in}} off the coast of [[California]] — the first American merchant ship to be sunk by a Japanese submarine in the war.  ''I-26'' had orders not to commence hostilities until 0330 8 December (Tokyo time) -- the anticipated time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''I-26'' found ''Cynthia Olson'' prior to that time, but remained submerged until surfacing near the freighter at 0330 Tokyo time (0800 7 December Hawaiian time or 0900 in the +9 time zone of the sinking.)  ''I-26'' fired a warning shell over ''Cynthia Olson'' from its 14-cm deck gun. ''Cynthia Olson'' stopped and radioed they were being attacked by a submarine. ''I-26'' sunk ''Cynthia Olson'' by gunfire after the crew abandoned ship in lifeboats.  The steamship ''Lurline'' heard the radio message from ''Cynthia Olson'', but the crew of the sunken ship perished at sea while attention was focused on the simultaneous bombing of Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ebbert Webber|Webber, Bert]], ''Retaliation: Japanese Attacks and Allied Countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II'',  Oregon State University Press, 1975, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

After searching unsuccessfully for the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} following the attack on Pearl Harbor, ''I-26'' patrolled off the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].  A scheduled bombardment of American coastal cities on [[Christmas]] eve of 1941 was canceled because of the frequency of coastal air and surface patrols.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Bert, ''Retaliation: Japanese Attacks and Allied Countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II'',  Oregon State University Press, 1975, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;  ''I-26'' was in Yokosuka drydock number 5 on 18 April 1942 when one of the [[Doolittle Raid]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] bombers damaged the carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūhō||2}} in the adjacent drydock number 4.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Bert, ''Retaliation: Japanese Attacks and Allied Countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II'',  Oregon State University Press, 1975, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday 7 June 1942 the 3286-ton freighter ''Coast Trader'' departed [[Port Angeles, Washington]] bound for [[San Francisco]] with a cargo of newsprint. ''I-26'' torpedoed ''Coast Trader'' as it left the Strait of Juan de Fuca that afternoon, and the ship sank in 40 minutes. One crewman died of exposure before the remainder were rescued over the following two days. The United States Navy apparently did not want to acknowledge Japanese submarine activity off the Pacific Coast during the [[Second Happy Time]] and officially attributed the sinking of ''Coast Trader'' to "an internal explosion."&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Bert, ''Retaliation: Japanese Attacks and Allied Countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II'',  Oregon State University Press, 1975, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening of 20 June 1942, while patrolling two miles off the coast of [[British Columbia]], ''I-26'' surfaced and shelled the [[lighthouse]] and [[Radio direction finder|radio-direction-finding (RDF)]] installation at [[Estevan Point]].&lt;ref&gt;Historylink.org, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7166 Japanese submarine sinks the SS Coast Trader on June 7, 1942.]&lt;/ref&gt; This simple act caused a disproportionate effect on coastal shipping, as all lighthouses along the coast were then extinguished for fear of their use by enemy vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Rc-sub.com, [http://www.rc-sub.com/bclass.html Japanese "B" Class Project]&lt;/ref&gt; ''I-26'' returned to [[Yokosuka]] on 7 July 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Bert, ''Retaliation: Japanese Attacks and Allied Countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II'',  Oregon State University Press, 1975, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific actions===
On 31 August 1942, she crippled the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} at {{coord|10|34|S|164|18|E}} with one [[torpedo]] hit (out of six launched).&lt;ref&gt;USS Saratoga Association, [http://www.uss-saratoga.com/saratoga5.pdf Saratoga V]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November, during the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea (American: [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]), she also hit the badly-damaged [[cruiser]] {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|6}} at {{coord|10|33|S|161|03|E}}. ''I-26''’s torpedo set off ''Juneau''’s [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]], blowing the ship in half; only ten of the 650-man crew were ultimately rescued. All five [[Sullivan brothers]] died either in the initial explosion or floating in the water awaiting rescue.&lt;ref&gt;History.navy.mil, [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/j5/juneau-i.htm ''Juneau'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 25–26 October 1944, in the aftermath of the [[Battle off Samar]], ''I-26'' attacked the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Petrof Bay|CVE-80|6}} off [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. ''I-26'' was sunk by either {{USS|Coolbaugh|DE-217|6}} or {{USS|Richard M. Rowell|DE-403|6}}.

The last contact with ''I-26'' was on 25 October; she was officially presumed lost east of Leyte on 21 November 1944.  
''I-26'' was finally removed from the Navy List on 10 March 1945.
''I-26'' was the IJN's third highest scoring submarine in terms of tonnage sunk, sinking more than 51,500 tons.

'''Jerry S. Parr''' (September 16, 1930 – October 9, 2015) was a [[United States Secret Service]] agent. He was one of the agents protecting [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] on the day of his [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]] on March 30, 1981 and is widely credited with helping to save the President's life.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|title=At The Edge Of Death|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/89689|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=October 4, 1999|accessdate=2008-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sue Anne Pressley |title=When History, Destiny Converged|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/29/AR2006032902595_pf.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 30, 2006|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Parr received his B.A. in English and Philosophy from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1962. In 1987, he received his M.S. in pastoral counseling from [[Loyola College in Maryland|Loyola University]] in Maryland.&lt;ref name="ITSS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesecretservice.com/jerrys-ministries|title=In The Secret Service|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordained minister.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/09/politics/secret-service-jerry-parr-dies/index.html|title=Jerry Parr, agent who helped wounded Reagan, dies - CNNPolitics|first=Steve Almasy|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987, Parr was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in Humane Letters from [[Eureka College]].&lt;ref name="ITSS" /&gt;

==Career with the Secret Service==
Parr's interest in joining the Secret Service originated as a boy after watching ''[[Code of the Secret Service]]'' (1939) starring [[Ronald Reagan]] as agent "Brass" Bancroft.{{r|wilber2011}}{{rp|18}} He was working as a lineman for Florida Power and Light in 1962 when he was interviewed by a visiting recruiter for the Secret Service. When asked if he was able to assume the risks of the job, Parr replied it was probably no more dangerous than what he had been doing for the power company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He joined the Secret Service at age 32, the oldest rookie in his class.&lt;ref name="ITSS" /&gt;

Over the next 23 years, Parr conducted 15 foreign and 65 domestic protective surveys for various Presidents and Vice Presidents, and worked with security, intelligence and law enforcement professionals in all 50 states and in 37 countries.&lt;ref name="wpost" /&gt; From 1969-78, he worked for the Foreign Dignitary Division as a mid-level supervisor on the Humphrey, Agnew and Ford details, and directed security for 56 foreign [[Head of State|heads of state]], including Queen Elizabeth of England, Emperor Hirohito of Japan, King Juan Carlos of Spain and Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref name="Newsweek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ITSS" /&gt;

From 1978-1979, he was Special Agent in Charge of the Vice Presidential Protective Division, where he directed security for Vice President Mondale. In 1979, Parr moved to the Presidential Protective Division, where he was Special Agent in Charge and Head of the [[White House]] Detail.&lt;ref name="ITSS"/&gt; There, he directed security for Presidents Carter and Reagan. In 1982, he became Assistant Director of Protective Research, and in 1985, Parr retired from the Secret Service. Parr's story is told in his autobiography, ''In the Secret Service: The True Story Of The Man who Saved President Reagan'' (Tyndale House Publishing), co-authored by his wife Carolyn Parr.

==Assassination attempt==

{{main|Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan}}
On March 30, 1981, [[John Hinckley Jr.]] opened fire on the President as he exited the Washington Hilton Hotel after giving a speech, firing six bullets in 1.7 seconds.&lt;ref name="wilber2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdCLMpSY5qkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rawhide Down: The Near Assassination of Ronad Reagan|author=Wilber, Del Quentin|publisher=Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=0-8050-9346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Parr was pushing Reagan into the limousine, the sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) from his heart.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-king010330-32|[32]]][[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-reagan.com-17|[17]]][[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-trial-20|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-wilber2011-13|[13]]]:224&lt;/sup&gt;

After the Secret Service first announced "shots fired" over its radio network at 2:27&amp;nbsp;p.m., Reagan—[[Secret Service codename|codename]] "Rawhide"—was taken away by the agents in the limousine ("Stagecoach").&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-ss19810330-36|[36]]][[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-wilber2011-13|[13]]]:66&lt;/sup&gt; At first, no one knew that he had been shot, and Parr stated that "Rawhide is OK...we're going to Crown" (the [[White House]]), as he preferred its medical facilities to an unsecured hospital.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-woodward20110311-37|[37]]][[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-ss19810330-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Reagan was in great pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he believed that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-king010330-32|[32]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the president believed that he had cut his lip,&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-woodward20110311-37|[37]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby [[George Washington University Hospital]], which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-ssreport19810504-23|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although Reagan came close to death, the medical team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-king010330-32|[32]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

After the assassination attempt, Jerry Parr was hailed as a hero&lt;ref name="wilber2011" /&gt; and received Congressional commendations for his actions. He later said March 30, 1981 was both the best and the worst day of his life.&lt;ref name="ITSS" /&gt;  Parr came to believe that God had directed his life so that he could one day save the president's, and became a pastor after retiring from the Secret Service in 1985.&lt;sup&gt;[[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan#cite note-wilber2011-13|[13]]]:224&lt;/sup&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kamacuras'''|カマキラス|Kamakirasu|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] film monster which first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1967 film ''[[Son of Godzilla]]''. The name alludes to "kamakiri", the Japanese word for mantis. In its first appearance, the creature was called '''Gimantis''' in the U.S. version.

==Overview==
===Showa===
In ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'', a species of man-sized [[mantis]] lived on Sollgel Island. Later, a radioactive accident that occurred due to a weather experiment mutated the insects into even larger proportions. Now the size of buildings, they became known as Kamacuras. Three Kamacuras found a giant egg and cracked it open to find a [[Minilla|baby Godzilla]]. Before they could eat the infant, [[Godzilla]] arrived on the scene and attacked. Godzilla killed two of the Kamacuras with the third one killed by the giant spider [[Kumonga]]. However, a fourth Kamacuras was seen living on [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monster Island]] in ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]''.

The Showa Kamacuras were 2 meters (6.5 feet) long prior to their mutation and were 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighed 2,800 metric tons (3,086 short tons) after their mutation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Godzilla Compendium. Profiles of the Monsters''; page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millennium===
In ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', Kamacuras made an appearance as one of the many controlled monsters of a race of superior extraterrestrial beings known as the Xiliens. It attacks [[Paris|Paris, France]] and causes damage to one of the EDF's battleships until it is teleported away by an enormous [[UFO]] to make it seem as if the Xiliens eliminated every monster. Eventually, it is discovered that the Xiliens were controlling the monsters, who are returned to finish their rampages. Kamacuras battles Godzilla when it makes landfall in Tokyo. Godzilla's resurfacing from the ocean causes a massive tidal wave that forces Kamacuras to flee and camouflage itself in a large forest. Godzilla is able to flush Kamacuras out with its atomic heat ray and Kamacuras flies at Godzilla at Mach speed, but Godzilla grabs it and impales it on an electrical tower, killing it. The novelization shows Godzilla crushing Kamacura's head with its tail.

The ''Final Wars'' Kamacuras is 40 meters (131 feet) tall, 90 meters (295 feet) long, and weighs 20,000 metric tons (22,046 short tons).&lt;ref&gt;''Toho Special Effects All Monster Encyclopedia. Godzilla: Final Wars''; page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers===
In addition to its slashing forearm blades and ability to fly, Kamacuras was shown in ''Final Wars'' as being able to blend in with its surroundings through a form of [[chameleon]]-like color changing ability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2193">A '''kick chart''' is a form or [[graphics|graph]] used by a [[pregnant]] woman in the later stages to record the activity of her [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=NCT-definition&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nct.org.uk/info/Kick_Chart | publisher = National Childbirth Trust | title = Kick Chart | year = 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224021903/http://www.nct.org.uk/info/Kick_Chart | archivedate = 24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If too few kicks are felt within a specified time (usually 12 hours) this could indicate a problem.&lt;ref name=NCT-definition/&gt; 

A frequent question posed by midwives is how "many times has the baby kicked in the last twelve hours?" The unborn foetus should move five times per hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stillnomore.org/goal7.htm | title = #7.  The Importance of Counting Kicks | publisher = The National Stillbirth Society | date = 10 September 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101108074821/http://www.stillnomore.org/goal7.htm | archivedate = 8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ten times in any twelve-hour period.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In the UK this is regarded as best indication of the health of the baby from the second trimester.

Once routine, use of these charts has declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/antenatalhealth/physicalhealth/babysmovements/ | publisher = BabyCentre L.L.C. | title = Your baby's movements in pregnancy | date = March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since women often forgot to complete them and fetal movement patterns are very varied, leading to unnecessary concern.

==Foetal Kick Counters==

A more recent trend in the United Kingdom has been the replacement of the kick chart with jewelry-based counters. A pregnancy bracelet is a wearable form of kick counter.

The bracelets available work on similar principles: the baby kicks, the mother moves a marker. The idea is that this is more practical than using a pen and paper.

The two most widely advertised bracelets are currently undergoing the patent application process.

He was a son of Southern Tang's founding emperor [[Li Bian]] (Emperor Liezu).  During the reign of his brother [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Li Jing]] (Emperor Yuanzong), he was initially designated the heir, but, having never embraced that role, repeatedly offered to yield the position to Li Jing's son [[Li Hongji]].  Eventually, Li Jing agreed, but Li Hongji, still fearing that Li Jing would change his mind again, had Li Jingsui poisoned to death.

== During Wu ==
Xu Jingsui was born in 920, during the reign of [[Yang Longyan]] the King of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]].&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;  His father, then known as [[Li Bian|Xu Zhigao]], was serving as Wu's junior regent at the Wu capital Guangling (廣陵, in modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]), with his adoptive father (Xu Jingsui's adoptive grandfather) [[Xu Wen]] the regent taking up position at [[Jinling]] and in actual control of the Wu state.&lt;ref name=HFD134&gt;''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties]]'', [[:zh:s:舊五代史/卷134|vol. 134]].&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother was Xu Zhigao's second wife [[Empress Song (Southern Tang)|Lady Song Fujin]], who was also the mother of his older brothers [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Xu Jingtong]] and [[Xu Jingqian]] and younger brother [[Li Jingda|Xu Jingda]].  Xu Jingsui was the third son overall.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;

By 936, Wu's titular ruler was Yang Longyan's younger brother [[Yang Pu]], who had taken imperial title by that point; Xu Jingsui's father Xu Zhigao was the regent, stationed at Jinling, with Xu Jingtong also there serving as his deputy.  The role that Xu Zhigao formerly had during Xu Wen's regency, as junior regent at the Wu capital Guangling, was held by Xu Jingqian,&lt;ref name=HFD134/&gt; who was Xu Zhigao's favorite son.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;  However, in 936, Xu Jingqian fell ill, and was removed from the junior regency and recalled to Jinling in hopes of recuperation.  Xu Jingsui, then 16, was sent to Guangling to serve as junior regent, carrying the titles of ''Menxia Shilang'' (門下侍郎) and ''Can Zhengshi'' (參政事), as a ''de facto'' [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ280&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷280|vol. 280]].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Xu Jingqian would not recover, however, and would die in 937.)&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷281|vol. 281]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== During Southern Tang ==

=== During Li Bian's reign ===
In 937, Yang Pu yielded the throne to Xu Zhigao, ending Wu.  Xu Zhigao took the throne as emperor of a new state of [[Southern Tang]].  He created Xu Jingsui, who had arrived at Jinling as part of the procession of Wu officials offering the throne to him on Yang's behalf, the Prince of Ji.  He also commissioned Xu Jingsui the titles of ''Shizhong'' (侍中), defender of the eastern capital (as Jinling became the Southern Tang capital, with Guangling becoming the eastern capital with the name of Jiangdu (江都)), and mayor of Jiangdu.  He had Xu Jingsui lead the officials who were assigned offices in Jiangdu back to Jiangdu.  In 938, Xu Zhigao recalled Xu Jingsui to Jinling, to participate in the matters of the office of chancellors, overseeing the executive bureau of government (尚書省, ''Shangshu Sheng'').&lt;ref name=ZZTJ281&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷281|vol. 281]].&lt;/ref&gt;  When Yang died later in 938, it was Xu Jingsui that Xu Zhigao sent to attend to the funereal train.  Xu Jingsui was overcome with grief, and those who saw him were touched.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;

In 939, Xu Zhigao changed his surname back to his birth name of [[Li (李)|Li]], and took a new name of Li Bian.  His children also changed their names to Li, and Xu Jingsui thus took the name of Li Jingsui.  Not long after, Li Jingsui's title was changed to Prince of Shou.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ282&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷282|vol. 282]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 942, when the senior statesman [[Song Qiqiu]] insisted on taking over the executive bureau, Li Bian had Li Jingsui yield the oversight of the executive bureau to him, and instead had Li Jingsui oversee the legislative (中書省, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') and examination (門下省, ''Menxia Sheng'') bureaus instead, but also having Li Jingsui's older brother Li Jingtong (whose name had been changed to Li Jing by this point) oversee all three bureaus.  Shortly after, Song's close associate Xia Changtu (夏昌圖) was involved in a corruption scandal, but Song initially did sentence him to death.  Li Bian, in anger, personally ordered Xia's death.  Song thus resigned his oversight over the executive bureau and was no longer meeting the emperor.  Li Bian had to send Li Jingsui to his mansion to comfort him and promise to make him the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern [[Nanchang]], [[Jiangxi]]) in order for him to come to the palace, upon which Song was given the Zhennan command.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ283&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷283|vol. 283]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During Li Jing's reign ===
Li Bian died in 943.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ283/&gt;  Li Jing, as the oldest son, was expected to be the heir, and while he initially offered the throne to Li Jingsui instead, Li Jingsui earnestly declined, and Li Jing thereafter took the throne.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;  He created Li Jingsui the greater title of Prince of Yan.  Shortly after, Li Jing, believing that it was Li Bian's will that he pass the throne in succession to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda, created Li Jingsui (who then was also carrying the titles of ''Zhongshu Ling'' (中書令), mayor of Jinling, and military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]) — a completely honorary title as Tianxiong was under the rule of Southern Tang's northern neighbor [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]) the Prince of Qi — a title that Li Bian and Li Jing successively carried before they became emperor.  He also had Li Jingsui take up residence at the eastern palace — traditionally, the residence for the [[Crown Prince]] — thereby effectively designating him as heir.  He also publicly declared his intention to pass the throne to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda (who took over the title of Prince of Yan).  Both Li Jingsui and Li Jingda repeatedly declined their new titles, but were not allowed to.  However, Li Jingsui still had no desire to be heir, and decided to take, as his [[courtesy name]], Tuishen — from the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' passage "withdraw your body after you complete your accomplishment" (功成名遂身退, ''gongchengming suishentui'') — to show his lack of desire to be heir.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ283/&gt;  (Li Jing's close associate [[Feng Yanji]] wanted to use this opportunity to block off the other officials' access to Li Jing, and therefore persuaded Li Jing to issue an edict that the officials could only meet with and report to Li Jingsui; however, when the senior imperial guard officer Jia Chong (賈崇), weeping, pointed out that this meant that Li Jing would not be able to see what was actually occurring in the imperial administration (which was what Feng wanted) and that, if the edict took effect, Jia himself would never be able to see the emperor again, Li Jing withdrew the edict.)&lt;ref name=ZZTJ283/&gt;

In 947, Li Jing formally created Li Jingsui Crown Prince.  (Li Jingda received the title of Prince of Qi, and Li Jing's oldest son [[Li Hongji]], previously the Prince of Nanchang, became the Prince of Yan.)  There was an occasion when Li Jingsui was meeting with his staff, but was paying attention to jade while staff member Zhang Yi (張易) wanted to discuss his (Li Jingsui's) behavior.  Zhang, in anger, grabbed a jade cup that Li Jingsui was holding and threw it on the ground, breaking it and shocking the entire staff.  Instead of becoming angry, Li Jingsui apologized, and thereafter treated Zhang better.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷286|vol. 286]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On a subsequent occasion, when Li Jing wanted to send Zhang on an embassy, over the sea, to [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]], Li Jingsui personally wrote a petition to Li Jing urging against it, stating, "Zhang Yi is man who can support the state.  He should be kept around to offer advice day and night.  He should not be sent over the unpredictable sea."  Li Jing, however, responded, "Zhang Yi is an unusual man, such that even the god of the sea would fear him."  He sent Zhang on the embassy anyway.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;

By 958, Southern Tang had lost a war against [[Later Zhou]] (the successor state to [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]], which had succeeded Later Jin), and had been forced to cede its territory north of the [[Yangtze River]] to Later Zhou, as well as formally submit as a subject).  Li Jingsui used this opportunity to submit, 10 times, petitions offering to yield his crown prince position, particularly citing his own lack of contributions to the military effort and Li Hongji's contributions in repelling the attack of Later Zhou's vassal state [[Wuyue]] during the war.  Li Jing accepted his petition and created Li Hongji Crown Prince to succeed him.  Li Jingsui was created the Prince of Jin, and was given the additional titles of ''Tiance Shangjiangjun'' (天策上將軍), generalissimo of Jiangnan West Circuit (i.e., Zhennan, but Li Jing intentionally using the more archaic [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] title for it for impressive effect), grand commandant of Zhennan's capital Hong Prefecture (洪州), ''Taiwei'' (太尉), and ''Shangshu Ling'' (尚書令).&lt;ref name=ZZTJ294/&gt;

Upon Li Jingsui's arrival at Zhennan, he, citing the fact that, given the recent losses to Later Zhou, Zhennan was now potentially exposed to war as well, requested an official as his deputy.  Li Jing thus sent Li Zhenggu (李徵古) to Zhennan to serve as his deputy military governor.  However, Li Zhenggu was arrogant and dominant, such that even though Li Jingsui was himself magnanimous and relaxed, he became unable to bear Li Zhenggu as time went by.  He considered killing Li Zhenggu and then report to Li Jing to confess, but was urged not to by his close associates.  He became unhappy, however.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ294/&gt;

Meanwhile, Li Hongji, as crown prince, had sometimes carried out unlawful deeds.  Li Jing, angry, had once caned Li Hongji, and, as he did, stated, "I will summon Jingsui back!"  There also happened be a time when false accusations were laid against the son of Li Jingsui's staff member Yuan Congfan (袁從範), such that Li Jingsui was considering executing Yuan's son.  When Li Hongji heard of this, he secretly sent Yuan poison to encourage Yuan to poison Li Jingsui.  On a day after Li Jingsui returned to his mansion after playing polo and was thirsty, Yuan gave him milk laced with poison.  Li Jingsui drank it and died.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ294/&gt;  Li Jing was greatly saddened.  His servants, wanting to lessen his sadness, falsely stated to him that when Li Jingsui fell ill, he stated, "[[Shangdi]] is having me replace Xu Jingyang (i.e., the [[Taoism|Taoist]] deity Xu Xun)."  Li Jing believed them, and did not look into the matter further.&lt;ref name=SGCQ19/&gt;  He posthumously honored Li Jingsui as a crown prince.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ294/&gt;

{{Tort law}}

'''Malicious prosecution''' is a [[common law]] intentional [[tort]], while like the tort of [[abuse of process]],  its elements include (1) intentionally (and [[Malice (law)|maliciously]]) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action ([[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]]) that is (2) brought without [[probable cause]] and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution.  In some jurisdictions, the term "malicious prosecution" denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term "malicious use of process" denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.

Criminal prosecuting attorneys and judges are protected from tort liability for malicious prosecution by doctrines of prosecutorial immunity and judicial immunity. Moreover, the mere filing of a complaint cannot constitute an abuse of process. The parties who have abused or misused the process have gone beyond merely filing a lawsuit. The taking of an appeal, even a frivolous one, is not enough to constitute an abuse of process. The mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit, even for an improper purpose, is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.

Declining to expand the tort of malicious prosecution, a unanimous California Supreme Court in the case of ''Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker'', 47 Cal. 3d 863, 873 (1989) observed: "While the filing of [[frivolous lawsuit]]s is certainly improper and cannot in any way be condoned, in our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself, rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded."&lt;ref&gt;Per the case of ''Lossing v. Superior Court'' (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 635, 638-640[255 Cal. Rptr. 18]; see also Tellefsen v. Key System Transit Lines, supra, 198 Cal.App.2d at p. 615 [Court of Appeal has remedies for frivolous appeals]; Green v. Uccelli (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1112, 1122-1123 [255 Cal.Rptr. 315]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The tort originates in the (now defunct) legal maxim that "the King pays no costs"; that is, [[The Crown]] could not be forced to pay the legal costs of a person it prosecuted, even if that person was found innocent. As ''[[The London Magazine]]'' stated in 1766: "if a groundless and vexatious prosecution be commenced in the King's name, his ministers who commenced, or advised commencing that prosecution, ought at least to be obliged to pay the costs which an innocent subject has thereby been put to".

==U.S. use of English Rule==
Sixteen [[U.S. state]]s require another element of malicious prosecution.{{fact|date=October 2018}}  This element, commonly called the English Rule, states that, in addition to fulfilling all other malicious prosecution elements, one must also prove injury other than the normal downside of being sued.  This rule is limited to equitable damages, such as loss of profit, and excludes damages that cannot be measured by the law (''e.g.'', damage to reputation).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Canadian law==
[[Law of Canada|Canadian jurisprudence]] has changed in that if any individual takes legal action that meet the above criteria, they may be sued. Legal action may be taken against the [[police]] or the [[Crown Attorney]] or the [[Attorney General#Canada|Attorney General]], as they are no longer exempt from suit.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The tort of malicious prosecution was recently reviewed in 2009 by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Miazga v. Kvello Estate]]'', and specifically how it applied to public prosecutors in Canada. The court outlined the four required elements for the tort of malicious prosecution: (i) The prosecution must be initiated by the defendant; (ii) The prosecution must be terminated in the plaintiff's favour. (iii) There was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds to commence or continue the prosecution; and (iv) The defendant was motivated to commence or continue to the prosecution due to malice.

In 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the contents of plea bargaining negotiations held in the context of criminal cases could be admitted as evidence in the context of a civil suit for malicious prosecution, despite the general evidentiary rule prohibiting adducing settlement discussions into proof at trial. More specifically, the Court held that introducing into evidence the contents of such negotiations was possible when it tended to demonstrate that the prosecution initiated or maintained criminal charges on the basis of improper motives.&lt;ref&gt;Singh c. Montreal (City of), 2014 QCCA 307 (CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/g36bd&gt; retrieved on 2014-11-07. Leave to Supreme Court of Canada refused on November 6th 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Notably, the tort of malicious prosecution only protects the right of defendants to be free of frivolous lawsuits brought by malicious plaintiffs.  For a variety of reasons grounded in [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], courts have consistently refused to authorize the converse — a tort of malicious defense which would protect the right of plaintiffs to be free of frivolous defenses raised by defendants.&lt;ref&gt;''Bertero v. National General Corp.'', 13 Cal. 3d 43, 52, 529 P.2d 608, 118 Cal. Rptr. 184 (1974) (citing ''Ritter v. Ritter'', 381 Ill. 549, 46 N.E. 2d 41 (1943)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPA3 family consists of bacterial multicomponent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[antiporter]]s. The best characterized systems are the PhaABCDEFG system of ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63.1.1 TC# 2.A.63.1.1]) that functions in pH adaptation and as a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux system, and the MnhABCDEFG system of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63.1.3 TC# 2.A.63.1.3]) that functions as a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63|title=2.A.63 The Monovalent Cation (K+ or Na+):Proton Antiporter-3 (CPA3) Family|website=Transporter Classification Databse|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology ==
A homologous, but only partially sequenced, system was earlier reported to catalyze Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport in an alkalophilic ''[[Bacillus]]'' strain. PhaA and PhaD are respectively homologous to the ND5 and ND4 subunits of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pumping [[NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.d.1 TC #3.D.1]). Homologous protein subunits from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in ''[[Bacillus subtilis]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moparthi VK, Kumar B, Mathiesen C, Hägerhäll C | title = Homologous protein subunits from Escherichia coli NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–36 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21236240 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologues of PhaA, B, C and D and Nha1, 2, 3 and 4 of an alkalophilic ''Bacillus'' strain are the Yuf(Mrp)T, U, V and D genes of ''Bacillus subtilis''. In this system, YufT is believed to be responsible for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter activity, but it does not have activity in the absence of other constituents of the operon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kosono S, Morotomi S, Kitada M, Kudo T | title = Analyses of a Bacillus subtilis homologue of the Na+/H+ antiporter gene which is important for pH homeostasis of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.

== Structure ==
The seven Pha proteins are of the following sizes (in #aas) and exhibit the following putative numbers of transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs): 
* PhaA - 725 and 17
* PhaB - 257 and 5
* PhaC - 115 and 3 
* PhaD - 547 and 13 
* PhaE - 161 and 3 
* PhaF - 92 and 3 
* PhaG - 120 and 3 
All are predicted to be integral membrane proteins.

Corresponding values for the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' Mnh system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiramatsu T, Kodama K, Kuroda T, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = A putative multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter from Staphylococcus aureus | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 24 | pages = 6642–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9852009 | pmc = 107768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* MnhA - 801 and 18 
* MnhB - 142 and 4
* MnhC - 113 and 3 
* MnhD - 498 and 13
* MnhE - 159 and 4
* MnhF - 97 and 3 
* MnhG - 118 and 3 
In view of the complexity of the system, large variation in subunit structure, and the homology with NDH family protein constituents, a complicated energy coupling mechanism, possibly involving a redox reaction, cannot be ruled out.

== Function ==
Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does, but K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; do not, support significant [[Antiporter|antiport]] by the [[Gram-positive bacteria]]l systems (TC# 2.A.6.3.1.2 and TC# 2.A.6.3.1.3).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swartz TH, Ito M, Ohira T, Natsui S, Hicks DB, Krulwich TA | title = Catalytic properties of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus members of the secondary cation/proton antiporter-3 (Mrp) family are revealed by an optimized assay in an Escherichia coli host | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 189 | issue = 8 | pages = 3081–90 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17293423 | pmc = 1855852 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00021-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporters have alkaline pH optima and apparent K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that are among the lowest reported for bacterial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporters.

The generalized reaction believed to be catalyzed by CPA3 family members is:&lt;blockquote&gt;[K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Pastry War''' ({{lang-es|Guerra de los pasteles}}, {{lang-fr|Guerre des Pâtisseries}}),&lt;ref&gt;Commonly known in Spanish as the ''Primera intervención francesa en México'', "First French intervention in Mexico".&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''First French intervention in Mexico''' or the '''First Franco-Mexican War''' (1838–1839), began in November 1838 with the naval blockade of some Mexican ports and the capture of the fortress of [[San Juan de Ulúa]] in Veracruz by [[French Armed Forces|French forces]] sent by King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]]. It ended several months later in March 1839 with a British-brokered peace. The intervention followed many claims by French nationals of losses due to unrest in [[Mexico]].

This incident was the first and lesser of Mexico's two 19th-century wars with France, being followed by the [[French intervention in Mexico|French invasion of 1861–67]] which supported the short reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] who was [[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian|executed by firing squad]] at the end of that later conflict.&lt;ref name="Napoléon" /&gt;

== Background ==
During the early years of the new Mexican republic there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control of the country. The fighting often resulted in the destruction or looting of private property. Average citizens had few options for claiming compensation as they had no representatives to speak on their behalf. Foreigners whose property was damaged or destroyed by rioters or bandits were usually  also unable to obtain compensation from the Mexican government and they began to appeal to their own governments for help and compensation.

Commercial relationships between France and Mexico existed prior to France's recognition of [[Independence of Mexico|Mexico's independence]] in 1830, and after the establishment of diplomatic relationships France rapidly became Mexico's third largest trade partner. However, France had yet to secure trade agreements similar to those that the United States and Great Britain (then Mexico's two largest trade partners) had, and as a result of this French goods were subject to higher taxes
.&lt;ref name="Penot"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Penot|first1=Jacques|title=L'expansion commerciale française au Mexique et les causes du conflit franco-mexicain de 1838-1839|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/hispa_0007-4640_1973_num_75_1_4100#hispa_0007-4640_1973_num_75_1_T1_0180_0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology of the conflict==
[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|French troops under [[Prince François, Prince of Joinville|Prince de Joinville]] attack residence of General [[Mariano Arista|Arista]] in Veracruz, 1838.]]
In a complaint to King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], a French [[pastry]] chef known only as Monsieur Remontel claimed that in 1832 Mexican officers looted his shop in [[Metro Tacubaya|Tacubaya]] (then a town on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]]). Remontel demanded 60,000 pesos as reparations for the damage (his shop was valued at less than 1,000 pesos).&lt;ref name="Aguilar Casas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plumas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coerver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Christopher|title=The Pastry War, 175 Years Ago|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-pastry-war-175-years-ago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of Remontel's complaint (which gave its name to the ensuing conflict) and of other complaints from French nationals (among them the looting in 1828 of French shops at the [[Zócalo|Parian market]] and the execution in 1837 of a French citizen accused of piracy) in 1838 prime minister [[Louis-Mathieu Molé]] demanded from Mexico the payment of 600,000 [[Spanish dollar|pesos]] (3 million [[Francs]]) in damages,&lt;ref name="Penot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plumas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acuerdo entre México y Francia pone fin a la Guerra de los Pasteles|url=http://plumaslibres.com.mx/2015/03/09/acuerdo-entre-mexico-y-francia-pone-fin-a-la-guerra-de-los-pasteles/}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enormous sum for the time, when the typical daily wage in Mexico City was about one peso (8 [[Mexican real]]s).

When president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] made no payment, the King of France ordered a fleet under Rear Admiral [[Charles Baudin]] to declare and carry out a [[blockade]] of all Mexican ports on the Atlantic coast from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to the [[Rio Grande]], to bombard the Mexican fortress of [[Battle of Veracruz (1838)|San Juan de Ulúa]], and to seize the city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], which was the most important port on the Gulf coast. French forces captured Veracruz by December 1838 and Mexico declared war on France.

With trade cut off, the Mexicans began smuggling imports via [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi, Republic of Texas]] and into Mexico. Fearing that France would blockade the Republic's ports as well, a battalion of Texan forces began patrolling [[Corpus Christi Bay]] to stop Mexican smugglers. One smuggling party abandoned their cargo of about a hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the mouth of the bay, thus giving [[Flour Bluff]] its name. The United States, ever watchful of its relations with Mexico, sent the schooner ''[[USRC Woodbury (1837)|Woodbury]]'' to help the French in their blockade &lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nofi" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Nofi|first1=Albert A.|title=The Alamo and the Texas War for Independence|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, acting without explicit government authority, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], known for his military leadership, came out of retirement from his hacienda near [[Xalapa]] and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz. He offered his services to the government, which ordered him to fight the French by any means necessary. He led Mexican forces against the French. In a skirmish with the rear guard of the French, Santa Anna was wounded in the leg by French grapeshot. His leg was amputated and buried with full military honors.&lt;ref name=Orange&gt;[http://orangeleader.com/local/x2056600153/Santa-Anna-s-Leg "Santa Anna's Leg"], ''The Orange Leader'' (Orange, Texas)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104115445/http://orangeleader.com/local/x2056600153/Santa-Anna-s-Leg |date=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting his wounds with eloquent propaganda, Santa Anna catapulted back to power.

==Peace restored==
The French forces withdrew on 9 March 1839 after a peace treaty was signed. As part of said treaty the Mexican government agreed to pay 600,000 [[peso]]s as damages to French citizens while France received promises for future trade commitments in place of war indemnities. However, this amount was never paid and that was later used as one of the [[Casus belli|justifications]] for the second [[French intervention in Mexico]] of 1861.&lt;ref name="Aguilar Casas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Napoléon" /&gt;

Following the Mexican victory in 1867 and the collapse of the second French empire in 1870, Mexico and France would not resume diplomatic relationships until 1880 when both countries left behind claims related to the wars.&lt;ref name=Coerver&gt;Coerver, Don M.

'''Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)''' is a form of [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of [[pregnancy]] and up to six months [[postpartum]].  As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the [[left ventricular ejection fraction]] (EF) with associated [[congestive heart failure]] and an increased risk of [[atrial]] and [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] [[arrhythmias]], [[thromboembolism]] (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even [[sudden cardiac death]].  In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.283.9.1183  |vauthors=Pearson GD, Veille JC, Rahimtoola S, etal |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Office of Rare Diseases (National Institutes of Health) workshop recommendations and review |journal=JAMA |volume=283 |issue=9 |pages=1183–8 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10703781  |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/283/9/1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkayam2005"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Elkayam U, Akhter MW, Singh H, etal |title=Pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy: clinical characteristics and a comparison between early and late presentation |journal=Circulation |volume=111 |issue=16 |pages=2050–5 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15851613 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000162478.36652.7E |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/111/16/2050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sliwa K, Fett J, Elkayam U |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |pages=687–93 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16920474 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murali S, Baldisseri MR |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Crit.

PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior history of heart disease and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. [[Echocardiogram]] is used to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of treatment for PPCM.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkayam2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

The cause of PPCM is unknown.  Currently, researchers are investigating cardiotropic viruses, [[autoimmunity]] or [[immune system]] dysfunction, other toxins that serve as triggers to immune system dysfunction, [[micronutrient]] or trace mineral definciencies, and genetics as possible components that contribute to or cause the development of PPCM.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansari"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansari AA, Fett JD, Carraway RE, Mayne AE, Onlamoon N, Sundstrom JB |title=Autoimmune mechanisms as the basis for human peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=301–24 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12402414 |doi=10.1385/CRIAI:23:3:301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of PPCM begins with an unknown trigger (possibly a cardiotropic virus or other yet unidentified catalyst) that initiates an inflammatory process in the heart. Consequently, heart muscle cells are damaged; some die or become scar tissue. Scar tissue has no ability to contract; therefore, the effectiveness of the pumping action of the heart is decreased. Also, damage to the cytoskeletal framework of the heart causes the heart to enlarge, stretch or alter in shape, also decreasing the heart's systolic function or output. The initial inflammatory process appears to cause an autoimmune or immune dysfunctional process, which in turn fuels the initial inflammatory process. Progressive loss of heart muscle cells leads to eventual heart failure.&lt;ref name="Fett2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fett JD |title=Understanding peripartum cardiomyopathy, 2008 |journal=Int. J. Cardiol. |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18590935 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.03.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: [[orthopnea]] (difficulty breathing while lying flat), [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath on exertion), pitting [[edema]] (swelling), cough, frequent night-time urination, excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy (1-2+ kg/week; two to four or more pounds per week), [[palpitations]] (sensation of racing heart-rate, skipping beats, long pauses between beats, or fluttering), and chest pain.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;

The shortness of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to take a deep or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs.  Also, patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better.  These symptoms, swelling, and/or cough may be indications of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs) resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM.

Unfortunately, patients and clinicians sometimes dismiss early symptoms because they appear to be typical of normal pregnancy.  Yet, early detection and treatment are critically important to the patient with PPCM.  Delays in diagnosis and treatment of PPCM are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FettChristie"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fett JD, Christie LG, Carraway RD, Ansari AA, Sundstrom JB, Murphy JG |title=Unrecognized peripartum cardiomyopathy in Haitian women |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=161–6 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15961090 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2005.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that occasionally patients present with other signs or symptoms.  This is demonstrated by one report of a woman with [[liver failure]] five weeks postpartum who was being considered for liver transplant.  An echocardiogram was performed and revealed PPCM and heart failure as the cause of her severe liver failure.  Conventional heart failure medications were administered.  She survived and completely recovered from both the liver failure and PPCM.&lt;ref name="Fussell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fussell KM, Awad JA, Ware LB |title=Case of fulminant hepatic failure due to unrecognized peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=891–3 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15818120 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000158517.25962.8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also quite common for women to present with evidence of having an [[embolus]] (clot) passing from the heart to a vital organ, causing such complications as [[stroke]], loss of circulation to a limb, even [[coronary artery]] occlusion (blockage) with typical [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).&lt;ref name="Lasinska"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF03016693 |vauthors=Lasinska-Kowara M, Dudziak M, Suchorzewska J |title=Two cases of postpartum cardiomyopathy initially misdiagnosed for pulmonary embolism |journal=Can J Anaesth |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=773–7 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11546718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, it is paramount that clinicians hold a high suspicion of PPCM in any peri- or postpartum patient where unusual or unexplained symptoms or presentations occur.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fett2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fussell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lasinska"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The following screening tool may be useful to patients and medical professionals in determining the need to take further action to diagnose symptoms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fett JD |title=Validation of a self-test for early diagnosis of heart failure in peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Critical Pathways in Cardiology |issue=10 |pages=44–45 |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Early detection and treatment are associated with higher rates of recovery and decreased morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FettChristie"/&gt;

Treatment for PPCM is similar to treatment for congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure treatment includes the use of diuretics, beta blockers (B-B), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) after delivery.  Diuretics, preferably [[furosemide]], help the body to get rid of excess water weight and also lower blood pressure.  ACE-I and B-B improve blood circulation and contribute to the reversal of the immune system dysfunction associated with PPCM.  If ACE-I is not well tolerated by the patient, it can be replaced by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).    Hydralazine with nitrates may replace ACE-I in [[breastfeeding]] mothers or before delivery; however, evidence suggests that this course of treatment may not be as effective as ACE-I but beneficial when necessary.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fett2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FettChristie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amos"/&gt;

If EF is less than 35%, [[anticoagulation]] is indicated, as there is a greater risk of developing left ventricular thrombi (blood clots).  Sometimes implantation of a [[left ventricular assist device]] (LVAD) or even [[heart transplant]] also becomes necessary.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fett2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aziz"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aziz TM, Burgess MI, Acladious NN, etal |title=Heart transplantation for peripartum cardiomyopathy: a report of three cases and a literature review |journal=Cardiovasc Surg |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=565–7 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10499901 |doi=10.1016/S0967-2109(99)00014-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that the patient receives regular follow-up care including frequent echocardiograms to monitor improvement or the lack thereof, particularly after changes of medical treatment regimes.

Patients who do not respond to initial treatment, defined as left ventricular EF remaining below 20% at two months or below 40% at three months with conventional treatment may merit further investigation, including cardiac [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[cardiac catheterization]], and endomyocardial biopsy for special staining and for viral [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) analysis. Antiviral therapy, immunoabsorption, intravenous [[gamma globulin]], or other immunomodulation therapy may then be considered accordingly, but following a controlled research-type protocol.&lt;ref name="Fett2008"/&gt;

Since no one knows for sure exactly when to discontinue treatment, even when recovery occurs quickly, it is still recommended that both ACE-I and B-B be continued for at least one year after diagnosis.&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The most recent studies indicate that with newer conventional heart failure treatment consisting of [[diuretics]], [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[beta blockers]], the survival rate is very high at 98% or better, and almost all PPCM patients improve with treatment.&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amos AM, Jaber WA, Russell SD |title=Improved outcomes in peripartum cardiomyopathy with contemporary treatments|journal=Am.

It is a misconception that hope for recovery depends upon improvement or recovery within the first six to 12 months of diagnosis.  Many women continue to improve or recover even years after diagnosis with continued medicinal treatment.&lt;ref name="SliwaFett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fett2005"/&gt;  Once fully recovered, if there is no subsequent pregnancy, the possibility of relapse or recurrence of heart failure is minimal.&lt;ref name="Amos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;

Subsequent pregnancy should be avoided when left ventricular function has not recovered and the EF is lower than 55%.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkayam2001"/&gt;  However, many women who have fully recovered from PPCM have gone on to have successful subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Fett2008"/&gt;  A significant study reports that the risk for recurrence of heart failure in recovered PPCM patients as a result of subsequent pregnancy is approximately 21% or better.&lt;ref name="Elkayam2001"/&gt;  The chance of relapse may be even smaller for those with normal contractile reserve as demonstrated by stress echocardiography.&lt;ref name="Lampert"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(97)80034-8 |vauthors=Lampert MB, Weinert L, Hibbard J, Korcarz C, Lindheimer M, Lang RM |title=Contractile reserve in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and recovered left ventricular function |journal=Am.

Where relapse occurs, conventional treatment should be resumed, including [[hydralazine]] with [[nitrates]] plus beta-blockers during pregnancy, or ACE-inhibitors plus beta-blockers following pregnancy.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that the incidence of PPCM in the United States is between 1 in 1300 to 4000 live births.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fett2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fett JD, Christie LG, Carraway RD, Murphy JG |title=Five-year prospective study of the incidence and prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy at a single institution |journal=Mayo Clin.

While the use of [[tocolytic]] agents or the development of [[preeclampsia]] (toxemia of pregnancy) and [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] (PIH) may contribute to the worsening of heart failure, they do not cause PPCM; the majority of women have developed PPCM who neither received tocolytics nor had preeclampsia nor PIH.&lt;ref name="Fett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SliwaForster"/&gt;

'''Pinhead''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Hellraiser (franchise)|''Hellraiser'' series]], first appearing as an unnamed figure in the [[Clive Barker]] novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="dread"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/14877/doug-bradley-talks-hellraiser-legacy/|title=Doug Bradley Talks Hellraiser Legacy|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Pinhead" is derived from a [[sobriquet]] given to him by the crew of the first ''[[Hellraiser]]'' film; he is first credited as such in ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]''. Nearly thirty years after ''The Hellbound Heart'' was published, the character was given the designations the '''Hell Priest''' and the '''Cold Man''' in the sequels that followed, ''[[The Scarlet Gospels]]'' and ''Hellraiser: The Toll''.&lt;!-- Cited below. --&gt;

Pinhead is one of the leaders of the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites]], formerly humans but transformed into creatures which reside in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] realm, who travel to Earth through a puzzle box called the [[Lemarchand's box|Lament Configuration]] in order to harvest human souls. His origins and the nature of the Cenobites vary depending upon the medium: while the character began as an [[amorality|amoral]] entity blindly devoted to the practice of experimental [[sadomasochism]], later depictions have portrayed him as explicitly evil and even demonic in origin.

The character's appearance in 1987's ''Hellraiser'' marked a significant departure from the standard 1980s depiction of [[Horror film|horror movie]] [[villain]]s, who tended to either be completely mute, or provide glib commentary while killing their victims. Rather, Pinhead was depicted as quiet yet articulate and intelligent, drawing influence from classical cinematic depictions of [[Count Dracula]].&lt;ref name="evo"/&gt;

==Appearances==

===Literature===
[[File:PinheadComic1.jpg|150px|thumb|Cover of ''Pinhead'' #1 (Dec. 1991). Art by [[Jim Sanders III]].]]
Pinhead first appears in Clive Barker's [[novella]] ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]'' (1986), in which he only appears in the story's beginning, and is portrayed as a sexually ambiguous follower of the "Engineer":

{{quote|Its voice, unlike that of its companion, was light and breathy-the voice of an excited girl. Every inch of its head had been tattooed with an intricate grid, and at every intersection of horizontal and vertical axes a jeweled pin driven through to the bone. Its tongue was similarly decorated.|sign=''The Hellbound Heart'', Clive Barker, ch. 1&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;[http://photo.goodreads.com/documents/1240860240books/52635.pdf ''The Hellbound Heart'' by Clive Barker]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The character appears in various ''Hellraiser'' comics and received his own comic miniseries, entitled ''Pinhead'', published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']] [[Epic Comics]] imprint.&lt;ref name="MovieManiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/Comic_Maniac.htm |title=Movie Maniac Comic Books |publisher=Iconsoffright.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the comic book series, Pinhead is depicted as the latest incarnation of the cenobite spirit [[Xipe Totec]], an entity derived from [[Aztec mythology]]. In the ''Harrowing'' storyline, Pinhead is revealed to have been romantically involved with a cenobite named Merkova, who was killed by the disciples of Morte Mamme, the sister and rival of Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellraiser: The Harrowing Part 2'' written by Clive Barker and illustrated by Tristin Shane, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pinhead/[[Marshal Law (comics)|Marshal Law]] crossover series, it is revealed that Pinhead's human incarnation, '''Captain Spencer''', took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marshal Law Vs Pinhead-Law in Hell''. Two issue series, Epic Comics 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Spencer has a cameo appearance in the novel ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]'' by [[Kim Newman]], in which he is working as an agent of [[the Diogenes Club]]. Suffering from [[shell shock]], Spencer is [[wiktionary: invalid#Verb|invalided out]] of the army after hammering nails into his own skull (in his introduction to Newman's collection ''The Original Doctor Shade and Other Stories'', [[Neil Gaiman]] claims that Kim Newman was part of a group of friends who inspired the depiction of the Cenobites).&lt;ref&gt;http://dangerousminds.net/comments/hell_on_earth_behind_the_scenes_of_hellraiser_and_its_sequels&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Barker began writing a series of ''Hellraiser'' comics for ''BOOM!,'' taking place sometime after the events of ''Hell on Earth.'' Pinhead is reunited in Hell with his cenobite entourage from the first two films (including Chatterer, the Female, and Butterball), where he comes to mourn the futility of his own existence. Deciding that he wants to permanently return to his human form and seek spiritual salvation, he begins sending anonymous clues to Kirsty Cotton as to the locations of artifacts that summon cenobites so she can destroy them. After Kirsty locates and opens the box, Pinhead and his fellow cenobites appear to her; but, rather than kill her, Pinhead instead betrays his fellow cenobites and he and Kirsty kill them together. As of the September 2011 issue, it is unclear whether Pinhead is attempting to coerce Kirsty into taking his place as the leader of the cenobites, or whether his plans to return to a human form involve romantic interests towards her.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}{{update inline|date=September 2016}}

He also appears in ''[[The Scarlet Gospels]]'', in which he confronts [[Harry D'Amour]]. In 1998, Clive Barker stated that the novel marks the death of Pinhead, and hopes that it will be definitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/barker-hell-thief-gospels|title=Barker on Hell, Thief &amp; Gospels}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scarlet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newbooksd.html |title=More Books Still To Come...? |publisher=Clivebarker.info |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208022735/http://www.clivebarker.info/newbooksd.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"One of the things I'm trying to do in the story with D'Amour and Pinhead is, I actually want to kind of make Pinhead feel fucked. I want people to make fools of him as he breathes his last and with no hope of resurrection. No sequels. I swear the way he's going - I have plotted this - the way he's going is so total, is so complete that the most optimistic film producer in Hollywood could never dream of resurrecting him! So I'm going to 'off' him, and I want the audience to say, 'Good'." .|sign=Clive Barker on ''The Good, The Bad, And The Light In The Dark'' By Phil Stokes, at the ''Write On! talk at Everyman Theatre'', Liverpool, 11 November 1998}}

Barker, who did not like the name "Pinhead",&lt;ref name="meat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/30469/clive-barker-hell-meat-more|title=Clive Barker on Hell, Meat &amp; More!|publisher=DreadCentral|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221093021/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/30469/clive-barker-hell-meat-more|archivedate=2009-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; vowed to rename the character in "The Scarlet Gospels".&lt;ref name="scarlet" /&gt; The novel referred to the character as "the Hell Priest", a title he held in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-does-the-scarlet-gospels-stack-up-to-clive-barkers-1722754152 |title=How Does The Scarlet Gospels Stack Up To Clive Barker's Horror Classics? |publisher=io9 |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Scarlet Gospels" revealed Pinhead as a "Hell Priest"; a religious authority figure in Hell. The plot in the novel established Hell as being a mixture of medieval Europe/ancient Greece{{original research inline|date=November 2017}} and the Hell Priest as being a powerful figure in the community, ruling over Hell in the absence of Lucifer, who abandoned Hell shortly after his fall from grace. Having secured all known sources of magic on Earth over a lengthy period of time, the Hell Priest reveals to Harry D'Amour that he has been secretly killing off his rivals in Hell to assume complete control over the realm. He also kidnaps Harry's friend Norma and uses her as a hostage to visit a forbidden section of Hell where Lucifer is said to reside. the Hell Priest's goal is to meet Satan and hopefully gain enlightenment from his encounter. However, he only finds Lucifer, dead in a crypt with his armor. the Hell Priest removes and dons Lucifer's armor, inadvertently raising him from the dead. Lucifer mortally wounds the Hell Priest, who manages to kill Norma and blind Harry before dying. His remains are ultimately destroyed when an unseen force annihilates Hell following Satan leaving the realm for Earth following the battle.

The 2018 novella ''Hellraiser: The Toll'' by Mark Alan Miller bridges the gap between ''The Hellbound Heart'' and ''The Scarlet Gospels'', where the Hell Priest was also identified as the Cold Man. In the novella, he calls upon his first witness for his plan from ''The Scarlet Gospels'', before he ultimately chose Harry D'Amour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hellraiser: The Toll (Book)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/254221/hellraiser-toll-book/|website=DreadCentral|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Hellraiser The Toll (Spoiler Free)|url=http://www.clivebarkercast.com/2017/09/30/review-hellraiser-the-toll-spoiler-free/|website=CliveBarkerCast|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hellraiser: The Toll|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/hellraiser-the-toll|website=Subterranean Press|accessdate=19 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119220639/https://subterraneanpress.com/hellraiser-the-toll|archivedate=19 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In the movie series storyline, Pinhead was born Elliott Spencer and opened the [[Lemarchand's box|Lament Configuration]] after becoming disenchanted with human life from his service in [[World War I]]. Like the other Cenobites, he lost all memory of his human identity following the transformation and serves the deity [[List of Hellraiser characters#Leviathan|Leviathan]] by abducting others who solve the Lament Configuration and torture them in a labyrinth realm called Hell.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), [[Kirsty Cotton]] unintentionally summons Pinhead and the Cenobites, but is spared on condition that she lead the Cenobites to her uncle, Frank Cotton, who had escaped them. After reclaiming Frank, the Cenobites turn on Kirsty, who manages to banish them back to their realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Clive Barker (Director)|title=Hellraiser|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=New World Pictures|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'' (1988), Pinhead regains memories of his original self when Kirsty shows him a photograph of Spencer. Pinhead briefly leads his fellow Cenobites in a battle with the newly created [[Dr. Channard (Hellraiser)|Channard cenobite]], but is seemingly killed after being reverted to his human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Tony Randel (Director)|title=Hellbound: Hellraiser II|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=New World Pictures|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth]]'' (1992), it is learned that Spencer's reversion to his human form caused the negative attributes of himself to manifest into an independent entity, which takes the form of Pinhead. Without human influence, Pinhead is unbound by the laws of the Cenobite Hell as he manifests on Earth after being trapped in the form of an intricately carved pillar with writhing figures and distorted faces etched into the surface. Using the nightclub owner J.P. Monroe, Pinhead feeds on enough humans to gain his freedom as he engages in an indiscriminate killing spree on Earth, transforming some of his victims into a Cenobite army. Spencer manages to escape [[Limbo]] and stops Pinhead by re-merging with him before the restored entity is banished back to the Cenobites' reality.&lt;ref name="III" /&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Bloodline]]'' (1996) Pinhead allies himself with the demon princess Angelique, in order to force John Merchant (a descendant of the inventor who built the Lament Configuration) to create an unsealable gateway to Hell. The future segments of the film reveal that Pinhead is finally destroyed in the year 2127 by Dr. Paul Merchant, another descendant, who uses a space station to complete the "Elysium Configuration",  capable of closing Hell's gateway for good. Pinhead and other Cenobites are trapped inside it and are destroyed along with the box.&lt;ref name="IV"&gt;{{cite video|people=Kevin Yagher (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Bloodline|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Inferno]]'' (2000) Pinhead appears primarily under the guise of police psychiatrist Doctor Paul Gregory, assuming his true form near the end to inform protagonist Detective Joseph Thorne that he has been in Hell for the duration of the film, and is being punished for his corruption and various misdeeds in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Scott Derrickson (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Inferno|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker]]'' (2002) Pinhead serves a role similar to the one he fulfilled in ''Inferno''. Kirsty is now married to Trevor, a corrupt insurance agent who plots to have her killed in a murder-for-money scheme, using Lemarchand's box to "cleanly" kill Kirsty without the evidence pointing to himself, his mistress, or his conspirators. Pinhead appears at the end of the film to inform Trevor, who had amnesia throughout the film, that he has actually been dead and trapped by the Cenobites for some time; Pinhead had appeared to Kirsty, pleased at the prospect of a "reunion," but Kirsty ultimately struck a deal with him: she would be left alone in exchange for killing Trevor and his conspirators, thus giving the Cenobites the victims' souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Hellseeker|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Deader]]'' (2005) Pinhead appears several times to reporter Amy Klein after she tinkers with the box, a central relic of a cult she is investigating. After Amy is captured by the group's leader, Winter, she learns he is a descendant of puzzle creator Phillip Lemarchand, and believes that it is his birthright to control the box and, thereby, the Cenobites. However, neither he nor any of his followers have been able to open it. Amy successfully opens the box, but rather than submit to Winter, Pinhead instead kills him and his followers for attempting to control it. Subject to being taken to the Cenobite realm for having opened the box, Amy instead chooses to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Deader|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinhead appears as a fictional character in ''[[Hellraiser: Hellworld]]'' (2005). In this film the box and the Cenobites have become the basis for a successful [[MMORPG]] called ''Hellworld''. Although the Pinhead seems to attack the guests at a ''Hellraiser''-themed party, he is revealed to be the hallucination of five guests who have been drugged and buried alive by the party's host, who blames them for not preventing his ''Hellworld''-addicted son's suicide. In the film's climax, the host discovers that the ''Hellraiser'' mythos is based on fact, and that his son had come into possession of a real Lemarchand box. Opening it causes the real Pinhead to appear, praising the boy's ingenuity before ordering a pair of Cenobites to kill the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Rick Bota (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Hellworld|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Revelations]]'' (2011), Pinhead is physically portrayed by Stephan Smith Collins, with [[Fred Tatasciore]] providing the voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/hellraiser/248551/ranking-the-hellraiser-movies  |title=Ranking the Hellraiser Movies |publisher=Den of Geek |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/feature-articles/13482-hellraiser-revisited |title=We Have Such Sights to Show You - HELLRAISER Revisited |date= |accessdate=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hellraiser: Judgment]]'' (2018), Pinhead is portrayed by Paul T. Taylor. In the film, Pinhead eviscerates the angel [[Jophiel]] after manipulating events so that a serial murderer is killed; one who is integral to God's plan to instill fear into sinners. Pinhead is punished by being expelled from Hell and sent to earth as a mortal man, crying out in longing for his revered state of eternal agony.

==Concept and creation==
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
According to Clive Barker and Doug Bradley, the earliest incarnation of Pinhead appeared in ''Hunters in the Snow'', an original 1973 play with Doug Bradley in the role of the Dutchman, an undead inquisitor and torturer. A later film titled ''The Forbidden'', which was shot in 16 millimetre and in black and white, included a prop in the form of a wooden block with six nails in it, which gave distorted shadow formations under different lighting angles. Years later, during the scripting of ''Hellraiser'', the same design would be applied to Pinhead's face to give the same effect.&lt;ref name="evo" /&gt;

After being disappointed with the way his material had been treated by producers in ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' (which included a scene in which needles burst out of a character's skull), Barker wrote ''The Hellbound Heart'' as his first step in directing a film by himself.&lt;ref name="evo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/pinevolution.html |title=Evolution Of A Character - Pinhead |publisher=Clivebarker.info |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | ''"[Pinhead] was basically Clive's design, as seen on the Hellbound T-shirts. There was a lot of discussion with Clive, then I did a few drawings. First we just had spikes coming out of his head. I wanted it to be more geometrical. Originally he had pins all over the head, but Clive and I thought it would be nice to make it look more like a mask with pins around his chin, over his ears and at the back of his head. We modelled it about six times and did loads of drawings. If you look at the first test pictures that came out of Hellraiser there are actually pins in there rather than nails and the pins got lost - you couldn't see them. So we clipped the ends of the pins off and made our own hollow brass nails that inserted over the top and they were much more visible." ''

[[File:Pinsketch.jpg|175px|thumb|left|An early Pinhead design by Clive Barker.]]
Barker drew inspiration for the cenobite designs from [[punk fashion]], [[Catholicism]] and by the visits he took to [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] clubs in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Amsterdam]]. For Pinhead specifically, Barker drew inspiration from African fetish sculptures.&lt;ref name="evo" /&gt; Initially, Barker intended Pinhead to have a navel piercing implying that the character had [[genital piercing]]s.&lt;ref name="meat" /&gt; Barker's original "Hell Priest" sketches for Pinhead were eventually adapted into an officially licensed mask by Composite Effects, to be released in limited quantity to the public on 24 March 2017. This was done in celebration of the 30th Anniversary of ''Hellraiser''.&lt;ref name="HellPriestMask"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/219633/composite-effects-working-clive-barker-exclusive-pinhead-hell-priest-mask/ |title=Composite Effects Working with Clive Barker on Exclusive Pinhead the Hell Priest Mask!|website=Dread Central|accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After securing funding in early 1986, Barker and his producer Chris Figg assembled a team to design the cenobites. Among the team was Bob Keen and Geoff Portass at Image Animation and Jane Wildgoose, a costume designer who was requested to make a series of costumes for 4–5 'super-butchers' while refining the scarification designs with Image Animation. In terms of lighting, Pinhead was designed so that shadows would swirl round his head. By July 1986, the shooting script positively identified the single pinheaded Cenobite from the earlier draft as clearly the leader.&lt;ref name="evo" /&gt;

The upcoming ''[[Hellraiser: Judgment]]'' will update Pinhead's appearance from the previous films. As writer-director [[Gary J. Tunnicliffe]] explained, "This is a very no nonsense Pinhead. No glib one-liners, he's a little leaner and a little meaner. We especially tried to incorporate this into the make-up and costume; the cuts are deeper, the pins a little longer, his eyes are completely black and wardrobe is a little sleeker and more visceral.

===Portrayal===
In the first eight Hellraiser films, Pinhead is portrayed by [[Doug Bradley]].  Because of his eventual skill at application and removal of the Pinhead appliances and costume, Bradley has been credited in some of the Hellraiser films as an assistant make-up artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rengamedia.com/dougbradley.html Doug Bradley - Renga Media]&lt;/ref&gt;  When he read the script for the first time, Bradley stated on interview that he saw Pinhead as a cross between [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Noël Coward]].&lt;ref name="petley"/&gt; Upon asking Barker how he should play Pinhead, Barker told him to "[think] of him as a cross between an administrator and a surgeon who's responsible for running a hospital where there are no wards, only operating theatres. As well as being the man who wields the knife, he's the man who has to keep the timetable going." The two also decided early on that Pinhead was formerly human:

{{quote|A line from one of Clive's plays swam into my mind: 'I am in mourning for my humanity.' At this point there was no back story for the character, but I had discussed this with Clive and we had agreed that he had once been human. But whether this was yesterday, last week, last year, ten, a hundred, a thousand years ago, I didn't know. I didn't need to. Sufficient to have that idea lodged into my brain. A perpetual, unconscious grieving for the man he had once been, for a life and a face he couldn't even remember. And a frozen grief. I felt now that Pinhead existed in an emotional limbo where neither pain nor pleasure could touch him. A pretty good definition of Hell for me."|sign=''Hellraiser'' From Chapter Seventeen of ''Sacred Monsters: Behind The Mask Of The Horror Actor'' by Doug Bradley, 1996}}

The Pinhead makeup took six hours to apply.&lt;ref name="petley"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H21BB8SZuyQC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=pinhead+bradley&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=pinhead%20bradley&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;British horror cinema'&amp;#39; by Steve Chibnall &amp; Julian Petley, published by Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-415-23003-9 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26|isbn=9780415230032|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bradley first donned the Pinhead makeup, he spent a few minutes alone in his room getting into character by looking at himself in the mirror. During rehearsals, Barker told Bradley, who at the time was more used to working in theatre, to subdue his movements and gestures, in order to give Pinhead an aura of complete control.&lt;ref name="evo"/&gt; New World Productions originally considered overdubbing Bradley's voice with that of an American actor, though this was reconsidered when the producers watched him perform.&lt;ref name="petley"/&gt;

Paul T. Taylor portrays Pinhead in ''Hellraiser: Judgment'', an experience he describes as a dream-come-true. According to Taylor, "[Pinhead] was always my favorite horror icon because he was the most twisted and intelligent in my mind." The American actor used a faux British accent when portraying the character due to his belief that "Pinhead has to be British". Gary Tunnicliffe gave Taylor room to create his own interpretation of Pinhead, as Taylor brought an intentional vulnerability to the role. In addition to prior knowledge, Taylor used [[Hellraiser (franchise)#Comic books|''Hellraiser'' comic books]] as preparation for the film.&lt;ref name="TaylorDallas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/dallas-actor-paul-t-taylor-sinks-his-hooks-into-the-role-of-horror-film-villain-pinhead-9258775 |title=Dallas Actor Paul T. Taylor Sinks His Hooks Into the Role of Horror Film Villain Pinhead|website=Dallas Observer|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
In the first ''Hellraiser'' script drafts, Pinhead was credited as "Priest".&lt;ref name="dread" /&gt; In the film, the character was simply credited as the "Lead Cenobite".

The name "Pinhead" was coined by the makeup crew that applied the prosthetics on Bradley to distinguish the Cenobites. Clive Barker had no say in choosing "Pinhead" as a name and did not like it, as he thought it was undignified.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; In the films, the character was first referred to openly as "Pinhead" by protagonist Joey Summerskill in ''Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth.'' The name is also used as a derogative term towards the Cenobite by Jophiel, God's advisor and Pinhead's superior, before he kills her in ''Hellraiser: Judgment,'' during the film's finale. The name also appears in the film ''Hellworld,'' referring to the fictional character portrayed in the Hellraiser game.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Pinhead was given the designation '''Hell Priest''' in Clive Barker's novel ''[[The Scarlet Gospels]]'', while his original concept art for Pinhead was adapted into a Hell Priest mask in 2017.&lt;ref name="HellPriestMask" /&gt;

==Characterization==
Pinhead's role has varied with each ''Hellraiser'' installment. In the script for the original film, Barker describes Pinhead and the other cenobites as "demons" in his notes; the character himself, however, upon capturing Kirsty Cotton, identifies himself as neither explicitly angelic nor demonic, stating that he and his fellow entourage are "Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others."&lt;ref name="I"&gt;{{cite video|people=Clive Barker (Director)|title=Hellraiser|medium=DVD|location=United Kingdom|publisher=[[New World Pictures]]|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film expounds on the idea of the Cenobites as demons by depicting them as denizens of a realm called Hell, a maze-like dimension ruled over by an entity known as Leviathan, where they subject their quarry to emotional and psychological torture. The third film radically altered the original concept, making Pinhead into a purely evil demon of chaos, explained by Pinhead losing the human, 'orderly', part of himself during the previous film. In the fourth film he is presented as a [[megalomania]]c bent on world domination,&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt; and by the fifth he acts as a judge, punishing those who open the box for their sins by making them face their personal demons. In this film, he goes by the title of "Engineer",&lt;ref name="V"&gt;{{cite video|people=Scot Derrickson (Director)|title=Hellraiser: Inferno|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name derived from the lead cenobite in Clive Barker's original novella.&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt; The seventh film reverts closer to the original film, with the Cenobites responsible for pleasure and pain, but the characters seem more demonic as in later installments.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

He was a very pukka Englishman, a public school type who went straight into the army. He felt terribly out of place and unfulfilled because he was only there through family tradition. So from his sterile viewpoint, what he hears of the Lament box is very appealing. I see him alone in his Nissen hut trying to solve the puzzle - which he obviously does, and is transformed into Pinhead.''
''"I don't see him as the first Cenobite. Of the four we know about, he is the leader, but the Cenobites have been around for centuries. To me, Pinhead is the chief Cenobite of the 20th Century.."''

[[File:Elliotspencer.png|thumb|200px|left|Doug Bradley as Captain Elliott Spencer in ''[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth]]''.]]

The character's past, which is alluded to in ''Hellbound'', is expanded upon in ''Hell on Earth''. It is revealed that Pinhead originated as '''Elliott Spencer''', a captain in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] suffering from [[post traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and [[survivor guilt]]. Spencer participated in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], after which he lost faith in humanity and [[God]]. He wandered Earth indulging in a [[hedonist]]ic lifestyle to bury his trauma, turning to the baser methods of gratification and pleasure until finding the Lament Configuration in [[British India]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="III"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Hellraiser-3-Hell-on-Earth.html |title='&amp;#39;Hellraiser III'&amp;#39; script, from The Internet Movie Script Database |publisher=IMSDb |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
According to Clive Barker, as the writing of the ''Hellraiser'' script took place during the height of the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' film series, his intended portrayal of Pinhead as an articulate and intelligent character was initially not well received by the producers: some suggested that Pinhead should act more like [[Freddy Krueger]] and crack jokes, while others suggested that he be a silent character like [[Jason Voorhees]] and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. Barker insisted that Pinhead's personality be more evocative of [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of [[Count Dracula]]: "Part of the chill of Dracula surely lies in the fact that he is very clearly and articulately aware of what he is doing – you feel that this is a penetrating intelligence – and I don't find dumb things terribly scary – I find intelligence scary, particularly twisted intelligence; it's one of the reasons why [[Hannibal Lecter]] is scary, isn't it? It's because you always feel that he's going to be three jumps ahead of you."&lt;ref name="evo"/&gt;

Though described by Pinhead's human half in ''Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth'' as being "very persuasive and very inventive",&lt;ref name="III"/&gt; Pinhead prefers using coercive methods in order to obtain his goals, a fact which brings him into conflict with his ally, the demon Princess Angelique.&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt;

Pinhead can be reasoned and bargained with. In both ''Hellraiser'' and ''Hellraiser: Hellseeker'', Kirsty Cotton bargains with Pinhead to offer him more "souls" in exchange for her own (in particular, her human adversaries), thus resulting in her life being spared.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Hellraiser-Hellseeker.html |title='&amp;#39;Hellraiser VI'&amp;#39; script, from The Internet Movie Script Database |publisher=IMSDb |date=2000-10-27 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hellraiser: Revelations'', Pinhead is prepared to take Emma to the cenobite realm for having opened the box before other characters explain that she was forced to open it at gunpoint by her boyfriend; Pinhead agrees to let Emma go and take Nico instead.

In his demonic incarnations, Pinhead is irreverent toward [[Christianity]]: in the third film, club owner J.P. Monroe exclaims "[[Jesus Christ]]," to which Pinhead mockingly replies, "Not quite.", and later on mockingly imitates the [[stigmata]] in a church,&lt;ref name="III"/&gt; and states in the fourth "Do I look like someone who cares what [[God in Christianity|God]] thinks?"&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; In Clive Barker's ''Hellraiser'' comics published by ''BOOM!'' in 2011, Pinhead has reached a crisis point in his existence and now yearns for spiritual salvation and the opportunity to reach [[Heaven]], and puts into motion a plan to destroy his fellow cenobites as a means of atonement.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Paul T. Taylor, who portrays Pinhead in ''[[Hellraiser: Judgment]]'', described the character as "twisted and intelligent". Finding Pinhead's mannerisms and demeanor to be unique among horror icons, Taylor tried to capture that in his performance: "It's about the stillness. He's already so terrifying that when he makes a move, it means something. He's very economical and when he speaks, he's so eloquent." Taylor also incorporated the uncomfortable make-up and costume into his presentation of the [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochist]], stating "Pinhead's always in agony so he likes it. I feel like I was in character the whole time, and I don't mean that in some sort of artistic, lofty way. I mean I maintained the demeanor the whole time because I had to."&lt;ref name="TaylorDallas" /&gt;

===Powers, weaknesses and limitations===
Described by Doug Bradley as stronger than Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers,&lt;ref name="evo" /&gt; Pinhead is an extremely powerful being, and as such, has several [[supernatural]] abilities. His preferred method of attack is by summoning hooks and chains to mutilate victims, often pulling said victims in several directions to tear them apart.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Hellraiser-Deader.html |title='&amp;#39;Hellraiser VII'&amp;#39; script, from The Internet Movie Script Database |publisher=IMSDb |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chains are subject to his total [[telekinesis|mental control]] and he may direct them at will. The chains may even change shape after having attached to a victim.&lt;ref name="VII" /&gt; Pinhead is highly resistant to damage and direct assault, being able to resist both gunshots&lt;ref name="III" /&gt; and futuristic energy weapons.&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt; His magic is also used for [[conjuration|creating objects out of thin air]], [[Teleportation|teleporting]], creating explosions at distances and deceiving opponents with illusions. He is capable of creating other cenobites from both living&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt; and dead victims.&lt;ref name="III" /&gt;

In order to act in the physical world, Pinhead needs to have been purposely summoned through the Lament Configuration, though this in itself is not usually enough for Pinhead to target the puzzle-solver: in ''Hellbound: Hellraiser II'', Pinhead stops the Cenobites from torturing an emotionally traumatised girl who was manipulated as a proxy into opening the Configuration, remarking "...it is not ''hands'' that call us, it is ''[[Motivation|desire]]''." In ''Hell on Earth'', he temporarily eliminates these restraints when he is separated from the part of him that is Elliot Spencer, wreaking havoc indiscriminately upon every human subject he encounters until he is finally defeated when Spencer willingly merges with Pinhead once again, the combination binding Pinhead as Spencer keeps his extremes in check. During this incident his powers were apparently expanded beyond their normal limits allowing him to physically warp reality to his will.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Pinhead at first has no memory of his human past, though is reminded of it in ''Hellbound: Hellraiser II'', which results in what screenwriter Peter Atkins described as him being "spiritually weakened" and subsequently killed by the Chanard Cenobite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Atkins, Peter|date=2001|title=Hellbound: Hellraiser 2|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Starz Media]]/[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entourage===
Pinhead is shown in all his appearances to be accompanied by other denizens of Hell. Although originally portrayed as a subordinate of "The Engineer" in ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]'',&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt; his film incarnations show him as the leader of secondary cenobite characters. The most consistent members of his entourage are a trio of Cenobites named [[Butterball Cenobite|Butterball]], [[Female Cenobite|The Female]], and [[Chatterer]]. All three appear in The Hellbound Heart, the first two Hellraiser films, and the BOOM! comic series, with The Female and Butterball making appearances in The Scarlet Gospels and Chatterer appearing in all but two of the Hellraiser sequels.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; In ''Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth'' and ''Hellraiser: Bloodline'' Pinhead creates cenobites from his victims, giving them characteristics evocative of their past lives or professions.&lt;ref name="III" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt; Later films in the series depict Pinhead accompanied by new Cenobites of unknown origin. Though he usually dominates other demons present in the films, in ''Hellraiser: Bloodline'', he encounters Angelique, whom he grudgingly treats as an equal:

{{quote|"This is something entirely new for Pinhead; he's never had a demonic cohort, so to speak. He's had his other Cenobites in the previous films, but the pecking order was always pretty clear. Angelique is at least his equal, and certainly in Angelique's own mind possibly his superior. Pinhead doesn't quite see things that way, so their relationship is a little sparky."|sign=Doug Bradley on ''Hellraiser: Bloodline'', US Press Kit, March 1996}}

Though initially reverent toward her, Pinhead is disillusioned when his methods in achieving his goals through coercion come at odds with Angelique's more seductive techniques.&lt;ref name="IV" /&gt;

==''Hellraiser'' remake==
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
Doug Bradley has stated that he has not been approached to portray Pinhead in the remake, stating that "seeing someone else become Pinhead feels like a kick in the teeth".&lt;ref name="dread"/&gt;

===Pinhead redesign===
[[File:Pinheadremake.jpg|thumb|Pinhead redesign by Gary Tunnicliffe, as shown in ''Project Angel: Redesigning an Icon'']]
Gary Tunnicliffe, who was responsible for the Pinhead makeup in the last four films, improvised a new design for Pinhead called ''Project Angel: Recreating an Icon'', the photos of which he published in ''[[Fangoria]]''.

{{quote|"My design idea was to create something that still felt like Pinhead but that stepped away from the 'order' of the original design, something that was more painful, more chaotic. Several times over the years, Clive has approached me on various HELLRAISER sets and commented that the makeup looked very 'clean' and that it had lost some of 'the decay, the filth.' I decided to amp up the dirtiness of Pinhead's visage, make it more self-inflicted, bloodier and more brutal."|sign=&lt;ref name="fangoria"/&gt;}}

Among Tunnicliffe's redesigns included the usage of square shafted nails for the iconic pins, which were meant to look rusted and handmade. He also designed the new Pinhead as wearing a white priest's robe rather than the original black leather, as a homage to the origins of the word "cenobite" which implies a religious connection.&lt;ref name="fangoria"&gt;{{cite web|author=RobG on February 5, 2009 05:24 PM |url=http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/02/recreating_an_icon_a_new_look.html |title=Recreating an ICON - A New Look For PINHEAD |publisher=Iconsoffright.com |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesign was criticised by Clive Barker as being too bloody:

{{quote|"I don't think that's right. I think the whole point about Pinhead is that he isn't bloody - that his victims are bloody but he isn't. The other thing is that there are these lacerations that are diagonal and very random. The original had the feel of geometry paper in school where it was broken up into segments and lines, which to me had a severity to it. Having the pins of the intersections of the crossroads made it have a surgical severity to it almost. I think this new version has sacrificed that feeling."|sign=&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;}}

[[Pascal Laugier]], who was set to write the remake wrote an online statement, stressing that Tunnicliffe's redesign was unauthorised, and that he himself had a very different design in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/15185 |title=Pascal Laugier Writes B-D Regarding That Pinhead' Make-Up |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''pluripotency''' of biological compounds describes the ability of certain substances to produce several distinct biological responses. Pluripotent is also described as something that has no fixed developmental potential, as in being able to differentiate into different cell types in the case of pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pluripotent|title = Pluripotent|date = |accessdate = 14 March 2015|website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of pluripotent cell, called a hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate into a large variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells have a different function, but they all work together as part of the immune system. 
[[Monocytes]] can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. [[Macrophages]] are covered with chemical receptors and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. [[Dendritic cells]] phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the acquired immune system (lymphocytes) as backup.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prescott's microbiology |last = Willey, J., Sherwood, L., &amp; Woolverton, C. |first = |publisher = McGraw Hill |year = 2014|isbn = 0073402400|location = Innate Host Resistance and Adaptive Immunity |pages = 723&amp;ndash;788|work = |editor-last =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example are lymphocytes called naïve T-helper cells. These cells can differentiate into many subtypes once activated by [[antigen presenting cells]] (APCs) like dendrites. They divide into memory cells, TH1, TH17, and TH2 cells, to name a few. Memory cells are made solely for the purpose of having a template to use in the case of reinfection so the body has a jump start instead of starting over as if never infected. TH17 cells do a variety of tasks including recruiting [[neutrophils]], creating [[defensins]], and mediating inflammation in the intestinal epithelium and skin. TH2 cells produce cytokines that will trigger certain B cells. [[B cells]] can differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells. The B plasma cells produce the [[antibodies]] that are used to tag invading cells so they can be attacked, among other functions. TH1 cells are created to make cytokines, like interferon gamma, that activate macrophages and [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs).&lt;ref name="Prescott"/&gt;

[[Interferon gamma]] represents an example of pluripotency in itself. Many cytokines are pluripotent, in that each of these compounds can activate specific behavior in some cell types and inhibit other behavior in other cell types.  Once activated by T lymphocytes or Natural Killer cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Ikeda, H., Old, L., &amp; Schreiber, R. | title= The roles of IFN in protection against tumor development and cancer immunoediting| journal= Cytokine &amp; Growth Factor Reviews | volume= 13|issue= 2| pages=95–109| year= 2002| doi= 10.1016/S1359-6101(01)00038-7 | pmid= 11900986}}&lt;/ref&gt; interferon gamma upregulates expression of macrophages and both types of [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]] (MHC) antigens. In [[B lymphocytes]] (B cells), interferon gamma stimulates antibody class switching. All of these cells have different, specialized functions, but they all came from one pluripotent cell.

'''Sergei Vasilyevich Belyaev''' (Russian: Сергей Васильевич Беляев; old style 20 September/2 October 1856, [[Moscow]] - ?) was a Major general of the [[Imperial Russian Army]], brigade commander of the 83th infantry division.
== Biography==

ISIL has received widespread criticism from Muslim scholars and others in the Muslim world for using part of the Qur'an to derive a ruling in isolation, rather than considering the entire Qur’an and Hadith.&lt;ref name="Kumar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sypher - Rape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdelaziz - ISIS States Justification"/&gt;

An article in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' suggests the existence of “a bias against covering rape and sexual assault, since they tend to be viewed by some as 'women’s issues' versus 'mainstream' insurgent tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/16/the_islamic_state_of_sexual_violence_women_rape_iraq_syria|title=The Islamic State of Sexual Violence|date=16 September 2014|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023111541/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/16/the_islamic_state_of_sexual_violence_women_rape_iraq_syria|archive-date=2014-10-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others warn that sexual violence should not be categorized as an act of terror, because such a categorization could provoke dangerous consequences.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;
[[Catherine M.

[[Amnesty International]] infers that ISIL has “launched a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq,” where “many of those held by IS have been threatened with rape or sexual assault or pressured to convert to Islam.  In some cases entire families have been abducted”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/gruesome-evidence-ethnic-cleansing-northern-iraq-islamic-state-moves-wipe-out-minorities-2014-0|title=Gruesome evidence of ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq as Islamic State moves to wipe out minorities - Amnesty International|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Amnesty.org|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027184421/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/gruesome-evidence-ethnic-cleansing-northern-iraq-islamic-state-moves-wipe-out-minorities-2014-0|archive-date=2014-10-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, these crimes extend beyond gender-based violence as males, in addition to females, are being targeted.  In this case sexual violence is employed to achieve a political goal,  religious conversion to Islam as interpreted by ISIL.

Haleh Esfandiari from the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] has highlighted the abuse of local women by ISIL militants after they have captured an area. "They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them.

'''''Sophie's Choice''''' is a 1979 novel by American author [[William Styron]]. It concerns the relationships between three people sharing a boarding house in [[Brooklyn]]: Stingo, a young aspiring writer from the [[Southern United States|South]] who befriends the Jewish scientist Nathan Landau and his lover Sophie, a Polish Catholic survivor of the German [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s.

''Sophie's Choice'' won the US [[National Book Award for Fiction]] in 1980. The novel was the basis of a 1982 [[Sophie's Choice (film)|film of the same name]]. It was controversial for the way in which it framed Styron's personal views regarding the Holocaust.

==Plot summary==
Stingo, a novelist who is recalling the summer when he began his first novel, has been fired from his low-level reader's job at the publisher [[McGraw-Hill]] and has moved into a cheap boarding house in Brooklyn, where he hopes to devote some months to his writing. While he is working on his novel, he is drawn into the lives of the lovers Nathan Landau and Sophie Zawistowska, fellow boarders at the house, who are involved in an intense and difficult relationship. Sophie is beautiful, Polish, and Catholic, and a survivor of the Holocaust and [[Nazi]] concentration camps; Nathan is a Jewish-American, and, purportedly, a genius. Although Nathan claims to be a Harvard graduate and a cellular biologist with a pharmaceutical company, it is later revealed that this is a fabrication.  Almost no one—including Sophie and Stingo—knows that Nathan has [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. He sometimes behaves quite normally and generously, but there are times when he becomes frighteningly jealous, violent, abusive and delusional.

As the story progresses, Sophie tells Stingo of her past. She describes her violently anti-Semitic father, a law professor in [[Kraków]]; her unwillingness to help him spread his ideas; her arrest by the [[Nazi]]s; and particularly, her brief stint as a stenographer-typist in the home of [[Rudolf Höss]], the commander of [[Auschwitz]], where she was interned. She specifically relates her attempts to seduce Höss in an effort to persuade him that her blond, blue-eyed, German-speaking son should be allowed to leave the camp and enter the [[Lebensborn]] program, in which he would be raised as a German child. She failed in this attempt and, ultimately, never learned of her son's fate. Only at the end of the book does the reader also learn what became of Sophie's daughter, named Eva.

Later, Nathan's delusions have led him to believe that Stingo is having an affair with Sophie, and he threatens to kill them both.

As Sophie and Stingo attempt to flee New York, Sophie reveals her deepest, darkest secret: on the night that she arrived at Auschwitz, a camp doctor made her choose which of her two children would die immediately [[Gas chamber|by gassing]] and which would continue to live, albeit in the camp. Of her two children, Sophie chose to sacrifice her seven-year-old daughter, Eva, in a heart-wrenching decision that has left her in mourning and filled with a guilt that she cannot overcome. By now alcoholic and deeply depressed, she is clearly willing to self-destruct with Nathan, who has already tried to persuade her to commit suicide with him. Despite the fact that Stingo proposes marriage to her, and despite a shared night that relieves Stingo of his virginity and fulfills many of his sexual fantasies, Sophie disappears, leaving only a note in which she says that she must return to Nathan.

Upon arriving back in Brooklyn, Stingo is devastated to discover that Sophie and Nathan have committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning#Suicide|sodium cyanide]].

==Inspiration and themes==

===Themes===
Sylvie Mathé notes that Styron's "position" in the writing of this novel was made clear in his contemporary interviews and essays, in the latter case, in particular "Auschwitz", "Hell Reconsidered", and "A Wheel of Evil Come Full Circle",&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt; and quotes Alvin Rosenfeld's summary of Styron's position, where Rosenfeld states that:&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79&gt;Rosenfeld, Alvin H. (1979) “The Holocaust According to William Styron,” ''Midstream,'' Vol. 25, No. 10 (December), pp. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|sign=|source=|(1) while [Styron] acknowledges Jewish suffering under the Nazis, he insists on seeing Auschwitz in general or universalistic terms, as a murderous thrust against "mankind" or "the entire human family"; (2) in line with the above, he sees his own role as "correcting" the view that the Holocaust was directed solely or exclusively against the Jews by focusing attention on the many Christians, and particularly the Slavs, who also perished in the camps; (3) … Auschwitz was "anti-Christian" as well as "anti-Semitic", and hence assertions of Christian guilt are misplaced and perhaps even unnecessary; (4) since he rejects historical explanations of Christian anti-Semitism as causative, Styron is drawn to the view, set forth by Richard Rubenstein and others … that in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination center; and (5) viewed against European examples of barbarism and slavery, epitomized by Auschwitz, the American South's treatment of the blacks looks pretty good and "… seems benevolent by comparison".&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt;}}

Rosenfeld, summarizing, states, "The drift of these revisionist views, all of which culminate in Sophie's Choice, is to take the Holocaust out of Jewish and Christian history and place it within a generalized history of evil."&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt;{{rp|44}} Mathé reinforces Rosenfeld's conclusion with a quote from Styron himself, who stated in his "Hell Reconsidered" essay that "the titanic and sinister forces at work in history and in modern life… threaten all men, not only Jews."&lt;ref name=StyronHell78&gt;Styron, William (1978) “Hell Reconsidered,” In ''This Quiet Dust and Other Writings,'' [1982], pp. 105-115, New York, NY, USA: Random House, {{ISBN|039450934X}}, {{ISBN|9780394509341}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pfUNAAAAIAAJ], accessed 7 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} She goes on to note that Styron's choices to represent these ideas, and to incorporate them so clearly into the narrative of his novel, resulted in polemic and controversy that continued, at least into the early years of the new millennium (see section on Controversy, below).&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt;

===Plot inspiration===
''Sophie’s Choice'' is partly based on the author's time in Brooklyn, where he met a refugee from Poland. He visited Auschwitz while researching the novel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20021204/sophies-choice-gets-jewish-groups-award|title='Sophie's Choice' gets Jewish group's award|last=|first=|date=2002-12-04|work=Gainesville Sun, AP|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central element of the novel's plot, the personally catastrophic choice referred to in the title, is said to have been inspired by a story of a Romani woman who was ordered by the Nazis to select which of her children was to be put to death, which Styron attributes{{where?|date=November 2015}} to [[Hannah Arendt]]'s ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]''.&lt;ref name="Mathe04" /&gt; However, [[Ira Nadel]] claims that the story is found in Arendt's ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Robin | first1=Corey | date=2015 | title=Hannah Arendt and Philip Roth: Parallel Lives | url=http://crookedtimber.org/2015/06/09/hannah-arendt-and-philip-roth-parallel-lives/#more-36055 | journal = Crooked Timber ''(blog, June 9)'' | accessdate=4 November 2015}}{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that book, Arendt argues that those who ran the camps perpetrated an "attack on the moral person":&lt;blockquote&gt;Totalitarian terror achieved its most terrible triumph when it succeeded in cutting the moral person off from the individualist escape and in making the decisions of conscience absolutely questionable and equivocal.

==Reception and controversies==

===Critical reception===
In his review of the novel in the ''New York Times,'' [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]] takes it as an example of [[Southern Gothic]] and writes that it "is a splendidly written, thrilling book, a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the 20th century. If it is not, for me, a hands‐down literary masterpiece, the reason is that, in transferring the form of the Southern Gothic to this vastly larger subject, Styron has been unable to get rid of or even noticeably tone down those qualities — some superficial, some deep — in the Southern Gothic that have always made Yankees squirm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/a-novel-of-evil-styron.html|title=A Novel of Evil|last=Gardner|first=John|date=1979-05-27|work=The New York Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===

====At publication====
''Sophie's Choice'' generated significant controversy at time of its publication, in part due to Styron's decision to portray a non-[[Jew]]ish victim of the [[Holocaust]] and in part due to its explicit sexuality and profanity;{{verification needed|date=May 2016}} it was banned in South Africa, censored in the Soviet Union, and banned in Communist Poland for "its unflinching portrait of Polish anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;Sirlin, Rhoda and West III, James L. W.  ''Sophie's Choice: A Contemporary Casebook''. Newcastle UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2007. p. ix. http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/60485. Accessed 5 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains several anti-Polish stereotypes. &lt;ref&gt;Danusha V. Goska. ''Bieganski: The Brute Polak Stereotype in Polish-Jewish Relations and American Popular Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvie Mathé notes that ''Sophie’s Choice,'' which she refers to as a "highly controversial novel," appeared in press in the year following the broadcast of the [[NBC]] miniseries ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' (1978), engendering a period in American culture where "a newly-raised consciousness of the Holocaust was becoming a forefront public issue."&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt; She goes on to note that with regard to the Holocaust (Hebrew, ''Shoah''):
{{quote|sign=|source=|Styron's ideological and narrative choices in his framing of a novel touching upon the "limit events" of Auschwitz, considered by many to lie beyond the realm of the imagination… spurred a polemic… which, twenty-five years later, is far from having died down.&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt; }}
Here, the reference to a "limit event" (synonymous with "limit case" and "limit situation") is to a concept deriving at least from the early 1990s—Saul Friedländer, in introducing his ''Probing the Limits of Representation,'' quotes David Carroll, who refers to the Shoah as "this limit case of knowledge and feeling"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Friedländer |first1= Saul |author-link1= Saul Friedländer | year= 1992 | chapter=Introduction  | editor1-last=Friedländer |editor1-first=Saul  | title= Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the "final Solution" | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0674707664 |format= | language=  | others=  | edition= |location= Cambridge, MA, USA | publisher= Harvard U Press | pages= 1–21 (esp. 6) |doi= |doi-broken-date= |isbn= 0674707664 |issn=  | jstor= |access-date= 7 November 2015 | via=  | lay-summary= | lay-source= | lay-date= | quote= | mode= | postscript= . [See David Carrol citation following, for the relevant quote.] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor-last= Carroll |contributor-first=David |contributor-link=  |date=1990 |contribution=The Memory of Devastation and the Responsibilities of Thought: 'And let's not talk about that' [Foreword] |last=Lyotard |first=Jean François |author-link=Jean François Lyotard |title= Heidegger and "the Jews" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Nd1XHpMtQUC |language=English |translator1=Andreas Michel |translator2=Mark S. Roberts |pages=vii-xxix |isbn=0816618577 |location=Minneapolis, MN |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |quote=[T]his indeterminacy has special significance when it comes to the Shoah, this limit case of knowledge and feeling, in terms of which all such systems of belief and thought, all forms of literary and artistic expression, seem irrelevant or criminal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a concept that can be understood to mean an event or related circumstance or practice that is "of such magnitude and profound violence" that it "rupture[s]... otherwise normative foundations of legitimacy and... civilising tendencies that underlie... political and moral community" (the oft-cited formulation of Simone Gigliotti).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gigliotti, Simone | date = 2003 | title = Unspeakable Pasts as Limit Events: The Holocaust, Genocide, and the Stolen Generations | journal = Australian Journal of Politics and History | volume= 49 | number = No. 2, June | pages = 164–181, esp. 164 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00302 | quote = Quote: A 'limit event' is an event or practice of such magnitude and profound violence that its effects rupture the otherwise normative foundations of legitimacy and so-called civilising tendencies that underlie the constitution of political and moral community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy to which Mathé is specifically referring arises from a thematic analysis which—in apparent strong consensus (e.g., see Rosenfeld's 1979 work, "The Holocaust According to William Styron"&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt;)—has Styron, through the novel, his interviews, and essays:
* acknowledging Jewish suffering under the Nazis, but attempting to reorient views of the Holocaust away from its being solely aimed against the Jews, toward its encompassing Slavic and other Christians (hence the Sophie character's nationality and Catholic heritage); 
that is, it has him insisting on seeing Auschwitz in particular in more universal terms as "a murderous thrust against 'the entire human family.'"&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt; Styron further extends his argument, again with controversy:
* proposing that this more general view of the barbarism of Auschwitz (and in particular the fact that Slavic Christians were caught up in its program of forced labour and extermination) obviates the need for Christian guilt and sets aside historical arguments for Christian anti-Semitism as a causative agent in the Holocaust, and 
* suggesting that the camp's role in forced labour justified its comparison (e.g., in the writings of Rubenstein) with the American institution of slavery, even allowing the latter to be viewed more favourably.&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt;

Speaking of Styron's views as set forth in the novel and his nonfiction work, Rosenfeld refers to them as "revisionist views" that "culminate in ''Sophie's Choice''" with an aim to "take the Holocaust out of Jewish and Christian history and place it within a generalized history of evil",&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld79/&gt;{{rp|44}} and it is this specific revisionist thrust that is the substance of the novel's initial and persisting ability to engender controversy.&lt;ref name=Mathe04/&gt;

In 2002, Styron received the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation's Witness to Justice Award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Contemporary====
''Sophie's Choice'' has been banned in some high schools in the United States. For instance, the book was pulled from the [[La Mirada High School]] Library in California by the Norwalk-La Mirada High School District in 2002 because of a parent's complaint about its sexual content.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news | last = Helmand | first = Duke |title = Students Fight for 'Sophie's Choice' | newspaper = [[The Los Angeles Times]] |date = 2001-12-22 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/22/local/me-17211 | accessdate = February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year after students protested and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) sent a letter to the school district requesting that the district reverse its actions, students were again given access to the book in the school library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/library_files/A%20History%20of%20Fighting%20Censorship.pdf|title=A History of Fighting Censorship|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|year=2006|accessdate=2009-10-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223201015/http://www.aclu-wa.org/library_files/A%20History%20of%20Fighting%20Censorship.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sshl.ucsd.edu/banned/books.html|title=Banned Books Week: September 25-October 2|date=September 22, 2004|publisher=[[UCSD]]|accessdate=2009-10-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511235655/http://sshl.ucsd.edu/banned/books.html|archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a patient is medically stable, the focus of their recovery shifts to rehabilitation.  Some patients are transferred to in-patient rehabilitation programs, while others may be referred to out-patient services or home-based care.  In-patient programs are usually facilitated by an interdisciplinary team that may include a physician, nurse, pharmacist, [[physical therapist]], [[occupational therapist]], [[speech and language pathologist]], [[psychologist]], and recreation therapist.&lt;ref name=Guidelines /&gt; The patient and their family/caregivers also play an integral role on this team. Family/caregivers that are involved in the patient care tend to be prepared for the caregiving role as the patient transitions from rehabilitation centers. While at the rehabilitation center, the interdisciplinary team makes sure that the patient attains their maximum functional potential upon discharge. The primary goals of this sub-acute phase of recovery include preventing secondary health complications, minimizing impairments, and achieving functional goals that promote independence in [[activities of daily living]].&lt;ref name=Duncan2 /&gt;

In the later phases of '''stroke recovery''', patients are encouraged to participate in secondary prevention programs for stroke.  Follow-up is usually facilitated by the patient’s primary care provider.&lt;ref name=Duncan2 /&gt;

The initial severity of impairments and individual characteristics, such as motivation, social support, and learning ability, are key predictors of stroke recovery outcomes.&lt;ref name=EBRSR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teasell, R.|author2=Bayona, N. |author3=Bitensky, J. |title=Background Concepts in Stroke Rehabiliitation|journal=Evidence Based Review of Stroke Rehabilitation (Version 13)|year=2011|pages=1–44|url=http://www.ebrsr.com/uploads/Background_SREBR_11.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to treatment and overall recovery of function are highly dependent on the individual.  Current evidence indicates that most significant recovery gains will occur within the first 12 weeks following a stroke.&lt;ref name=EBRSR /&gt;

==History of stroke neuro-rehabilitation==
In 1620, [[Johann Jakob Wepfer]], by studying the brain of a pig, developed the theory that stroke was caused by an interruption of the flow of blood to the brain.&lt;ref name="licht"&gt;S Licht. Stroke and its Rehabilitation. Wavely Press, Inc. Baltimore, MD. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  After that, the focus became how to treat patients with stroke.

For most of the last century, people were discouraged from being active after a stroke. Around the 1950s, this attitude changed, and health professionals began prescription of therapeutic exercises for stroke patient with good results. At that point, a good outcome was considered to be achieving a level of independence in which patients are able to transfer from the bed to the wheelchair without assistance.

In the early 1950s, Twitchell began studying the pattern of recovery in stroke patients. He reported on 121 patients whom he had observed. He found that by four weeks, if there is some recovery of hand function, there is a 70% chance of making a full or good recovery. He reported that most recovery happens in the first three months, and only minor recovery occurs after six months.&lt;ref name="Twitchell" /&gt; More recent research has demonstrated that significant improvement can be made years after the stroke.

Around the same time, Brunnstrom also described the process of recovery, and divided the process into seven stages. As knowledge of the science of brain recovery improved, intervention strategies have evolved. Knowledge of strokes and the process of recovery after strokes has developed significantly in the late 20th century and early 21st century.

==Current perspectives and therapeutic avenues==

===Motor re-learning===

"[[Neurocognitive Rehabilitation]] by Carlo Perfetti concept", widespread in many countries, is an original motor re-learning theories application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinktag.org/index.php?page=documents.DocumentView&amp;documentId=795858 Carlo Perfetti (1979), '''''La rieducazione motoria dell’emiplegico'''''. Ghedini, Milano.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constraint-induced movement therapy====
{{Main|Constraint-induced movement therapy}}
The idea for constraint-induced therapy is at least 100 years old. Significant research was carried out by Robert Oden. He was able to simulate a stroke in a monkey's brain, causing [[hemiplegia]]. He then bound up the monkey's good arm, and forced the monkey to use his bad arm, and observed what happened. After two weeks of this therapy, the monkeys were able to use their once hemiplegic arms again. This is due to [[neuroplasticity]]. He did the same experiment without binding the arms, and waited six months past their injury. The monkeys without the  intervention were not able to use the affected arm even six months later. In 1918, this study was published, but it received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author      = Oden, Robert| date        = 1918-03-23| title       = SYSTEMATIC THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PARALYSES IN HEMIPLEGIA| journal      = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume       = 70| issue        = 12| pages        = 828–833| doi          = 10.1001/jama.1918.02600120008003 | url          = http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/70/12/828.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, researchers began to apply his technique to stroke patients, and it came to be called [[constraint-induced movement therapy]]. Notably, the initial studies focused on chronic stroke patients who were more than 12 months past their stroke. This challenged the belief held at that time that no recovery would occur after one year. The therapy entails wearing a soft mitt on the good hand for 90% of the waking hours, forcing use of the affected hand. The patients undergo intense one-on-one therapy for six to eight hours per day for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wolf S. L. | year = 2006 | title = Effect of constraint-induced movement therapy on upper extremity function 3 to 9 months after stroke: the EXCITE randomized clinical trial | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 296 | issue = 17| pages = 2095–2104 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | pmid = 17077374 | last2 = Winstein | first2 = CJ | last3 = Miller | first3 = JP | last4 = Taub | first4 = E | last5 = Uswatte | first5 = G | last6 = Morris | first6 = D | last7 = Giuliani | first7 = C | last8 = Light | first8 = KE | last9 = Nichols-Larsen | first9 = D | doi = 10.1001/jama.296.17.2095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that supports the use of constraint induced movement therapy has been growing since its introduction as an alternative treatment method for upper limb motor deficits found in stroke populations.&lt;ref name=Hakkennes /&gt; Recently, constraint induced movement therapy has been shown to be an effective rehabilitation technique at varying stages of stroke recovery to improve upper limb motor function and use during daily activities of living. The greatest gains are seen among persons with stroke who exhibit some wrist and finger extension in the effected limb.&lt;ref name=Siebers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siebers|first=A.|author2=Oberg, U. |author3=Skargren, E. |title=The Effect of Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy on Spasticity and Motor Function of the Affected Arm in Patients with Chronic Stroke|journal=Physiotherapy Canada|date=October 2010|volume=62|issue=4|pages=388–396|url=http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/g177968x476171r3/|accessdate=12 May 2011|doi=10.3138/physio.62.4.388|pmid=21886380|pmc=2958081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes plastic changes in function and structure in patients that perform constraint induced movement therapy. These changes accompany the gains in motor function of the paretic upper limb. However, there is no established causal link between observed changes in brain function/structure and the motor gains due to constraint induced movement therapy.&lt;ref name=Hakkennes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hakkennes|first=S|author2=Keating, J. |title=Constraint-induced movement therapy following stroke: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials |journal= Australian Journal of Physiotherapy |year=2005 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages= 221–231 |url= http://svc019.wic048p.server-web.com/ajp/vol_51/4/AustJPhysiotherv51i4Hakkennes.pdf |accessdate= 13 May 2011 |doi= 10.1016/S0004-9514(05)70003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wittenberg&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wittenberg |first=G |author2= Schaechter, J. |title= The neural basis of constraint-induced movement therapy |journal= Current Opinion in Neurology |year=2009 |volume=22 |pages= 582–588 |url= http://journals.lww.com/co-neurology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&amp;issue=12000&amp;article=00005&amp;type=abstract |accessdate= 12 May 2011 |doi= 10.1097/WCO.0b013e3283320229 |pmid= 19741529 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraint induced movement therapy has recently been modified to treat aphasia in patients post CVA as well.  This treatment intervention is known as Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT).  The same general principals apply, however in this case, the client is constricted from using compensatory strategies to communicate such as gestures, writing, drawing, and pointing, and are encouraged to use verbal communication.  Therapy is typically carried out in groups and barriers are used so hands, and any compensatory strategies are not seen.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Cohen, A. (2014). Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy. Retrieved from http://researchandhope.com/constraint-induced-aphasia-therapy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mental practice/mental imagery====
[[Mental practice of action|Mental practice of movements]], has been shown in many studies to be effective in promoting recovery of both arm and leg function after a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Dickstein R and Deutsch JE. Motor Imagery in physical therapist practice. Phys Ther 2007;(87)7:942-953.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often used by physical or occupational therapists in the rehab or homehealth setting, but can also be used as part of a patient's independent home exercise program.  Mental Movement Therapy is one product available for assisting patients with guided mental imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Movement Therapy|url=http://www.rehabafterstroke.com|website=Stroke Rehab Product}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain repair===

====Electrical stimulation====

Such work represents a paradigm shift in the approach towards rehabilitation of the stroke-injured brain away from pharmacologic flooding of neuronal receptors and instead, towards targeted physiologic stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid17046674"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brown JA |title=Recovery of motor function after stroke |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=157 |issue= |pages=223–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17046674 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(06)57015-3 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-51602-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In layman's terms, this electrical stimulation mimics the action of healthy muscle to improve function and aid in retraining weak muscles and normal movement. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is commonly used in ‘foot-drop’ following stroke, but it can be used to help retrain movement in the arms or legs.

====Bobath (NDT)====
{{Main|Bobath concept}}
In patients undergoing rehabilitation with a stroke population or other central nervous system disorders (cerebral palsy, etc.), [[Bobath]], also known as [[Neurodevelopmental Treatment]] (NDT), is often the treatment of choice in North America.  The Bobath concept is best viewed as a framework for interpretation and problem solving of the individual patient’s presentation, along with their potential for improvement.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;  Components of motor control that are specifically emphasized, are the integration of postural control and task performance, the control of selective movement for the production of coordinated sequences of movement and the contribution of sensory inputs to motor control and motor learning.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;  Task practice is a component of a broad approach to treatment that includes in-depth assessment of the movement strategies utilized by the patient to perform tasks, and identification of specific deficits of neurological and neuromuscular functions.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=Kim|author2=Haase, Gerlinde.

====Mirror Therapy====

[[Mirror therapy]] (MT) has been employed with some success in treating stroke patients. Clinical studies that have combined mirror therapy with conventional rehabilitation have achieved the most positive outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;/Subeyaz, S, Yavuzer, G, Sezer, N, Koseoglu, F, Mirror Therapy Enhances Lower-Extemity Motor Recovery and Motor Functioning After Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial, Archives Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Vol 88, May 2007 [http://www.fisioterapiamarlenemuller.com.br/pdfs/SUTBEYAZ,2007%20Mirror%20therapy%20enhances%20lower-extremity%20motor%20recovery%20and%20motor%20functioning%20after%20stroke.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no clear consensus as to its effectiveness. In a recent survey of the published research, Rothgangel concluded that&lt;blockquote&gt;In stroke patients, we found a moderate quality of evidence that MT as an additional therapy improves recovery of arm function after stroke. The quality of evidence regarding the effects of MT on the recovery of lower limb functions is still low, with only one study reporting effects. In patients with CRPS and PLP, the quality of evidence is also low.&lt;ref&gt;Rothgangel, S, Braun, S, Beurskens, A, Seitz, R, Wade, D, The clinical aspects of mirror therapy in rehabilitation: a systematic review of the literature, Journal of Rehabilitation Research, 34:1-13,2011 [http://thblack.com/links/rsd/IntJRehabilRes2011_34_1_mirrorTherapy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Possible mechanisms of neurorestoration and neuroprotection by MSCs after stroke====

Transdifferentiation of MSCs into excitable neuron-like cells has been shown to be possible [[in vitro]]&lt;ref name="Kopen ''et al.'' 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mezey ''et al.'' 2000" /&gt; and these cells respond to common central nervous system neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name ="Wislet-Gendebien ''et al.'' 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wislet-Gendebien S, Hans G, Leprince P, Rigo JM, Moonen G, Rogister B | year = 2005 | title = Plasticity of cultured mesenchymal stem cells: switch from nestin-positive to excitable neuron-like phenotype | url = | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 392–402 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.2004-0149 | pmid = 15749934 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that this degree of transdifferentiation occurs [[in vivo]] and that &lt;1% of injected MSCs become truly differentiated and integrate in the damaged area.&lt;ref name ="Chen ''et al.'' 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen X, Li Y, Wang L, Katakowski M, Zhang L, Chen J, Xu Y, Gautam SC, Chopp M | year = 2002 | title = Ischemic rat brain extracts induce human marrow stromal cell growth factor production | url = | journal = Neuropathology | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 275–279 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1789.2002.00450.x | pmid = 12564767 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that transdifferentiation of MSCs into neurons or neuron-like cells is not a major mechanism by which MSCs cause neurorestoration.

Induction of [[neurogenesis]] (development of new neurons) is another possible mechanism of neurorestoration; however its correlation with functional improvement after stroke is not well established.&lt;ref name="Dharmasaroja, 2008" /&gt; The inducted cells likely originate from the ventricular zone, subventricular zone and choroid plexus, and migrate to the areas in their respective hemispheres which are damaged.&lt;ref name ="Li ''et al.'' 2002a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Y, Chen J, Chopp M | year = 2002 | title = Cell proliferation and differentiation from ependymal, subependymal and choroid plexus cells in response to stroke in rats | url = | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 193 | issue = 2| pages = 137–146 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-510X(01)00657-8 | pmid = 11790394 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Chen et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen J, Li Y, Katakowski M, Chen X, Wang L, Lu D, Lu M, Gautam SC, Chopp M | year = 2003 | title = Intravenous bone marrow stromal cell therapy reduces apoptosis and promotes endogenous cell proliferation after stroke in female rat | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Research | volume = 73 | issue = 6| pages = 778–786 | doi=10.1002/jnr.10691| pmid = 12949903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lee ''et al.'' 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee J, Kuroda S, Shichinohe H, Ikeda J, Seki T, Hida K, Tada M, Sawada K, Iwasaki Y | year = 2003 | title = Migration and differentiation of nuclear fluorescence-labeled bone marrow stromal cells after transplantation into cerebral infarct and spinal cord injury in mice | url = | journal = Neuropathology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 169–180 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1789.2003.00496.x | pmid = 14570283 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Yano ''et al.'' 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yano S, Kuroda S, Shichinohe H, Hida K, Iwasaki Y | year = 2005 | title = Do bone marrow stromal cells proliferate after transplantation into mice cerebral infarct?–A double labelling study | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1065 | issue = 1–2| pages = 60–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2005.10.031 | pmid = 16313889 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the induction of neurogenesis, the induction of [[angiogenesis]] (development of new blood vessels) by MSCs has been associated with improvements in brain function after ischemic strokes&lt;ref name ="Liu ''et al.'' 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu H, Honmou O, Harada K, Nakamura K, Houkin K, Hamada H, Kocsis JD | year = 2006 | title = Neuroprotection by PlGF gene-modified human mesenchymal stem cells after cerebral ischaemia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 129 | issue = Pt 10| pages = 2734–2745 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awl207 | pmid = 16901914 | pmc = 2605397 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Shen ''et al.'' 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shen LH, Li Y, Chen J, Zhang J, Vanguri P, Borneman J, Chopp M | year = 2006 | title = Intracarotid transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells increases axon-myelin remodelling after stroke | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 137 | issue = 2| pages = 393–399 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.08.092 | pmid = 16298076 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is linked to improved neuronal recruitment.&lt;ref name ="Louissaint ''et al.'' 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Louissaint Jr A, Rao S, Leventhal C, Goldman SA | year = 2002 | title = Coordinated interaction of neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the adult songbird brain | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 945–960 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00722-5 | pmid = 12086642 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[synaptogenesis]] (formation of new synapses between neurons) has been shown to increase after MSC treatment;&lt;ref name="Shen ''et al.'' 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen J, Chopp M (2006) Neurorestorative treatment of stroke: cell and pharmacological approaches. NeuroRX 3:466–473.&lt;/ref&gt; this combination of improved neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis may lead to a more significant functional improvement in damaged areas as a result of MSC treatment.

MSC treatment also has shown to have various neuroprotective effects,&lt;ref name="Brazelton ''et al.'' 2000" /&gt; including reductions in apoptosis,&lt;ref name="Chen et al. 2003" /&gt; inflammation and demyelination, as well as increased astrocyte survival rates.&lt;ref name="Shen ''et al.'' 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Li et al. 2005"&gt;Li Y, Chen J, Zhang CL, Zhang CL, Wang L, Lu D, Katakowski M, Gao Q, Shen LH, Zhang J, Lu M, Chopp M (2005) Gliosis and brain remodeling after treatment of stroke in rats with marrow stromal cells.

Although activation of endogenous neuroprotection and neurorestoration probably has a major part in the improvement of brain function after stroke, it is likely that the functional improvements as a result of MSC treatment are due to combined action via multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms to affect neurorestoration and neuroprotection, rather than just a single mechanism. These effects are also modulated by key variables, including the number of and type of MSCs used, timing of treatment relative to when the patient’s stroke occurred, route of delivery of the MSCs, as well as patient variables (e.g. age, underlying conditions).&lt;ref name="Dharmasaroja, 2008" /&gt;

====What this means for stroke patients and the limitations or concerns with MSCs as a potential treatment====

If MSC treatment becomes available for stroke patients, it is possible that current mortality and morbidity rates could substantially improve due to the direct enhancement of neuroprotection and neurorestoration mechanisms rather than only indirect facilitation or prevention of further damage, e.g. decompressive surgery. However, for MSC treatment to be used effectively and safely in a clinical setting, more research needs to be conducted, specifically in the areas of determining the relative influences of key variables (especially patient variables) on patient outcomes as well quantifying potential risks, e.g. tumour formation. Although ethical concerns are mostly limited to the use of [[embryonic stem cells]],&lt;ref name ="Frankel, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frankel MS | year = 2000 | title = In search of stem cell policy | url = | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5457| page = 1397 | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5457.1397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it may also be important to address any possible ethical concerns (however unlikely) over the use of somatic stem cells.

==Training of muscles affected by the upper motor neuron syndrome==
Muscles affected by the upper motor neuron syndrome have many potential features of altered performance including: weakness, decreased motor control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, [[spasticity]] and decreased endurance.
The term "spasticity" is often erroneously used interchangeably with upper motor neuron syndrome, and it is not unusual to see patients labeled as spastic who demonstrate an array of UMN findings.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanhoe CB, Reistetter TA: "Spasticity: The misunderstood part of the upper motor neuron syndrome" ''Am J Phys Med Rehabil'' 2004;83(suppl):S3–S9.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that approximately 65% of individuals develop spasticity following stroke,&lt;ref name=Gallichio &gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallichio J | year = 2004 | title = Pharmacologic management of spasticity following stroke | url = | journal = Phys Ther | volume = 84 | issue = 10| pages = 973–981 | pmid = 15449979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies have revealed that approximately 40% of stroke victims may still have spasticity at 12 months post-stroke.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;{{cite journal | author = Watkins CL | year = 2002 | title = Prevalence of spasticity post stroke | url = | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 16 | issue = 5| pages = 515–522 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1191/0269215502cr512oa | pmid = 12194622 | last2 = Leathley | first2 = MJ | last3 = Gregson | first3 = JM | last4 = Moore | first4 = AP | last5 = Smith | first5 = TL | last6 = Sharma | first6 = AK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in muscle tone probably result from alterations in the balance of inputs from reticulospinal and other descending pathways to the motor and interneuronal circuits of the spinal cord, and the absence of an intact corticospinal system.&lt;ref name=Vanek/&gt;  In other words, there is damage to the part of the brain or spinal cord that controls voluntary movement.

Various means are available for the treatment of the effects of the upper motor neuron syndrome. These include: exercises to improve strength, control and endurance, nonpharmacologic therapies, oral drug therapy, intrathecal drug therapy, injections, and surgery.&lt;ref name=Gallichio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanek&gt;Vanek ZF Menkes JH (2005) [http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic706.htm "Spasticity"] eMedicine article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;Mayer et al.

(2002) ''Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Secrets'', 2nd Edition, Hanley &amp; Belfus, Inc., pp442–446&lt;/ref&gt;
While Landau suggests that researchers do not believe that treating spasticity is worthwhile, many scholars and clinicians continue to attempt to manage/treat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Landau WM |title=Spasticity after stroke: why bother? |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1787–8; author reply 1787–8 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15232114 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000136388.80433.eb |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/8/1787 |last2=Sommerfeld |first2=D.

Another group of researchers concluded that while spasticity may contribute to significant motor and activity impairments post-stroke, the role of spasticity has been overemphasized in stroke rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sommerfeld DK, Eek EU, Svensson AK, Holmqvist LW, von Arbin MH |title=Spasticity after stroke: its occurrence and association with motor impairments and activity limitations |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=134–9 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14684785 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000105386.05173.5E |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/1/134|last2=Eek |last3=Svensson |last4=Holmqvist |last5=von Arbin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a survey done by the National Stroke Association, while 58 percent of survivors in the survey experienced spasticity, only 51 percent of those had received treatment for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recoveryfromastroke.com/ |title=Recovery From A Stroke |accessdate=24 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonpharmacologic therapies===
Treatment should be based on assessment by the relevant health professionals.  For muscles with mild-to-moderate impairment, [[strength training|exercise]] should be the mainstay of management, and is likely to need to be prescribed by a physiotherapist.

Muscles with severe impairment are likely to be more limited in their ability to exercise and may require help to do this.  They may require additional interventions, to manage the greater neurological impairment and also the greater secondary complications. These interventions may include serial casting, flexibility exercise such as sustained positioning programs, and patients may require equipment, such as using a standing frame to sustain a standing position. Applying specially made Lycra garments may also be beneficial.&lt;ref name=Gracies&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gracies JM | year = 1997 | title = Lycra garments designed for patients with upper limb spasticity: mechanical effects in normal subjects | url = | journal = Arch Phys Med Rehabil | volume = 78 | issue = 10| pages = 1066–71 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-9993(97)90129-5 | pmid = 9339154 | last2 = Fitzpatrick | first2 = R | last3 = Wilson | first3 = L | last4 = Burke | first4 = D | last5 = Gandevia | first5 = SC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physiotherapy====
[[Physiotherapy]] is beneficial in this area as it helps post-[[stroke]] individuals to progress through the stages of motor recovery.&lt;ref name="OSul"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Susan. B | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = 5 | editors = O'Sullivan, S.B., and Schmitz, T.J | publisher = F.A.

B | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = 5 | editors = O'Sullivan, S.B., and Schmitz, T.J. | publisher = F.A. Davis Company | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia | pages = 719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As recovery begins, and progresses, basic movement synergies will develop into more complex and difficult movement combinations.&lt;ref name="Twitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunnstrom"/&gt; Concurrently, [[spasticity]] may develop and become quite severe before it begins to decline (if it does at all).&lt;ref name="Twitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunnstrom"/&gt; Although an overall pattern of motor recovery exists, there is much variability between each individual’s recovery. As previously described, the role of spasticity in stroke [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] is controversial. However, physiotherapy can help to improve motor performance, in part, through the management of spasticity.&lt;ref name="Bhakta"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Management of spasticity in stroke | journal = British Medical Bulletin | year = 2000 | first = Bipin B | last = Bhakta | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 476–485| id =  | doi = 10.1258/0007142001903111 | pmid = 11092096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaddressed [[spasticity]] will result in the maintenance of abnormal resting limb postures which can lead to [[contracture]] formation.&lt;ref name="Bhakta"/&gt; In the arm, this may interfere with [[hand hygiene]] and dressing, whereas in the leg, abnormal resting postures may result in difficulty transferring. In order to help manage spasticity, [[physiotherapy]] interventions should focus on modifying or reducing [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref name="OSul"/&gt; Strategies include mobilizations of the affected limbs early in [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], along with elongation of the spastic muscle and sustained [[stretching]].&lt;ref name="OSul"/&gt; In addition, the passive manual technique of rhythmic rotation can help to increase initial range.&lt;ref name="OSul"/&gt; Activating the [[antagonist (muscle)]] in a slow and controlled movement is a beneficial training strategy that can be used by post-stroke individuals.&lt;ref name="Bhakta"/&gt; Splinting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saebo.com/benefits-rehabilitation-gloves-dynamic-splints-stroke-recovery/|title=Rehabilitation Gloves and Dynamic Splints For Stroke Recovery|date=2016-06-27|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain muscle stretch and provide tone inhibition, and cold (i.e. in the form of ice packs), to decrease neural firing, are other strategies that can be used to temporarily decrease the extent of spasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Susan. B | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = 5 | editors = O'Sullivan, S.B., and Schmitz, T.J. | publisher = F.A. Davis Company | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia | pages = 744–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of physiotherapy for post-stroke individuals is to improve motor performance, in part, through the manipulation of muscle tone.&lt;ref name="Bhakta"/&gt;

===Oral drug therapies===
Oral medications used for the treatment of spasticity include: [[diazepam]] (Valium), [[dantrolene]] sodium, [[baclofen]], [[tizanidine]], [[clonidine]], [[gabapentin]],&lt;ref name=Gallichio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer/&gt; and even [[cannabinoid]]-like compounds.³ The exact mechanism of these medications is not fully understood, but they are thought to act on neurotransmitters or neuromodulators within the central nervous system (CNS) or muscle itself, or to decrease the stretch reflexes. The problem with these medications is their potential side effects and the fact that, other than lessening painful or disruptive spasms and dystonic postures, drugs in general have not been shown to decrease impairments or lessen disabilities.&lt;ref name=Dobkin&gt;Dobkin  BH (2003) ''The Clinical Science of Neurologic Rehabilitation''. New York, NY. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrathecal drug therapy===
Intrathecal administration of drugs involves the implantation of a pump that delivers medication directly to the CNS.&lt;ref name=Gallichio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanek/&gt; The benefit of this is that the drug remains in the spinal cord, without traveling in the bloodstream, and there are often fewer side effects. The most commonly used medication for this is [[baclofen pump|baclofen]] but [[morphine sulfate]] and [[Fentanyl]] have been used as well, mainly for severe pain as a result of the spasticity.

===Injections===
Injections are focal treatments administered directly into the spastic muscle. Drugs used include: [[Botulinum toxin]] (BTX), [[phenol]], alcohol, and [[lidocaine]].&lt;ref name=Gallichio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer/&gt; Phenol and alcohol cause local muscle damage by denaturing protein, and thus relaxing the muscle. Botulinum toxin is a [[neurotoxin]] and it relaxes the muscle by preventing the release of a neurotransmitter ([[acetylcholine]]). Many studies have shown the benefits of BTX&lt;ref name=Gallichio/&gt; and it has also been demonstrated that repeat injections of BTX show unchanged effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Lagalla&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lagalla G | year = 2000 | title = Post-stroke spasticity management with repeated botulinum toxin injections of the upper limb | url = | journal = Am J Phys Med Rehabil | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 377–84 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1097/00002060-200007000-00010 | last2 = Danni | first2 = Maura | last3 = Reiter | first3 = Frank | last4 = Ceravolo | first4 = Maria Gabriella | last5 = Provinciali | first5 = Leandro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
Surgical treatment for spasticity includes lengthening or releasing of muscle and tendons, procedures involving bones, and also selective dorsal [[rhizotomy]].&lt;ref name=Vanek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer/&gt; Rhizotomy, usually reserved for severe spasticity, involves cutting selective sensory [[nerve roots]], as they probably play a role in generating spasticity.

==Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain Following Stroke==

==== Cause ====
Hemiplegic shoulder pain (shoulder pain on the stroke-affected side of the body) is a common source of pain and dysfunction following stroke.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Braddom's rehabilitation care : a clinical handbook|isbn=9780323497336|pages=244–247|ref=Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause ([[etiology]]) of hemiplegic shoulder pain remains unclear,&lt;ref name="EBRSR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebrsr.com/evidence-review/11-hemiplegic-shoulder-pain-complex-regional-pain-syndrome|title=Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain &amp; Complex Regional Pain Syndrome {{!}} EBRSR - Evidence-Based Review of Stroke Rehabilitation|website=www.ebrsr.com|language=en|ref=EBRSR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible causes may include shoulder [[subluxation]], [[muscle contracture]]s, [[spasticity]], [[rotator cuff]] disorders or [[Impingement syndrome|impingement]], and [[complex regional pain syndrome]].&lt;ref name="EBRSR2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Rebecca A.|last2=Field|first2=Thalia S.|date=2015|title=Post Stroke Pain: Identification, Assessment, and Therapy|journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=190–201|doi=10.1159/000375397|ref=Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the shoulder is very mobile, and relies on muscles and ligaments to support it, therefore, if a stroke damages the neurons that control those muscles and ligaments, the whole joint will be affected and pain may result.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

==== Non-pharmacological treatment ====
There are several non-pharmacological interventions which are recommended for prevention and treatment of post-stroke hemiplegic shoulder pain. These include proper positioning, [[range of motion]] exercises, motor retraining, and [[adjuvant]] therapies like neuromuscular [[Electric stimulation therapy|electric stimulation]] (NMES) (e.g. functional electric stimulation (FES)).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winstein|first=Carolee J.|last2=Stein|first2=Joel|last3=Arena|first3=Ross|last4=Bates|first4=Barbara|last5=Cherney|first5=Leora R.|last6=Cramer|first6=Steven C.|last7=Deruyter|first7=Frank|last8=Eng|first8=Janice J.|last9=Fisher|first9=Beth|date=2016|title=Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association|url=|journal=Stroke|volume=47|issue=6|pages=e98–e169|doi=10.1161/STR.0000000000000098|issn=1524-4628|pmid=27145936|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of slings remains controversial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Functional electric stimulation FES is a NMES technique where nerves or muscles affected by stroke receive bursts of low-level electrical current.&lt;ref name="Engine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.strokengine.ca/en/intervention/functional-electrical-stimulation-hemiplegic-shoulder/|title=Functional Electrical Stimulation - hemiplegic shoulder - Stroke Engine|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation: Stroke Engine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13|ref=Engine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/702604771|title=Modalities for therapeutic intervention|last=|first=|publisher=F.A.

== Shoulder subluxation following stroke ==
[[Glenohumeral joint|Glenohumeral]] (or shoulder) [[subluxation]] is defined as a partial or incomplete [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the shoulder joint that typically results from changes in the mechanical integrity of the joint.   Subluxation is a common problem with [[hemiplegia]], or weakness of the musculature of the upper limb.   Traditionally this has been thought to be a significant cause of post-stroke shoulder pain, although a few recent studies have failed to show a direct correlation between shoulder subluxation and pain.

The exact cause of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but appears to be caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint.  The shoulder is one of the most mobile joints in the body.  To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., [[rotator cuff muscles]], [[latissimus dorsi muscle|latissimus dorsi]], and [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]]) for much of its support.  This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. If a stroke damages the upper motor neurons controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern.  The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the [[supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus]] and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and outward movement of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak [[joint capsule]].  Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.

Diagnosis can usually be made by [[palpation]] or by feeling the joint and surrounding tissues, although there is controversy as to whether or not the degree of subluxation can be measured clinically.  If shoulder subluxation occurs, it can become a barrier to the rehabilitation process.  Treatment involves measures to support the subluxed joint such as taping the joint, using a [[lapboard]] or armboard.  A shoulder sling may be used, but is controversial and a few studies have shown no appreciable difference in range-of-motion, degree of subluxation, or pain when using a sling. A sling may also contribute to contractures and increased flexor tone if used for extended periods of time as it places the arm close to the body in [[adduction]], [[internal rotation]] and elbow [[flexion]]. Use of a sling can also contribute to learned nonuse by preventing the functional and spontaneous use of the affected upper extremity. That said, a sling may be necessary for some therapy activities. Slings may be considered appropriate during therapy for initial transfer and [[gait training]], but overall use should be limited. As the patient begins to recover, [[spasticity]] and voluntary movement of the shoulder will occur as well as reduction in the shoulder subluxation. Slings are of no value at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors = O'Sullivan and Schmitz | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = Fifth Edition | publisher = F.A. Davis Company | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia, PA | pages = 753–754 | isbn = 978-0-8036-1247-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional electrical stimulation]] (FES) has also shown promising results in treatment of subluxation, and reduction of pain, although some studies have shown a return of pain after discontinuation of FES. More recent research has failed to show any reduction of pain with the use of FES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=KOYUNCU|first=E.|author2=NAKIPOGLU-YUZER, G., DOGAN, OZGIRGIN, N. A., &amp;|title=The effectiveness of functional electrical stimulation for the treatment of shoulder subluxation and shoulder pain in hemiplegic patients: A randomized controlled trial|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|year=2010|volume=32|issue=7|pages=560–566|doi=10.3109/09638280903183811|pmid=20136474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical treatment consists of preventive measures such as early [[range of motion]], proper positioning, passive support of [[soft tissue]] structures and possibly early re-activation of shoulder musculature using functional electrical stimulation. Aggressive exercises such as overhead pulleys should be avoided with this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=R.|author2=Metter, E. |author3=Mehta, A. |author4=Chew, T. |title=Shoulder pain in hemiplegia: The role of exercise|journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation|date=August 1990|volume=69|issue=4|pages=205–208|doi=10.1097/00002060-199008000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-stroke pain syndromes==
Chronic pain syndromes are common in about one half of stroke patients.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is neuropathic pain which is caused by damage to the neurons in the brain (central nervous system), as the result of a vascular injury. One study found that up to 8% of people who have had a stroke will develop central post-stroke pain, and that the pain will be moderate to severe in 5% of those affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andersen G Vestergaard K Ingeman-Nielsen M Tensen TS | year = 1995 | title = Incidence of Central Poststroke Pain| journal = Pain | volume = 61| issue = 2 | pages = 187–196 | doi=10.1016/0304-3959(94)00144-4| last2 = Vestergaard | last3 = Ingeman-Nielsen | last4 = Jensen }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The condition was formerly called "[[thalamic pain syndrome|thalamic pain]]", because of the high incidence among those with damage to the [[thalamus]] or [[thalamic nuclei]]. Now known as CPSP, it is characterized by perceived pain from non-painful stimuli, such as temperature and light touch. This altered perception of stimuli, or [[allodynia]], can be difficult to assess due to the fact that the pain can change daily in description and location, and can appear anywhere from months to years after the stroke. CPSP can also lead to a heightened central response to painful sensations, or [[hyperpathia]]. Affected persons may describe the pain as [[cramping]], burning, crushing, shooting, [[pins and needles]], and even [[bloating]] or [[urinary urgency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicholson B | year = 2004 | title = Evaluation and Treatment of Central Pain Syndromes | journal = Neurology | volume = 62(supp)| pages = S30–36|doi=10.1212/wnl.62.5_suppl_2.s30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the variation and mechanism of pain in CPSP have made it difficult to treat. Several strategies have been employed by physicians, including intravenous lidocaine, [[opioids]]/narcotics, [[anti-depressant]]s, [[anti-convulsant|anti-epileptic medications]] and [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] procedures with varying success. Higher rates of successful pain control in persons with CPSP can be achieved by treating other sequelae of stroke, such as depression and spasticity. As the age of the population increases, the diagnosis and management of CPSP will become increasingly important to improve the quality of life of an increasing number of stroke survivors.

==Apraxia==
{{main|Apraxia}}
An uncommon, less understood result of stroke is a condition called [[apraxia]]. This condition was initially recognized as: 'Disorders of the execution of learned movements which cannot be accounted for by either weakness, incoordination, or sensory loss, nor by incomprehension of, or inattention to commands.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Can Heugten CM | year = 2001 | title = Rehabilitation and Management of Apraxia After Stroke | journal = Reviews in Clinical Gerontology | volume = 11| pages = 177–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Several forms of apraxia are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cigna.com/healthinfo/nord766.html&lt;/ref&gt; Limb-kinetic apraxia is the inability to make precise or exact movements with a finger, an arm or a leg. [[Idiomotor effect|idiomotor]] apraxia is the inability to carry out a command from the brain to mimic limb or head movements performed or suggested by others. Conceptual apraxia is similar to idiomotor apraxia, but infers a more profound malfunctioning in which the function of tools or objects is no longer understood. Ideational apraxia is the inability to create a plan for a specific movement. Buccofacial apraxia, or facial-oral apraxia, is the inability to coordinate and carry out facial and lip movements such as whistling, winking, coughing, etc. on command. Constructional apraxia affects the person’s ability to draw or copy simple diagrams, or to construct simple figures. Oculomotor apraxia is a condition in which the patient finds it difficult to move his/her eyes.   Many believe that the most common form of apraxia is idiomotor apraxia, in which a disconnection between the area of the brain containing plans for a movement and the area of the brain that is responsible for executing that movement occurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Unlike many effects of stroke, where the clinician is able to judge the particular area of the brain that a stroke has injured by certain signs or symptoms, the causation of apraxia is less clear. A common theory is that the part of the brain that contains information for previously learned skilled motor activities has been either lost or cannot be accessed. The condition is usually due to an insult to the dominant hemisphere of the brain. More often this is located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere of the brain. Treatment of acquired apraxia due to stroke usually consists of physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   The Copenhagen Stroke Study, which is a large important study published in 2001, showed that out of 618 stroke patients, manual apraxia was found in 7% and oral apraxia was found in 6%.&lt;ref name="Pederson PM et al 2001 685–692"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pederson PM | year = 2001 | title = Manual and Oral Apraxia in Acute Stroke, Frequency and Influence on Functional Outcome: The Copenhagen Stroke Study | journal = American Journal of Physical Medicine | volume = 80| issue=9 |pages = 685–692|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both manual and oral apraxia were related to increasing severity of stroke. Oral apraxia was related with an increase in age at the time of the stroke. There was no difference in incidence among gender. It was also found that the finding of apraxia has no negative influence on ability to function after rehabilitation is completed.   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently sponsoring a clinical trial to gain an understanding of how the brain operates while carrying out and controlling voluntary motor movements in normal subjects. The objective is to determine what goes wrong with these processes in the course of acquired apraxia due to stroke or brain injury.&lt;ref name="Pederson PM et al 2001 685–692"/&gt;

==Lateral medullary syndrome==
{{main|Lateral medullary syndrome}}
[[Lateral medullary syndrome]], also known as Wallenberg's syndrome, is caused by blockage of the [[posterior inferior cerebellar artery]] (PICA) or the [[vertebral arteries]]. Signs and symptoms include decreased pain and temperature on the same side of the face and opposite side of the body compared to the lesion, [[ataxia]] on the same side of the lesion, and [[Horner's syndrome]] on the same side of the face.

Treatment in the acute setting is mostly focused on symptomatic management. After initial treatment in the hospital, some patients will need short-term placement in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe [[nausea]] and [[vertigo]] can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with [[anti-emetic]]s and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include [[ondansetron]], [[metoclopramide]], [[prochlorperazine]], and [[promethazine]]. These medications are also used to treat [[hiccups]], along with [[chlorpromazine]]. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including [[baclofen]] and [[anti-convulsant|anti-epileptic medications]]. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.

==Post-stroke depression==
[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is a commonly reported consequence of stroke and is seen in 25–50% of patients.  The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-IV-TR) defines post-stroke depression as "a mood disorder due to a general medical condition (i.e. stroke) that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of [that] condition".  Post-stroke depression may involve depressed mood and decreased interest and pleasure that impairs social and occupational functioning, but does not necessarily need to meet the full criteria of a major depressive disorder.

The first studies to look for an association between specific stroke lesions and the occurrence of depression reported a correlation between left frontal lesions and major depression.  Damage to the frontal [[noradrenergic]], [[dopaminergic]], and [[serotonergic]] projections were thought to cause a depletion of [[catecholamine]]s, leading to depression.  However, more recent studies have demonstrated that the anatomic aspects of a lesion do not necessarily correlate with the occurrence of depression.  Other psychological factors can lead to the development of depression including personal and social losses related to the physical disabilities often caused by a stroke.

The incidence of post-stroke depression peaks at 3–6 months and usually resolves within 1–2 years after the stroke, although a minority of patients can go on to develop chronic depression.  The diagnosis of post-stroke depression is complicated by other consequences of stroke such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[psychomotor retardation]] – which do not necessarily indicate the presence of depression.  Loss of interest in activities and relationships should prompt an evaluation for depression.

Traditionally, [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs), such as [[nortriptyline]], have been used in the treatment of post-stroke depression.  More recently, the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), such as [[fluoxetine]] and [[citalopram]], have become the pharmacologic therapy of choice due to the lower incidence of [[adverse effect|side effects]].  Also, psychologic treatment such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[group therapy]], and [[family therapy]] are reported to be useful adjuncts to treatment.

Overall, the development of post-stroke depression can play a significant role in a patient’s recovery from a stroke.  The severity of post-stroke depression has been associated with severity of impairment in [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs).  By effectively treating depression, patients experience a greater recovery of basic ADLs such as dressing, eating and ambulating, as well as instrumental ADLs, such as the ability to take care of financial and household matters.  In essence, recognition and treatment of post-stroke depression leads to greater functional ability for the patient over time.

== History ==
The Boston Foundation was founded in 1915 by Charles E. and Charles M. Rogerson, who were father and son.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/tbforg/There_at_the_Beginning/There%20from%20the%20Beginning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the Permanent Charity Fund, it was one of the first community foundations in the United States, but, thanks to a bequest of $4 million shortly after it was launched, it was the first with the resources to begin grant making.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; In 1959 another large bequest of $20 million catapulted the Foundation into an era during which it made early investments in some of the most important nonprofit institutions in Boston, from WGBH to the New England Aquarium to the clean up of Boston Harbor.  1985, the foundation was renamed the Boston Foundation, and Anna Faith Jones became the President—the first African-American woman to lead a major foundation in the United States.  Today, it is led by President and CEO, Paul S. Grogan, who is credited with transforming the Foundation into a major civic leader for the city and region.&lt;ref name="TBF-84"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/AboutTBF/AboutTBFDetail.aspx?id=84 Meet Our President].

== Grant Making ==
Over more than 100 years of grantmaking, the Foundation has been there at the beginning for numerous fresh ideas and new institutions by providing crucial seed capital and other support.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; Among its greatest accomplishments are grants that helped to launch [[WGBH-TV]], now considered the nation’s premier public television station.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made an early investment in the redevelopment of Faneuil Hall into a thriving marketplace, often credited with sparking the renewal of Boston in recent decades; and helped to shape Boston’s Longwood Medical Center area.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; The Foundation invested in the most extensive network of community health centers in the nation and made grants to a group called Save the Harbor/Save the Bay to clean up Boston Harbor.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; What was once one of the filthiest harbors in the world is now one of the cleanest.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made early grants to numerous organizations that started in Boston and spread throughout the country, like City Year, Citizen Schools and Year Up.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt;

Today, the Foundation and its donors make grants&lt;ref name="grants"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/GrantSeekers/GrantSeekersHome.aspx Grant Seekers]. Tbf.org (July 1, 2011).

It also provides leadership for special initiatives, such as the Success Boston College Completion Initiative and SkillWorks.

== Civic leadership ==
Through its Understanding Boston series, the Boston Foundation commissions research from universities, think tanks and other organizations and shares this information through a series of forums that are attended by thousands of people every year.&lt;ref name="UB"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/UnderstandingBoston/Default.aspx The Boston Foundation]. Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues addressed through Understanding Boston embrace a broad range of issues, including public education, housing, the workforce, health, philanthropy and the nonprofit sector, the arts and the urban environment.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;

In addition to providing fresh information and bringing people together to discuss findings, the Foundation also creates Task Forces and Action Agendas to produce positive change.  A number of issues have been influenced by this process.  The Commonwealth Housing Task Force created a Smart Growth housing effort to address the current shortage of housing in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/chtf The Commonwealth Housing Task Force].

==Plot summary==
{{in-universe|date=February 2015}}
The novel is set in a [[post-human]] future solar system. [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Jean le Flambeur|Jean le Flambeur]] is a legendary thief who has been imprisoned in a [[Prisoner's dilemma|Dilemma Prison]], a virtual jail of the [[Sobornost]] created by the [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Sobornost|Archons]], themselves the creation of the [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Sobornost|Engineer-of-Souls]]. During an unsuccessful encounter with the [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Sobornost|All-Defector]], he is sprung from his prison in the [[Neptune trojan|Neptunian Trojan belt]] by [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Mieli|Mieli]], a warrior from the [[Oort cloud]], and taken to her ship, [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Perhonen|''Perhonen'']]. There, he finds out that his freedom comes at a price: he must return to his old criminal ways to steal something for Mieli's employer, the [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Joséphine Pellegrini|pellegrini]]. First, however, he has to retrieve his previous memories, which he had meticulously hidden in the [[Oubliette]], one of the Moving Cities of Mars.

In the Oubliette, [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Isidore Beautrelet|Isidore Beautrelet]] is unraveling a [[Dead Souls|Gogol]] piracy case, brought to his attention by his [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Tzaddikim|tzaddik]] mentor, [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Gentleman|The Gentleman]]. Isidore is an architecture student and only ten [[Timekeeping on Mars#Martian year|Martian years]] old, but he has accumulated a reputation as a sharp detective. This case, however, exposes him to unwanted fame, which is extremely gauche in polite Oubliette society, where even people who share a flat remain discreetly behind a cloud of "gevulot" to avoid the faux pas of violating each other's privacy. Notoriety, however, brought him to the attention of a new client, the millenniaire [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Christian Unruh|Christian Unruh]]. Unruh is about to host a party to commemorate his early entry into Quiet, but a note has appeared under impossible circumstances in his mansion, which Unruh asks Isidore to investigate. The note announces an unlikely gate-crasher to the party: Jean le Flambeur.

== Themes ==
Themes central to ''The Quantum Thief'' are the unreliability and malleability of memory and the effects of extreme longevity on an individual's perspective and personality. Prisons, [[surveillance]] and control in society are also major themes.

In the book, the people living in the Oubliette society on Mars have two types of memory; in addition to a traditional, personal memory, there is the [[exomemory]], which can be accessed by other people, from anywhere in the city. Memories about personal experiences can be stored in the exomemory and partitioned, with different levels of access granted to different people. These memories can be used, among other things, as an expedient form of communication.

The Oubliette society has an economy where time is used as currency. When an individual's time is expended, their consciousness is uploaded into a "Quiet". The Quiet are mute machine servants who maintain and protect the city. Although the quiet seem to have little interest in the world outside their occupations, they do seem to retain some traces of their former personalities and memories.

The conspiracy central to the plot involves the hidden rulers, called the "cryptarchs", manipulating and abusing the exomemory and through the citizens' transformations to quiet and back, the traditional memory as well. In the book, the Oubliette society is compared to a [[panopticon]]; a prison, where every action of the dwellers can be scrutinized.

==History and influences==
The first chapter of ''The Quantum Thief'' was presented by Rajaniemi's literary agent, John Jarrold, to Gollancz as the basis for the three-book deal that was eventually secured. Rajaniemi has stated that he had "come up with an outline that had every single idea I could cram into it, because I wanted to be worthy of what had happened." The outline eventually expanded into three parts, and the first part became ''The Quantum Thief''.&lt;ref name=SFN&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/interview-hannu-rajaniemi/ | title=Interview: Hannu Rajaniemi | author=Sam Bandah | work=SciFiNow | accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel's plot was inspired by one of Rajaniemi's favorite characters in fiction, [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s gentleman thief [[Arsène Lupin]], who operates on both sides of the law. What intrigued Rajaniemi were the cycles of redemption and relapse Lupin goes through as he tries to go straight, always falling  short.&lt;ref name=Guard/&gt; Besides LeBlanc, Rajaniemi mentioned [[Roger Zelazny]] as a strong influence. [[Ian McDonald (British author)|Ian McDonald]] was the other SF author he mentioned as influential,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekchocolate.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=262%3Ahannu-rajaniemi-novelist-and-mathematician&amp;catid=47%3Ainterview&amp;Itemid=62&amp;showall=1 Interview of Hannu Rajaniemi - novelist and mathematician], 24 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt; plus Frances A.Yates's book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'', for [[memory palace]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/15/hannu-rajaniemi-the-quantum-thief-q-a 2011 interview of Rajaniemi] at ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Rajaniemi said he wasn't trying to write the novel as [[hard SF]]: "For me, the more important consequence of having a scientific background is a degree of speculative rigour: trying hard to work out the consequences of the assumptions one begins with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldsf.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/original-content-an-interview-with-hannu-rajaniemi/ An Interview with Hannu Rajaniemi] by Preston Grassmann, November 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel has received generally positive reviews. [[Gary K. Wolfe]] writes in his ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' review that Rajaniemi has "spectacularly delivered on the promise that this is likely the most important debut SF novel we'll see this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2010/09/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-hannu-rajaniemi/ | title=Gary K. Wolfe reviews Hannu Rajaniemi | author=Gary K. Wolfe| work=Locus Magazine | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovegrove]], reviewing the book in his ''[[Financial Times]]'' column, notes that "many an anglophone author would kill to turn out prose half as good as this, especially on their maiden effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d8a91ee8-a0ea-11df-badd-00144feabdc0.html | title=Alien Nations | author=James Lovegrove | work=The Financial Times | accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Brown, reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', finds the novel to be "a brilliant debut", while alluding to the "apocryphal" (and incorrect) myth that "this novel sold on the strength of its first line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/scifi-roundup-reviews-eric-brown | title=Science fiction roundup | author=Eric Brown| work=The Guardian | accessdate=2010-12-12 | location=London | date=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Bandah, at ''[[SciFiNow]]'', praises the novel for "its engaging narrative and characters backed by often almost intimidatingly good sci-fi concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/launch/book-review-the-quantum-thief/ | title=Book review: The Quantum Thief | author=Sam Bandah| work=SciFiNow | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism for the novel has generally centred on Rajaniemi's sparse "[[show, don't tell]]" writing style. Brown notes that "the author makes no concessions to the lazy reader with [[Exposition (literary technique)#Information dump|info-dumps]] or convenient explanations." Niall Alexander, of the Speculative Scotsman, states that "had there been some sort of index, [he] would have gladly (and repeatedly) referred to it during the mind-boggling first third of ''The Quantum Thief''", while proclaiming the novel to be "''the'' sci-fi debut of 2010."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://scotspec.blogspot.com/2010/07/book-review-quantum-thief-by-hannu.html | title=Book Review: The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi| author=Niall Alexander | work=The Speculative Scotsman | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tich''' (1940–1959) was a [[mixed-breed dog|mixed-breed]] [[military dog]] during the [[Second World War]]. She was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]] in 1949 for her actions during the war as a battalion mascot to the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]]. The Dickin Medal is considered to be the animal's [[Victoria Cross]]. After the war she lived with her battalion handler at his home in the UK. After she died she was buried in the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA)'s [[Ilford Animal Cemetery]].

==Military service==
[[File:Tich DM.jpg|thumb|Tich's grave at Ilford Animal Cemetery]]
During the fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] during the [[Second World War]] in 1941, a small cross-breed dog was found by soldiers of the 1st Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]]. Named "Tich" and nicknamed "The Desert Rat",&lt;ref name=desertrat&gt;{{cite web|title="Tich" - The Desert Rat|url=http://www.krrcassociation.com/swiftandbold/tich_the_desert_rat.pdf|publisher=King's Royal Rifle Corps Association|accessdate=10 December 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; she acted as a mascot to the Battalion. In 1943, the dog was passed to Rifleman Thomas Walker. The dog accompanied Walker whilst on the front line, riding usually on the bonnet of a [[bren gun carrier]] or a [[jeep]].&lt;ref name=rgjm&gt;{{cite web|title=PDSA Dickin Medal Awarded in 1949 to 'Tich' a Black Mongrel Terrier|url=http://www.rgjmuseum.co.uk/pages_object/obj_0009.asp|publisher=Royal Green Jackets Museum|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1944, she was smuggled aboard the ship that took the battalion to Italy and whilst on board had puppies.&lt;ref name=desertrat/&gt; Walker was awarded the [[Military Medal]] for his work as a battlefield medic whilst under fire. On each occasion where he was in danger, Tich remained by his side. 1KRRC's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.A.W. Williams recommended Tich for the [[Dickin Medal]] stating, "Her courage and devotion to duty were of very real and considerable value and her courageous example materially helped many men to keep their heads and sense of proportion in times of extreme danger. The sight of her put heart in the men as she habitually rode on the bonnet of her master’s jeep and refused to leave her post even when bringing in wounded under heavy fire."&lt;ref name=rgjm/&gt; The Dickin Medal is considered to be the animal's [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref name=pdsadickin&gt;{{cite web|title=PDSA Dickin medal|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal|publisher=PDSA|accessdate=10 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924092934/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal|archivedate=24 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her Dickin Medal was dated 1 July 1949, with it being awarded to her by Major Peter Earle, MC, on 3 September 1949 at Wembley in front of eight thousand people during the Animals' Rally.&lt;ref name=desertrat/&gt; Her citation reads, "For loyalty, courage and devotion to duty under hazardous conditions of war 1941 to 1945, while serving with the 1st King's Rifle Corps in North Africa and Italy."&lt;ref name=pdsadog&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs#awards-made-between-2000-ndash-to-date | title = Dickin Medal dogs | publisher = [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] | accessdate = 14 September 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100212182318/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs#awards-made-between-2000-ndash-to-date | archivedate = 12 February 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal - inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=9781848093768|ref=long2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Tich gave birth to fifteen puppies during her life, and lived after the war with Walker at his home in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], England. Together they took part in fundraising activities for the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]], the issuing body for the Dickin Medal.&lt;ref name=rgjm/&gt; She died in 1959, and was buried at the PDSA's [[Ilford Animal Cemetery]] where several other Dickin Medal holders are interred. Her Dickin Medal was passed into the hands of the [[Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum]] in Winchester.&lt;ref name=rgjm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">In animal and plant breeding, '''truncation selection''' is a standard method in [[selective breeding]] in selecting animals to be bred for the next generation. Animals are ranked by their phenotypic value on some trait such as milk production, and the top percentage is reproduced. The effects of truncation selection for a continuous trait can be modeled by the standard [[breeder's equation]]  by using [[heritability]] and [[truncated normal distribution]]s; on a binary trait, it can be modeled easily using the [[liability threshold model]]. It is considered an easy and efficient method of breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Crow &amp; Kimura 1979, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC382946/ "Efficiency of truncation selection"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer science ==
In computer science, truncation selection is a [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection method]] used in [[genetic algorithm]]s to select potential candidate solutions for recombination modeled after the breeding method.

In truncation selection the candidate solutions are ordered by fitness, and some proportion, ''p'', (e.g. ''p'' = 1/2, 1/3, etc.), of the fittest individuals are selected and reproduced 1/p times.  Truncation selection is less sophisticated than many other selection methods, and is not often used in practice.  It is used in Muhlenbein's [[Breeder Genetic Algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">[[File:Fußballschiedsrichter_und_Polizeischutz.jpg|thumb|[[Association football]] referees in Brazil with police protection.]]
'''Umpire abuse''' refers to the act of [[abuse]] towards an [[umpire]], referee, or other [[official]] in [[sport]]. The abuse can be [[verbal abuse]] (such as [[namecalling]]), or [[physical abuse]] (such as [[punch (combat)|punching]]). For example, [[Australian Football League]] spectators use the term "white maggot" (derived from their formerly white uniforms) towards umpires at games,&lt;ref name="whitemaggotdicdef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-white+maggot.html|title=Definition of white maggot|publisher=AllWords.com|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they do not agree with an umpire's decision.

Umpire abuse has become quite common in sport, practiced by players, coaches and spectators, with one [[Australian Rules Football|Australian Football]] league having half the [[tribunal]] cases heard about umpire abuse.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230154422/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-30|title=New umpire abuse rule for amateur footballers|last=Toy|first=Mitchell|date=2009-07-19|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=2009-07-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some high-profile cases of abuse towards the umpires in sport, with one Australian football player suspended for life after [[punching|striking]] an umpire.&lt;ref name="AFLlifeban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/03/2587921.htm|title=Footballer punches 16yo umpire, banned for life|last=MacBean|first=Nic|date=2009-06-03|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
In 1996, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player [[Roberto Alomar]] spat in umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during a dispute. Alomar received a five-game suspension for the incident, but the punishment was served during the following season, and not the 1996 playoffs. MLB umpires, upset over the lack of an immediate suspension, threatened to go on [[Strike action|strike]] before a federal judge prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Claire|title=An Error the Official Scorer Cannot Take Away|work=The New York Times|date=1996-10-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/sports/an-error-the-official-scorer-cannot-take-away.html|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], [[Angel Valodia Matos]] from [[Cuba]] pushed and then kicked a referee in the face during a [[Taekwondo]] match. He was disqualified for taking too much [[injury time]] in the [[playoff|bronze medal match]] by referee [[Chakir Chelbat]], before kicking Chelbat in the face. The referee required stitches in his lip after the attack. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] has banned Matos and his coach from taekwondo competitions for life.&lt;ref name="espn.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matos faces lifetime ban after kicking referee following match|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer08/judo/news/story?id=3549903|website=ESPN|accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Mark Jamar]], an Essendon [[Australian Football League|AFL]] player has been fined $1500 for umpire abuse. The umpire, [[Mathew Nicholls]], reported Jamar after he expressed his annoyance that he wasn't awarded a free kick in a marking contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Jamar fined $1500 for umpire abuse, Jack Ziebell cleared for bump on Sam Mitchell|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/essendon/mark-jamar-reported-for-umpire-abuse-in-essendons-clash-against-gws-giants/news-story/d4ac56f235688effe7890ddca9d2ef7c|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==
[[Sports league|League]]s and the like are trying to stop abuse towards umpires.

In [[Australian Rules Football]], attempting to strike or striking an umpire, abusing or threatening an umpire, or disputing an umpires decision is a reportable offense, per the [[Laws of Australian Football]]. It is also possible to send a player off for up to the remainder of the game for abusing an umpire, however this is only usually practiced at amateur and junior level. There have also been other programs trailed, such as making players suspended for umpire abuse attend umpire training sessions.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse" /&gt;

In [[cricket]], the preamble to the [[Laws of Cricket]] state that it is not within the spirit of cricket to abuse an umpire, and to dispute their decisions.

In [[ice hockey]], it is against the rules to dispute a [[referee]]'s decision, although the team captains can skate out and discuss the calls with the [[referee]]s and [[linesmen]]. After a warning (and a [[minor penalty]]), arguing with a [[referee]], or starting a fight with a referee is grounds for a [[game misconduct]], which results in ejection for the offending player or coach.

In [[baseball]], it is against the rules for any coach, manager, or player to question the [[umpire]]'s judgement on a call on the field, or on balls and strikes. If a [[coach (sport)|coach]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or player begins to walk toward the [[umpire]] with the intent to argue a call or balls and strikes, he will be warned to return to his bench or position. If he continues to advance, he will be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]].

=== Legal Implications ===

In the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]], some jurisdictions mandate more severe penalties when a person commits a crime against a sports official immediately prior to, during, or immediately following any athletic contest in which the umpire, referee, or judge is participating in an official capacity. For instance, in the State of [[California]], Section 243.8 of the Penal Code specifies that [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official shall result in a fine that does not exceed more than $2000, or imprisonment with the sentence not exceeding one year. [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official has more severe penalties than simple battery against a civilian, as in Section 243. California's maximum [[incarceration]] penalty for Battery on a Sports Official is twice as lengthy as the maximum sentence for Simple Battery.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 243.8|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/243.8.html|website=onecle|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10851">'''Unsportsmanlike conduct''' (also called '''unsporting behaviour''' or '''ungentlemanly conduct''' or '''bad sportsmanship''' or '''poor sportsmanship''') is a [[Foul (sports)|foul]] or offense in many [[sport]]s that violates the sport's generally accepted rules of [[sportsmanship]] and participant conduct. Examples include [[verbal abuse]] or taunting of an opponent, an excessive celebration following a scoring play, or feigning injury. The official rules of many sports include a catch-all provision whereby participants or an entire team may be penalized or otherwise sanctioned for unsportsmanlike conduct.

==Examples in different sports==
In [[American football]], unsportsmanlike conduct results in a 15-yard [[Penalty (American football)|penalty]], assessed after the completion of a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/penaltysummaries |title=NFL Rules Digest: Summary of Penalties |work=[[National Football League]] |accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it occurs after a scoring play, the 10 or 15 yards are assessed on the kickoff. Situations that can incur such a penalty include [[excessive celebration]]s after plays, often involving props or multiple players or engaging in taunting against an opponent; a player's purposeful removal of his helmet anywhere in the field of play during or in between plays; or if a [[Bench-clearing brawl|substitute leaves the team bench during a fight]]. Unsportsmanlike conduct can also lead to players or officials being ejected from the game if the conduct is found to be flagrant. In the NCAA, NFL, two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls lead to the offender's ejection. The referee signals unsportsmanlike conduct by holding his arms outstretched with palms facing downward. Coaches can also receive an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for taunting, arguing with, or abusing officials, one of the few times a coach's actions can be penalized outside of the rare [[palpably unfair act]] penalty; but can't be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/signals/26 |title=NFL Official Signals |work= National Football League |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canadian football]], the equivalent penalty is '''objectionable conduct''' and only carries a 10-yard penalty. [[Indoor American football]] leagues, because of the shorter field, also assign a 10-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.

In [[association football]], the term "unsporting behaviour" is more commonly used, being one of the listed reasons under law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|laws of the game]] for which a [[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]] may be given. It is interpreted broadly, most commonly to sanction [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|fouls]] which are more serious than most, though below a level which would merit a [[red card (sport)|red card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg_en.pdf |title=Laws of the Game 2008/2009 |page=35 |work=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include extravagant goal celebrations (e.g. removing one's jersey) and simulating actions intended to deceive the referee ([[diving (association football)|diving]]). 

In [[basketball]], such misconduct is penalized by a ''technical'' foul as opposed to a ''personal'' foul. The technical foul is akin to a caution in that two such fouls warrant an expulsion, although egregious conduct will be immediately assessed two consecutive technical fouls, or in at least one case, one.

In [[tennis]], such conduct is categorized as a "code violation". Examples include racket abuse (intentionally throwing a racket or using it to strike an object other than the ball), ball abuse (intentionally hitting or throwing the ball into the stands outside of normal play), or intentionally shouting during a point in order to distract an opponent. Penalties vary based on the organizers of the match or tournament and usually start with a verbal warning for a first violation, and forfeiture of a point, game, or a match for additional violations.

In [[cricket]], such behavior is considered to be violating the "spirit of the game". The preamble to the "[[Laws of cricket|Laws of Cricket]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106065059/http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; state certain actions which may violate the spirit of cricket. A more detailed list (along with appropriate sanctions) is given in the [[ICC Cricket Code of Conduct]].  Since good behaviour in cricket is traditionally deemed the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of a gentleman to the game's historical status as a "gentleman's game", it has led to the saying, "It's not cricket", an English language phrase meaning unsportsmanlike conduct in sports, in business, or in life in general. There is considerable debate over whether [[Sledging (cricket)|sledging]] should be deemed as "unsportsmanlike behavior" and banned due to several high profile punishable instances of racial and verbal abuse during international matches; proponents have argued that sledging was meant to be witty and humorous and not a personal attack on the opposition player.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=There's something disturbing about Abbott's acceptance of sledging in cricket|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/theres-something-disturbing-about-abbotts-acceptance-of-sledging-in-cricket|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Sledging shows Australian cricket culture has lost its moral compass|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/sledging-shows-australian-cricket-culture-has-lost-its-moral-compass-20150119-12trzc.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wit of Cricket|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygNa9iKqu2oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wit+in+cricket&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PP1|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|first=Barry|last=Johnston|author-link=Barry Johnston (writer)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ice hockey]], unsportsmanlike conduct is defined in Rule 75 of the [[National Hockey League]] Rule Book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26486 |title=Official Rules. Rule 75 - Unsportsmanlike Conduct|website=Nhl.com|accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
"Players, goalkeepers and non-playing Club personnel are responsible for their conduct at all times and must endeavor to prevent disorderly conduct before, during or after the game, on or off the ice and any place in the rink. The Referees may assess penalties to any of the above team personnel for failure to do so." A player can receive a two-minute penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Unusually for a team sport, [[fighting in ice hockey|fighting]], in most circumstances, does not constitute unsportsmanlike conduct.

===Field lacrosse===

[[Field lacrosse]]'s definition of unsportsmanlike conduct generally includes the same behavior as other sports, such as arguing with the official over a call, using [[foul language]] and taunting or baiting other players. It is considered a [[personal foul (field lacrosse)|personal foul]] under the rules. Coaches and nonplaying personnel can incur the penalty if they enter the field without the official's permission (save situations where the rules allow it) or use abusive language toward officials. Additional infractions can be called if the behavior continues. Penalties can vary from one to three minutes, usually non-releasable; in some less severe instances that do not involve abusive conduct, such as deliberately handling the ball during play, repeatedly committing the same [[technical foul (field lacrosse)|technical foul]] or deliberately delaying return to the playing field in order to gain an advantage, those penalties are releasable.&lt;ref name="NCAA lacrosse rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA Men's Lacrosse 2015 and 2016 Rules and Interpretations|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC16.pdf|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=51|date=October 2014|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules for high school boys' lacrosse, a second unreleasable unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the same player is an automatic [[Ejection (sports)#Field lacrosse|ejection]] foul. The player must serve three unreleasable minutes in the penalty area; when that time expires, a substitute must re-enter the game in his place. He must leave the game area unless they are no school personnel around to supervise, in which case he is confined to the bench area for the duration of the game. As a consequence of the ejection, he is [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] for at least the next game.&lt;ref name="NFHS ejection foul for second offense"&gt;{{cite book|title=2017 Boys' Lacrosse Rules Book|publisher=[[National Federation of State High School Associations]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorsports===

In [[Formula 1]], drivers are shown a black-and-white flag for unsportsmanlike driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Collantine |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/04/04/drivers-as-stewards-make-presence-felt-as-hamilton-gets-black-and-white-flag/ |title=Drivers as stewards make presence felt as Hamilton gets black-and-white flag · F1 Fanatic |website=F1fanatic.co.uk |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASCAR]] likewise has section 12-4, which prohibits actions that are 'detrimental to stock car racing'.  This was invoked against [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] as a result of apparently [[gaming the system]] in order to allow their driver [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] to make the 2013 [[Chase for the Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/09/09/nascar-sprint-cup-richmond-penalties-mwr-chase.html/ |title=NASCAR penalizes Michael Waltrip Racing |website=Nascar.com |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match fixing==
Unsportsmanlike conduct also includes attempts by players of [[Match fixing#Avoiding the best team before the finals|match fixing]], which has seen teams deliberately lose (a thrown game) or achieve draws or select scores, in order to receive a more favorable knockout bracket or a higher draft pick.

{{nihongo|'''Varan'''|バラン|Baran|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] film monster which first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1958 film ''[[Varan the Unbelievable]]''.

==Overview==
In its first appearance, Varan is a [[kaiju]] that lives in a saltwater lake within the Kunishiroshima valley, where it is known to the natives as ''Baradagi-Sanjin''. It kills an expedition duo and then completely destroys a nearby village. After its home is invaded again, the monster proceeds to attack Tokyo and is seemingly unstoppable until it is tricked by the military into eating bombs. After a few detonate in its stomach, Varan is mortally wounded and escapes back into the ocean, but one final bomb explodes, ultimately defeating the creature.

Years later, Varan reappears in ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' living in [[Monsterland and Monster Island|Monsterland]] with many other monsters including Godzilla, [[Mothra]], [[Kumonga]], [[Anguirus]], [[Baragon]], [[Minilla]], [[Rodan]], [[Gorosaurus]], and [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]]. Varan is seen, in the wide screen version of the film on DVD, gliding in to join the other Earth monsters to fight against [[King Ghidorah]], although it does not actually take part in the fight. Within the context of the film itself it is only seen gliding down to the ground prior to the climatic fight at the end of the movie and in the last scene gliding up into the air as a static model rather than as an actor in a suit. It is never mentioned by name in this film, and its roar is not heard.

Varan makes a semi-cameo in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' using stock footage from ''Varan the Unbelievable'' during the narrative at the beginning, claiming that Varan was one of many monsters that arose due to the devastation that the World Wars brought, along with [[Space Amoeba#Gezora|Gezora]], Baragon, [[The War of the Gargantuas|Gaira]], [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]], and [[Meganulon#Megaguirus|Megaguirus]].

Varan is 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighs 15,000 metric tons (16,534 short tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lees |first1=J.D. |title=The Official Godzilla Compendium |date=1998|publisher=Random House |isbn=0679888225|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance and abilities===
[[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and Akira Watanabe based Varan's design on that of a [[Draco (genus)|''Draco'' lizard]], [[Godzilla]], and a [[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]. The name ''Varan'' is derived from ''Varanus pater'', or "father of lizards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ragone |first=August |title=Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters |year=2007 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-8118-6078-9 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may also be named after the genus of [[monitor lizards]] ''Varanus''. In its film appearances, Varan does not have any special abilities such as fiery or radioactive breath. It can however glide at speeds of [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5, and has a row of spines along its body which may afford protection.

===Action figures===
Few figures of Varan have been issued compared to other kaiju film monsters. Bullmark released the first ever Varan vinyl toy in 1970. [[Bandai]] has only issued Varan in [[gashapon]] form as part of High Grade Series 6, in promotion for the film ''[[Godzilla 2000]]''. Y-MSF has also released a figure on the 6" scale in 2005. Other companies, such as CCP, Marmit, Trendmasters, and the modern version of [[Marusan]] have also released Varan figures.

==Appearances==
In one of the early drafts of what would become ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'', Varan was to have joined Godzilla and [[Rodan]] in defending the Earth against King Ghidorah, [[Gigan]], and a new monster that had never been seen before with the name Mogu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaijuphile.com/rodansroost/scrapyard/rogshowa.shtml Rodan's Roost: Kaiju Scrap-yard: Return of King Ghidorah&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Shusuke Kaneko, director of the popular [[Heisei era (daikaiju eiga)|Heisei]] [[Gamera]] trilogy had originally considered Varan, along with Anguirus, to star in ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' as antagonists to Godzilla. Varan and Anguirus were however replaced with the far more popular [[Mothra]] and [[King Ghidorah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaijuphile.com/rodansroost/scrapyard/vba.shtml Rodan's Roost: Kaiju Scrap-yard: Varan, Baragon, Anguirus: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack - Godzilla 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The suit designer is said to have compromised by giving some of Varan's facial features to King Ghidorah.
