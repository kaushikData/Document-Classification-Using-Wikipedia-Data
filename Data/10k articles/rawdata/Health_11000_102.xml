'''AIDS Information Centre-Uganda (AIC)''' is a Non-Governmental Organization in [[Uganda]] established in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://data.unaids.org/Publications/IRC-pub02/JC680-KnowledgePower_en.pdf Knowledge is Power: Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing in Uganda&lt;/ref&gt; to provide [[Voluntary Counseling and Testing]] (VCT) for Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV).  The Organization was founded as a result of growing demand from people who wanted to know their HIV status. At this time the [[HIV/AIDS in Uganda]] was high.

AIC currently offers HIV counselling and testing services&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicug.org AIDS Information Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; through 8 branches of Kampala, Jinja, Mbale, Mbarara, Arua, Lira, Soroti and Kabale, selected hospitals, health centres, and antenatal clinics. AIC also conducts HCT outreaches to communities and institutions targeting the Most-at risk populations. AIC supported the Uganda Ministry of Health to extend HCT services nearer to the communities by supporting HCT in 33 districts in Uganda with over 200 district health facilities benefiting.

By December 2010 AIC had served over 2,959,193 clients. The number keeps growing and for the last 3 years over 300,000 clients annually are being served using the different approaches for HCT.

To consolidate its HIV counselling and Testing services in the country, AIC has adopted a new vision as ‘Universal knowledge of HIV status in Uganda’ and its mission as ‘to provide HIV and AIDS information and quality HCT services’ and this will be through to 2015.

==How AIC works==
AIC is now a membership organisation, with a functional Board of Trustees (BOT), 8 Branch Advisory Committees (BACs) and just over 3000 members all over Uganda. Headed by the Executive Director, AIC now employs 140 full-time staff that include Managers, coordinators, supervisors, medical and no medical counselors and medical officers and support staff.

AIC has a wide range of stakeholders with whom it works including government ministries, development partners and other agencies involved in HIV and AIDS work. Major stakeholders include [[Centre for Disease Control]] and Prevention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), Department for International Development ([[DFID]]), European Union ([[European Union|EU]]), Ministry of Health (MoH), Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC), the AIDS Support Organization (TASO), District Local Governments among others.

==Services offered by AIC==

===HIV counselling and Testing Services ===
AIC uses a multi-faceted approach in order to increase accessibility and HCT utilisation &lt;ref name = "Menzies"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menzies N, Abang B, Wanyenze R, Nuwaha F, Mugisha B, Coutinho A, Bunnell R, Mermin J, Blandford JM | title=The costs and effectiveness of four HIV counseling and testing strategies in Uganda | journal= AIDS |volume=23| issue=3 | pages=395–401|year=2009|pmid=19114865|doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e328321e40b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Client initiated HCT is provided at the 8 AIC stand alone branches and outreaches. Targeted outreaches for the Most At Risk Populations (MARPs) are also conducted for these hard to reach populations that included commercial sex workers, Long Distance Truck Drivers and their clients, Fishing communities and Institutions of Higher learning. Commercial sex workers access HCT services during the peak hours of service delivery in order to benefit their clients. The truck drivers with their "service providers" are also another target group that AIC serves during evenings and nights at their transit stations. This HCT service delivery strategy is now referred to as the "Moonlight HCT services". 
For distant areas with difficult terrain, the community camping strategy is used. This is where HCT service providers camp in a community and provide services from the community for several days.  This strategy is cost effective in terms of fuel, wear and tear and ensured service delivery to all potential clients. This strategy also promotes community involvement as mobilisation is done through the existing community structures.  
HCT is also offered to pregnant women both at the branches and at the supported health units where HCT is offered to all pregnant women as part of their routine ante-natal medical check up.

HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) service are offered daily (even on Sundays and public holidays on appointments) at an affordable user fee in AIC main branches. Free HCT is also provided to children and youth below 24 years of age and Most At Risk Population.
AIC is currently the largest single Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) HCT service provider in the country contributing at least 26 -30% of the total number of individuals tested for HIV in the country in any a given year.

==Palliative care==
AIC contributes to the goal of the National Strategic Plan in care and treatment by offering Palliative Care Basic –Health Care (PCBHC). PCBHC includes psychosocial support, screening for and treatment of opportunistic infections (including Tuberculosis), as well as the provision of the basic health care package. The basic health care package includes prevention of malaria, respiratory and central nervous system diseases among PLHAs.

===Psychosocial Support===
Clients that are HIV positive are encouraged to live positively. This is provided by counselors to clients during one on one session or in Post Test clubs.

===TB/HIV Integration===
AIC is guided by the National Policy guidelines for TB/HIV collaborative activities in Uganda. The overall goal of the policy is to decrease the burden of tuberculosis and HIV in Uganda through improved TB and HIV collaborative interventions. AIC employs a screening tool developed in collaboration with Centres for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) to screen HIV positive clients for TB &lt;ref name="Mugisha B"&gt;{{ cite journal | vauthors=Mugisha B, Bock N, Mermin J | title= Tuberculosis case finding and preventive therapy in an HIV voluntary counseling and testing center in Uganda | journal= The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease| year=2006| pages=761–767| volume=10 | issue=7  | pmid= 16848338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in the 8 branches of AIC and the supported sites

===Screening and treatment of other opportunistic Infections===
AIC screens and treats sexually transmitted infections like syphilis and Herpes simplex type II and other opportunistic infections like skin infections, pneumonias and others   in all its eight branches. Among the integrated services offered are education and counseling on Reproductive health issues for the HIV positive and offering of Family Planning (FP) suitable to individual circumstances and choice.

===Basic Care Packages (BCP)===
HIV positive clients receives basic care packages consisting of mosquito nets, water guard chemical and a safe water vessel, condoms, Septrin for prophylaxis and reading material on psychosocial counseling to all HIV positive clients. This Package helps in prevention of malaria, respiratory, central nervous system diseases among PLHAs. This was achieved through partnership with PSI.

===Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis===
A daily dose of Cotrimoxazole has been proven to prolong life (25-50% decrease in mortality) and reduce the incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, toxoplasmosis, certain respiratory infections, blood infections (Septicaemia) and other illnesses affecting PLHA.

==CD4   Monitoring==
AIC started offering this service in 2004 at AIC Kampala but has now expanded to cover all the 8 branches.The service is offered to the all HIV positive clients after VCT and are able to pay the user fee for the CD4/CD8+ count, any client with evidence of a positive HIV test and referral document from a recognized centre and  clients already on ARVS with referral for monitoring.

==Research and Documentation==
AIC being the pioneer HCT organization in Uganda, and with over 20 years of work, AIC is well placed to play a leading role in driving or influencing policy and practice in the area of HCT. AIC has made deliberate efforts to promote its corporate image among its clients, development partners  and central government agencies.

AIC conducts operational research to generate answers to emerging questions and provide evidence-based data on HCT. Through its research and documentation activities with its partners, AIC has supported to the public to access evidence-based information on HCT and its related services through various channels, including the print materials, radio, video, the resource centre and website.

==Capacity Building for HIV Counselling and Testing==
AIC trains HIV/AIDS Counselors, Trainer of Trainers, Counselor supervisors, Laboratory technicians, Data entrants, Voluntary counseling and testing promoters, and People living with HIV/AIDS who have accepted to go public. AIC provides training within and outside Uganda in HCT; HIV prevention, care, adherence, and support.

==Youth Friendly Services==
AIC provides specially designed HCT to meet the special needs of young people, aged 12 to 24 free of charge with same day results. This followed a study conducted to identify opportunities and barriers for providing VCT to youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/horizons/vctyouthbaseline.pdf HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing Among Youth Ages 14 to 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;  With trained peer counselors, a private waiting room and lab, the environment is youth friendly, satisfying the need for privacy. Youth can also access all other AIC services including referral to youth friendly service organizations. AIC also provides HCT for children below age 12. To date AIC has established seven youth corners at seven AIC branches.

==HIV Prevention Programme==
AIC has continued to contribute towards the national efforts to fight the drivers of the epidemic.  Appropriate messages are delivered depending on the nature of the client and community.

===Abstinence, Be faithful and condom use===
Abstinence messages encourage young clients to abstain or delay their sex debut.  The messages delivered give the client the advantages of abstaining, and give role models in society who abstained and have been successful in their lives. AIC delivers abstinence messages to young people in and out of school through educational talks, music and drama outreaches and HIV counseling sessions at HCT service delivery sites.

Recent studies indicate an escalating HIV prevalence among people who are currently married or cohabiting and those that have ever been married.  Statistics from the AIC database corroborate these findings.  AIC uses community dialogues, music and drama and HIV counseling in the provision of "Be faithful" messages to the target audience who are sexually active clients.

The need for promotion of correct and consistent use of condoms remains vital because majority of high risk populations (MARPS) do not know the correct use of the condoms while those that know, do not use them consistently.  Condoms are distributed through PTC condom distribution outlets, AIC branch offices and other targeted points such as bars and lodges.

===Know Your HIV Status Clubs===
The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS), 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR194/FR194.pdf
|title=Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2006
|publisher=Uganda Bureau of Statistics Kampala, Uganda and Macro International Inc. Calverton, Maryland, USA
|accessdate=2011-03-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that although most people had some knowledge about HIV only about 30 percent of women and 40 percent of men had comprehensive knowledge. In order to bridge this gap and increase comprehensive knowledge about HIV and to increase access to care and support for clients who have tested HIV positive, AIC established the Know Your HIV Status Clubs at parish level in 9 districts of Uganda in 2010.

A Know Your HIV Status Club (KYHSC) is an association of 20 members at parish level who have been selected by the community to pass on messages to households on HIV and AIDS prevention and care. These members are drawn  from the existing district structures such as Village Health Teams, Community Resource Persons, PHA Network Support Agents, Post Test Club members and other structures. The major role of the twenty members is to disseminate information on comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention package at household level.

==Post Test Services==
The AIC Post Test Club (PTC) was established on August 4, 1990, in support of the national effort to prevent further spread of HIV and AIDS and to provide psychosocial support to those infected and affected by HIV. The purpose of the club is to respond to the expressed needs of the clients for ongoing support services. The major objective is to offer on-going psychosocial support to the members irrespective of their HIV status. All the eight AIC regional centres have PTC’s and over 20 district based PTCs in Uganda are supported .

The services range from on-going support counseling, educational talks, condom promotion, community mobilization to distribution of Information Education Communication (IEC) materials among others.

===AIC Couple Club===
In the recent past, AIC realized that the cases of HIV discordance among couples were on the rise.&lt;ref name="Bunnell RE"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors= Bunnell RE, Nassozi J, Marum E, Mubangizi J, Malamba S, Dillon B, Kalule J, Bahizi J, Musoke N, Mermin JH |title= Living with discordance: knowledge, challenges, and prevention strategies of HIV-discordant couples in Uganda.|journal=AIDS Care |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages= 999–1012| year= 2005 |pmid= 16176896 |doi=10.1080/09540120500100718}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV test results showed that at least 8% of all couples tested have one HIV positive while the other is negative. The Couple Club support couples socially and psychologically, enabling them cope with denial, avoid blame, or violence. At the Discordant Couple Club, AIC provide: Ongoing psychosocial support; continuous education to prevent the infection of the HIV negative partner; peer psychosocial support groups through sharing experiences; promote positive living and provide education on treatment options. We also impart income generation skills for many of the clients.

===Philly Lutaaya Initiative (PLI)===
The PLI was established in September 1991 through the collaborative efforts of TASO, World Learning Inc., AIC and UNICEF. PLI was formed after the death of the renowned Ugandan musician [[Philly Lutaaya]] Bongole the first Ugandan to publicly declare that he was infected with HIV. The objective of the PLI was to bring the reality of HIV and AIDS to the general affected communities and to demonstrate that people living with HIV and AIDS (PHAs) can lead a healthy and productive life.

In 1983, the Barbados parliament passed the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, decriminalizing abortion and giving women access to legal and safe abortion care.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/28/why-do-politicians-still-force-women-through-unwanted-pregnancies-dame-billie-miller-barbados|title=Why do politicians still force women through unwanted pregnancies? {{!}} Billie Miller|last=Miller|first=Billie| date=2017-09-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billie Miller]], the first woman to serve as minister of health in Barbados, campaigned for seven years to encourage her colleagues to decriminalize medical care for women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Passage of this new law made Barbados the first English-speaking country in the Caribbean to decriminalize abortion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9057">The relationship between '''alcohol and breast cancer''' is clear:  drinking [[alcoholic beverages]], including wine, beer, or liquor, is a [[risk factor for breast cancer]], as well as some other forms of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|last2=Richardson|first2=A.|last3=Frampton|first3=C.|date=November 2013|title=Population attributable risks for modifiable lifestyle factors and breast cancer in New Zealand women|journal=Internal Medicine Journal|volume=43|issue=11|pages=1198–1204|doi=10.1111/imj.12256|issn=1445-5994|pmid=23910051|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IARC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Drinking alcohol causes more than 100,000 cases of breast cancer worldwide every year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] has declared that there is sufficient scientific evidence to classify alcoholic beverages a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] that causes breast cancer in women.&lt;ref name="IARC"&gt;''Alcohol consumption and ethyl carbamate'' [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (2007: Lyon, France) {{ISBN|9789283212966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Group 1 carcinogens are the substances with the clearest scientific evidence that they cause cancer, such as smoking [[tobacco]].

A woman drinking an average of two units of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] per day has 8% higher risk of developing [[breast cancer]] than a woman who drinks an average of one unit of alcohol per day.&lt;ref name=COC&gt;''[http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/alco04nontech.pdf Non-Technical Summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724211538/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/alco04nontech.pdf |date=24 July 2006 }}'' Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food Consumer Products and the Environment (COC)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even light consumption of alcohol – one to three drinks per week – increases the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shield|first=Kevin D.|last2=Soerjomataram|first2=Isabelle|last3=Rehm|first3=Jürgen|date=June 2016|title=Alcohol Use and Breast Cancer: A Critical Review|journal=Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1166–1181|doi=10.1111/acer.13071|issn=1530-0277|pmid=27130687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy drinkers are also more likely to die from breast cancer than non-drinkers and light drinkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Also, the more alcohol a woman consumes, the more likely she is to be diagnosed with a recurrence after initial treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[Image:BreastCancer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Mastectomy]] specimen containing a very large cancer of the breast (in this case, an invasive [[Mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinoma]]).]]
The mechanisms of increased breast cancer risk by alcohol are not clear, and may be:
*Increased estrogen and androgen levels&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singletary KW, Gapstur SM |title=Alcohol and breast cancer: review of epidemiologic and experimental evidence and potential mechanisms |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=17 |pages=2143–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11694156 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.17.2143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enhanced mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenics&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"/&gt;
*Increased mammary DNA damage&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"/&gt;
*Greater metastatic potential of breast cancer cells&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"/&gt;

Their magnitude likely depends on the amount of alcohol consumed.&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"/&gt;

Susceptibility to the breast cancer risk of alcohol may also be increased by other dietary factors, (e.g. [[folate deficiency]]), lifestyle habits (including use of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]]), or biological characteristics (e.g. as hormone receptor expression in tumor cells).&lt;ref name="pmid11694156"/&gt;

==In daughters of drinking mothers==
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol during pregnancy may affect the likelihood of breast cancer in daughters. "For women who are pregnant, ingestion of alcohol, even in moderation, may lead to elevated circulating oestradiol levels, either through a reduction of melatonin or some other mechanism. This may then affect the developing mammary tissue such that the lifetime risk of breast cancer is raised in their daughters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stevens RG, Hilakivi-Clarke L |title=Alcohol exposure in utero and breast cancer risk later in life |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=276–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11373268 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/36.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light and moderate drinking==
Light drinking is one to three alcoholic drinks per week, and moderate drinking is about one drink per day.  Both light and moderate drinking is associated with a higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang SM, Lee IM, Manson JE, Cook NR, Willett WC, Buring JE |author3-link=JoAnn E. Manson |title=Alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk in the Women's Health Study |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=165 |issue=6 |pages=667–76 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17204515 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwk054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the increased risk caused by light drinking is small compared to heavy drinking.

== Recurrence ==
Drinking or not drinking alcohol does not solely determine whether breast cancer will recur after treatment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gou|first1=YJ|last2=Xie|first2=DX|last3=Yang|first3=KH|last4=Liu|first4=YL|last5=Zhang|first5=JH|last6=Li|first6=B|last7=He|first7=XD|date=2013|title=Alcohol Consumption and Breast Cancer Survival: A Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies.|url=|journal=Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP|volume=14|issue=8|pages=4785–90|pmid=24083744|quote=Although our meta-analysis showed alcohol drinking was not associated with increased breast cancer mortality and recurrence, there seemed to be a dose-response relationship of alcohol consumption with breast cancer mortality and recurrence and alcohol consumption of &gt;20 g/d was associated with increased breast cancer mortality.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the more a woman drinks, the more likely the cancer is to recur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In men==
In men, breast cancer is rare, with an incidence of fewer than one case per 100,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerindex.org/clinks3m.htm Male Breast Cancer]&lt;/ref&gt; Population studies have returned mixed results about excessive consumption of alcohol as a risk factor. One study suggests that alcohol consumption may increase risk at a rate of 16% per 10g daily alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P.| last2 = Cyr| first2 = D.| last4 = Lynge| last3 = Sabroe| last5 = Merletti | first3 = S. | first4 = E.| last7 = Baumgardt-Elms| last8 = Ménégoz | first5 = F.| last1 = Guénel| last9 = Olsson | first6 = W.| last6 = Ahrens| first7 = C. | first8 = F. | first9 = H.| title = Alcohol drinking may increase risk of breast cancer in men: a European population-based case-control study | first12 = G.| journal = Cancer causes &amp; control : CCC| last12 = Wingren| volume = 15 | first11 = L.| issue = 6| pages = 571–580| last10 = Paulsen| last11 = Simonato| date=Aug 2004 | issn = 0957-5243| doi = 10.1023/B:CACO.0000036154.18162.43 | first10 = S.| pmid = 15280636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have shown no effect at all, though these studies had small populations of alcoholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last3 = Gierach | first1 = A. | first2 = A.| last2 = Richesson| first3 = L. | first4 = R.| last5 = Park| last4 = Lacey Jr| last7 = Schatzkin | first5 = Y. | first6 = R.| last1 = Brinton| first7 = A.| title = Prospective evaluation of risk factors for male breast cancer| last6 = Hollenbeck| journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| volume = 100| issue = 20| pages = 1477–1481| date=Oct 2008 | issn = 0027-8874| pmid = 18840816| pmc = 2720728| doi = 10.1093/jnci/djn329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Worldwide, alcohol consumption causes approximately 144,000 women to be diagnosed with breast cancer each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately 38,000 women die from alcohol-induced breast cancer each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About 80% of these women were heavy or moderate drinkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Byways and Bridleways Trust''' (BBT) is a charity&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=280214&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0&lt;/ref&gt; (registered number 280214 in 1980) which exists to protect [[bridleway|bridleways]] and [[byway (road)|byway]]s in England and Wales.
It is a prescribed consultee&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife and Countryside Regulations 1993 Schedule 6, Public Path Orders Regulations 1993 Schedule 3&lt;/ref&gt; for proposed changes or effects on public rights of way (minor highways) made under the Highways Act 1980, Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  As such, the Trust responds to consultations from government, government agencies, local authorities and potential applicants for planning permission and changes to public rights of way.  The Trust takes the opportunity where presented to respond to Parliamentary calls for evidence such as on the Marine Bill&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200708/jtselect/jtmarine/159/159we53.htm Memorandum to Marine Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Trust's aim is:

''To protect, preserve, maintain, secure, improve and develop public rights of way for the benefit of the public at large, so that the conditions of life may be improved, in particular by taking steps to ensure high standards of surveying and recording on definitive maps and any other public records of public rights of way over byways open to all traffic, roads used as public paths, unmetalled carriageways, green lanes, drove roads, driftways and bridleways in England and Wales.''

The Definitive Map and Statement is the legally conclusive record of public rights of way maintained by highway authorities as required by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/97/part/IV/crossheading/ascertainment-of-footpaths-bridleways-and-certain-other-highways/enacted Section 27 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949].

==History==
There are two main theories as to how cannabis came to Ghana:

The first report of illegal cannabis cultivation in Ghana occurred in 1960.&lt;ref name="Rubin1975"/&gt;

In the 1990s, cannabis which had previously been an urban phenomenon in bars and nightclubs, had spread to rural areas as well.&lt;ref name="Daly1996"/&gt; Cannabis was associated with youth involved in [[Rastafari]] culture, and with students who believed cannabis use would improve their ability to study.&lt;ref name="AKYEAMPONGHILL2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=EMMANUEL AKYEAMPONG|author2=ALLAN G HILL|author3=ARTHUR M KLEINMAN|title=The Culture of Mental Illness and Psychiatric Practice in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUd9CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 May 2015|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-01304-0|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' in '''[[Peru]]''' was last used in 1979. In the same year, the death penalty was abolished for ordinary crimes.

==Usage==
Capital punishment is currently legal only during times of international or [[civil war]], with several restrictions.  Death sentences during this time are allowed for specific crimes, and may only be imposed by [[military Court|military courts]] during states of war.  Execution is carried out by a [[firing squad]] and is permitted for six specific crimes (if committed during wartime): 

*[[Treason]]
*[[Genocide]]
*[[Crimes Against Humanity]]
*[[Terrorism]]
*[[War Crimes]]
*[[Murder]]

The national Constitution allows reinstating the death penalty for peacetime terrorism. In early 2007, President [[Alan García]] proposed that the death penalty be restored for this crime, but the bill was rejected.

'''Cellucor''' is a [[sports nutrition]] brand from the nutritional life sciences company Nutrabolt, which is headquartered in [[Bryan, Texas]] in the [[United States]]. Cellucor was brought to market in 2002.

It uses readily available consumer technologies to deliver patient care outside of the hospital or doctor's office. Connected health encompasses programs in telehealth, remote care (such as home care) and disease and lifestyle management, often leverages existing technologies such as connected devices using cellular networks and is associated with efforts to improve chronic care.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The United States and European Union are two dominant markets for the use of connected health in home care service, in part due to the high availability of telephone and Internet service as compared to other parts of the world.{{cn|date=December 2017}}
Proponents of connected health believe that technology can transform healthcare delivery and address inefficiencies especially in the area of work flow management, chronic disease management and [[patient compliance]] of the US and global healthcare systems.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Connected health has its roots in [[telemedicine]], and its more recent relative, [[telehealth]]. The first telemedicine programs were primarily undertaken to address healthcare access and/or provider shortages. Connected health is distinguished from telemedicine by:{{cn|date=December 2017}}

* A broader concern for healthcare cost, quality and efficiency, particularly as related to the chronically ill
* Concomitant interests in making healthcare more patient centric by promoting healthcare consumerism through education, and patient feedback
* Efforts in the direction of integrating data generated outside of traditional healthcare settings such as the home with centralised, often [[electronic patient record]]

== Definition ==
There is no standard, accepted definition of connected health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.connectedhealthireland.com/what-is-connected-health/|title=Definition of Connected Health, e-health, m-health, tele-|website=Connected Health Ireland|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a broader note, connected health is the "umbrella term arrived to lessen the confusion over the definitions of telemedicine, telehealth and mhealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iglehart|first=John K.|date=2014-02-01|title=Connected health: emerging disruptive technologies|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=33|issue=2|pages=190|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0042|issn=1544-5208|pmid=24493758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered as the new lexicon for the term telemedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Paul J.|last2=McElnay|first2=James C.|last3=Hughes|first3=Carmel M.|date=2012-02-01|title=Connected health care: the future of health care and the role of the pharmacist|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01522.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=56–62|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01522.x|pmid=20698917|issn=1365-2753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology view of connected health focuses more on the connection methods between clients and the health care professional.

An alternative view is that of a socio-technical perspective in which connected health is considered as a combination of people, processes and technology. In 2015 Connected health was defined as patient-centred care resulting from process-driven health care delivery undertaken by health care professionals, patients and/or carer who are supported by the use of technology (software and/or hardware).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lero.ie/sites/default/files/Lero-TR-2015-03%20Connected%20Health.pdf|title=Connected Health: People, Technology and Processes| last=Richardson| first=Ita| date=2015| website=Lero – the Irish Software Research Centre|publisher=www.lero.ie|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In operation==
Two "core platforms" are emphasized in connected health, self-care and remote care, with programs primarily focused on monitoring and feedback for the chronically ill, elderly, and those patients located at an untenable distance from primary or specialty providers.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Programs designed to improve patient-provider communication within an individual medical practice for example, the use of email to communicate with patients between office visits also fall within the purview of connected health.{{cn|date=December 2017}} There are also [[lifestyle coaching]] programs, in which an individual receives healthcare information to facilitate behavior change to improve their fitness and/or general well being, (see [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]]) or to reduce or eliminate the impact of a particular behavior that presents a risk to their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6345919&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6345919|title=Radar walking speed measurements of seniors in their apartments: Technology for fall prevention|publisher=IEEE EMBC 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common types of connected health programs in operation today include:

* Home care via remote monitoring of chronically ill patients including surveillance connected devices or patient controlled monitoring of health parameters{{cn|date=December 2017}}
* Traditional [[telehealth]] programs, where care is provided in remote areas by teams of local clinicians or community healthcare workers teamed up with specialists in medical centers{{cn|date=December 2017}}
* Monitoring programs whose aim is to ensure the safety and quality of life of elderly parents living at a distance from their relatives{{cn|date=December 2017}}
* Web-based second opinion services for patients in need of medical care{{cn|date=December 2017}}
* Lifestyle and fitness coaching for wellness or health risk reduction{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The Center for Connected Health is implementing a range of programs in high-risk, chronic and remotely located populations.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Inherent in the concept of connected health is flexibility in terms of technological approaches to care delivery and specific program objectives. For instance, remote monitoring programs might use a combination of cell phone and smart phone technology, online communications or biosensors and may aim to increase patient-provider communication, involve patients in their care through regular feedback, or improve upon a health outcome measure in a defined patient population or individual. Digital pen technology, global positioning, videoconferencing and environmental sensors are all playing a role in connected health.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Goals==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Proponents of Connected health view it as a critical component of change in human healthcare and envision:

* Reductions in the cost of providing quality care to the chronically ill, estimated by the Center for Health Care Economics at the  Milken Institute to be over $1 trillion per year
* Improved global and local [[public health surveillance]], with a resultant reduction in epidemics, increased control over infectious disease and improved drug safety
* Diminished rate of medical errors
* Better "customer service" in healthcare
* Ongoing preventive health, with attendant reductions in: morbidity, mortality and the cost of care
* Consumer engagement in health and self-management
* Safer and more effective clinical trials

==Evolution==
{{off-topic|date=December 2017}} 
Rising costs, increases in chronic diseases, geographic dispersion of families, growing provider shortages, ethnic disparities in care, better survival rates among patients fighting serious diseases, an aging U.S. population and longer lifespan are all factors pointing to a need for better ways of delivering healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"], The New York Review of Books website, (Accessed December 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansforhealthcare.org/facts/ Americans for Healthcare website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705134639/http://www.americansforhealthcare.org/facts/ |date=2008-07-05 }}(Accessed December 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/news/ulp/costs/ulpcosts1.htm "Health Care Costs: Why Do They Increase? What Can We Do?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100938/http://www.ahrq.gov/news/ulp/costs/ulpcosts1.htm |date=2008-12-05 }}, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality website, (Accessed December 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Direct-to-consumer advertising]] is a demonstrated contributor to the rise in consumer demand, as is the mass availability of inexpensive technology and ubiquity of the Internet, cell phones and PDAs.&lt;ref&gt;PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 2006. The Factors Fueling Rising Healthcare Costs 2006, Prepared for America's Health Insurance Plans, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/chcm030807oth.cfm "How Changes in Medical Technology Affect Health Care Costs"] Kaiser Family Foundation website, March 2007 (Accessed December 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Connected health experts such as Joseph C. Kvedar, believe that consumer engagement in healthcare is on its way to becoming a major force for change.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In summary, connected health has arisen from: 1) a desire on the part of individual physicians and healthcare organizations to provide better access, quality and efficiency of care 2) dynamics of the healthcare economy (such as rising costs and changing demographics) 3) consumerism in health care and a drive towards patient centric healthcare. Together, these factors are providing impetus for connected healthcare in the United States and many other industrialised nations and forcing innovation both from within and outside the system.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Evidence==
While connected health is yet emerging, there is evidence of its benefit. For example, in a program being implemented by the Center for Connected Health and  Partners Home Care, over 500 heart failure patients have now been monitored remotely through the collection of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure and weight, using simple devices in the patient's home. The information is sent daily to a home health nurse, who can identify early warning signs, notify the patient's [[primary care physician]], and intervene to avert potential health crises. A pilot of this program demonstrated reduced hospitalizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7600/942 bmj 2007]; 334: 942 (5 may)&lt;/ref&gt; Another initiative at the Center for Connected Health uses cellular telephone technology and a "smart" pill bottle to detect when a patient has not taken their scheduled medication. A signal is then sent that lights up an ambient orb device in the patient's home to remind them to take their medication.

==Funding and implementation==
It appears that connected health programs are operated and funded primarily by home care agencies and large healthcare systems.{{cn|date=December 2017}} However, insurers and employers are increasingly interested in connected health for its potential to reduce direct and indirect healthcare costs.In 2007, [[EMC Corporation]] launched the first employer-sponsored connected health program, in the beta phase of implementation, aimed at improving outcomes and cost of care for patients with high blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/diseases/articles/2007/03/03/employees_to_get_an_online_checkup/?page=1 Kowalczyk, L. Employees to get an online checkup: Care provider, EMC will test a program to cut health costs], The Boston Globe, March 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==US government agencies==
Government agencies involved in connected health include:

* The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth
* The [[National Center for Telehealth &amp; Technology]] (T2)
* The [[Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]] (CMS), to the extent that Medicaid reimburses for telemedicine programs, at the state's option. According to the CMS Web site, at least 18 states are allowing reimbursement for services provided via telemedicine for reasons that include improved access to specialists for rural communities and reduced transportation costs.
* The [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC) is charged with creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure for the nation, primarily defined as an electronic health records system. Former National Coordinator [[David Brailer]] indicated his support for portable personal health records which are controlled by consumers. As of 2006 it remained to be seen how his successor, Robert Kolodner, will interpret this charge.&lt;ref&gt;Brailer, David J. Your Medical History, To Go. The New York Times. September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal health records==
Personal health records, or PHRS, (see [[personal health record]]) – are essentially medical records controlled and maintained by the healthcare consumer. PHRs intersect with connected health in that they attempt to increase the involvement of healthcare consumers in their care.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/05/11/microsofts-sean-nolan-on-electronic-medical-records-their-storage-and-the-future-of-healing/&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, electronic medical records (EMRs) (see [[electronic medical record]]) are digital medical records or medical records systems maintained by hospitals or medical practices and are not part of connected health delivery.

'''Copper toxicity''', also called '''copperiedus''', is a type of [[metal poisoning]] caused by an excess of [[copper]] in the body. Copperiedus can occur from eating acidic foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, or from exposure to excess copper in drinking water or other environmental sources.

==Types==

===ICD-9-CM 985.8 ''Toxic effect of other specified metals''===
ICD-9-CM code '''985.8''' ''Toxic effect of other specified metals'' includes acute &amp; chronic copper poisoning (or other toxic effect) whether intentional, accidental, industrial etc.
*In addition, it includes poisoning and toxic effects of other metals including tin, selenium nickel, iron, heavy metals, thallium, silver, lithium, cobalt, aluminum and bismuth. Some poisonings, e.g. zinc phosphide, would/could also be included as well as under 989.4 Poisoning due to other pesticides, etc.
*Excluded are toxic effects of mercury, arsenic, manganese, beryllium, antimony, cadmium, and chromium.

==Symptoms and presentation==
Acute symptoms of copper poisoning by ingestion include vomiting, hematemesis (vomiting of blood), hypotension (low blood pressure), melena (black "tarry" feces), coma, jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin), and gastrointestinal distress.&lt;ref name="Casarett"&gt;Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology, The Basic Science of Poisons, Fifth Edition, Edited by Curtis D. Klassen, Ph.D., McGraw-Hill, New York. pp 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency may be at increased risk of hematologic effects of copper.&lt;ref name="Casarett" /&gt; Hemolytic anemia resulting from the treatment of burns with copper compounds is infrequent.&lt;ref name="Casarett" /&gt;

Chronic (long-term) copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="CopperHealth"&gt;Copper: Health Information Summary, Environmental Fact Sheet. New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, ARD-EHP-9 2005, Available Online at: http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/ard/documents/ard-ehp-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals have efficient mechanisms to regulate copper stores such that they are generally protected from excess dietary copper levels.&lt;ref name="CopperHealth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Function and Regulation of Human Copper-Transporting ATPases|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/87/3/1011.short|publisher=Physiological Reviews|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those same protection mechanisms can cause milder symptoms, which are often misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. There is a lot of research on the function of the Cu/Zn ratio in neurological, endocrinological, and psychological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of copper in human neurological disorders|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/3/855S.short|publisher=American Society for Clinical Nutrition 2008|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treatment of Mood Lability and Explosive Rage with Minerals and Vitamins: Two Case Studies in Children |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/104454602760386897|publisher=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology 2002|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The plasma zinc/serum copper ratio as a biomarker in children with autism spectrum disorders|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13547500902783747|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis 2009|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the substances that protect us from excess copper perform important functions in our neurological and endocrine systems, leading to diagnostic difficulties. When they are used to bind copper in the plasma, to prevent it from being absorbed in the tissues, their own function may go unfulfilled. Such symptoms often include mood swings, irritability, depression, fatigue, excitation, difficulty focusing, and feeling out of control. To further complicate diagnosis, some symptoms of excess copper are similar to those of a copper deficit.

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) in drinking water is 1.3 milligrams per liter.&lt;ref name="Casarett" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 8 / Wednesday, January 12, 2000 / Rules and Regulations. pp. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The MCL for copper is based on the expectation that a lifetime of consuming copper in water at this level is without adverse effect (gastrointestinal). The US EPA lists copper as a micronutrient and a toxin.&lt;ref name="Ecological Toxicity Information"&gt;{{cite web|author1=US EPA Region 5|title=Ecological Toxicity Information|url=http://www.epa.gov/R5Super/ecology/toxprofiles.htm#cu|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity in mammals includes a wide range of animals and effects such as liver cirrhosis, necrosis in kidneys and the brain, gastrointestinal distress, lesions, low blood pressure, and fetal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxicological Profile for Copper|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=206&amp;tid=37|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabata-Pendias|first1=Alina|title=Trace Elements in Soils and Plants, Fourth Edition|url=http://www.petronet.ir/documents/10180/2323242/Trace_Elements_in_Soils_and_Plants|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ware|first1=George W.|title=Pesticides: Theory and application|date=1983|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/669712126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set a limit of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for copper fumes (vapor generated from heating copper) and 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for copper dusts (fine metallic copper particles) and mists (aerosol of soluble copper) in workroom air during an eight-hour work shift, 40-hour work week.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Copper, Available Online at: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/metalsheavy/copper.html&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity to other species of plants and animals is noted to varying levels.&lt;ref name="Ecological Toxicity Information"/&gt;

==Toxicity==
Copper in the blood and blood stream exists in two forms: bound to [[ceruloplasmin]] (85–95%), and the rest "free", loosely bound to [[albumin]] and small molecules. Nutritionally, there is a distinct difference between organic and inorganic copper, according to whether the copper ion is bound to an organic [[ligand]].&lt;ref&gt;Batley, G. E., &amp; Florence, T. M. (1976). Determination of the chemical forms of dissolved cadmium, lead and copper in seawater. Marine Chemistry, 4(4), 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Den Berg, C. M. (1984). Organic and inorganic speciation of copper in the Irish Sea. Marine Chemistry, 14(3), 201-212.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (DO NOT RESTORE THIS CONTENT WITHOUT FINDING PROPER CITATIONS.  Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources#Questionable_and_self-published_sources.)
Organic copper, like that found in food, is a beneficial micronutrient needed for good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Copper Toxicity |url=http://nutritionalbalancing.org/center/htma/science/articles/copper-toxicity.php |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inorganic metallic copper, like that found in electrical wire, plumbing pipes, brass fittings, redox water filters, sheet metal, cooking utensils, jewelry and pennies, is a neurotoxic heavy metal linked to physical and psychiatric symptoms on par with mercury and lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Copper Toxicity Epidemic: Top 10 Health Conditions, Strategies &amp; Solutions | url=http://metabolichealing.com/copper-toxicity-major-epidemic/ |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Copper Toxicity Syndrome | url=http://drlwilson.com/articles/copper_toxicity_syndrome.htm |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Copper Toxicity |url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/CopperToxDoc.htm |publisher=Analytical Research Labs |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfeiffer |first1=Carl C. |title=Nutrition and Mental Illness |date=1987 |publisher=Healing Arts Press |location= Rochester, Vt. |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15790101}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===EPA cancer data===
The EPA lists no evidence for human cancer incidence connected with copper, and lists animal evidence linking copper to cancer as "inadequate". Two studies in mice have shown no increased incidence of cancer. One of these used regular injections of copper compounds, including cupric oxide. One study of two strains of mice fed copper compounds found a varying increased incidence of [[reticulum cell sarcoma]] in males of one strain, but not the other (there was a slightly increased incidence in females of both strains). These results have not been repeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0368.htm EPA results for copper and cancer. Accessed March 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
In cases of suspected copper poisoning, [[penicillamine]] is the drug of choice, and [[dimercaprol]], a heavy metal chelating agent, is often administered. Vinegar is not recommended to be given, as it assists in solubilizing insoluble copper salts. The inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles, as are the nervous ones.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

There is some evidence that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) may work as a milder chelator of tissue-bound copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparison of the effect of α-lipoic acid and α-tocopherol supplementation on measures of oxidative stress|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584999001550|publisher=Elsevier, Free Radical Biology and Medicine 1999|accessdate=20 December 2015|doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(99)00155-0|volume=27|journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine|pages=1114–1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha lipoic acid is also being researched for chelating other heavy metals, such as mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury toxicity and antioxidants: part I: role of glutathione and alpha-lipoic acid in the treatment of mercury toxicity.

==Cookware==
Cookware in which copper is the main structural element (as opposed to [[Cookware and bakeware#Clad aluminium or copper|copper clad, copper sandwiched]] or copper colored) is sometimes manufactured without a lining when intended to be used for any of a number of specific culinary tasks, such as preparing [[Fruit preserves|preserves]] or [[meringue]]s. Otherwise, copper [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is lined with a non-reactive metal to prevent contact between acidic foods and the structural copper element of the cookware.

Excepting for acute or chronic conditions, exposure to copper in cooking is generally considered harmless.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&amp;dat=19800104&amp;id=qgoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rlEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4002,415576&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Toxicology|Paracelsus]], dosage makes the poison; as this pertains to copper "a defense mechanism has apparently evolved as a consequence of which toxicity in man is very unusual."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(67)80160-4/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Copper in health#Acute exposures|Acute]] exposure and attendant copper toxicity is possible when cooking or storing highly acidic foods in unlined copper vessels for extended periods, or by exposing foodstuffs to reactive copper salts (copper corrosion, or [[verdigris]]). Continuous, small ("[[Copper in health#Chronic exposures|chronic]]") exposures of acidic foods to copper may also result in toxicity in cases where either surface area interaction potentials are significant, pH is exceptionally low and concentrated (in the case of cooking with, for example, vinegar or wine), or both, and insufficient time elapses between exposures for normal homeostatic elimination of excess copper.

Exceptions to the above may be observed in the case of jam, jelly and preserve -making, wherein unlined copper vessels are used to cook (not to store) acidic preparations, in this case of fruit. Methods of jamming and preserving specify sugar as chemically necessary to the [[Food preservation#Sugaring|preserving (antibacterial) action]], which has the additional effect of mediating (buffering) the interaction of fruit acid with copper,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/jam-making-101-tools-techniques.html&lt;/ref&gt; permitting the use of the metal for its efficient thermal transfer properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Escoffier|first1=Auguste|last2=Gilbert|first2=Pliléas|title=Larousse Gastronomique|date=1961|publisher=Crown|location=New York|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sparking tools==
OSHA has set safety standards for grinding and sharpening copper and copper alloy tools, which are often used in nonsparking applications. These standards are recorded in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] 29 CFR 1910.134 and 1910.1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=12716&amp;p_table=standards |title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: The most important nonsparking copper alloy is [[beryllium copper]], and can lead to [[beryllium poisoning]].

==Drinking water==
With an {{LD50}} of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in rats, "gram quantities" of [[copper sulfate]] are potentially [[Lethal dose|lethal]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pesticide Information Profile for Copper Sulfate | url = http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/carbaryl-dicrotophos/copper-sulfate-ext.html | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggested safe level of copper in [[drinking water]] for humans varies depending on the source, but tends to be pegged at 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2000/20003184.htm#30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth control==
Estrogen birth control pills may increase the amount of copper in humans, but was not shown to increase absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Effects of age and sex on copper absorption, biological half-life, and status in humans | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/5/917.short | publisher = The American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Inc | accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been questioned anecdotally{{by whom|date=November 2018}}, with people claiming copper toxicity, but there is currently no scientific evidence to substantiate this claim. Estrogen increases the absorption of copper, making women more likely to carry excess copper even when no birth control is used.{{mcn|date=November 2018}}

The amount of estrogen (or copper) contained in these modern forms of contraception are generally considered safe, and the former restrictions for estrogen use (not to be used by women older than 40, 35 for smokers) were lifted in 1989.

There are conditions in which an individual's copper metabolism is compromised to such an extent that birth control may cause an issue with copper accumulation. They include toxicity or just increased copper from other sources, as well as the increased copper level of the individual's mother via the placenta before birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Copper and iron transport across the placenta: regulation and interactions| journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology |year=2008 | pmid=18266949 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01658.x | volume=20 | issue=4 |vauthors=McArdle HJ, Andersen HS, Jones H, Gambling L | pages=427–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two hormones commonly used in birth control, estrogen and progestin, protect from each other's complications, so a combination method may work best. At least when existing imbalances have been treated.

==Pathophysiology==
A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as [[hydroxyl radical]] in a manner similar to [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]].&lt;ref name=PubMed&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Radiat Res. | author = Held KD | date = May 1996 | volume = 145 | issue = 5 |pages = 542&amp;ndash;53 | title = Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis | doi = 10.2307/3579272 | pmid = 8619019 | publisher = Radiation Research Society | jstor = 3579272|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed [[oxidative stress]], and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.

Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper.&lt;ref name="pmid17259340"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer GJ |title=Iron and copper toxicity in diseases of aging, particularly atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Exp.

===Indian childhood cirrhosis ===
One manifestation of copper toxicity, [[cirrhosis]] of the liver in children ([[Indian childhood cirrhosis]]), has been linked to boiling milk in copper cookware. The [[Merck Manual]] states recent studies suggest that a genetic defect is associated with this particular cirrhosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec01/ch005/ch005c.html?qt=copper%20and%20milk&amp;alt=sh | title = Merck Manuals -- Online Medical Library: Copper | publisher = Merck | date = November 2005 | accessdate = 2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilson disease===
An inherited condition called [[Wilson's disease]] causes the body to retain copper, since it is not excreted by the [[liver]] into the [[bile]]. This disease, if untreated, can lead to [[brain]] and [[liver]] damage, and [[bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate]] is under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease. &lt;!--.&lt;ref name=Ala&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ala A, Walker AP, Ashkan K, Dooley JS, Schilsky ML |title=Wilson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=397–408 |year=2007 |pmid=17276780 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; THE REFERENCE IS FROM WIKI:Wilson's disease but it has to be checked if it is in line with what is stated here--&gt;

== Bacteria ==
Copper and [[copper alloys]] such as [[brass]] have been found to be toxic to bacteria via the [[oligodynamic effect]]. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which have been found to self-disinfect after eight hours, and [[mineral sanitizer]]s, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on [[Great Palm Island]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prociv P |title=Algal toxins or copper poisoning--revisiting the Palm Island "epidemic" |journal=Med.

'''Donald Harvey''' (April 15, 1952&amp;nbsp;– March 30, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] and [[orderly]] who claimed to have [[murder]]ed 87 people, though official estimates are between 37 and 57 victims. Harvey said he started out killing to "ease the pain" of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Ronald, &amp; Holmes, Stephen. (2009). ''Serial Murder'' 3rd ed. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; As time progressed, he began to enjoy it more and more and became a self-described "[[Angel of mercy (criminology)|angel of death]]". Harvey was serving 28 [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]s at the [[Toledo Correctional Institution]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], having pleaded guilty to murder charges to avoid the death penalty.

==History==
Donald Harvey worked around the [[Medicine|medical]] profession from the age of 18. He began his [[career]] as an [[orderly]] at the Marymount Hospital in [[London, Kentucky]]. He later confessed that during the ten-month period he worked at the hospital, he killed at least a dozen patients. His second victim was killed in the room with Danny George, a twelve year old child. Harvey was insistent that he killed purely out of a sense of empathy for the sufferings of those who were terminally ill. He also admitted that many of the killings he committed were due to anger at the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Interview on ''Mindhunter'', MSNBC, November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey kept his crimes from coming to light for over 17 years. 

The true extent of his crimes may never be known since so many were undetected for so long. Harvey  used many methods to kill his victims, such as [[arsenic]]; [[cyanide]]; [[insulin]]; [[Asphyxia|suffocation]]; miscellaneous poisons; [[morphine]]; turning off [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]]s; administration of fluid tainted with [[hepatitis B]] and/or [[HIV]] (which resulted in a hepatitis infection, but no HIV infection, and illness rather than death); insertion of a coat hanger into a [[catheter]], causing an abdominal puncture and subsequent [[peritonitis]]. Cyanide and arsenic were his most used methods, with Harvey administering them via food, injection, or IV. The majority of Harvey's crimes took place at the Marymount Hospital (now [[Saint Joseph Hospital (Lexington, Kentucky)|St. Joseph's – London]]) in [[London, Kentucky]], the [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|Cincinnati V.A. Medical Hospital]], and Cincinnati's Drake Memorial Hospital.

Harvey did not limit his victims to helpless hospital patients. When he suspected his lover and roommate Carl Hoeweler of infidelity, he poisoned Hoeweler's food with arsenic so he would be too ill to leave their apartment. He poisoned two of his neighbors—sickening one, Diane Alexander, by putting hepatitis serum in her drink and killing the other, Helen Metzger, by putting arsenic in her pie. He also killed Hoeweler's father Henry with arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Psychology |first1=Department Of |title=Donald Harvey "Angel of Death"; page 4 |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Harvey,%20Donald%20-%20fall,%202005.pdf |publisher=Radford University |access-date=28 March 2014 |author2=Elizabeth Sellers |author3=Pannill Hedgecock |author4=Melissa Georges |pages=13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328224831/http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Harvey%2C%20Donald%20-%20fall%2C%202005.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey was incarcerated in [[Toledo Correctional Institution]], where he had been admitted on October 26, 1987. His first parole hearing was scheduled for April 2043.&lt;ref name="OhioDRC"&gt;[http://www.drc.state.oh.us/OffenderSearch/Details.aspx?id=A199449 Offender Search Detail – Donald Harvey] Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.

In [[dentistry]], '''embrasures''' are V-shaped valleys between adjacent [[teeth]]. They provide a spill way for food to escape during [[mastication|chewing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheFreeDictionary|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embrasure|publisher=2014 Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which essentially aids in the self-cleansing process. They also prevent food from being forced through the contact area which might cause food packing and periodontal pain and permit a slight amount of stimulation to the gingiva.

When two teeth in the same arch are in contact, their curvatures adjacent to the contact areas form spillway spaces which are called as embrasures.

==Aims and tasks==
ELISAD’s key purpose was to provide those working in the field of drug, alcohol, tobacco and other addictions information with a network for exchanging knowledge, ideas and sharing experiences.

ELISAD's tasks were:

* To stimulate and enhance European [[cooperation]] between [[library|libraries]], [[information science|information]] services, [[documentation science|documentation]] centres and individuals working in the field of [[addictions]].
* To stimulate the use and the development of [[information management]] technologies.
* To promote the role of libraries and documentation centres as important means for communicating research findings to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (October 2008). ''National drug-related research in Europe'', Selected issues series, Lisbon, p. 25. [http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/selected-issues/research]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To enable [[professional]]s, [[medical practice|practitioners]], [[social worker]]s and others working in the field of both [[substance abuse|licit and illicit drugs]] to gather information easily.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (2007). ''Guidelines for the evaluation of treatment in the field of problem drug use: a manual for researchers and professionals'', p. 61. {{ISBN|978-92-9168-279-9}}. [http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index50509EN.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

ELISAD organises an annual conference each year on topics relevant to information, research and documentation and addictions. It provides a [[mailing list]] for members to exchange information about new books, meetings and other resources.

==History==

Following meetings in 1988 [[Lyon]], [[France]] and 1989 [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] of European [[librarian]]s, [[documentalist]]s and [[information professional]]s working in drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, it was recognised that there was a need to set up an association to enable the exchange of [[experiences]], [[skills]] and [[knowledge]]. Annual meetings were felt to be a way of meeting this need, with the formal establishment of Elisad in 1990.&lt;ref name=Poster&gt;[http://www.elisad.eu/pdf/ElisadPosters.pdf Posters presenting Elisad’s 20 years history, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Jasper Woodcock, Head of the Institute for the Study of Drug Dependence, UK – that became [[DrugScope]] in 2000 – was elected as Elisad’s first President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Druglink/D/druglink-dance-drugs.pdf In ''DrugLink'' (Nov./Dec. 1992) p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many existing [[list of library associations|library associations]] were models and encouraged the Elisad foundation:&lt;ref name=Poster /&gt;

* SALIS ([[Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists]]), Elisad’s sister organisation in North America
* EAHIL ([[European Association for Health Information and Libraries]])
* IFLA ([[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]])
* ALA ([[American Library Association]])
* ASIST ([[American Society for Information Science and Technology]])

Over the years the annual conferences have covered many subjects. 
 
In 1999, at the annual ELISAD meeting at the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) in [[Lisbon]], presentations focused on the growth of information about addictions on the [[World Wide Web]] and raised concerns about the quality and accuracy of such resources. Presenters also found that their searches were producing thousands of results because addictions encompasses various research disciplines, including [[health care|health]], [[social sciences]], [[medicine]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[neurosciences]], [[toxicology]], and so on&lt;ref name=ChristineGoodair&gt;Goodair, Christine; Moen, Jorunn; Prepeliczay, Susanna; &amp; Rouault Thomas (2005). “Collaboration across Europe: Experience from practice”. In ''Libri, International Journal of Libraries and Information Services'' 55, 225-230. K. G. Saur Verlag, ISSN 0024-2667. [http://www.librijournal.org/pdf/2005-4pp225-230.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;…

In 2000, at the annual meeting held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], ELISAD members issued their ''Ethical Charta''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elisad.eu/pdf/EthicalCharta.pdf Ethical Charta]&lt;/ref&gt; to stress the fundamental importance of [[ethics]] in the field of drug information.

In 2002, at the annual meeting held in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]], given the national and international emphasis on provision and need for high quality and accurate information on drugs and other addictions, ELISAD members issued the ''Bremen Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archido.uni-bremen.de/elisad/bremen_declaration_en.doc Bremen Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration supported the need for high quality information whilst drawing attention to the deterioration of financial support for specialist addiction libraries across Europe.&lt;ref name=ChristineGoodair /&gt; A response from ELISAD on this was to consider how they could contribute to the need for high quality resources and this resulted in funding from the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;European Commission DG Health: [http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2001/drug/drug_project_2001_full_en.htm#7]. Retrieved 2012-03-20&lt;/ref&gt; to develop an internet portal on addiction resources from 32 countries in Europe.

Between 2003 and 2005 members of ELISAD developed the internet portal on addictions. This online ''European Gateway on Alcohol, Drugs and Addictions'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addictionsinfo.eu/ European Gateway on Alcohol, Drugs and Addictions]&lt;/ref&gt; provided descriptions of and links to evaluated European websites and other Internet resources on the use and misuse of drugs covering 32 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Savva Susan (May 2004). ”Launch of a new European information resource”. In ''Addiction'', 99(5) 657–659. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.t01-1-00757.x/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 to 2007, a second development phase of the ''European Gateway'' was completed, again funded by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Executive Agency for Health and Consumers, [http://ec.europa.eu/eahc/projects/database.html?prjno=2004325]. Retrieved 2012-03-20&lt;/ref&gt; The Gateway was updated and provides descriptions and links to more than 1100 evaluated websites on addictions, and is searchable in 17 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrb.tinderbox.ie/cgi-bin/mojo.cgi?flavor=archive&amp;id=20070621071127&amp;list=hrb National Documentation Centre on Drug Use, NDC Newsletter (2007) 3(5)]&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the site can search for information on [[education]] and [[drug prevention|prevention]], [[drug rehabilitation|treatment]], [[drug policy|policy]] and [[research]], find resources in their own countries or abroad and identify other European organisations of interest.&lt;ref&gt;New addictions resource for professionals and researchers across Europe launched online [http://www.ahrn.net/index2.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2591&amp;pop.#_online_re]. Retrieved 2012-03-20&lt;/ref&gt; The central challenge for this project was the language barrier within the different EU countries and considerable work was done on standardising the [[terminology]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodair, Christine &amp; Welsh Anne (2008). “Information retrieval and terminology”. In ''Addiction'' 103(4) p. 695. DOI: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02150.x. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02150.x/full]&lt;/ref&gt; among European countries and on the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] used within this gateway.

More recent annual conferences have focused on how to address the problems many libraries and information services encounter due to the expansion of drug information on the [[Internet]] and the impact of finances being reduced. Their themes are :

The '''European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership''' or '''EDCTP''' is a partnership between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and developing countries and other donors, as well as the [[pharmaceutical industry]], to enable [[clinical trials]] and the development of new medicines and [[vaccine]]s against [[HIV|HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].[http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/edctp_en.html] The need for global action against these diseases in order to promote poverty reduction has been recognised by the [[United Nations]], the [[G8]], and the [[African Union]], and the program envisioned the provision of €600 million for the period 2003-2007 in order to translate medical research results into clinical applications relevant to the needs of developing countries.

The [[European Council]] adopted the '''Programme for Action: Accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction''' (COM (2001)96, [http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/pdf/com-2001-96_final_en.pdf]) on 15 May 2001, following its launch by the [[European Commission]]. The [[European Commission|Commission]] proposal was adopted on 16 June 2003 by the [[European Council|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]].[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_169/l_16920030708en00010005.pdf] The Programme was to be based on three central pillars: ''"...the impact of existing interventions, the affordability of key pharmaceuticals and trade, and the research and development of specific [[global public good]]s."''[http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/pdf/background_en.pdf] These aims relate specifically with the [[European Union|EU]] stance on access to [[essential medicines]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/comm/trade/issues/global/medecine/index_en.htm]

==Projects and activities==

EDCTP-funded activities are based on:

* North/North networking and co-ordination

Partnerships among the [[European Union|EU]] and associated countries, allowing focused collaboration of national and European efforts that were not previously coordinated.

* North/South networking and co-ordination

Partnerships among [[European Union|EU]] and developing countries that focuses specifically on developing countries' needs, who are jointly involved in setting the research priorities.

* South/South networking and co-ordination

Efforts aimed at creating lasting long-term partnerships between African scientists and research institutions in Africa.

* Supporting relevant clinical trials

Acceleration of the development of new or improved drugs, vaccines and microbicides against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, with a focus on phase II and III clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa.

* Capacity building

Manifested as a general strengthening of clinical research capacity in Africa, including training activities, workshops and meetings, and the upgrading of [[clinical trials|clinical trial]] sites in Africa.

==Funding==
[[Image:EDCTP proposed expenditure.png|frame|Proposed EDCTP expenditure for the first 5 years of the Programme (2003-2007)[http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/pdf/background_en.pdf]]]

The total budget of the EDCTP is €600 million for the period 2003-2007, of which one third (€200 million) is to be provided by the [[European Union|EU]] budget, an equivalent amounts from Member States' activities, and the remaining €200 million from industry, charities, and private organisations. The Partnership is intended to be a long-term initiative (10–20 years) and a separate legal entity has been created to maintain its independence and flexibility.

Taken together, clinical trials based in developing countries where the diseases are endemic, capacity building, and South-South networking are expected to make up over 90% of the overall budget. (figure).

'''Fibre supplements''' (or '''fiber supplements''') are considered to be a form of a subgroup of functional [[dietary fiber|dietary fibre]], and in the United States are defined by the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM).  According to the IOM, functional fibre "consists of isolated, non-digestible [[carbohydrate]]s that have beneficial physiological effects in humans".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. (2005). "Dietary Reference Intakes for energy, carbohydrates, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein and animo acids". Washington, DC: National Academies Press. Retrieved from http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&amp;page=R1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibre supplements are widely available, and can be found in forms such as [[powder (substance)|powder]]s, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], and [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]s.  Consumption of fibre supplements may be for: improving dietary intake, lowering [[blood cholesterol]], alleviating [[irritable bowel syndrome]], reducing the risk of [[colon cancer]], and increasing feelings of [[satiety]].

Excessive fibre intake can lead to fluid imbalance, [[dehydration]], [[mineral]] deficiencies, [[nutrient]] and [[drug interaction]]s, and other medical problems.

== Rationale for fibre supplement use ==
The American Dietetic Association recommends that the average adult consume 25 to 38&amp;nbsp;grams of [[dietary fiber|dietary fibre]] per day.&lt;ref name=ADA2008&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that the average American only consumes 14 to 15&amp;nbsp;grams per day.&lt;ref name=ADA2008/&gt; To reach the recommended amount of fibre, consumption of dietary fibre from foods (e.g. plants, vegetables, legumes, and grains) instead of supplements is preferred because they contain additional beneficial nutrients and non-nutritive components (e.g. [[antioxidant]]s and [[phytoestrogens]]). Nevertheless, a fibre supplement may be needed to prevent [[constipation]] when food intake is low, which is the case among inactive elderly. A cereal bran such as [[psyllium seed husks|psyllium seed husk]], or a synthetic fiber such as [[methyl cellulose|methylcellulose]] is often used in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Fibre supplement claims==

===Blood cholesterol reduction===
Foods that are high in viscous fibres have been found to lower [[blood cholesterol]] by binding with [[bile acid]]s. In order to compensate for this, [[cholesterol]] from the liver may be used to make more bile acids. The products of bacterial fermentation in the colon may also decrease the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;
Whitney, E., &amp; Rolfes, S. R. (2005). Understanding Nutrition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, research has produced mixed results with respect to whether fibre supplements are as effective as [[dietary fibre]] in reducing [[blood cholesterol]].  Two recent studies show nearly opposing results, using fibre-supplemented apple juice containing both the soluble pectin from apples and gum arabic.  In the first study, the supplement-enriched juice had no discernible effect on the blood cholesterol levels of 110 [[hypercholesterolemia|hypercholesterolaemic]]  men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Dugan | first2 = L. D. | year = 1998 | title = A low-viscosity soluble-fiber fruit juice supplement fails to lower cholesterol | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 128 | issue = | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the second study, the total and [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-cholesterol]] levels of mildly hypercholesterolaemic men were lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mee | first1 = K. A. | last2 = Gee | first2 = D. L. | year = 1997 | title = Apple fiber and gum arabic lowers total and LDL-cholesterol levels in men | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 422–424 | doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(97)00106-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, a dietary supplement consisting of both [[dietary fiber|soluble fibre]] (guar gum, pectin) and insoluble fibre (soy fibre, pea fibre, corn bran) was found to reduce [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-cholesterol]] for individuals that have mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia without reducing [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL-cholesterol]]  or increasing [[triglyceride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Supplements containing extracted [[dietary fiber|insoluble fibre]] may have an effect on [[blood lipids]] that most resembles the effects of dietary fibre.  In a more recent randomized, double blind clinical study of 58 hypercholesterolaemic volunteers, an extruded [[carob]] pulp preparation added to daily diet reduced total and [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-cholesterol]] and improved the ratio of [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]]:LDL cholesterol in all participants, and also showed a marked reduction in [[blood cholesterol|serum cholesterol]] in the women of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zunft | first1 = H.

=== Gastrointestinal health ===

==== Colorectal cancer ====
The protective properties of [[dietary fibre]] against [[colorectal cancer]] are undisputed.  However, fibre supplements do not seem to provide the same defensive effect.  A study of 1429 men and women over six months showed that a high-fibre cereal ([[bran|wheat bran]]) supplement had no protective effect on recurring colorectal [[adenomas]].  In addition, no significant improvement in the proportion or features of existing colorectal adenomas was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vitanzo Jr | first1 = P. C. | last2 = Hong | first2 = E. S. | year = 2000 | title = Does a high-fiber dietary supplement of wheat bran reduce the recurrence rate of colorectal adenomas? | url = | journal = Journal of Family Practice | volume = 49 | issue = 7| pages = 656–656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diverticular disease ====
[[Diverticulitis]] is mainly attributed to the low fibre intake typical of the Western diet for which gradual increase dietary fibre over several weeks is common clinical solution.  Fibre supplements are again much less effective. One study of 58 men and women with uncomplicated diverticulitis in a double-blind controlled trial concluded that common doses of wheat bran and a [[psyllium]]-derived supplement provided relief of constipation only, with no other observable effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, M. H., Littlewood, E. R., Baird, I. M., Fowler, J., North, W. R. S., &amp; Cox, A. G. (1981). Are fibre supplements really necessary in diverticular disease of the colon? A controlled clinical trial. British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), 282(6273), 1353.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irritable bowel syndrome====
[[Irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal ailment for which dietary soluble fibre is often prescribed as part of a therapeutic solution.  As a supplement, partially hydrolysed [[guar gum]] (PHGG - completely soluble, fully fermentable&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of Cereal Chemists]]
http://www.aaccnet.org/meetings/2000/Abstracts/a00ma043.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) has been shown to be quite effective in clinical trials for decreasing IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain and generally improving quality of life for sufferers well beyond treatment.  In addition, PHGG has been shown to have prebiotic properties by acidifying bowel contents and increasing [[gut microflora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = E. G. | last2 = Mansi | first2 = C. | last3 = Dulbecco | first3 = P. | last4 = Savarino | first4 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Role of partially hydrolyzed guar gum in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome | url = | journal = Nutrition | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 334–342 | doi=10.1016/j.nut.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acacia senegal fiber ([[gum arabic]] - completely soluble, fully fermentable) has also been shown to have a prebiotic effect in the gut, significantly increasing Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli after 4 weeks of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Calame W, Weseler AR, Viebke C, Flynn C, Siemensma AD. (2008). Acacia establishes prebiotic functionality in healthy human volunteers. Br J Nutr. 2008 May 9:1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Acacia ferments very slowly in the gut, and due to its polymeric nature does not disturb osmotic pressure, so it has a good gastrointestinal tolerance (it has no sudden and painful release of gas, and the total gas production is much lower than with FOS, for instance) and does not present any side effects at dosages up to 50 grams per day.&lt;ref name="Cherbut C. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cherbut | first1 = C. | last2 = Michel | first2 = C. | last3 = Raison | first3 = V. | last4 = Kravtchenko | first4 = TP | last5 = Meance | first5 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Acacia Gum is a bifidogenic dietary fiber with high digestive tolerance in healthy humans | url = | journal = Microbial Ecol Health Dis | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.1080/08910600310014377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly helpful for IBS is that Acacia senegal behaves as a regulator; it is able to reduce diarrhea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bliss | first1 = DZ | last2 = Jung | first2 = HJ | last3 = Savik | first3 = K | display-authors = etal  | year = 2001 | title = Supplementation with dietary fiber improves fecal incontinence | url = | journal = Nurs.

Dietary insoluble fiber has long been shown to exacerbate Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Francis CY, Whorwell PJ. (1999). Bran and irritable bowel syndrome: time for reappraisal. Lancet. 1994 Jul 2;344(8914):39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight management===
It has been suggested that the refining of fibre-rich grains has contributed to the [[epidemiology of obesity|obesity epidemic]] of [[Western countries]].  Whole, [[dietary fiber|dietary forms of fibre]] are more difficult to ingest and absorb than milled and refined food products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = K.W. | year = 1973 | title = Food fibre as an obstacle to energy intake | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(73)92806-7 | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1418–1421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because dietary fibre may be able to displace available [[food energy|calories]] and [[nutrients]], requires more time for chewing (thereby slowing intake rate and inducing [[satiety]]), and reduces the efficiency of absorption in the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slavin | first1 = J.L. | year = 2005 | title = Dietary fibre and body weight | url = | journal = Nutrition | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 411–418 | doi=10.1016/j.nut.2004.08.018 | pmid=15797686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplemental forms of fibre have been shown to potentially assist weight management by increasing [[satiety]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pasman | first1 = W.J. | last2 = Saris | first2 = W.H.M. | last3 = Wauters | first3 = M.A.J. | last4 = Westerterp-Plantenga | first4 = M.S. | year = 1997 | title = Effect of one week of fibre supplementation on hunger and satiety ratings and energy intake | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 77–87 | doi=10.1006/appe.1997.0091 | pmid=9268427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

(2005) The acute effects of a high fibre meal on postprandial blood lipids and satiety. Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition; 2005 Supplement, Vol. 14, pS65-S65&lt;/ref&gt;

Powdered [[guar gum]], a [[soluble fibre]], was shown to be associated with a significantly lower energy intake in [[obese]] subjects who ingested a non-restricted diet over one week, when the same participants did not consume the fibre supplement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A similar reduction of energy intake through fibre supplementation was observed in another study.  A dose of guar gum was administered to normal-weight and obese participants.  A 10% reduction of energy was observed in the normal subjects, and a 30% reduction of energy for obese subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = E. | last2 = Millar | first2 = D.S. | year = 1975 | title = Bulking agents in the treatment of obesity | url = | journal = Nutrition and Metabolism | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 199–203 | doi = 10.1159/000175595 | pmid=1196549}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fibre supplementation has also been indicated to assist compliance to low-calorie diets, as indicated through decreased feelings of [[hunger]] and increased ratings of [[satiety]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Other soluble fiber forms such as [[glucomannan]] have also been studied in relationship to blood sugar and fat digestion in obese patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|title=Effect of glucomannan on obese patients: a clinical study| pmid=6096282 | volume=8|issue=4|year=1984|journal=Int J Obes|pages=289–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety considerations==
Abruptly adding elevated amounts of fibre to the diet too quickly can lead to intestinal gas, [[diarrhea]], abdominal bloating, cramping, and [[constipation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=ZH|last2=Wang|first2=H|last3=Chen|first3=XY|last4=Wang|first4=BS|last5=Rong|first5=ZX|last6=Su|first6=BH|last7=Chen|first7=HZ|title=Time- and dose-dependent effect of psyllium on serum lipids in mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials.|pmid=18985059|journal=The National Center for Biotechnology Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is therefore better to regulate and moderate daily fibre intake.  If increased fibre intake is desired, gradually increasing the amount over a few days allows the natural [[bacteria]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] to adjust to the change. Drinking 1- 2 L of water every day can prevent some uncomfortable symptoms by making the stool soft and bulky.

The risk of [[intestinal obstruction]] from insoluble fiber in susceptible individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillemeier | first1 = C | year = 1995 | title = An overview of the effects of dietary fibre on gastrointestinal transit | pmid = 7494680 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 96| issue = | pages = 997–999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fluid imbalance leading to [[dehydration]] and mineral deficiencies may increase if more than 50 g of fibre is ingested per day. For this reason, individuals who decide to suddenly double or triple their fibre intake are often advised to double or triple their water intake. In addition, excessive intake of non-fermentable fibre (typically in supplemental form) may lead to mineral deficiencies by reducing the [[Small intestine#Absorptions|absorption]] or increasing the [[excretion]] of [[mineral]]s, especially when mineral intake is too low or when mineral needs are increased such as during [[pregnancy]], [[lactation]], or [[adolescence]].

Excessive fibre intake can also contribute to nutrient and drug interactions.  For example, [[antidepressant]] medications, diabetes medications, [[carbamazepine]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger AB, Shinnar S, Sinnett MJ, Moshe SL. Carbamazepine-induced constipation. J Epilepsy. 1992;5(3):191-193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cholesterol]]-lowering medications and [[penicillin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11021">'Food biodiversity' is defined as "the diversity of plants, animals and other organisms used for food, covering the genetic resources within species, between species and provided by ecosystems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guidelines on Assessing Biodiverse Foods in Dietary Intake Surveys|last=FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and Bioversity International|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-5-109598-0|location=Rome, Italy|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Food biodiversity can be considered from two main perspectives: production and consumption. From a consumption perspective, food biodiversity describes the diversity of foods in human diets and their contribution to [[dietary diversity]], cultural identity and good [[nutrition]]. Production of food biodiversity looks at the thousands of food products, such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, meat and condiments sourced from agriculture and from the wild (e.g. forests, uncultivated fields, water bodies). Food biodiversity covers the diversity ''between species,'' for example different animal and crop species, including those considered [[Neglected and underutilized crop|neglected and underutilized species]]. Food biodiversity also comprises the diversity ''within species,'' for example different varieties of fruit and vegetables, or different breeds of animals.  

== Consumption of food biodiversity ==

=== Trends in food biodiversity consumption ===
Since 1961, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.&lt;ref name="Khoury"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Khoury, C.K.|author2=Bjorkman, A.D.|author3=Dempewolf, H.|author4=Ramirez-Villegas, J.|author5=Guarino, L.|author6=Jarvis, A.|author7=Rieseberg, L.H.|author8=Struik, P.C.|date=2014|title=Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313490111|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4001–4006|doi=10.1073/pnas.1313490111|pmc=3964121|pmid=24591623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern "global standard"&lt;ref name="Khoury" /&gt; diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[maize]], [[soybean]] (by +284%&lt;ref name="Kinver"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26382067|title=Crop diversity decline 'threatens food security'|last1=Kinver|first1=Mark|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[palm oil]] (by +173%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), and [[sunflower]] (by +246%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important crops, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including [[rye]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[sweet potato]] (by -45%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), [[cassava]] (by -38%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), [[coconut]], [[sorghum]] (by -52%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;) and [[millet]]s (by -45%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="Khoury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diets-around-the-world-are-becoming-more-similar/|title=Diets around the world are becoming more similar|last1=Fischetti|first1=Mark|publisher=Scientific American|page=72|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food biodiversity and nutrition ===
Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for public health as well as sustainable [[food systems]] perspective.

Food biodiversity provides necessary nutrients for quality diets and is  essential part of local food systems, cultures and [[food security]]. Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for sustainable food systems. Nutritionally, diversity in food is associated with higher micronutrient adequacy of diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachat|first=Carl|last2=Raneri|first2=Jessica E.|last3=Walker Smith|first3=Katherine|last4=Kolsteren|first4=Patrick|last5=Van Damme|first5=Patrick|last6=Verzelen|first6=Kaat|last7=Penafiel|first7=Daniela|last8=Vanhove|first8=Wouter|last9=Kennedy|first9=Gina|last10=Hunter|first10=Danny|last11=Oduor Odhiambo|first11=Francis|last12=Ntandou-Bouzitou|first12=Gervais|last13=De Baets|first13=Bernard|last14=Ratnasekera|first14=Disna|last15=The Ky|first15=Hoang|last16=Remans|first16=Roseline|last17=Termote|first17=Celine|date=|year=2017|title=Dietary species richness as a measure of food biodiversity and nutritional quality of diets|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/13/1709194115|journal=PNAS|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1073/pnas.1709194115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, per additional species consumed, mean adequacy of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[folate]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] increased by 3%. From a conservation point of view, diets based on a wide variety of species place less pressure on single species.

==Production of food biodiversity==

=== Role of biodiversity in production systems ===
Conservation and management of broad-based [[genetic diversity]] within the domesticated species have been improving agricultural production for 10,000 years. However, diverse natural populations have been providing food and other products for much longer. High biodiversity can maximize production levels, which are sustained through beneficial impact of ecosystem services for agricultural, modified and natural ecosystems. Conversely, reliance on a narrow portfolio of crops or crop varieties can jeopardize food production systems. This is illustrated by the Great [[Irish Potato Famine]]. Potatoes were introduced into Ireland from the New World in about 1600 and they became the major food source of most Irish people. The wind-borne Potato blight fungus spread throughout the country In 1845-1847 and caused almost complete failure of the potato crop. It is estimated that 1 million people died of starvation, cholera and typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm#Food_Supplies Values Of Biodiversity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120117203030/http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services ===
A wide range of biologically diverse populations in natural ecosystems and in / near agricultural ecosystems maintain essential ecological functions that are critical for the production of food. Such populations contribute positively to, for example, [[nutrient cycling]], [[decomposition]] of organic matter, crusted or degraded [[soil rehabilitation]], pest and disease regulation, [[water quality]] maintenance, and [[pollination]]. Maintaining species diversity, while building on and enhancing ecosystem functions, reduces external input requirements by increasing [[nutrient availability]], improving water use and [[soil structure]], and controlling pests.

=== Traits ===
Genetic diversity within food species is a source of useful genes with a variety of benefits. For example:

* Wild subspecies of tomatoes (''[[Solanum lycopersicum]] chmielewskii'') were [[crossbred]] with cultivated tomato species. After 10 generations, new tomato strains with larger fruits were produced. There was a marked increase in pigmentation. The content of soluble solid, mainly [[fructose]], [[glucose]] and other sugars increased.&lt;ref name="Ittis"&gt;[[Hugh Iltis|H.H.Iltis]] (1988). "Serendipity in the Exploration of Biodiversity." In: [[E. O. Wilson]], editor. ''Biodiversity''. National Academy Press. 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A barley plant from [[Ethiopia]] provides a gene that protects the barley crop from the lethal yellow dwarf virus.&lt;ref name="Plotkin"&gt;M.J.Plotkin. 1988. ''The Outlook for New Agricultural and Industrial Products from the Tropics''. In: E.O. Wilson, Editor. Biodiversity. National Academy Press&lt;/ref&gt;

* Host resistance gene, Xa21,from ''[[Oryza longistaminata]]'' is integrated into the genome of ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' for a broad range resistance to rice blight disease caused by ''[[Xanthomonas oryzae|Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/rgn/vol20/b38.html Rice Genetics Newsletter, Vol. 20: Evaluation of durable resistance of transgenic hybrid maintainer line IR58025B for bacterial blight disease of rice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic patterns of biodiversity and food==

In 2016, researchers linked the centers and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume. Foreign crops (crops entirely from regions of diversity outside the location of the country) were extensively used in food supplies (68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean were derived from foreign crops) and production systems (69.3% of crops grown were foreign). Foreign crop usage was shown to have increased significantly over the past 50 years, including in countries with high indigenous crop diversity.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

== History ==
The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the [[Biomedical model|biomedical]] perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by [[disease]]. An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with [[Human body|physical]], [[biological]], [[Psychology|psychological]], and [[social stress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=J.|last2=Noren|first2=J.|last3=Shindell|first3=S.|date=1982-01-01|title=Definition of terms and concepts applicable to clinical preventive medicine|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=8|issue=1|pages=33–41|issn=0094-5145|pmid=6764783|doi=10.1007/bf01324395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to [[well-being]], in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/37089|title=The first ten years of the World Health Organization|last=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|year=1958|isbn=|location=Geneva|publication-date=1958|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phprimer.afmc.ca/Part1-TheoryThinkingAboutHealth/ConceptsOfHealthAndIllness/DefinitionsofHealth|title=Part 1 – Theory: Thinking About Health Chapter 1 Concepts of Health and Illness|website=phprimer.afmc.ca|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as "a resource for living". 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as "the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/107835|title=Health promotion : a discussion document on the concept and principles : summary report of the Working Group on Concept and Principles of Health Promotion, Copenhagen, 9–13 July 1984|last=World Health Organization. Regional Office for Europe|first=|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe|year=1984|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=|type=ICP/HSR 602(m01)5 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from insults. Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person's ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned. 

Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Initiative has been a visible component of the United States’ approach to improving population health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives Federal Prevention Initiatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615184241/https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives |date=2016-06-15 }}.

Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by [[health care provider]]s. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary sciences]]. The term "healthy" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of [[healthy community design|healthy communities]], [[healthy city|healthy cities]] or [[healthy environment]]s. In addition to [[health care]] interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions and spirituality; these are referred to as "determinants of health." Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24756311 |title=BBC News – How stressed are you? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at improving human health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jadad|first=Alejandro R.|date=2016-11-01|title=Creating a pandemic of health: What is the role of digital technologies?|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=260–268|doi=10.1057/s41271-016-0016-1|pmid=27899800|issn=0197-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in the presence of multiple chronic diseases, or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of determinants of health, away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the prevalence of diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/creating-a-pandemic-of-health-opportunities-and-lessons-for-a-university-initiative-at-the-intersection-of-health-equity-and-innovation/|title=Creating a Pandemic of Health: Opportunities and Lessons for a University Initiative at the Intersection of Health, Equity, and Innovation {{!}} Harvard Public Health Review: A Student Publication|website=harvardpublichealthreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of  their life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037| pmid=29301638|title = Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| volume=200| pages=258–261|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of [[health science]], but also through the efforts and intelligent [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choices of the individual and society. According to the [[World Health Organization]], the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;World Health Organization.

An increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, [[health care system|health care organization]] and [[health policy]], one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreyeva|first=Tatiana|last2=Chaloupka|first2=Frank J.|last3=Brownell|first3=Kelly D.|title=Estimating the potential of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce consumption and generate revenue|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=52|issue=6|pages=413–416|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.03.013|pmid=21443899|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;– such as the 1974 [[Lalonde report]] from Canada;&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt; the [[Alameda County Study]] in California;&lt;ref name="Housman &amp; Dorman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Housman|first1=Jeff|last2=Dorman|first2=Steve|title=The Alameda County Study: A Systematic, Chronological Review|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=September–October 2005|volume=36|issue=5|pages=302–308|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ792845|accessdate=27 December 2011|format=PDF|issn=1055-6699|id=ERIC document number EJ792845|ref=CITEREFHousmanDorman2005|doi=10.1080/19325037.2005.10608200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series of [[World Health Report]]s of the World Health Organization, which focuses on [[global health]] issues including access to health care and improving [[public health]] outcomes, especially in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

The concept of the "''health field,''" as distinct from [[medicine|medical care]], emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt;
* Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;
* Environmental: all matters related to health external to the [[human body]] and over which the individual has little or no control;
* Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.

The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, [[mental health|mental]], and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the ''"health triangle."''&lt;ref&gt;Georgia State University. 1998. [http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwche/ ''Health Triangle Slides''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nutter S. (2003) ''The Health Triangle''. Anchor Points, Inc., {{ISBN|0974876003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's 1986 ''[[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]]'' further stated that health is not just a state, but also "a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/index.html The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.] Adopted at the First International Conference on Health Promotion, Ottawa, 21 November 1986 – WHO/HPR/HEP/95.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via [[exercise]], enough [[sleep]], maintaining a healthy [[body weight]], limiting [[alcohol]] use, and avoiding [[smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Housman|Dorman|2005|pp=303–304}}.

The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]] and the [[social environment]]. Factors such as clean [[water]] and [[air]], adequate [[house|housing]], and safe communities and [[road traffic safety|roads]] all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. [http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/facts_figures/basic_needs.shtml ''The UN World Water Development Report: Facts and Figures – Meeting basic needs.''] Accessed 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of [[obesity]], linked to lower overall health and well being.&lt;ref name="Fanny Price"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Björk J, Albin M, Grahn P, Jacobsson H, Ardö J, Wadbro J, Ostergren PO | title = Recreational Values of the Natural Environment in Relation to Neighborhood Satisfaction, Physical Activity, Obesity and Well being | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = e2 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18365329 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2007.062414 | url = http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/5178417/1056501.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in [[public policy]] and land use.

[[Genetics]], or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the [[genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their [[families]]. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either mental, emotional or physical. For example, [[obesity]] is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Human Factors, Business Management, Training and Education {{!}} SpringerLink|volume = 498|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-42070-7|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2017|isbn = 978-3-319-42069-1|last1 = Kantola|first1 = Jussi Ilari|last2 = Barath|first2 = Tibor|last3 = Nazir|first3 = Salman|last4 = Andre|first4 = Terence}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Potential issues===
{{Citation style|section|date=March 2014}}

A number of types of health issues are common around the globe.  [[Disease]] is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36&amp;nbsp;million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).

Among communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).

Another health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children.  One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children.  Approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).

Bodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide.  These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Anup (5 January 2014). [http://www.globalissues.org/issue/587/health-issues "Health Issues."] ''Global Issues''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases.  These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet.  Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).

Though the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |title=United Nations Global Issues |publisher=Un.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608150700/http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |archivedate=2016-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrahealth.org/page/the-top-10-global-health-issues-to-watch-in-2013 |title=The Top 10 Global Health Issues to Watch in 2013 |publisher=Intrahealth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
{{main article|Mental health}}
The [[World Health Organization]] describes mental health as "a state of [[well-being]] in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2005).

Mental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Steven W.

Roughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, [[schizophrenia]], [[ADHD]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and [[Autism spectrum|autism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml The numbers count: Mental disorders in America]. nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorders]], and [[drug abuse]]. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/teen/pages/Mental-Health-and-Teens-Watch-for-Danger-Signs.aspx |title=Mental Health and Teens: Watch for Danger Signs |publisher=HealthyChildren.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&amp;nbsp;Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
* Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
* Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
* Family history of mental health [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health/index.html problems]

An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide [[nutrients]] to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. [[blood pressure]]). The [[food guide pyramid]] is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of [[cancer]], and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |title=Healthy Eating: Why should I make healthy food choices? |publisher=Livelifewell.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227194359/http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like [[phenolic compound]]s, [[isoprenoid]]s and [[alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Garrido M |author2=González-Flores D |author3=Marchena AM |author4=Propr E |author5=García-Parra J |author6=Barriga C |author7=Rodríguez A.B. |title=A lycopene-enriched virgin olive oil enhances antioxidant status in humans |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=1820–6 |pmid=23225211 |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/jsfa.5972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise===
{{Main article | Exercise}}
[[Exercise|Physical exercise]] enhances or maintains [[physical fitness]] and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the [[cardiovascular system]]. According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], there are four types of exercise: [[endurance]], [[Physical strength|strength]], [[flexibility]], and [[Balance (ability)|balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Types of Exercise|url=https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/4-types-exercise|publisher=Go4Life, National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|language=en|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep===
{{Main article | Sleep | Sleep deprivation}}
Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing [[sleep deprivation]] has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pilkington |first=Stephanie |date=August 7, 2013 |title=Causes and consequences of sleep deprivation in hospitalized patients |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=27 |issue=49 |pages=35–42 |doi=10.7748/ns2013.08.27.49.35.e7649|pmid=23924135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/august/sleep-and-sickness.html |title=New Research Confirms Lack of Sleep Connected to Getting Sick |publisher=cmu.edu |author=Shilo Rea |date=2015-08-31|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the role of sleep in regulating [[Sleep and metabolism|metabolism]], insufficient sleep may also play a role in [[weight gain]] or, conversely, in impeding [[weight loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patel |first=Sanjay R. |last2=Hu |first2=Frank B. |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Short sleep duration and weight gain: a systematic review |journal=Obesity (Silver Spring) |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=643–653 |doi=10.1038/oby.2007.118 |pmid=18239586 |pmc=2723045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the [[World Health Organization]], declared that "shiftwork that involves [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] disruption is probably [[carcinogen]]ic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2007/pr180.html |title=IARC Monographs Programme finds cancer hazards associated with shiftwork, painting and firefighting |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |date=December 5, 2007 |access-date=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hirshkowitz, Max |author2=Whiton, Kaitlyn | title=National Sleep Foundation's sleep time duration recommendations: methodology and results summary | journal= Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation |url= http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/fulltext |date=14 January 2015 | pmid = 29073412| doi= 10.1016/j.sleh.2014.12.010 |accessdate=25 November 2015  |display-authors=etal | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of science===
{{Main article|Health science|Health care}}
[[File:Nieuws uit Indonesië, het werk van de Nederlandse dienst voor Volksgezondheid Weeknummer 46-21 - Open Beelden - 16742.ogv|thumb|upright=0.95|The Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the [[Dutch East Indies]], May 1946]]
[[Health science]] is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and [[research]] of the [[Human body|body]] and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure [[disease]]s and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[physics]], [[epidemiology]], [[pharmacology]], [[medical sociology]]. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as [[health education]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[biotechnology]] and [[public health]].

Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[nutrition]], [[pharmacy]], [[social work]], [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and other [[health care provider|health care professions]]. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. [[Workplace wellness]] programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are [[school health services]] in order to improve the health and well-being of children.

===Role of public health===
{{Main article|Public health}}
{{See also|Global health}}

[[File:NewZealand-Stamp-1933-Health.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Postage stamp, [[New Zealand]], 1933. Public health has been promoted&amp;nbsp;– and depicted&amp;nbsp;– in a wide variety of ways.]]
Public health has been described as "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winslow CE | title = The Untilled Fields of Public Health | journal = Science | volume = 51 | issue = 1306 | pages = 23–33 | year = 1920 | pmid = 17838891 | doi = 10.1126/science.51.1306.23 | url = https://archive.org/details/cihm_90880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], and [[occupational health]] are also important areas of public health.

The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behavior]], [[healthy community design|communities]], and (in aspects relevant to human health) [[environmental protection|environments]]. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing [[health education|educational programs]], developing [[health policy|policies]], administering services and conducting [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307160406/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/about/index.html ''What is Public Health?''] Retrieved 2010-06-24&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an [[outbreak]]. [[Vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s to prevent the spread of [[communicable disease]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).

[[Public health]] also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the [[country]] and, in some cases, the [[continent]] or [[world]]. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.&lt;ref&gt;Hispanics and the Future of America. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19910 ''Access to and Quality of Health Care'']&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the public [[health system]] include the areas of [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of [[infectious disease|infectious]] and [[chronic disease]]s.

The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for [[infants]] and [[child]]ren and a continual increase in [[life expectancy]] in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050228214104/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/impact/index.html ''Impact of Public Health''.] Retrieved 2010-6-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide by six years since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

===Self-care strategies===
{{Main article|Self care}}
{{See also|Chronic care management|Social relation|Stress management}}
&lt;!--[[File:Nanogreens-2.gif|thumb|Example of [[nanogreens]] from health and hygiene.]] --&gt;
[[File:Borch Lady washing hands.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A lady washing her hands c. 1655]]
Personal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through [[disease management (health)|integrative care]]. They also include personal [[hygiene]] practices to prevent infection and illness, such as [[bathing]] and [[washing hands]] with soap; [[oral hygiene|brushing and flossing teeth]]; storing, preparing and handling [[food safety|food safely]]; and many others. The information gleaned from personal [[Observations of Daily Living|observations of daily living]]&amp;nbsp;– such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features&amp;nbsp;– may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (''e.g.'', "I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (''e.g.'', a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).&lt;ref name="e-primer3"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828125539/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf ''Health in Everyday Living''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong [[social relation]]ships, [[volunteering]], and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among [[old age|seniors]] over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris AH, Thoresen CE | title = Volunteering is Associated with Delayed Mortality in Older People: Analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging | journal = Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–52 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16176953 | doi = 10.1177/1359105305057310 | url = http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153152/http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better [[cognition|cognitive performance]] scores, fewer [[mood disorder|depressive symptoms]], and better mental well-being and [[life satisfaction]] than non-volunteering retirees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwingel A, Niti MM, Tang C, Ng TP | title = Continued work employment and volunteerism and mental well-being of older adults: Singapore longitudinal ageing studies | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 531–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19474036 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/afp089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged [[psychological stress]] may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in [[cognitive impairment]] with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McEwen BS | title = Protective and damaging effects of stress mediators: central role of the brain | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17290796 | pmc = 3181832 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stress management]] is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. [[Relaxation technique]]s are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include [[cognitive therapy]], [[meditation]], and [[Optimism|positive thinking]], which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as [[problem solving]] and [[time management]] skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.

==Occupational==
{{Main article|Occupational safety and health}}
In addition to [[safety]] risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common [[occupational diseases]] are various forms of [[pneumoconiosis]], including [[silicosis]] and [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease)]]. [[occupational asthma|Asthma]] is another [[respiratory illness]] that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including [[eczema]], [[dermatitis]], [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]], and [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niosh-skin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skin Exposure &amp; Effects|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/|website=NIOSH Topics|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other occupational diseases of concern include [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and [[lead poisoning]].

As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[overwork]] in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Health and Safety Executive]] and in the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.&lt;ref name="niosh-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osha-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hse-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Safety Executive|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|publisher=U.K. Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">Bulgaria  had the third highest mortality in Europe, at 708 per 100,000 population in 2015.  The  four European regions with the highest death rates from diseases of the circulatory system were all in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the early 2000s, the major natural causes of death were [[cardiovascular disease]] (most commonly manifested in [[stroke]]s), [[cancer]], and [[respiratory illness]]. [[Bulgaria]] has had a very low incidence rate of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Although in 2003 the estimated rate of incidence was less than 0.1 percent of the population, in the early 2000s the number of new case reports increased annually. In 2005 some 86 new cases were reported, bringing the official total to about 600, and 58 new cases were reported in the first half of 2006.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2010, there were 1,160 [[HIV]]-positive persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnes.bg/health/2010/06/10/1160-sa-bolnite-ot-spin-u-nas.92537 Здраве1160 са болните от СПИН у нас], dnes.bg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
As a former satellite of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria used to have their health system: the Semashko model. This particular system is characterized by having a state monopoly, where there is centralized planning and financing of the health sphere. There were no private structures for providing health services. There were no health insurances; the system was funded directly from the state budget, paid for maintenance, universally accessible, and free for patients. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/80592/E90023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulgaria]] began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the [[communist]] era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on [[communist]]-era public [[clinic]]s while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. 

The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the [[National Health Insurance Fund]] (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary [[health care costs]]. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of [[Salary|salaries]], with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private [[physician]]s. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the survey conducted by the [[Euro health consumer index]] in 2015 Bulgaria was among the European countries in which unofficial payments to doctors were reported most commonly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the [[European Union]] (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and [[paramedic]]al training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system’s long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of [[physician|doctor]]s but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

[[Heterocyclic amines]] are a group of [[chemical compound]]s, many of which can be formed during cooking. They are found in meats that are cooked to the "well done" stage, in pan drippings and in meat surfaces that show a brown or black crust. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] studies show associations between intakes of heterocyclic amines and cancers of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[rectum]], [[breast]], [[prostate]], [[pancreas]], [[lung]], [[stomach]]/[[esophagus]] and animal feeding experiments support a causal relationship. The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] labeled several heterocyclic amines as likely [[carcinogenic|carcinogens]] in its 13th ''Report on Carcinogens''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=13th Report on Carcinogens|title=Substances Listed in the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/listed_substances_508.pdf|accessdate=2015-05-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in cooking techniques reduce the level of heterocyclic amines.

More than 20 compounds fall into the category of heterocyclic amines, often abbreviated HCAs[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300483X93901096]. Table 1 shows the chemical name and abbreviation of those most commonly studied.

The compounds found in food are formed when [[creatine]] (a non-protein amino acid found in muscle tissue), other [[amino acids]] and [[monosaccharides]] are heated together at high temperatures (125-300&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C or 275-572&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F) or cooked for long periods. HCAs form at the lower end of this range when the cooking time is long; at the higher end of the range, HCAs are formed within minutes.{{R|sjj}}

=== Cooked ground beef ===
A review of 14 studies of HCA content in ground beef cooked under home conditions found in northern Europe and the U.S. found a range of values (Table 2). Because a standard U.S. serving of meat is 3 ounces, Table 2 includes a projection of the maximum amount of HCAs that could be found in a ground beef patty.

[[File:Meat Consumption in the U.S..jpg|thumb|[[Meat consumption]] in the U.S.]]

Meat is a major component of American diets. Data from 1960 show the combined annual [[per capita]] consumption of beef, pork and chicken at 148 pounds; in 2004, that amount increased to 195 pounds a year.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis CG, Lin B. (2005). Factors affecting U.S. beef consumption. USDA report LDP-M-135-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Ground beef made up 42% of the beef market in 2000. Beef consumption, particularly ground and processed beef, is highest in households with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level.

Patterns of beef intake by race/ethnicity show that non-Hispanic whites and Asians consumed the least amount of beef. Non-Hispanic African-Americans had the highest per capita intake of processed beef, ground beef and steaks compared to three other race/ethnicity groups.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

More than half of beef purchased in the U.S. comes from retail stores and is prepared at home. Ground beef makes up the highest per capita intakes of beef both at home and away from home.

Ground beef consumption is highest among males age 12-19 who consume on average 50 pounds per year per capita. The 12-19 age group showed the highest consumption of ground beef for females, but the amount (28.5&amp;nbsp;lbs) is much lower than that of males.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

US dietary exposure has been estimated at 1-17&amp;nbsp;ng/kg bodyweight per day.&lt;ref name="DHHSPHS"&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program.

Approximately 16 percent of HCA exposure came from hamburgers.

== Cooking ==
HCA formation during cooking depends on the type of meat, cooking temperature, the degree of browning and the cooking time. Meats that are lower in fat and water content show higher concentrations of HCAs after cooking. More HCAs are formed when pan surface temperatures are higher than 220&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (428&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F) such as with most frying or grilling. However, HCAs also form at lower temperatures when the cooking time is long, as in roasting. HCA concentrations are higher in browned or burned crusts that result from high temperature.{{R|sjj}} The pan drippings and meat bits that remain after meat is fried have high concentrations of HCAs. Beef, chicken and fish have higher concentrations than pork. Sausages are high in fat and water and show lower concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augustsson|first=Katarina|last2=Lindblad|first2=Jennifer|last3=Overvik|first3=Eva|last4=Steineck|first4=Gunnar|date=1999-05-01|title=A population-based dietary inventory of cooked meat and assessment of the daily intake of food mutagens|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520399284082|journal=Food Additives &amp; Contaminants|volume=16|issue=5|pages=215–225|doi=10.1080/026520399284082|issn=0265-203X|pmid=10560575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground beef patties show lower levels of HCAs if they are flipped every minute until the target temperature is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knize|first=Mark G.|last2=Felton|first2=James S.|date=2005-05-01|title=Formation and human risk of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed from natural precursors in meat|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=63|issue=5|pages=158–165|issn=0029-6643|pmid=15971410|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2005.tb00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beef patties cooked while frozen show no difference in HCA levels compared to room-temperature patties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Elna|last2=Oroszvári|first2=Bea Kovácsné|last3=Tornberg|first3=Eva|last4=Sjöholm|first4=Ingegerd|last5=Skog|first5=Kerstin|date=2008-01-01|title=Heterocyclic amine formation during frying of frozen beefburgers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01390.x/abstract|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=62–68|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01390.x|issn=1365-2621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancer ==
After scientists discovered the carcinogenic components in [[cigarette]] smoke, they questioned whether carcinogens could also be found in smoked/burned foods, such as meats.{{R|sugi}} In 1977, cancer-causing compounds [[heterocyclic amine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were discovered in food as a result of household cooking processes.{{R|sugi}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norat|first=Teresa|last2=Lukanova|first2=Annekatrin|last3=Ferrari|first3=Pietro|last4=Riboli|first4=Elio|date=2002-03-10|title=Meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk: dose-response meta-analysis of epidemiological studies|journal=International Journal of Cancer|volume=98|issue=2|pages=241–256|issn=0020-7136|pmid=11857415|doi=10.1002/ijc.10126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most potent of the HCAs, MeIQ, is almost 24 times more carcinogenic than [[aflatoxin]], a carcinogen produced by [[mold]].{{R|sugi}}

Most of the 20 HCAs are more toxic than [[benzopyrene]], a carcinogen found in cigarette smoke and [[coal tar]]. MeIQ, IQ and 8-MeIQx are the most potent mutagens according to the [[Ames test]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turesky|first=Robert J.|date=2007-02-05|title=Formation and biochemistry of carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines in cooked meats|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427406013257|journal=Toxicology Letters|series=Highlights of EUROTOX 2006/6 CTDC Congress - 43rd Congress of the European Societies of Toxicology &amp; 6th Congress of Toxicology in Developing Countries|volume=168|issue=3|pages=219–227|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2006.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These HCAs are 100 times more potent carcinogens than [[PhIP]], the compound most commonly found as a result of normal cooking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{R|Nobuyuki}}

HCAs contribute to the development of cancer by causing gene mutations, causing new cells to grow in an uncontrolled manner and form a [[tumor]]. Epidemiological studies linked consumption of well-done meats with increased risk of certain cancers, including cancer of the colon or rectum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisburger|first=John H.|date=2002-09-30|title=Comments on the history and importance of aromatic and heterocyclic amines in public health|journal=Mutation Research|volume=506-507|pages=9–20|issn=0027-5107|pmid=12351140|doi=10.1016/s0027-5107(02)00147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of research articles on [[meat consumption]] and [[colon cancer]] estimated that red meat consumption contributed to 7 to 9% of colon cancer cases in European men and women.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Animal studies ===
Long-term rat studies showed that PhIP causes cancer of the colon and [[mammary gland]] in rats.{{R|Nobuyuki}} Female rats given doses of 0, 12.4, 25, 50, 100 or 200 ppm of PhIP showed a dose-dependent incidence of [[adenocarcinoma]]s. The offspring of female rats exposed to PhIP while pregnant had a higher prevalence of adenocarcinomas than those whose mothers had not been exposed. This was true even for offspring who were not exposed to PhIP. PhIP was transferred from mothers to offspring in their milk.

=== Epidemiological studies ===
The effects of HCAs and well-done cooked meat on humans are less well established. Meat consumption, especially of well-done meat and meat cooked at a high temperature, can be used as an indirect measure of exposure to HCAs. A review of all research studies reported between 1996 and 2007 that examined relationships between HCAs, meat and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Wei|last2=Lee|first2=Sang-Ah|date=2009-07-17|title=Well-Done Meat Intake, Heterocyclic Amine Exposure, and Cancer Risk|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635580802710741|journal=Nutrition and Cancer|volume=61|issue=4|pages=437–446|doi=10.1080/01635580802710741|issn=0163-5581|pmc=2769029|pmid=19838915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two studies were found; of these, 18 showed a relationship between either meat intake or HCA exposure and some form of cancer. HCA exposure was measured in 10 of the studies and of those, 70% showed an association with cancer. The authors concluded that high intake of well-done meat and/or high exposure to certain HCAs may be associated with cancer of the colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, stomach and esophagus.

A recent study found that the relative risk for colorectal cancer increased at intakes &gt;41.4&amp;nbsp;ng/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohrmann|first=Sabine|last2=Hermann|first2=Silke|last3=Linseisen|first3=Jakob|date=2009-05-01|title=Heterocyclic aromatic amine intake increases colorectal adenoma risk: findings from a prospective European cohort study|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1418|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|language=en|volume=89|issue=5|pages=1418–1424|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26658|issn=0002-9165|pmid=19261727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence of increased relative risk occurred with intakes of MeIQx greater than or equal to 19.9&amp;nbsp;ng/day, but the trend was not as strong as for PhIP.

Recent studies had mixed results, finding no relationship between dietary heterocyclic amines and [[lung cancer]] in women who had never smoked,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Wei-Yen|last2=Chuah|first2=Khoon Leong|last3=Eng|first3=Philip|last4=Leong|first4=Swan Swan|last5=Lim|first5=Elaine|last6=Lim|first6=Tow Keang|last7=Ng|first7=Alan|last8=Poh|first8=Wee Teng|last9=Tee|first9=Augustine|date=2011-08-01|title=Meat Consumption and Risk of Lung Cancer Among Never-Smoking Women|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2011.589961|journal=Nutrition and Cancer|volume=63|issue=6|pages=850–859|doi=10.1080/01635581.2011.589961|issn=0163-5581|pmid=21774592}}&lt;/ref&gt; no relationship between HCA intake and prostate cancer risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sander|first=Anja|last2=Linseisen|first2=Jakob|last3=Rohrmann|first3=Sabine|date=2010-11-20|title=Intake of heterocyclic aromatic amines and the risk of prostate cancer in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-010-9680-9|journal=Cancer Causes &amp; Control|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=109–114|doi=10.1007/s10552-010-9680-9|issn=0957-5243}}&lt;/ref&gt; but suggesting a positive association between red meat, PhIP and bladder cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrucci|first=Leah M.|last2=Sinha|first2=Rashmi|last3=Ward|first3=Mary H.|last4=Graubard|first4=Barry I.|last5=Hollenbeck|first5=Albert R.|last6=Kilfoy|first6=Briseis A.|last7=Schatzkin|first7=Arthur|last8=Michaud|first8=Dominique S.|last9=Cross|first9=Amanda J.|date=2010-09-15|title=Meat and components of meat and the risk of bladder cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.25463/abstract|journal=Cancer|language=en|volume=116|issue=18|pages=4345–4353|doi=10.1002/cncr.25463|issn=1097-0142|pmc=2936663|pmid=20681011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased risk of advanced [[prostate cancer]] with intakes of meat cooked at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Esther|last2=Stern|first2=Mariana|last3=Sinha|first3=Rashmi|last4=Koo|first4=Jocelyn|title=Meat Consumption, Cooking Practices, Meat Mutagens, and Risk of Prostate Cancer|url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10%2e1080%2f01635581%2e2011%2e539311&amp;magic=crossref%7c%7cD404A21C5BB053405B1A640AFFD44AE3|journal=Nutrition and Cancer|volume=63|issue=4|pages=525–537|doi=10.1080/01635581.2011.539311|pmc=3516139|pmid=21526454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not all studies report an association between HCA and/or meat intake and cancers, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service [[National Toxicology Program]] found sufficient evidence to label four HCAs as "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen" in its twelfth ''Report on Carcinogens'', published in 2011. The HCA known as IQ was first listed in the tenth report in 2002. MeIQ, MeIQx and PhIP were added to the list of anticipated carcinogens in 2004.&lt;ref name="DHHSPHS" /&gt; The ''Report on Carcinogens'' stated that MeIQ has been associated with rectal and colon cancer, MeIQx with lung cancer, IQ with breast cancer and PhIP with stomach and breast cancer.&lt;ref name="DHHSPHS" /&gt; However, no current federal guidelines focus on the recommended consumption limit of HCA levels in meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Cancer Institute|title=Chemicalsin Meat Cooked at High Temperatures|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cooked-meats#r19|accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purposeful production of [[alcoholic drink]]s is common and often reflects cultural and religious peculiarities as much as geographical and sociological conditions.

Discovery of late [[Stone Age]] jugs suggest that intentionally [[Fermentation|fermented]] beverages existed at least as early as the [[Neolithic]] period (c. 10000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote= |last=Charles H |first=Patrick |authorlink= |author2=Durham, NC |year=1952 |title=Alcohol, Culture, and Society |publisher=Duke University Press (reprint edition by AMS Press, New York, 1970) |isbn=9780404049065 |pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wine was consumed in [[Classical Greece]] at breakfast or at [[symposium|symposia]], and in the 1st century BC it was part of the diet of most [[Roman Empire|Roman]] citizens. Both the Greeks and the Romans generally drank diluted wine (the strength varying from 1 part wine and 1 part water, to 1 part wine and 4 parts water).

In [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], beer, often of very low strength, was an everyday drink for all classes and ages of people. A document from that time mentions [[nun]]s having an allowance of six pints of ale each day. [[Cider]] and [[pomace wine]] were also widely available; grape wine was the prerogative of the higher classes.

By the time the Europeans reached the [[Americas]] in the 15th century, several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] civilizations had developed alcoholic beverages. According to a post-conquest [[Aztec]] document, consumption of the local "wine" (''[[pulque]]'') was generally restricted to religious ceremonies but was freely allowed to those who were older than 70 years.

The natives of [[South America]] produced a beer-like beverage from [[cassava]] or [[maize]], which had to be chewed before fermentation in order to turn the [[starch]] into [[sugar]]. (Beverages of this kind are known today as ''[[cauim]]'' or ''[[chicha]]''.) This chewing technique was also used in ancient [[Japan]] to make [[sake]] from [[rice]] and other starchy crops.

The ability to metabolize alcohol likely predates humanity with primates eating fermenting fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malhotra|first1=Richa|title=Our Ancestors Were Driinking Alcohol Before They Were Human|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20170222-our-ancestors-were-drinking-alcohol-before-they-were-human|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the world's oldest [[brewery]] was found, with residue of 13,000-year-old beer, in a prehistoric cave near [[Haifa]] in [[Israel]] when researchers were looking for clues into what plant foods the [[Natufian]] people were eating. This is 8000 years earlier then experts had previously thought beer was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45534133|title='World's oldest brewery' found in cave in Israel, say researchers|work=BBC|date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient period==

===Ancient China===
{{main|History of alcohol in China}}

The earliest evidence of wine was found in what is now [[China]], where jars from [[Jiahu]] which date to about 7000&amp;nbsp;BC. This early [[rice wine]] was produced by fermenting rice, honey, and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGovern | first = Patrick E. | year = 2003 | title = Ancient Wine: The Search for the Origins of Viniculture | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | isbn = 978-0-691-07080-3 | page = 314}}&lt;/ref&gt; What later developed into Chinese civilization grew up along the more northerly [[Yellow River]] and fermented a kind of [[huangjiu]] from [[millet]]. The [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] attached great importance to alcohol and ascribed the loss of the [[mandate of Heaven]] by the earlier [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] as largely due to their dissolute and alcoholic emperors. An edict ascribed to {{circa|lk=no|1116}} BC makes it clear that the use of alcohol in moderation was believed to be prescribed by heaven.

Unlike the traditions in Europe and the Middle East, [[China]] abandoned the production of [[wine in China|grape wine]] before the advent of writing and, under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], abandoned [[beer in China|beer]] in favor of [[huangjiu]] and other forms of [[rice wine]]. These naturally fermented to a strength of about 20% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]]; they were usually consumed warmed and frequently flavored with additives as part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. They considered it spiritual food and extensive documentary evidence attests to the important role it played in [[Chinese folk religion|religious life]]. "In ancient times people always drank when holding a memorial ceremony, offering sacrifices to gods or their ancestors, pledging resolution before going into battle, celebrating victory, before feuding and official executions, for taking an oath of allegiance, while attending the ceremonies of birth, marriage, reunions, departures, death, and festival banquets."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Marco Polo]]'s 14th century record indicates grain and rice wine were drunk daily and were one of the treasury's biggest sources of income.

Alcoholic beverages were widely used in all segments of Chinese society, were used as a source of inspiration, were important for hospitality, were considered an antidote for fatigue, and were sometimes misused. Laws against making wine were enacted and repealed forty-one times between 1100 BC and AD 1400. However, a commentator writing around 650 BC asserted that people "will not do without beer. To prohibit it and secure total [[abstinence]] from it is beyond the power even of sages. Hence, therefore, we have warnings on the abuse of it."&lt;ref&gt;Preventing Alcohol Abuse: Alcohol, Culture, and Control
 By David J. Hanson page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[China|Chinese]] may have independently developed the process of [[distillation]] in the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], during the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt;

===Ancient Persia (or Ancient Iran)===
A major step forward in our understanding of Neolithic winemaking came from the analysis of a yellowish residue excavated by Mary M. Voigt at the site of [[Hajji Firuz Tepe]] in the northern [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran. The jar that once contained wine, with a volume of about 9 liters (2.5 gallons) was found together with five similar jars embedded in the earthen floor along one wall of a "kitchen" of a Neolithic mudbrick building, dated to c. 5400-5000 BC.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penn.museum/sites/wine/wineneolithic.html |title=The Origins and Ancient History of Wine |last1=McGovern |first1=Patrick E. |website=Penn Museum |access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such communities, winemaking was the best technology they had for storing highly perishable grapes, although whether the resulting beverage was intended for intoxication as well as nourishment is not known.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
[[Brewing]] dates from the beginning of civilization in [[ancient Egypt]], and alcoholic beverages were very important at that time. Egyptian brewing began in the city of Heirakonpolis around 3400 BC; its ruins contain the remains of the world’s oldest brewery, which was capable of producing up to three hundred gallons per day of beer.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt; Symbolic of this is the fact that while many gods were local or familial, [[Osiris]] was worshiped throughout the entire country. Osiris was believed to be the god of the dead, of life, of vegetable regeneration, and of wine.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt;
{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wissler |first1=Clark |author-link1=Clark Wissler |last2=Mok |first2=Michel |date= May 1932 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Raymond J.  |title=Stone Age Had Booze and Prohibition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1ScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |journal=[[Popular Science]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=44–46, 121–123 |issn=0161-7370 |access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both beer and wine were deified and offered to gods. Cellars and wine presses even had a god whose [[hieroglyph]] was a winepress. The ancient Egyptians made at least 17 types of beer and at least 24 varieties of wine. The most common type of beer was known as hqt. Beer was the drink of common laborers; financial accounts report that the Giza pyramid builders were allotted a daily beer ration of one and one-third gallons.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt; Alcoholic beverages were used for pleasure, nutrition, medicine, ritual, remuneration and funerary purposes. The latter involved storing the beverages in tombs of the deceased for their use in the after-life.

Numerous accounts of the period stressed the importance of moderation, and these norms were both secular and religious. While Egyptians did not generally appear to define drunkenness as a problem, they warned against [[taverns]] (which were often houses of [[prostitution]]) and excessive drinking. After reviewing extensive evidence regarding the widespread but generally moderate use of alcoholic beverages, the nutritional biochemist and historian [[William J. Darby]] makes a most important observation: all these accounts are warped by the fact that moderate users "were overshadowed by their more boisterous counterparts who added 'color' to history." Thus, the intemperate use of alcohol throughout history receives a disproportionate amount of attention.Those who abuse alcohol cause problems, draw attention to themselves, are highly visible and cause legislation to be enacted. The vast majority of drinkers, who neither experience nor cause difficulties, are not noteworthy. Consequently, observers and writers largely ignore moderation.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

Evidence of [[distillation]] comes from [[alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Distilled water]] has been known since at least c. 200 AD, when [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] described the process.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00033794500201451 | issn = 0003-3790 | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | page = 186 | last = Taylor | first = F.

===Ancient Babylon===
Beer was the major beverage among the [[Babylonia]]ns, and as early as 2700 BC they worshiped a wine goddess and other wine deities. Babylonians regularly used both beer and wine as offerings to their gods. Around 1750 BC, the famous [[Code of Hammurabi]] devoted attention to alcohol. However, there were no penalties for drunkenness; in fact, it was not even mentioned. The concern was fair commerce in alcohol. Although it was not a crime, the Babylonians were critical of drunkenness.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Ancient India===
Alcoholic beverages in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] appeared in the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic Era]]. These beverages were in use between 3000 BC and 2000 BC. ''[[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|Sura]]'', a beverage brewed from rice meal, wheat, sugar cane, grapes, and other fruits, was popular among the [[Kshatriya]] [[warrior]]s and the peasant population.&lt;ref&gt;Alcohol and Pleasure: A Health Perspective By [[Stanton Peele]], Marcus Grant. Page number 102. Contributor Stanton Peele, Ph. D., J.D. Published 1999. Psychology Press. Self/Help. 419 pages. {{ISBN|1-58391-015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sura'' is considered to be a favorite drink of [[Indra]].&lt;ref name="Dasgupta, Amitava"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol Affects Your Body and Mind|first=Amitava|last=Dasgupta|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2011|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3qc7aqWt9oC&amp;pg=PA3|isbn=978-1-4422-0409-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu]] [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] texts describe both the beneficent uses of alcoholic beverages and the consequences of intoxication and alcoholic diseases. [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] texts concluded that alcohol was a medicine if consumed in moderation, but a poison if consumed in excess.&lt;ref name="Dasgupta, Amitava"/&gt; Most of the people in [[India]] and [[China]], have continued, throughout, to ferment a portion of their crops and nourish themselves with the alcoholic product.

In ancient India, alcohol was also used by the orthodox population. Early [[Vedic literature]] suggests the use of alcohol by priestly classes.&lt;ref name="The True Path"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mathew |first=Roy J. |date=18 February 2009 |title=The True Path: Western Science and the Quest for Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAaZWZwSHqgC&amp;pg=PA131 |location= |publisher=Basic Books |page=131 |isbn=978-0738206813 |access-date=19 March 2015 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two great Hindu epics, [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], mention the use of alcohol. In Ramayana, alcohol consumption is depicted in a good/bad dichotomy. The bad faction members consumed meat and alcohol while the good faction members were abstinent vegetarians. However, in Mahabharata, the characters are not portrayed in such a black-white contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International handbook on alcohol and culture|first=Dwight|last=Heath|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9lWztgWymgC|page=131|year=1995|isbn=978-0-313-25234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol abstinence was promoted as a moral value in India by [[Mahavira]], the founder of Jainism, and [[Adi Shankaracharya]].&lt;ref name="The True Path" /&gt;

Distillation was known in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]], evident from baked clay [[retort]]s and receivers found at [[Taxila]] and [[Charsadda]] in modern [[Pakistan]], dating back to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. These "[[Gandhara]] stills" were only capable of producing very weak [[liquor]], as there was no efficient means of collecting the vapors at low heat.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
While the art of wine making reached the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] peninsula by about 2000 BC, the first alcoholic beverage to obtain widespread popularity in what is now Greece was [[mead]], a fermented beverage made from honey and water. However, by 1700 BC, wine making was commonplace. During the next thousand years wine drinking assumed the same function so commonly found around the world: It was incorporated into religious rituals. It became important in hospitality, used for medicinal purposes, and became an integral part of daily meals. As a beverage, it was drunk in many ways: warm and chilled, pure and mixed with water, plain and spiced.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt; Alcohol, specifically wine, was considered so important to the Greeks that consumption was considered a defining characteristic of the Hellenic culture between their society and the rest of the world; those who did not drink were considered barbarians.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt;

Contemporary writers observed that the Greeks were among the most temperate of ancient peoples. This appears to result from their rules stressing moderate drinking, their praise of temperance, and their avoidance of excess in general. An exception to this ideal of moderation was the cult of [[Dionysus]], in which intoxication was believed to bring people closer to their deity.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

While habitual drunkenness was rare, intoxication at banquets and festivals was not unusual. In fact, the [[symposium]], a gathering of men for an evening of conversation, entertainment and drinking typically ended in intoxication. However, while there are no references in ancient Greek literature to mass drunkenness among the Greeks, there are references to it among foreign peoples. By 425 BC, warnings against intemperance, especially at symposia, appear to become more frequent.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

[[Xenophon]] (431-351 BC) and [[Plato]] (429-347 BC) both praised the moderate use of wine as beneficial to health and happiness, but both were critical of drunkenness, which appears to have become a problem. Plato also believed that no one under the age of eighteen should be allowed to touch wine. [[Hippocrates]] (cir. 460-370 BC) identified numerous medicinal properties of wine, which had long been used for its therapeutic value. Later, both [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC) and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] (cir. 336-264 BC) were very critical of drunkenness.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

Among Greeks, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] viewed intemperance as a sign of masculinity and were well known for their drunkenness. Their king, [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BC), whose mother adhered to the Dionysian cult, developed a reputation for inebriety.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

===Pre-Columbian America===
Several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] civilizations developed alcoholic beverages. Many versions of these beverages are still produced today.

'''''[[Pulque]]''''', or '''''octli''''' is an [[alcoholic beverage]] made from the [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] juice of the [[Agave americana|maguey]], and is a traditional native beverage of [[Mesoamerica]]. Though commonly believed to be a beer, the main carbohydrate is a complex form of fructose rather than starch. ''Pulque'' is depicted in Native American stone carvings from as early as AD 200. The origin of pulque is unknown, but because it has a major position in religion, many folk tales explain its origins.

'''''[[Balché]]''''' is the name of a [[honey]] wine brewed by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], associated with the Mayan deity [[Acan]]. The drink shares its name with the balché tree ([[Lonchocarpus violaceus]]), the bark of which is fermented in water together with honey from the indigenous [[stingless bee]].

'''''[[Tepache]]''''' is a mildly alcoholic beverage indigenous to [[Mexico]] that is created by fermenting [[pineapple]], including the rind, for a short period of three days.

'''''[[Tejuino]]''''', traditional to the Mexican state of [[Jalisco]], is a [[maize]]-based beverage that involves fermenting [[masa]] dough.

'''''[[Chicha]]''''' is a Spanish word for any of variety of traditional fermented beverages from the Andes region of South America. It can be made of maize, [[manioc]] root (also called
yuca or cassava) or fruits among other things. During the [[Inca Empire]] women were taught the techniques of brewing chicha in [[Inca education|Acllahuasis]] (feminine schools). ''Chicha de jora'' is prepared by [[Germination|germinating]] maize, extracting the [[malt]] sugars, boiling the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]], and fermenting it in large vessels, traditionally huge earthenware vats, for several days. In some cultures, in lieu of germinating the maize to release the starches, the maize is ground, moistened in the chicha maker's mouth and formed into small balls which are then flattened and laid out to dry. Naturally occurring [[diastase]] [[enzymes]] in the maker's saliva [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the breakdown of [[starch]] in the maize into [[maltose]]. Chicha de jora has been prepared and consumed in communities throughout in the Andes for millennia. The [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]] used chicha for ritual purposes and consumed it in vast quantities during religious festivals. In recent years, however, the traditionally prepared chicha is becoming increasingly rare. Only in a small number of towns and villages in southern [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] is it still prepared.

'''''[[Cauim]]''''' is a traditional alcoholic beverage of the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native American]] populations of [[Brazil]] since pre-Columbian times. It is still made today in remote areas throughout [[Panama]] and [[South America]]. ''Cauim'' is very similar to ''chicha'' and it is also made by fermenting [[manioc]] or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains. A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and re-cooked prior to fermentation. As in the making of ''chicha'', enzymes from the saliva of the ''cauim'' maker breakdown the starches into fermentable sugars.

'''''[[Tiswin]]''''', or '''''niwai''''' is a mild, fermented, ceremonial beverage produced by various cultures living in the region encompassing the southwestern [[United States]] and northern Mexico. Among the [[Apache]], tiswin was made from maize, while the [[Tohono O'odham]] brewed tiswin using [[saguaro]] sap. The Tarahumara variety, called '''''[[tesgüino]]''''', can be made from a variety of different ingredients. Recent archaeological evidence has also revealed the production of a similar maize-based intoxicant among the ancestors of the [[Pueblo]] peoples.

In addition, the [[Iroquois]] fermented sap from the [[sugar maple]] tree to produce a mildly alcoholic beverage.

===Ancient Rome===
Bacchus, the god of wine - for the Greeks, [[Dionysus]] - is the patron deity of agriculture and the theater. He was also known as the Liberator (Eleutherios), freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy, or wine. The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of the aulos and to bring an end to care and worry. The Romans would hold dinner parties where wine was served to the guest all day along with a three course feast. Scholars have discussed Dionysus' relationship to the "cult of the souls" and his ability to preside over communication between the living and the dead.

The Roman belief that wine was a daily necessity made the drink "democratic" and ubiquitous: wine was available to slaves, peasants, women and aristocrats alike. To ensure the steady supply of wine to Roman soldiers and colonists, viticulture and wine production spread to every part of the empire. The Romans diluted their wine before drinking. Wine was also used for religious purposes, in the pouring of libations to deities.

Though beer was drunk in [[Ancient Rome]], it was replaced in popularity by wine.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Gozzini Giacosa, {{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KVbBA3x9wW0C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Beer+Ancient+Rome&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Beer%20Ancient%20Rome |title=''A Taste of Ancient Rome'', page 191-191|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0226290328}} |accessdate=21 March 2010 |isbn=978-0-226-29032-4 |date=2 May 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] wrote disparagingly of the beer brewed by the [[Germanic peoples]] of his day. [[Thracians]] were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as the ancient Greek logographer [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] says. Their name for beer was ''brutos'', or ''brytos''. The Romans called their brew ''cerevisia'', from the Celtic word for it. Beer was apparently enjoyed by some [[Roman legion]]aries. For instance, among the [[Vindolanda tablets]] (from [[Vindolanda]] in [[Roman Britain]], dated c. 97-103 AD), the cavalry [[decurion (military)|decurion]] Masculus wrote a letter to prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included a polite request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer).&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ibeji (16 November 2012).

===Ancient Sub-Saharan Africa===

[[Palm wine]] played an important social role in many African societies.

Thin, gruel-like, alcoholic beverages have existed in traditional societies all across the [[Africa]]n continent, created through the fermentation of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[banana beer|bananas]], or in modern times, [[maize]] or [[cassava]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dietler and Ingrid Herbich, Liquid material culture: following the flow of beer among the Luo of Kenya,  in ''Grundlegungen.

==Medieval period==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2015}}

===Medieval Middle East===
[[File:Alembic for distillation.svg|thumb|Schematic of a still]]

[[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Middle-Eastern scientists]] used distillation extensively in their [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemical experiments]], the most notable of whom were the Persian-Arab [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber), the Arab [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) and the other Persian scientist [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (Rhazes). Geber is acknowledged to be the father of the science of chemistry. He established the principle of classifying substances by their properties and invented equipment and techniques for isolating them. His technical innovations included the alembic still, whose principles still govern the production of alcoholic spirits.&lt;ref name="Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol" /&gt;

Al-Kindi unambiguously described the true [[Distilled beverage|distillation of wine]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="hassan"&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] (2001), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h2g1qte4iegC&amp;pg=PA65 ''Science and Technology in Islam: Technology and applied sciences'', pages 65-69], [[UNESCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hassan-Alcohol&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/notes/notes7.html |title=Alcohol and the Distillation of Wine in Arabic Sources |accessdate=2014-04-19 |last=Hassan |first=Ahmad Y |authorlink=Ahmad Y Hassan |work=History of Science and Technology in Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/2281757 The Economist: "Liquid fire - The Arabs discovered how to distil alcohol.

He became chief physician of Rey and Baghdad hospitals. Razi invented what today is known as rubbing alcohol.

===Medieval China and Medieval India===
Distillation in China could have begun during the Eastern [[Han Dynasty]] (during the 1st &amp; 2nd centuries), but the earliest archaeological evidence found so far indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began sometime during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] or [[Southern Song dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Haw"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stephen G. Haw]]|title=Marco Polo in China|chapter=Wine, women and poison|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA148|date=10 September 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27542-7|pages=147–148|quote=The earliest possible period seems to be the Eastern Han dynasty... the most likely period for the beginning of true distillation of spirits for drinking in China is during the Jin and Southern Song dynasties}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[still]] has been found at an archaeological site in Qinglong, [[Hebei]], dating to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt;

In India, the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the [[Middle East]]. It was in wide use in the [[Delhi Sultanate]] by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="habib"/&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
The process of distillation spread from the Middle East to Italy,&lt;ref name="hassan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="habib"/&gt; where evidence of the distillation of alcohol appears from the [[School of Salerno]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to the history of science |last= Sarton|first=George|year=1975 |publisher=R. E. Krieger Pub. Co.|page= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fractional distillation]] was developed by Tadeo Alderotti in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alchemy |last= Holmyard |first= Eric John |year=1990 |publisher= Courier Dover Publications|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500, [[Germany|German]] alchemist [[Hieronymus Braunschweig]] published ''Liber de arte destillandi'' (The Book of the Art of Distillation), the first book solely dedicated to the subject of distillation, followed in 1512 by a much expanded version. In 1651, [[John French (doctor)|John French]] published [http://www.levity.com/alchemy/jfren_ar.html The Art of Distillation] the first major English compendium of practice, though it has been claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Distillation |journal=[[Industrial and Engineering Chemistry]] |volume=28 |issue=6 |page=677 |doi=10.1021/ie50318a015 |year=1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that much of it derives from Braunschweig's work. This includes diagrams showing an industrial rather than bench scale of the operation.

Names like "life water" have continued to be the inspiration for the names of several types of beverages, like [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] [[whisky]], [[France|French]] [[eaux-de-vie]] and possibly [[vodka]]. Also, the [[Scandinavia]]n [[akvavit]] spirit gets its name from the Latin phrase ''aqua vitae''.

At times and places of poor public sanitation (such as [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]]), the consumption of alcoholic drinks was a way of avoiding water-borne diseases such as [[cholera]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Small beer]] and [[Pomace#History|faux wine]], in particular, were used for this purpose. Although alcohol kills bacteria, its low concentration in these beverages would have had only a limited effect. More important was that the boiling of water (required for the [[Brew kettle|brewing]] of beer) and the growth of yeast (required for [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] of beer and wine) would kill dangerous [[microorganisms]]. The alcohol content of these beverages allowed them to be stored for months or years in simple wood or clay containers without spoiling. For this reason, they were commonly kept aboard sailing vessels as an important (or even the sole) source of [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] for the crew, especially during the long voyages of the [[early modern period]].

==Modern period==

===Early modern period===
During the [[early modern period]] (1500–1800), [[Protestant]] leaders such as [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], the leaders of the [[Anglican Church]], and even the [[Puritans]] did not differ substantially from the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]: [[alcohol]] was a gift of God and created to be used in moderation for pleasure, enjoyment and health; [[drunkenness]] was viewed as a [[sin]] (see [[Christianity and alcohol]]).

From this period through at least the beginning of the 18th century, attitudes toward drinking were characterized by a continued recognition of the positive nature of moderate consumption and an increased concern over the negative effects of drunkenness. The latter, which was generally viewed as arising out of the increased self-indulgence of the time, was seen as a threat to [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[salvation]] and societal well being. [[Alcohol intoxication|Intoxication]] was also inconsistent with the emerging emphasis on rational mastery of self and world and on work and efficiency.

In spite of the ideal of moderation, consumption of alcohol was often high. In the 16th century, alcohol beverage consumption reached 100 liters per person per year in Valladolid, [[Spain]], and [[Poland|Polish]] [[peasants]] consumed up to three [[liters]] of [[beer]] per day. In Coventry, [[England]], the average amount of beer and [[ale]] consumed was about 17 pints per person per week, compared to about three pints today; nationwide, consumption was about one pint per day per capita. Swedish beer consumption may have been 40 times higher than in modern [[Sweden]]. English sailors received a ration of a [[gallon]] of beer per day, while soldiers received two-thirds of a gallon. In [[Denmark]], the usual consumption of beer appears to have been a gallon per day for adult laborers and sailors.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt; It is important to note that modern beer is much stronger than the beers of the past. While current beers are 3-5% alcohol, the beer drunk in the historical past was generally 1% or so.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} This was known as 'small beer'.

However, the production and distribution of [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] spread slowly. Spirit drinking was still largely for [[medicinal]] purposes throughout most of the 16th century. It has been said of distilled alcohol that "the sixteenth century created it; the seventeenth century consolidated it; the eighteenth popularized it."

A beverage that clearly made its debut during the 17th century was sparkling [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. The credit for that development goes primarily and erroneously to [[Dom Pérignon (monk)|Dom Perignon]], the wine-master in a [[France|French]] [[abbey]]. Although the oldest recorded sparkling wine is [[Blanquette de Limoux]], in 1531,&lt;ref&gt;"Tom Stevenson (2005) Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopaedia Dorling Kindersley {{ISBN|0-7513-3740-4}}, p237"&lt;/ref&gt; the English scientist and physician [[Christopher Merret]] documented the addition of sugar to a finished wine to create a second fermentation six years before Dom Perignon joined the [[Abbey|Abbey of Hautvillers]] and almost 40 years before it was claimed that he invented Champagne. Around 1668, Perignon used strong bottles, invented a more efficient cork (and one that could contain the effervescence in those strong bottles), and began developing the technique of blending the contents. However, another century would pass before problems, especially bursting bottles, would be solved and champagne would become popular.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

The original [[grain]] spirit, [[whisky]] (or ''whiskey'' in [[Hiberno-English]]) and its specific origins are unknown but the distillation of whisky has been performed in Ireland and Scotland for centuries. The first confirmed written record of whisky comes from 1405 in Ireland, the production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry from 1494, although both countries could have distilled grain alcohol before this date.

Distilled spirit was generally flavored with [[juniper]] berries. The resulting beverage was known as jenever, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "juniper." The French changed the name to genievre, which the English changed to "geneva" and then modified to "gin." Originally used for medicinal purposes, the use of [[gin]] as a social drink did not grow rapidly at first. However, in 1690, England passed "An Act for the Encouraging of the Distillation of Brandy and Spirits from Corn" and within four years the annual production of distilled spirits, most of which was gin, reached nearly one million gallons.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt; It should be noted that "corn" in the British English of the time meant "grain" in general, while in American English "corn" refers principally to [[maize]].

The dawn of the 18th century saw the [[British Parliament]] pass legislation designed to encourage the use of grain for distilling spirits. In 1685, consumption of gin had been slightly over one-half million gallons but by 1714 it stood at two million gallons. In 1727, official (declared and taxed) production reached five million gallons; six years later the London area alone produced eleven million gallons of gin.
The English government actively promoted gin production to utilize surplus grain and to raise revenue. Encouraged by public policy, very cheap spirits flooded the market at a time when there was little stigma attached to drunkenness and when the growing urban poor in [[London]] sought relief from the newfound insecurities and harsh realities of urban life. Thus developed the so-called [[Gin Craze|Gin Epidemic]].&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

While the negative effects of that phenomenon may have been exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale of gin in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically. However, the peak in consumption was reached seven years later, when the nation of six and one-half million people drank over 18 million gallons of gin. And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities; people in the countryside largely consumed beer, ale and [[cider]].&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

After its peak, gin consumption rapidly declined. From eighteen million gallons in 1743, it dropped to just over seven million gallons in 1751 and to less than two million by 1758, and generally declined to the end of the century. A number of factors appear to have converged to discourage consumption of gin. These include the production of higher quality beer of lower price, rising corn prices and taxes which eroded the price advantage of gin, a temporary ban on distilling, an increasing criticism of drunkenness, a newer standard of behavior that criticized coarseness and excess, increased [[tea]] and [[coffee]] consumption, an increase in [[piety]] and increasing [[industrialization]] with a consequent emphasis on [[sobriety]] and labor efficiency.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

While drunkenness was still an accepted part of life in the 18th century, the 19th century would bring a change in attitudes as a result of increasing industrialization and the need for a reliable and punctual work force. Self-discipline was needed in place of self-expression, and task orientation had to replace relaxed conviviality. Drunkenness would come to be defined as a threat to industrial efficiency and growth.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

Ethanol can produce a state of [[general anesthesia]] and historically has been used for this purpose (Dundee et al., 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299997891741 | doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(97)89174-1 | volume=329 | issue=2–3 | title=Ethanol as a general anesthetic: Actions in spinal cord | journal=European Journal of Pharmacology | pages=121–127| date=1997-06-25 | last1=Wong | first1=Shirley M.E. | last2=Fong | first2=Eileen | last3=Tauck | first3=David L. | last4=Kendig | first4=Joan J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems commonly associated with industrialization and rapid urbanization were also attributed to alcohol. Thus, problems such as urban crime, poverty and high infant [[death|mortality]] rates were blamed on alcohol, although "it is likely that gross overcrowding and unemployment had much to do with these problems." Over time, more and more personal, social and religious/moral problems would be blamed on alcohol. And not only would it be enough to prevent drunkenness; any consumption of alcohol would come to be seen as unacceptable. Groups that began by promoting the moderate use of alcohol instead of its abuse- would ultimately form [[temperance movement]]s and press for the complete and total [[prohibition]] of the production and distribution of beverage alcohol. Unfortunately, this would not eliminate social problems but would compound the situation by creating additional problems wherever it was implemented.&lt;ref name=Hanson/&gt;

===The Thirteen Colonies===
{{further|Christianity and alcohol}}
[[File:1897 Saloon Blackhawk.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the Toll Gate [[Bar|Saloon]] in [[Black Hawk, Colorado|Black Hawk]], [[Colorado]] (1897)]]

[[Alcoholic beverages]] played an important role in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from their early days. For example, the ''[[Mayflower]]'' shipped more [[beer]] than [[water]] when it departed for the [[New World]] in 1620. While this may seem strange viewed from the modern context, note that drinking wine and beer at that time was safer than drinking water - which was usually taken from sources also used to dispose of sewage and garbage.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a common belief that may have been added without examining research.|date=May 2018}} Experience showed that it was safer to drink alcohol than the typically polluted water in [[Europe]].{{Citation needed|reason=This is a common belief that may have been added without examining research.|date=May 2018}} Alcohol was also an effective [[analgesic]], provided energy necessary for hard work, and generally enhanced the quality of life.

For hundreds of years the [[England|English]] ancestors of the colonists had consumed beer and [[ale]]. Both in England and in the New World, people of both sexes and all ages typically drank beer with their meals. Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, it was difficult to make the beer they were accustomed to because wild [[yeasts]] caused problems in [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and resulted in a bitter, unappetizing brew. Although wild [[hops]] grew in [[New England]], hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer. In the meantime, the colonists improvised a beer made from red and black [[spruce]] twigs boiled in water, as well as a [[ginger beer]].
[[File:A cross roads store, bar, juke joint, and gas station in Melrose, Louisiana, 1944.jpg|thumb|A [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era bar in [[Melrose, Louisiana]]]]
Beer was designated{{by whom|date=January 2017}} X, XX, or XXX according to its [[alcohol content]]. The colonists also learned to make a wide variety of [[wine]] from fruits. They additionally made wine from such products as flowers, herbs, and even oak leaves. Early on, [[France|French]] vine-growers were brought{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to the New World to teach settlers how to cultivate grapes.
[[File:Charleston J W Swarts Saloon year 1885.jpg|thumb|J.W. Swarts Saloon in [[Charleston, Arizona]] in 1885]]
Colonists adhered to the traditional belief that [[distilled]] spirits were ''[[aqua vitae]]'', or water of life. However, [[rum]] was not commonly available until after 1650, when it was imported from the [[Caribbean]]. The cost of rum dropped after the colonists began importing [[molasses]] and cane sugar directly and distilled their own rum. By 1657, a rum distillery was operating in [[Boston, MA|Boston]]. It was highly successful and within a generation the production of rum became colonial New England's largest and most prosperous industry.

Almost every important town from [[Massachusetts]] to the Carolinas had a rum distillery to meet the local demand, which had increased dramatically. Rum was often enjoyed in mixed drinks, including [[flip (cocktail)|flip]]. This was a popular winter beverage made of rum and beer sweetened with sugar and warmed by plunging a red-hot fireplace poker into the serving mug.
Alcohol was viewed positively while its abuse was condemned. [[Increase Mather]] (d. 1723) expressed the common view in a sermon against [[drunkenness]]: "Drink is in itself a good creature of God, and to be received with thankfulness, but the abuse of drink is from Satan; the wine is from God, but the drunkard is from the Devil."

=== The United States of America ===
In the early 19th century, Americans had inherited a hearty [[Drinking culture|drinking tradition]]. Many types of alcohol were consumed. One reason for this heavy [[Drinking#Alcoholic beverages|drinking]] was attributed{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to an overabundance of [[Maize|corn]] on the western [[Frontier#American frontier|frontier]], which encouraged the widespread production of cheap whiskey. It was at this time that alcohol became an important part of the American diet.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the 1820s, Americans drank seven gallons of alcohol per person annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/28/AR2009102803801.html |title= A reality check on drug use |accessdate= |author= George F.

In colonial America, water contamination was common. Two means to ensure that waterborne illness, for example [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]], was not conveyed by water was to boil it in the process of making tea or coffee, or to use it to make alcohol. As a result, alcohol consumption was much higher in the nineteenth century than it is today -- {{convert|7.1| gal|l}} of pure alcohol per person per year.&lt;ref name="at150629"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=Colonial Americans Drank Roughly Three Times as Much as Americans Do Now|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/benjamin-rush-booze-morality-democracy/396818/|accessdate=6 August 2017|publisher=The Atlantic|date=Jun 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], transportation of grain from the west was cost prohibitive; farmers instead converted their grain to alcohol for shipping eastward. This dependence on alcohol as a revenue source led to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] of 1794. Later in the nineteenth century opposition to alcohol grew in the form of the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], culminating in [[Prohibition in the United States]] from 1920 to 1933.

== Biography ==
The career of Hu Sihui, as he states in preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2V7qt0YFaIC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=hu+ssu-hui&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=ru&amp;sig=ACfU3U1fo6yNjd2hfgdBPwPrYCsg2R_ROg  '''Unschuld, Paul Ulrich. Medicine in China: A History of Pharmaceutics.] University of California Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-520-05025-8}}, {{ISBN|9780520050259}}''' pages 213—214&lt;/ref&gt; was in the reign of [[Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, Emperor Renzong of Yuan|Buyantu Khan]] in Yenyu years (1314—1320). An ethnic [[Mongols|Mongol]], and an official in Xuanhui Yuan (the Ministry of Court Supplies and Provisions), around 1315 Hu Sihui initially emerged as the therapist of Empress Dowager, soon also became the therapist of the acting Empress, and later received the rank of the chief Imperial therapist and became responsible for food and drinks of the numerous Emperor's family.

As tradition has it, Buyantu Khan, after several years of expeditions and irregular life, was overstrained and suffered acute pain in his kidneys. The [[vegetable soup]] prescribed by Hu Sihui cured the pains in 3 months, and one of Emperor's spouses  became pregnant. The Emperor grandly awarded Hu Sihui as the cause of this "double joy".

In 1330 Hu Sihui, no longer busy with the Emperor and his harem, completed and presented to the Court his book ''Yinshan Zhengyao'' (饮膳正要), summarising the experiences of the court dietitian. The main idea of his work was that people preparing food for the Emperor are directly responsible for efficiency of the State, as a monarch may get sick from improper eating, and lose ability of managing state affairs.

== Principles ==
''Yinshan Zhengyao'' teaches a significant number of diseases are caused by improper eating, and a significant part of them can be cured by proper eating. The book propagated moderation, regularity and variety in food, proper hygiene and food storage, and special diets for pregnant women and for children. This book was the first to describe in detail how diseases are connected to deficiency of certain components in food. It was probably the first book in China to dwell on food poisoning.

Recipes presented show strong Han Chinese as well as Mongolian, Turkic and Persian influences. As Hu Sihui states, a large variety of foods were known in the court since [[Kublai Khan]] and this novelty needed special research as to its influence on health. Taken as a collection of recipes and ingredients alone, his book is a tremendously important description of Medieval food of Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;Allsen, Thomas T. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0StLNcKQNUoC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=hu+ssu-hui&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=ru&amp;sig=ACfU3U3aKGI6m82_cQ1FsFIPKRFAY10Bnw#PPA131,M1 Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia.] Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-60270-X}}, 9780521602709 стр. 130—131&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of recipes starts with a variety soups, barley, then noodles and breads. Many recipes represent Central and West Asian cooking traditions, roughly translated into Chinese categories, some even translated from Turkic languages.&lt;ref&gt;Husihui, Paul D. Buell,  Eugene N. Anderson, tr., ''A Soup for the Qan: Chinese Dietary Medicine of the Mongol Era as Seen in Hu Szu-Hui's Yin-Shan Cheng-Yao: Introduction, Translation, Commentary and Chinese Text''  (London; New York: Kegan Paul International,  2000. {{ISBN|0710305834}}), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of recipes are:

:''Wolf soup'': Wolf meat (leg: bone and cut up), tsaoko cardamom (three), black pepper (five chien), kasini (one ch’ien), turmeric (two ch’ien), za’faran (one ch’ien). Boil together into a soup. Adjust flavors of everything using onions, sauce, salt, and vinegar.
      
:''Deboned chicken morsels'': clean, cook, and cut up ten fat chickens, debone as morsels, juice of sprouting ginger, onions, ginger, Chinese flour, pepper, make into vermicelli &lt;ref&gt;Hu Sihui, ''A Soup for the Qan'' p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Hu Sihui's book was widely accepted in Later Yuan, but won even wider influence after the fall of Yuan. [[Ming Dynasty]], after occupying Beijing in 1368, started to combine Chinese cuisine from other regions with the cosmopolitan cuisine of Yuan court. [[Jingtai Emperor]] of Ming (ruled 1449—1457) personally wrote a preface to an edition of Yinshan Zhengyao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://china.org.cn/english/imperial/26109.htm Imperial Food in the Ming Dynasty] на сайте China Internet Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

As a culinary encyclopedia, this book made some regional recipes aссepted as part of national cuisine of the whole of China.  For example, it is this book that contained a recipe of a roast duck that could be a predecessor of the widely known [[Beijing Duck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing Duck|url=http://english.hanban.edu.cn/english/features/beijing/31300.htm|accessdate=2008-10-17|publisher=China Internet Information Center|year=2008|work=International Chinese Language Council website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

придворный , a Mongol, is credited for being a distinguished dietician. He wrote Yinshan Zhengyao (Important Principles of Food and Drink) in 1330 and was a proponent of a balanced diet. He especially focused on the importance of moderation and championed the eating in moderation rule. In addition, Hu's book offered a list of 230 cereals, meat, fish, shellfish, fruits and vegetables with a description of their nutritional benefits. For example, Hu said that eating too many apples caused distension and too many oranges could harm the liver; that dog meat was salty, not too overpowering, non-toxic and calmed the zang organs; and that grapes sustain energy and strengthen character.

The Mongolian food served in the Yuan palace was mainly meat from animals and fowl, especially mutton, but little seafood was served. The Yuan imperial food considered of meats and vegetables with mixed flavors from the Muslims, Hans, and other ethnic groups. This was because Beijing, having been the capital city of the Yuan Dynasty, was an important communication center and was inhabited mainly by Han people. Therefore, the food of the Mongolian rulers had been influenced by the Hans and other ethnic groups.

The imperial food of the Ming and Qing Dynasties had one common attribute: Diet was used to protect health. Kublai (1215 - 1294), the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, paid great attention to protecting his health through diet.

During the Reign of Tianli in the Yuan Dynasty (1328 - 1330), Hu Sihui, the imperial physician at the imperial hospital in charge of the emperor’s food, wrote a book entitled Principles of Correct Diet, which he gave to the emperor. The book dealt with questions about nutrition and hygiene. It also told how to make soup, thick soup, syrup, paste, oils, tea, sesame cakes, stuffed buns, steamed buns, porridge, and noodles, and described their nutritious effects. The book had a great influence on the food and drinks served in the Yuan palace. It encouraged health protection and parental education, listed taboo foods during pregnancy, and banned alcoholic drinks. It described foods for use in all seasons, prevented the wrong use of flavors, and stressed dietotherapy and regimen.

Shortly after Zhu Yuanzhang (1328 – 1398) ascended to the throne, he summoned Jia Ming, a 100 – year – old man from Haining to ask him the secret of his long life. Jia Ming gave The Instructions on Foods and Drinks to the emperor.

Hu Sihui’s Proper and Essential Ways of Drinking and Eating also received great attention from the Ming emperors. Zhu Qiyu, Emperor Daizong of the Ming Dynasty, even wrote a preface for the book before it was reprinted.

As in previous dynasties, food and drinks in the Ming Palace were supplied in season. Fresh fruits, vegetables and meats were supplied in their times. In the Ming Palace, more vegetables and fruits were eaten than meat and fish. Among the meat and fish eaten were chicken, pheasant, goose, duck, carp, golden carp, Mandarin fish, bream, rabbit, and deer.

The menu in the Ming Palace changed daily and dishes were not repeated. Light refreshments also changed daily. This variation in the daily diets continued until the end of the Qing Dynasty.

&lt;!-- The book is an investigation of Yuan era dietary medicine in its social and historical context. And, while Western Chinese medical practitioners will not find a highly rationalized presentation of traditional Asian dietary ideas abstracted and packaged for clinical application, they will find a very accessible exploration of traditional dietetics in the powerful and cosmopolitan Mongol court. This fidelity to the times gives the reader an understandable view of what likely influenced the thinking of Yuan-era chefs and doctors. Buell and Anderson state it thus: ". . . what most impresses us in the YSCY is the degree to which Hu's medical ideas are not formulated in terms of Correspondence Medicine, or any other system. Hu was no slave to tradition. He drew upon folk belief and folk experience as well as Correspondence Theory in presenting his medical ideas."

For example, Hu scores all major foods by heating/cooling category, and according to their effects on ch'i. He also discusses the effects many of them have on particular organs and anatomical parts, their role in humoral therapy. But, like other pragmatists of the Chinese herbal tradition, Hu also specifies which cannot be eaten together, which cure particular diseases or cause particular conditions, and which have magical effects. In other words, this is a book for those whose interest is understanding the native application of Chinese dietetic ideas in a known context. As such, it is accessible and often fascinating. It belongs in the libraries of schools specializing in clinical education, and on the shelves of persons whose interest in traditional East Asian dietary medicine and herbalism extends to understanding their traditional context. --&gt;

'''Hyperventilation syndrome''' ('''HVS'''); also '''chronic hyperventilation syndrome''' ('''CHVS''') and '''dysfunctional breathing hyperventilation syndrome''' is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply or too rapidly ([[hyperventilation]]).  HVS may present with [[chest pain]] and a tingling sensation in the fingertips and around the mouth ([[paresthesia]]) and may accompany a [[panic attack]].

People with HVS may feel that they cannot get enough air. In reality, they have about the same oxygenation in the arterial blood (normal values are about 98% for hemoglobin saturation) and too little [[carbon dioxide]] ([[hypocapnia]]) in their blood and other tissues.  While oxygen is abundant in the bloodstream, HVS reduces effective delivery of that oxygen to vital organs due to low-{{Co2}}-induced [[vasoconstriction]] and the suppressed [[Bohr effect]].

The hyperventilation is self-promulgating as rapid breathing causes carbon dioxide levels to fall below healthy levels, and [[respiratory alkalosis]] (high blood [[pH]]) develops. This makes the symptoms worse, which causes the person to breathe even faster, which then, further exacerbates the problem.

The respiratory alkalosis leads to changes in the way the [[nervous system]] fires and leads to the [[paresthesia]], dizziness, and perceptual changes that often accompany this condition.  Other mechanisms may also be at work, and some people are physiologically more susceptible to this phenomenon than others.&lt;ref name="Edward Newton"/&gt;

==Causes==
Hyperventilation syndrome is believed to be caused by psychological factors and by definition has no organic cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shu|first=BC |author2=Chang, YY |author3=Lee, FY |author4=Tzeng, DS |author5=Lin, HY |author6=Lung, FW|title=Parental attachment, premorbid personality, and mental health in young males with hyperventilation syndrome.|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=2007-10-31|volume=153|issue=2|pages=163–70|pmid=17659783|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one cause of [[hyperventilation]] with others including infection, blood loss, [[heart attack]],&lt;ref name="titleHyperventilation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hyperventilation/article_em.htm |title=Hyperventilation |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hypocapnia]] or [[alkalosis]] due to chemical imbalances, decreased cerebral blood flow, and increased nerve sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Brad McKechnie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/12/04/03.html |title=Neurology - Hyperventilation Syndrome &amp;#124; Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, one third of patients with HVS had "subtle but definite lung disease" that prompted them to breathe too frequently or too deeply.&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-07401-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Natelson, Benjamin H. |title=Facing and fighting fatigue: a practical approach |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1998 |pages=40 |isbn=0-300-07401-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people with [[panic disorder]] or [[agoraphobia]] will experience HVS. However, most people with HVS do not have these disorders.&lt;ref name="Edward Newton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic270.htm |title=eMedicine - Hyperventilation Syndrome: Article by Edward Newton, MD |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Hyperventilation syndrome is a remarkably common cause of dizziness complaints. About 25% of patients who complain about dizziness are diagnosed with HVS.&lt;ref name="Brad McKechnie"/&gt;

A diagnostic Nijmegen Questionnaire provides an accurate diagnosis of Hyperventilation.&lt;ref name="Dixhoorn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Dixhoorn J, Duivenvoorden HJ |title=Efficacy of Nijmegen Questionnaire in recognition of the hyperventilation syndrome |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |year=1985 |doi= 10.1016/0022-3999(85)90042-x|pmid=4009520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is insufficient evidence for or against breathing exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=M|author2=Harvey, A |author3=Marston, L |author4= O'Connell, NE |title=Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome in adults.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=May 31, 2013|volume=5|pages=CD009041|pmid=23728685|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009041.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional intervention for an acute episode has been to have the patient breathe into a paper bag, causing [[rebreathing]] and restoration of CO₂ levels, this is not advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bergeron |first1=J. David |last2=Le Baudour |first2=Chris |title=First Responder |accessdate=|edition=8 |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-614059-7 |page=262 |chapter=Chapter 9: Caring for Medical Emergencies |quote= Do not use a paper bag in an attempt to treat hyperventilation. These patients can often be cared for with low-flow oxygen and lots of reassurance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same benefits can be obtained more safely from deliberately slowing down the breathing rate by [[counting]] or looking at the second hand on a [[watch]]. This is sometimes referred to as "7-11 breathing", because a gentle inhalation is stretched out to take 7 seconds (or counts), and the exhalation is slowed to take 11 seconds. This in-/exhalation ratio can be safely decreased to 4-12 or even 4-20 and more, as the O₂ content of the blood will easily sustain normal cell function for several minutes at rest when normal blood acidity has been restored.

It has also been suggested that breathing therapies such as the [[Buteyko method|Buteyko Breathing]] method may be effective in reducing the symptoms and recurrence of the syndrome.

Benzodiazepines can be prescribed to reduce stress that provokes hyperventilation syndrome. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can reduce the severity and frequency of hyperventilation episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyperventilation Syndrome Medication|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/807277-medication|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original traditional treatment of breathing into a paper bag to control psychologically based hyperventilation syndrome (which is now almost universally known and often shown in movies and TV dramas) was invented by New York City physician (later [[radiologist]]), Alexander Winter, M.D. [1908-1978], based on his experiences in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]] during [[World War II]] and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=A|title=A Rapid Emergency Treatment for Hyperventilation Syndrome.|journal=J Am Med Assoc|year=1951|volume=147|issue=10|pages=990|doi=10.1001/jama.1951.03670270080028|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/search?fulltext=alexander+winter+hyperventilation&amp;submit=yes&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because other medical conditions can be confused with hyperventilation, namely [[asthma]] and [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], most medical studies advise against using a paper bag since these conditions worsen when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/health/13real.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-02-09|date=2008-05-13|author=Anahad O'Connor|title= The Claim: If You’re Hyperventilating, Breathe Into a Paper Bag }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal of Travel Medicine is a peer reviewed and PubMed indexed journal for the concentration of travel medicine. Published by ISTM 6 times a year, it provides medical professionals with current research and original articles.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley Online Library, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1708-8305&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects included in previous journals are: epidemiology among traveling individuals (including members of the military, refugees, and migrants), preventative travel care, diagnosis of illnesses obtained during travel, adventure travel, expatriated individuals, self-therapy, and the impact of travelers on a host country.

== GeoSentinel ==
The GeoSentinel Network is a global surveillance network created in order to gather and share data concerning travel and tropical medicine.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSentinel, http://www.istm.org/geosentinel/surveill.html&lt;/ref&gt; The GeoSentinel Network was founded in 1995 with the support of ISTM and the United States Centers for Disease Control to identify and alert medical professionals of illnesses among travelers, immigrants, and refugees.
GeoSentinel Sites, located on five continents, participate in surveillance and monitoring of travelers to detect alarming diagnoses or atypical events. These activities allow for information sharing globally and enables health authorities to be aware of global trends in morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;The Centers for Disease Control, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-1-introduction/travel-medicine-data-collection-geosentinel-and-global-travepinet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Grants ==
In order to facilitate ongoing research in the field of travel medicine, ISTM awards Research Grants to ISTM members annually. These research grants are carefully selected by a peer-reviewed process and Research and Awards Committee.&lt;ref&gt;International Society of Travel Medicine, http://www.istm.org/WebForms/Activities/research_programs/research_grants.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The grants provide support for research to encourage travel medicine interest, and enable researchers to collect data and test hypotheses to provide opportunities for application to more substantive grants in the future.

'''The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center''' is located on the [[Idaho State University]] campus. The Center addresses topics that deal with equality issues that have an effect on the community regardless of [[sexual dimorphism]], [[gender]], or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.isu.edu/womenctr/index.shtml | title=Gender Resource Center| publisher=Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center  |year= 2012 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2008-05-17 |archiveurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
The mission statement for the Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center at Idaho State University serves as the focal point on campus for the consideration of gender issues. The mission of the Center is to increase awareness and promote open dialogue about gender through its resources and services, educational programming and support of gender-related research. In our efforts, we are especially guided by the ideal of diversity, which allows us to envision a future free of the limitations imposed by our culture's standard definitions of gender. Funded through mandatory student fees, the Center’s primary target audience is that of ISU students; the Center also welcomes the interest and participation of prospective students, ISU faculty and staff, and members of the Eastern Idaho community. &lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
The founding of the Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center originated in 1996 when members of Idaho State University Professional Women asked President Richard Bowen about establishing a women's center. As a result, Bowen appointed Dr. Janet Anderson, Dean of Student Affairs, to head a committee that would determine if a women's center was a feasible idea for Idaho State University. It was decided that a gender center was an ideal venue for Idaho State University to address women's issues on campus, however the Center was not funded at that time.

In 1998, when Anderson was preparing for her retirement, the Associated Students of ISU (ASISU) was searching for a plan to honor Anderson's service towards the university. As a result, ASISU decided that a center funded through student fees would be an ideal solution to honor Anderson. In October 1998, the Janet C. Anderson Resource Center opened in its permanent space in Gravely Hall.

In December 1999, the Center established the Project Hope Advocacy Program through a grant from the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. Following a grant renewal, the State Board of Education approved funding for a permanent, full-time advocacy position in 2004. In the spring of 2003, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare provided a grant to establish the W.I.S.E. Project, an [[HIV]] prevention program for women. Also in  the spring of 2003, the Center received funding from the Idaho Department of health and Welfare's Rape Prevention and Education Fund, which supports the Center's Project Hope graduate assistant planning programming specifically for men.

The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center has undergone many changes since its founding. On December 9, 2002, President Bowen accepted a proposal by Rebecca Morrow, to amend the Center's official name to the Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center. The word "gender" was included to more accurately describe the mission of the Center. The Center believes there should be an open and fair dialogue between both males and females to construct gender. At the Center, hard work has been implemented to make it known as a place that is open to anyone who shares in the curiosity about women's and men's lives in our society.

==Services==
The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center provides a number of services that are all geared towards constructing a better understanding of "gender" and how both men and women can affect the word "gender". The Center provides educational programming, the support of gender-related research, and resources that help individuals make important life decisions.

===Educational programming===
[[File:Walk a Mile.JPG|thumb|right|Photo from "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes", an event hosted to prevent sexual assault by males]]
[[File:Take Back the Night.JPG|thumb|Photo from "Take Back the Night", an event held at the Bannock County Courthouse]]
Each year, the Center takes part in commemorating and celebrating nationally designated months and participates in events designed to draw attention to particular gender-related issues, including:
* Heart health and Dating Violence Month (February)
* [[Women's History Month]] (March)
* [[Sexual Assault Awareness Month]] (April)
* [[Domestic Violence]] Awareness Month and [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]] (October)
* Positive Body Image Day (late February)
* [[National Coming Out Day]] (October 11)
* [[World AIDS Day]] (December 1)

The Center also hosts discussion groups and sponsors entertainment-oriented events. The Center attempts to maintain a healthy relationship with faculty and staff by giving them the opportunity to host presentations and group discussions surrounding topics such as domestic violence, sexual assault, [[stalking]], healthy relationships, and HIV/AIDS including prevention and  [[cultural diversity]].

===Support of gender-related research===
The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center sponsors lectures by nationally known figures on an irregular basis.

===Resources===
The Janet C. Anderson Gender Resource Center's library holds books, magazines, and pamphlets on a variety of gender-related topics. The library holds material that focuses on everyone no matter what their sex, sexual orientation, ethnic or cultural background, religion, abilities or age are. Materials from the library can be borrowed for a period up to a month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">A '''K-line''', or '''Knowledge-line''', is a [[mental agent]] which represents an association of a group of other mental agents found active when a subject solves a certain [[problem]] or formulates a new [[idea]]. These were first described in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s essay [[K-lines: A Theory of Memory]], published in 1980 in the journal ''Cognitive Science'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you "get an idea," or "solve a problem" ... you create what we shall call a K-line. ... When that K-line is later "activated", it reactivates ... mental agencies, creating a partial mental state "resembling the original."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/CSJarchive/1980v04/i02/p0117p0133/MAIN.PDF  Minsky's "K-lines: A Theory of Memory]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Whenever you 'get a good idea', solve a problem, or have a memorable experience, you activate a K-line to 'represent' it. A K-line is a wirelike structure that attaches itself to whichever mental agents are active when you solve a problem or have a good idea.

When you activate that K-line later, the agents attached to it are aroused, putting you into a 'mental state' much like the one you were in when you solved that problem or got that idea.  This should make it relatively easy for you to solve new, similar problems!" (1998, p. 82.)

This is a '''list of largest [[reservoir]]s in [[India]]''', including all artificial lakes with a capacity greater than or equal to {{convert|1000000|acre feet|km3|lk=in}}. In terms of number of dams, India ranks fourth after [[List of dams and reservoirs in China|China]], [[List of dams and reservoirs in the United States|USA]] and [[List of dams and reservoirs in Russia|Russia]].

[[File:Loss comic.jpg|thumb|"Loss" by Tim Buckley for the webcomic [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'']]]]
"'''Loss'''", sometimes referred to as "'''Loss.jpg'''", is a [[webcomic]] strip created in 2008 by Tim Buckley for his gaming-related webcomic [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'']]. During a storyline where the main character Ethan and his fiancée Lilah are expecting their first child, the strip—presented as a four-panel comic with no dialogue—has Ethan entering a [[hospital]], asking a receptionist for directions, talking to a doctor, and finding Lilah crying on her side in a hospital bed, implying that she had suffered a [[miscarriage]]. Buckley cited personal events in his life as inspiration for the comic. 

Since the publication of the strip, it has garnered negative reception from critics and webcomic creators, noting the shift in tone in the webcomic as an example of "[[fridging]]". It later garnered a legacy as an [[internet meme]], with edits to the strip being made by other creators.

==Background==
''Ctrl+Alt+Del'', abbreviated to "CAD", is a webcomic series by Tim Buckley. Created in October 2002, the comic focuses on characters Ethan and Lucas, and later Ethan's love interest Lilah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3145208|title=Will Strip For Games|page=2|last=Maragos|first=Nick|work=[[1UP.com]]|date=November 7, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528063739/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3145208|archivedate=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, during a storyline where Ethan and Lilah were expecting their first child, Buckley posted the strip "Loss", presented as a four-panel comic strip with no dialogue. The strip showed Ethan entering a [[hospital]] in the first panel, asking a receptionist for directions in the second, talking to a doctor in the third, and finding Lilah crying on her side in a hospital bed in the last panel, implying that she had suffered a [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="NYMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2015/11/longest-running-miscarriage-meme-on-the-web.html

He also mentioned personal experience in his life inspired the strip, mentioning  an unplanned pregnancy and miscarriage with an ex-girlfriend in college.&lt;ref name="NYMag"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Image:Krahulik Holkins, Comicon 2009.jpg|thumb|''[[Penny Arcade]]'' creators [[Mike Krahulik]] (left) and [[Jerry Holkins]] (right) criticized Tim Buckley on "Loss".]]

"Loss" was received negatively by webcomic creators and critics. During the 2008 [[Penny Arcade Expo]], creators of the event and webcomic series ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' [[Mike Krahulik]] and [[Jerry Holkins]] were asked about the strip during an interview with [[Joystiq]]. Both men criticized it, with Holkins describing Buckley as the "[[Antichrist]]", humorously citing "Loss" and its storyline as the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|first horseman of the Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/02/pax-2008-the-penny-arcade-interview/|title=PAX 2008: The Penny Arcade Interview|last=Miller|first=Ross|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=September 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902233828/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/02/pax-2008-the-penny-arcade-interview/|archivedate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]], creator of the video game review series ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'', satirically referenced ''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' in his episode on video game webcomics, where he brings up that having a story line where a character miscarries in a webcomic known for humor would be considered "an awkward tonal shift" and "hugely disrespectful" of the subject of miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/108-Webcomics|title=Webcomics|last=Croshaw|first=Ben|author-link=Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw|work=[[Zero Punctuation]]|date=July 2, 2008|accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kotaku]]'s Mike Fahey, formerly a self-declared fan of the webcomic, agreed with Croshaw's complaints, mentioning being unable to read the series like he used to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5021521/zero-punctuation-takes-on-ctrl%252Balt%252Bdel|title=Zero Punctuation Takes On Ctrl+Alt+Del|last=Fahey|first=Mike|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 2, 2008|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip has also faced criticism for being an example of "fridging", a term coined by the website [[Women in Refrigerators]] where an author uses the trauma of a female character as a [[plot device]]. Buckley later stated, in the event the situation was brought up again in the webcomic, he would do more research on the effects miscarriages have on mothers.&lt;ref name="NYMag"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Minimalist loss.png|thumb|A minimalist version of "Loss", consisting only of seven straight lines.]]
Since the strip was first published in 2008, it has become an [[internet meme]], with users from sites such as [[4chan]] and [[Tumblr]] creating edits of the strip, such as recreating it using scenes from other works such as ''[[Futurama]]'' and [[Pokémon]]. 4chan's video game board /v/ would later ban users who created new threads about these edits.&lt;ref name="NYMag"/&gt; A [[minimalist]] version of the meme involves the sequence in the same four-panel style; panel one with a single straight line, second panel with two straight lines, with the second line slightly shorter, third panel two standing lines, and the fourth panel a standing line and a horizontal line. Seeing this sequence would usually cause the reader to ask, "Is this Loss?"&lt;ref name="NYMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"/&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]''{{'s}} Brian Feldman declared it as "the Internet’s Longest-Running Miscarriage ‘Joke’".&lt;ref name="NYMag"/&gt; Aryehi Bhushan from [[student newspaper]] [[Varsity (Cambridge)|''Varsity'']] wrote about "Loss" as a meme, praising its longevity compared to other memes that have short lifespans.&lt;ref name="Varsity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/violet/13533|title=Meme-ory Lane: Loss.jpg|last=Bhushan|first=Aryehi|work=[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the podcast [[Reply All (podcast)|''Reply All'']] discussed the strip during their eightieth episode, where a variant of "Loss" was used as a joke about the results in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/80-flash|title=Flash!|work=[[Reply All (podcast)|Reply All]]|author1=Vogt, PJ|author2=Goldman, Alex|number=80|date=October 27, 2016|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2018, the tenth anniversary of "Loss", the original strip was replaced by an edit of the comic titled "Found".&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"/&gt; The difference between the two comic strips has Ethan in the last panel with a smirk on his face. A day later, the original strip was restored with no explanation for the replacement.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/one-of-the-nets-longest-running-webcomics-has-done-some-1826508119|title=One of the 'Net's Longest-Running Webcomics Has Done Something Weird to Its Most Memed Strip|last=Muncy|first=Julie|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=June 2, 2018|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Alexander from [[Polygon (website)|''Polygon'']] considered "Found" to be an acknowledgement of the status "Loss" had achieved as a meme, comparing the evolution of the strip to [[Pepe the Frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/6/17430838/ctrl-alt-del-loss-found-memes-tim-buckley|title=Ctrl+Alt+Del's 'Loss' and 'Found' comics prove artists still struggle with meme-ified work|last=Alexander|first=Julia|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the debut feature of director-editor Jeff Malmberg. It was the inspiration for ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'', a 2018 drama directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robert-zemeckis-direct-marwencol-universal-650730]"Robert Zemeckis to Direct 'Marwencol' for Universal"  "The Hollywood Reporter" hollywoodreporter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/universal-robert-zemeckis-steve-carell-pic-for-november-2018-1202403338/] "Universal Dates Robert Zemeckis-Helmed Steve Carell Pic for November 2018" variety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On April 8, 2000, Mark Hogancamp was attacked outside of a bar by five men who beat him nearly to death after he told them he was a cross-dresser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=2011-04-06 |title=In a Tiny Universe, Room to Heal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/garden/07marwencol.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After nine days in a coma and forty days in the hospital, Hogancamp was discharged with brain damage that left him little memory of his previous life. Unable to afford therapy, he creates his own by building a 1/6-scale [[World War II]]-era [[Belgian]] town in his yard and populating it with dolls representing himself, his friends, and even his attackers.  He calls that town "[[Marwencol]]," blending the names "Mark," "Wendy" and "Colleen."

Hogancamp was initially discovered by photographer David Naugle, who documented and shared his story with [[Esopus (magazine)|''Esopus'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|title=Marwencol on My Mind|last=Hogancamp|first=Mark|date=Fall 2005|website=[[Esopus (magazine)|Esopus]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511082836/http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|archive-date=2006-05-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then his work was shown in a [[New York City|New York]] [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]].

==In popular culture==
In 2013, [[Robert Zemeckis]] began work on a dramatization of the story for [[Universal Studios]] based on a script by Caroline Thompson.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt; ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'' is set to be released in December 2018, starring [[Steve Carell]] as Hogancamp.&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;

The ninth episode of the second season of Fox sitcom ''[[Raising Hope]]'' ("The Men of New Natesville") is an homage to the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-men-of-new-natesville,66147]"The Men of New Natesville" "AV Club" avclub.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spike Jonze]]-directed music video for the [[Beastie Boys]] song "[[Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win]]" was inspired by the film and Hogancamp's world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/07/02/spike-jonzes-new-beastie-boys-video-sets-course-for-marwencol/]"Spike Jonze's New Beastie Boys Video Sets Course For Marwencol" ''Bleeding Cool'' bleedingcool.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian musical group The Saint Petersburg Disco Spin Club released a track in 2011, "Marwencol".&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/filq/the-saint-petersburg-disco-spin-club-marwencol]"The Saint Petersburg Disco Spin Club - Marwencol" ''Sound Cloud'' soundcloud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Medicine in ''Star Trek''}}
'''Medicine in ''Star Trek''''' refers to the medical technologies, procedures and conditions as seen in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]].

== Medical technology ==
Since the ''Star Trek'' fictional universe takes place roughly two or three centuries in our future, medical technology is portrayed as having grown to be far more sophisticated and advanced than current technology. When confronted with medical technology from older time periods, the character often react apprehensively or skeptically to the relatively outdated modern procedures. For example, when visiting a hospital in the 1980s in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', [[Dr. McCoy]] (played by [[DeForest Kelley]]) shows disdain for his 20th century counterparts and compares their procedures to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] and the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name="thevoyagehome"&gt;''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VISOR ===
{{main|VISOR}}
[[File:Ocularimplant.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ocular implants as worn by Geordi La Forge. From ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'']]

In the series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the character [[Geordi La Forge]] (played by [[LeVar Burton]]) wears a piece of technology called a '''VISOR''' that allows him to "see" despite being [[blindness|blind]] from birth by directly sending the information into his [[brain]]. The device also gave him the ability to see in the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] and [[infrared]] spectrums. The VISOR was used as a plot device throughout multiple episodes, including one where the VISOR is used to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] La Forge&lt;ref name="mindseye"&gt;TNG [[The Mind's Eye (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Mind's Eye]]&lt;/ref&gt; and one where emanations from the VISOR caused the character [[Worf]] to shift between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s.&lt;ref name="parallels"&gt;TNG [[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the movie ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', a group of [[Klingon]]s used the VISOR to transmit the shield frequencies of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)]] to their ship, which allowed them to fatally cripple the ''Enterprise-D'' before they were destroyed.&lt;ref name="generations"&gt;''[[Star Trek Generations]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When La Forge is next seen, in the movie ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', he no longer wears his VISOR in lieu of the more innocuous-looking ocular implants.&lt;ref name="firstcontact"&gt;''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying mechanics of the VISOR (the transmission of images directly into the brain to overcome blindness) has been developed in the real world, albeit not as precisely as seen in ''[[Star Trek]]''. In 2005, a team of medical researchers at [[Stanford University]] used a combination of microchip implants behind mice retinas and goggles equipped with LED readouts and a small camera to partially restore sight enough so that the mice could distinguish sets of black and white patterns.&lt;ref name="miceeyeimplants"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Dawn|title=Scientists design 'bionic eye' that could someday help the visually disabled|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/march30/retina-033005.html|website=Stanford University|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a woman who lost her sight in a car crash had a similar procedure performed on her in [[Portugal]] which gave her the ability to see object outlines and differences in light.&lt;ref name="portugaleyesight"&gt;{{cite web | author = Ivanhoe Newswire | title = New device allows woman to see, even without eyes | work = News 14 Carolina | date = March 31, 2006 | url = http://rdu.news14.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=82612 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612230716/http://rdu.news14.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=82612| archivedate= 22 May 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypospray ===
{{main|Hypospray}}
[[File:Ped-O-Jet-TearyChild-crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A jet injector, shown here used as part of a child vaccination program.]]

The hypospray has been featured in every ''Star Trek'' series as a tool used to give injections of medications. It has been shown in the series to be able to deliver injections through clothing, and does not carry any risk of [[cross-contamination]] as opposed to modern hypodermic needles.&lt;ref name="angelone"&gt;TNG [[Angel One]]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the hypospray was developed when producers on the original ''Star Trek'' series discovered that [[NBC]]'s broadcast standards and practices prohibited the use of [[hypodermic syringe]]s to inject medications; the needleless hypospray sidestepped this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Stephen E., and [[Gene Roddenberry|Roddenberry, Gene]], ''The Making of Star Trek'', Ballantine Books, 1969, ASIN B000HYXX5S; reprinted by Titan Books Ltd., 1991, {{ISBN|1-85286-363-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypospray has a real world counterpart called a [[jet injector]], invented four years before the first ''Star Trek'' series debuted. It uses compressed air to inject the medication through the skin. However, unlike the hypospray,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} it carries the risk of cross-contamination, which has led to the jet injector falling into disuse. It also has limits for adjusting and controlling the exact dosage levels. The mechanisms used, particularly in spring-loaded designs, are one shot releases, with a coil that ejects the same amount of drug to the same depth every time, which limits the application to certain drugs or patient populations.

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved a device which uses ultrasonic waves to open pores on the skin, allowing the injection liquid to enter the bloodstream without the use of needles.&lt;ref name="sonoprep"&gt;{{cite web |author=Joel | title = Life Imitates Star Trek: SonoPrep Needle-less Injection | work = Gizmodo.com | date = September 28, 2004 | url = https://gizmodo.com/022206/life-imitates-star-trek-sonoprep-needle-less-injection | accessdate = 2007-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, MIT researchers have engineered a device that delivers a tiny, high-pressure jet of medicine through the skin without the use of a hypodermic needle. The device can be programmed to deliver a range of doses to various depths, an improvement over similar jet-injection systems commercially available. Among other benefits, the technology may help reduce the potential for needle-stick injuries. A needleless device may also help improve necessary scheduled medications among patients who might otherwise avoid the discomfort of regularly injecting themselves with drugs such as insulin. The jet-injection system delivers a range of doses to variable depths in a highly controlled manner. The design is built around a mechanism called a "Lorentz-force actuator", a small, powerful magnet surrounded by a coil of wire that’s attached to a piston inside a drug ampoule. When current is applied, it interacts with the magnetic field to produce a force that pushes the piston forward, ejecting the drug at high pressure and velocity, almost the speed of sound in air, out through the ampoule’s nozzle, an opening as wide as a mosquito sting. Through testing, the group found that various skin types may require different waveforms to deliver adequate volumes of drugs to the desired depth. For example, breaching a baby’s skin to deliver vaccine will not need as much pressure as adult skin, allowing doctors to tailor the pressure profile.

The team is also developing a version of the device for transdermal delivery of drugs ordinarily found in powdered form by programming the device to vibrate, turning powder into a “fluidized” form that can be delivered through the skin much like a liquid. A powder-delivery vehicle may help solve what’s known as the “cold-chain” problem: Vaccines delivered to developing countries need to be refrigerated if they are in liquid form. Often, coolers break down, spoiling whole batches of vaccines. Instead, Hunter says a vaccine that can be administered in powder form requires no cooling, avoiding the cold-chain problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/needleless-injections-0524.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency Medical Hologram==
{{main|Emergency Medical Hologram}}
For the television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' an emergency medical hologram, [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Doctor]], was introduced. It was designed to be an expert on all fields of medicine, able to do anything any organic doctor could do.

'''[[Muzzle (firearms)|Muzzle]]-Action-[[trigger (firearms)|trigger]]''' often used in the US [[military]] and [[ROTC]] [[rifle]] programs. The steps are defined as: 

1) '''Muzzle''' - Keep your muzzle under control on and off the range even if it's not loaded or armed. Keep your muzzle free of obstructions and dirt.&lt;br /&gt; 
2) '''Action''' - Check to see if the bolt is pulled back into the unarmed position, make sure there is no [[ammunition]] inside, check for a CBI (see also clear [[barrel]] indicator C.B.I.). Make sure that the bolt area is clean of debris and that there is no ammunition in it. &lt;br /&gt;
3) '''Trigger''' - KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU'RE AT THE FIRING POSITION AND READY TO FIRE even with safety. Remember safety is no accident. Remember to report all problems and safety issues to you range master. Also remember that YOU are a safety officer! only you can prevent accidents if you see an unsafe action yell "CEASE FIRE!"

'''Natural farming''' is an [[ecological farming]] approach established by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] (1913–2008), a Japanese [[farmer]] and philosopher, introduced in his 1975 book ''[[The One-Straw Revolution]]''. Fukuoka described his way of farming as {{Eigo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref name="One–Straw_Translator's_Notes"&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as "the Fukuoka Method", "the natural way of farming" or "do-nothing farming". The title refers not to lack of effort, but to the avoidance of manufactured inputs and equipment. Natural farming is related to fertility farming, [[organic farming]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[agroecology]], [[agroforestry]], [[ecoagriculture]] and [[permaculture]], but should be distinguished from [[biodynamic agriculture]].

The system works along with the natural biodiversity of each farmed area, encouraging the complexity of living organisms—both plant and animal—that shape each particular ecosystem to thrive along with food plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/life-and-death/|title=Life and Death in the Field {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuoka saw farming both as a means of producing food and as an aesthetic or spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was, "the cultivation and perfection of human beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.08.001| title = Linking foresight and sustainability: An integral approach| journal = Futures| volume = 42| pages = 59| year = 2010| last1 = Floyd | first1 = J. | last2 = Zubevich | first2 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agriculture: A Fundamental Principle |last=Hanley |first=Paul |journal=Journal of Bahá’í Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1990 |url=https://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327202848/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that farmers could benefit from closely observing local conditions.&lt;ref name="Duncan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Adrien MacKinley Duncan|title=The Centrality of Agriculture: Between Humankind and the Rest of Nature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=c0ZcTTXw9a8C}}|year=1996|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural farming is a closed system, one that demands no human-supplied inputs and mimics nature.&lt;ref&gt;Trees on Organic Farms, Mirret, Erin Paige. North Carolina State University, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka's ideas radically challenged conventions that are core to modern agro-industries; instead of promoting importation of nutrients and chemicals, he suggested an approach that takes advantage of the local environment.&lt;ref name="stock and morse"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Morse|author2=Michael Stockin|title=People and Environment: Development for the Future|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nPeHlOh0y_UC}}|year=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-85728-283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural farming is considered a subset of organic farming, it differs greatly from conventional [[organic farming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Participating in Nature: Thomas J. Elpel's Field Guide to Primitive Living Skills |last=Elpel |first=Thomas J. |date=November 1, 2002 |isbn=1892784122}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Fukuoka considered to be another modern technique that disturbs nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf  What Does Natural Farming Mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720070520/http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} by Toyoda, Natsuko&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka claimed that his approach prevents [[water pollution]], [[biodiversity loss]] and [[soil erosion]], while providing ample amounts of food.&lt;ref name="Reddystudies2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Priya Reddy|author2=Prescott College Environmental studies|title=Sustainable Agricultural Education: An Experiential Approach to Shifting Consciousness and Practices|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=dtE8MwEACAAJ}}|year=2010|publisher=Prescott College|isbn=978-1-124-38302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fukuoka's principles ==

In principal, practitioners of natural farming maintain that it is not a ''technique'' but a ''view'', or a way of seeing ourselves as a [[Nature connectedness|part of nature]], rather than separate from or above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/masanobu-fukuoka-and-natural-farming/|title=Masanobu Fukuoka and Natural Farming {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the methods themselves vary widely depending on culture and local conditions.

Rather than offering a structured method, Fukuoka distilled the natural farming mindset into five principles:&lt;ref name="Norberg-HodgeGoering2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helena Norberg-Hodge|author2=Peter Goering|author3=John Page|title=From the Ground Up: Rethinking Industrial Agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4sQTjNulnQC|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# No [[tillage]]
# No [[fertilizer]]
# No [[pesticide]]s or [[herbicide]]s

Though many of his plant varieties and practices relate specifically to Japan and even to local conditions in [[Humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] western [[Shikoku]], his philosophy and the governing principles of his farming systems have been applied widely around the world, from Africa to the [[temperate]] northern hemisphere.

Principally, natural farming minimises human labour and adopts, as closely as practical, nature's production of foods such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[daikon]] or [[citrus]] in biodiverse agricultural [[ecosystem]]s. Without [[plow]]ing, [[seeds]] [[germination|germinate]] well on the surface if site conditions meet the needs of the seeds placed there. Fukuoka used the presence of [[spiders]] in his fields as a [[key performance indicator]] of [[sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Fukuoka specifies that the ground remain covered by [[weed]]s, [[white clover]], [[alfalfa]], [[herbaceous]] [[legume]]s, and sometimes deliberately sown [[herbaceous plant]]s. [[Ground cover]] is present along with grain, vegetable crops and [[orchards]]. Chickens run free in orchards and [[ducks]] and [[carp]] populate rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically ground layer plants including weeds may be cut and left on the surface, returning their nutrients to the soil, while suppressing weed growth. This also facilitates the sowing of seeds in the same area because the dense ground layer hides the seeds from animals such as birds.

For summer rice and winter barley grain crops, ground cover enhances [[nitrogen fixation]]. [[Straw]] from the previous crop [[mulch]]es the [[topsoil]]. Each grain crop is sown before the previous one is harvested by [[broadcast seeding|broadcasting]] the seed among the standing crop. Later, this method was reduced to a single direct seeding of clover, barley and rice over the standing heads of rice.&lt;ref name="Fukuoka1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masanobu Fukuoka|title=The Natural Way of Farming: The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy|url={{google books|plainurl=y |id=L3M_AAAAYAAJ}}|year=1987|publisher=Japan Publications|isbn=978-0-87040-613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a denser crop of smaller, but highly productive and stronger plants.

Fukuoka's practice and philosophy emphasised small scale operation and challenged the need for mechanised farming techniques for high productivity, efficiency and economies of scale.  While his family's farm was larger than the Japanese average, he used one field of grain crops as a small-scale example of his system.

== Yoshikazu Kawaguchi ==
[[File:Natural farmer Yoshikazu Kawaguchi.jpg|thumb|Yoshikazu Kawaguchi at Akame Natural Farm School]]
Widely regarded as the leading practitioner of the second-generation of natural farmers, [[Yoshikazu Kawaguchi]] is the instigator of Akame Natural Farm School, and a related network of volunteer-based "no-tuition" natural farming schools in Japan that numbers 40 locations and more than 900 concurrent students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=(Japan))|first=Hokazono, S.(Mie Univ., Tsu|last2=K.|first2=Ohara,|date=2007-01-01|title=The role of a learning site for urban residents hoping to do farming: Focusing on the spread of 'natural farming' by the Akame Natural Farming School|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=JP2008004433|journal=Journal of Rural Problems (Japan)|language=Japanese|issn=0388-8525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kawaguchi's practice is based on Fukuoka's principals, his methods differ notably from those of Fukuoka. He re-states the core values of natural farming as:

# Do not plow the fields
# Weeds and insects are not your enemies
# There is no need to add fertilizers
# Adjust the foods you grow based on your local climate and conditions

Kawaguchi's recognition outside of Japan has become wider after his appearance as the central character in the documentary ''[[Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness]]'', through which his interviews were translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org|title=Final Straw – Food - Earth - Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of several books in Japan, though none have been officially translated into English.

Since 2016, Kawaguchi is no longer directly instructing at the Akame school which he founded. He is still actively teaching however, holding open farm days at his own natural farm in Nara prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37510039_Body_and_Earth_Are_Not_Two_Kawaguchi_Yoshikazu's_NATURAL_FARMING_and_American_Agriculture_Writers |title='Body and Earth Are Not Two': Kawaguchi Yoshikazu's NATURAL FARMING and American Agriculture Writers|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climax ecosystems ==

In [[ecology]], [[climax ecosystem]]s are mature ecosystems that have reached a high degree of stability, productivity and diversity (see [[old-growth forest]]). Natural farmers attempt to mimic those virtues, creating a comparable climax ecosystem, and employ advanced techniques such as [[intercropping]], [[companion planting]] and [[integrated pest management]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== No-till ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

Natural farming recognizes soils as a fundamental natural asset. Ancient soils possess physical and chemical attributes that render them capable of generating and supporting life abundance. It can be argued that tilling actually degrades the delicate balance of a climax soil:

# Tilling may destroy crucial physical characteristics of a soil such as ''[[water potential|water suction]]'', its ability to send moisture upwards, even during dry spells. The effect is due to pressure differences between soil areas. Furthermore, tilling most certainly destroys [[soil horizon]]s and hence disrupts the established flow of nutrients. A study suggests that reduced tillage preserves the crop residues on the top of the soil, allowing organic matter to be formed more easily and hence increasing the total organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to conventional tillage. The increases in organic carbon and nitrogen increase aerobic, facultative anaerobic and [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Principles and Applications of Soil Microbiology| last1=Sylvia |first1=D.M. |last2=Fuhrmann |first2=J.J. |last3=Hartel |first3=P.G. |last4=Zuberer |first4=D.A.| publisher=Prentice Hall| location=New Jersey| year=1999| ISBN=0130941174| pages=39–41 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tLjwAAAAMAAJ|p=39}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tilling over-pumps oxygen to local soil residents, such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. As a result, the chemistry of the soil changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the [[microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]] mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil.
# Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen.&lt;!-- just oxygen? --&gt; They also create room for beneficial [[insect]]s and [[annelid]]s (the phylum of [[worm]]s). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the [[rhizobium]]) that can fix nitrogen.

Fukuoka advocated avoiding any change in the [[natural landscape]]. This idea differs significantly from some recent permaculture practice that focuses on permaculture design, which may involve the change in landscape. For example, [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture farmer, advocates the creation of terraces on slopes to control soil erosion. Fukuoka avoided the creation of terraces in his farm, even though terraces were common in China and Japan in his time. Instead, he prevented soil erosion by simply growing trees and shrubs on slopes.

== Variants of natural farming ==
[[File:P-14 lady beetle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ladybird]]s consume [[aphid]]s and are considered beneficial by natural farmers that apply [[biological control]].]]Although the term "natural farming" came into common use in the English language during the 1980s with the translation of the book ''One Straw Revolution'', the natural farming mindset itself has a long history throughout the world, spanning from historical Native American practices to modern day urban farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenatureofcities.com/2015/09/16/a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=Lydon|first=Patrick|date=2015-09-16|website=The Nature of Cities|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociecity.org/post/2015/urban-empathy-garden/|title=Artwork / Urban Empathy Garden {{!}} SocieCity|website=sociecity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.1525/j.ctt1ppfn4|title=Tending the Wild: Native American Knowledge and the Management of California's Natural Resources|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

Some variants, and their particularities include:

=== Fertility farming ===

In 1951, [[Frank Newman Turner|Newman Turner]] advocated the practice of "fertility farming", a system featuring the use of a cover crop, no tillage, no chemical fertilizers, no pesticides, no weeding and no composting. Although Turner was a commercial farmer and did not practice random seeding of [[seed balls]], his "fertility farming" principles share similarities with Fukuoka's system of natural farming. Turner also advocate a "natural method" of [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Newman Turner| title=Fertility Farming| ISBN=978-1601730091| year=1951| publisher=Faber and Faber Limited| url=http://www.journeytoforever.org/farm_library/turner/turnerToC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native American ===
Recent research in the field of [[traditional ecological knowledge]] finds that for over one hundred centuries, Native American tribes worked the land in strikingly similar ways to today's natural farmers. Author and researcher M. Kat Anderson writes that "According to contemporary Native Americans, it is only through interaction and relationships with native plants that mutual respect is established."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nature Farming (Mokichi Okada) ===
Japanese farmer and philosopher [[Mokichi Okada]], conceived of a "no fertilizer" farming system in the 1930s that predated Fukuoka. Okada used the same [[Chinese characters]] as Fukuoka's "natural farming" however, they are translated into English slightly differently, as [[nature farming]].&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|publisher=Research Signpost|year=2001 |location=T. C. 37/661(2), Fort Post Office, Trivandrum - 695023, Kerala, India |type=Monograph|isbn=81-308-0111-6 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture researcher Hu-lian Xu claims that "nature farming" is the correct literal translation of the Japanese term.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1" /&gt;

=== Rishi Kheti ===
In [[India]], natural farming is often referred to as "Rishi Kheti", a practice which includes ancient [[Vedic]] principles of farming including use of animal waste and herbs for controlling pests and promoting growth.&lt;ref name="Mr. Fukuoka news article 2010 Mumbai India"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report_masanobu-fukuoka-the-man-who-did-nothing_1426864 "Masanobu Fukuoka: The man who did nothing By Malvika Tegta"] "DNA Daily News and Analysis". "Published: Sunday, Aug 22, 2010, 2:59 IST". "Place: Mumbai", India. (Retrieved 1 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature Farmers-India Rishi Keti"&gt;[http://www.satavic.org/rishikheti.htm "Natural farming succeeds in Indian village By Partap C Aggarwal" in the 1980s] [http://www.satavic.org/media.htm ''Satavic Farms''] (India), "Slowly, bit by bit, we found ourselves close to what is called ‘natural farming’, pioneered in Japan by Masanobu Fukuoka. At Rasulia we called it 'rishi kheti' (agriculture of the sages)."&lt;/ref&gt; The rishi or Indian sages use cow products like buttermilk, milk, curd and its waste urine for preparing growth promoters. The Rishi or Vedic farming is regarded as non-violent farming without any usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. They obtain high quality natural or organic produce having medicinal values. Today still a small number of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu use this farming method in India.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Zero Budget Farming===
Zero Budget Farming is a variation on natural farming developed in, and primarily practiced in southern India.It also called spiritual farming .The method involves [[mulching]], [[intercropping]], and the use of several preparations which include [[cow dung]]. These preparations, generated on-site, are central to the practice, and said to promote microbe and earthworm activity in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Budget Natural Farming in India|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-bl990e.pdf|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian agriculturist [[Subhash Palekar]] has researched and written extensively on this method.

Ringe 1995 {{ISBN|0-664-25259-1}} page 195&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Matthew's Gospel]], the parallel passage to Luke's Parable of the Great Banquet is also set as a wedding feast ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#22:1|Matthew 22:1-14]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aland, Kurt, ed.

In New Testament times, a [[wedding]] was a very sacred and joyous thing. Some even lasted up to or more than a week. When Jesus told this parable, many people were able to understand the picture he was trying to create because he used a [[Jewish Wedding]] as the setting of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauckham|first=Richard|title=The Parable of the Royal Wedding Feast (Matthew 22:1-14) and the Parable of the Lame Man and the Blind Man (Apocryphon of Ezekiel)|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|date=Autumn 1996|volume= 115|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke 14:11 says "Every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted"; this saying is also found in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#18:14|Luke 18:14]] and  [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#23:12|Matthew 23:12]]. It is similar to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#18:4|Matthew 18:4]].&lt;ref name=Ringe /&gt;

==Narrative==
{{quotation|He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them, “When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don’t sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,   and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person’. Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

He also said to the one who had invited him, “When you make a dinner or a supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back. But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; and you will be blessed, because they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.”
|Luke 14:7–14, [[World English Bible]]}}

[[File:Phage.jpg|thumb|An [[electron micrograph]] of bacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell. These viruses are the size and shape of coliphage T1.]]

'''Phage therapy''' or '''viral phage therapy''' is the [[therapeutic]] use of [[bacteriophage]]s to treat [[pathogenic]] [[bacterial infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Kohn" /&gt; Phage therapy has many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry, veterinary science, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="McAuliffe" /&gt; If the target [[host (biology)|host]] of a phage therapy treatment is not an animal, the term "[[biocontrol]]" (as in phage-mediated biocontrol of bacteria) is usually employed, rather than "phage therapy".

Bacteriophages are much more specific than [[antibiotics]]. They are typically harmless not only to the host [[organism]], but also to other beneficial bacteria, such as the [[gut flora]], reducing the chances of [[opportunistic infection]]s.&lt;ref name="phage"/&gt; They have a high [[therapeutic index]], that is, phage therapy would be expected to give rise to few [[adverse effect|side effects]]. Because phages replicate ''[[in vivo]]'' (in cells of living organism), a smaller effective dose can be used. On the other hand, this specificity is also a disadvantage: a phage will only kill a bacterium if it is a match to the specific [[strain (biology)|strain]]. Consequently, phage mixtures are often applied to improve the chances of success, or samples can be taken and appropriate phages identified and grown.

Phages tend to be more successful than antibiotics where there is a biofilm covered by a polysaccharide layer, which antibiotics typically cannot penetrate.&lt;ref name="LabNews" /&gt; In the West, no therapies are currently authorized for use on humans.&lt;ref name="pmid11052592"/&gt;

Phages are currently being used therapeutically to treat bacterial infections that do not respond to conventional antibiotics, particularly in [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="Eaters of bacteria: Is phage therapy ready for the big time?" /&gt; and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15986542" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thiel" /&gt; There is also a phage therapy unit in [[Wrocław]], Poland, established 2005, the only such centre in a European Union country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitd.pan.wroc.pl/en/clinphage2015|title=IITD PAN Wrocław -|website=www.iitd.pan.wroc.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Twort.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick Twort]]]]
[[File:Bacillus anthracis Lyse.jpg|thumb|Phage in action on cultured ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.]]

The discovery of bacteriophages was reported by the Englishman [[Frederick Twort]] in 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)20383-3 |title=An investigation on the nature of ultra-microscopic viruses |journal=The Lancet |volume=186 |issue=4814 |pages=1241–1243 |year=1915 |last1=Twort |first1=F.W. |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858021447929;view=1up;seq=513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French-Canadian [[Felix d'Hérelle]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = D'Herelle F |title=Sur un microbe invisible antagoniste des bacilles dysenteriques|journal=Comptes Rendus|date=1917|volume=165|pages=373–375|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31787#page/379/mode/1up|trans-title=An invisible microbe that is antagonistic to the dysentery bacillus|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15143702" /&gt; D'Hérelle said that the phages always appeared in the stools of ''[[Shigella]]'' dysentery patients shortly before they began to recover.&lt;ref name="Häusler" /&gt; He "quickly learned that bacteriophages are found wherever bacteria thrive: in sewers, in rivers that catch waste runoff from pipes, and in the stools of convalescent patients".&lt;ref name="Kuchment" /&gt; Phage therapy was immediately recognized by many to be a key way forward for the eradication of pathogenic bacterial infections. A Georgian, [[George Eliava]], was making similar discoveries. He travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris where he met d'Hérelle, and in 1923 he founded the [[Eliava Institute]] in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], devoted to the development of phage therapy. Phage therapy is used in Russia, Georgia and Poland.

In Russia, extensive research and development soon began in this field. In the United States during the 1940s commercialization of phage therapy was undertaken by [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

While knowledge was being accumulated regarding the biology of phages and how to use phage cocktails correctly, early uses of phage therapy were often unreliable.&lt;ref name="Kutter" /&gt; Since the early 20th century, research into the development of viable therapeutic [[antibiotics]] had also been underway, and by 1942 the antibiotic [[penicillin G]] had been successfully purified and saw use during the Second World War. The drug proved to be extraordinarily effective in the treatment of injured Allied soldiers whose wounds had become infected. By 1944, large-scale production of Penicillin had been made possible, and in 1945 it became publicly available in pharmacies. Due to the drug's success, it was marketed widely in the U.S. and Europe, leading Western scientists to mostly lose interest in further use and study of phage therapy for some time.&lt;ref name="pmid17566713" /&gt;

Isolated from Western advances in antibiotic production in the 1940s, Russian scientists continued to develop already successful phage therapy to treat the wounds of soldiers in [[field hospital]]s. During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union used bacteriophages to treat many soldiers infected with various bacterial diseases e.g. dysentery and gangrene. Russian researchers continued to develop and to refine their treatments and to publish their research and results. However, due to the scientific barriers of the [[Cold War]], this knowledge was not translated and did not proliferate across the world.&lt;ref name="Science-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11544363" /&gt; A summary of these publications was published in English in 2009 in "A Literature Review of the Practical Application of Bacteriophage Research".&lt;ref name="Chanishvili" /&gt;

There is an extensive library and research center at the [[George Eliava Institute]] in Tbilisi, Georgia. Phage therapy is today a widespread form of treatment in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Kuchment, Anna (2011); Häusler, Thomas (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the development of [[antibiotic resistance]] since the 1950s and an advancement of scientific knowledge, there has been renewed interest worldwide in the ability of phage therapy to eradicate bacterial infections and chronic polymicrobial [[biofilm]] (including in industrial situations&lt;ref name="kera" /&gt;).

Phages have been investigated as a potential means to eliminate pathogens like ''[[Campylobacter]]'' in raw food&lt;ref name="pmid17958494" /&gt; and ''[[Listeria]]'' in fresh food or to reduce food spoilage bacteria.&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt; In agricultural practice phages were used to fight pathogens like ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' in farm animals, ''[[Lactococcus]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' pathogens in fish from aquaculture and ''[[Erwinia]]'' and ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' in plants of agricultural importance. The oldest use was, however, in human medicine. Phages have been used against diarrheal diseases caused by ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'' or ''[[Vibrio]]'' and against wound infections caused by facultative pathogens of the skin like [[staphylococci]] and [[streptococci]]. Recently the phage therapy approach has been applied to systemic and even intracellular infections and the addition of non-replicating phage and isolated phage enzymes like [[lysins]] to the antimicrobial arsenal. However, actual proof for the [[efficacy]] of these phage approaches in the field or the hospital is not available.&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt;

Some of the interest in the West can be traced back to 1994, when Soothill demonstrated (in an animal model) that the use of phages could improve the success of skin grafts by reducing the underlying ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' infection.&lt;ref name="pmid8054131" /&gt; Recent studies have provided additional support for these findings in the model system.&lt;ref name="pmid17387151" /&gt;

Although not "phage therapy" in the original sense, the use of phages as delivery mechanisms for traditional antibiotics constitutes another possible therapeutic use.&lt;ref name="pmid17404004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16723570" /&gt; The use of phages to deliver [[antitumor]] agents has also been described in preliminary ''in vitro'' experiments for cells in tissue culture.&lt;ref name="pmid18387177" /&gt;

In June 2015 the European Medicines Agency hosted a one-day workshop on the therapeutic use of bacteriophages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/events/2015/05/event_detail_001155.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c3|title=European Medicines Agency – News and Events – Workshop on the therapeutic use of bacteriophages|website=www.ema.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2015 the National Institutes of Health (USA) hosted a two-day workshop "Bacteriophage Therapy: An Alternative Strategy to Combat Drug Resistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://respond.niaid.nih.gov/conferences/bacteriophage/Pages/Agenda.aspx|title=Bacteriophage Therapy: An Alternative Strategy to Combat Drug Resistance|website=respond.niaid.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==
[[File:Phage Therapy.svg|thumb|Phage therapy is the use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections. This could be used as an alternative to antibiotics when bacteria develops resistance. Superbugs that are immune to multiple types of drugs are becoming a concern with the more frequent use of antibiotics. Phages can target these dangerous microbes without harming human cells due to how specific they are.]]
Bacteriophage treatment offers a possible alternative to conventional [[antibiotic]] treatments for bacterial infection.&lt;ref name="pmid19649921" /&gt; It is conceivable that, although bacteria can develop resistance to phage, the resistance might be easier to overcome than resistance to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="phagetherapycenter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cienciaviva.eu/rede/oceanos/2desafio/visaogeral.pdf|title=Phage Therapy: Past History and Future Prospects }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as bacteria can evolve resistance, viruses can evolve to overcome resistance.&lt;ref name="Abedon" /&gt;

Bacteriophages are very specific, targeting only one or a few strains of bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid11909002" /&gt; Traditional antibiotics have more wide-ranging effect, killing both harmful bacteria and useful bacteria such as those facilitating food digestion. The species and strain specificity of bacteriophages makes it unlikely that harmless or useful bacteria will be killed when fighting an infection.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

A few research groups in the West are engineering a broader spectrum phage, and also a variety of forms of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] treatments, including impregnated wound dressings, preventative treatment for burn victims, phage-impregnated sutures.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Enzybiotics]] are a new development at Rockefeller University that create enzymes from phage. Purified recombinant phage enzymes can be used as separate antibacterial agents in their own right.&lt;ref name="pmid16565432" /&gt;

Phage Therapy also has the potential of preventing or treating infectious [[Coral disease|diseases]] of [[coral]]s. This could assist with decline of coral around the world.&lt;ref name="Efrony_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Efrony R, Atad I, Rosenberg E | title = Phage therapy of coral white plague disease: properties of phage BA3 | journal = Current Microbiology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–45 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 18923867 | doi = 10.1007/s00284-008-9290-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Collection ===
The simplest method of phage treatment involves collecting local samples of water likely to contain high quantities of bacteria and bacteriophages, for example [[effluent]] outlets, [[sewage]] and other sources.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt; The samples are taken and applied to the bacteria that are to be destroyed which have been cultured on growth medium.

If the bacteria die, as usually happens, the mixture is centrifuged; the phages collect on the top of the mixture and can be drawn off.

The phage solutions are then tested to see which ones show growth suppression effects (lysogeny) or destruction (lysis) of the target bacteria. The phage showing lysis are then amplified on cultures of the target bacteria, passed through a filter to remove all but the phages, then distributed.

=== Treatment ===

Phages are "bacterium-specific" and it is therefore necessary in many cases to take a swab from the patient and culture it prior to treatment. Occasionally, isolation of therapeutic phages can require a few months to complete, but clinics generally keep supplies of phage cocktails for the most common bacterial strains in a geographical area.

Phage cocktails are sold in pharmacies in eastern countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCallin S, Alam Sarker S, Barretto C, Sultana S, Berger B, Huq S, Krause L, Bibiloni R, Schmitt B, Reuteler G, Brüssow H | title = Safety analysis of a Russian phage cocktail: from metagenomic analysis to oral application in healthy human subjects | journal = Virology | volume = 443 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–96 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23755967 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2013.05.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abedon ST, Kuhl SJ, Blasdel BG, Kutter EM | title = Phage treatment of human infections | journal = Bacteriophage | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 66–85 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 22334863 | pmc = 3278644 | doi = 10.4161/bact.1.2.15845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of bacteriophagics cocktails has been periodically modified to add phages effective against emerging pathogenic strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarroel J, Larsen MV, Kilstrup M, Nielsen M | title = Metagenomic Analysis of Therapeutic PYO Phage Cocktails from 1997 to 2014 | journal = Viruses | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 328 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29099783 | pmc = 5707535 | doi = 10.3390/v9110328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phages in practice are applied orally, topically on infected wounds or spread onto surfaces, or used during surgical procedures. Injection is rarely used, avoiding any risks of trace chemical contaminants that may be present from the bacteria amplification stage, and recognizing that the immune system naturally fights against viruses introduced into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

In 2007 a Phase 1/2 clinical trial was completed at the [[Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital]], London, for ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' infections ([[otitis]]).&lt;ref name="Press and News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STVdoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biocontrol-2" /&gt; Documentation of the Phase-1/Phase-2 study was published in August 2009 in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

Phase 1 clinical trials have now been completed in the Southwest Regional Wound Care Center, Lubbock, Texas for an approved cocktail of phages against bacteria, including ''P. aeruginosa'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (better known as ''E. coli'').&lt;ref name="Rhoads" /&gt; The cocktail of phages for the clinical trials was developed and supplied by [[Intralytix]].

Reviews of phage therapy indicate that more clinical and microbiological research is needed to meet current standards.&lt;ref name="Brüssow" /&gt;

=== Administration ===

Phages can usually be freeze-dried and turned into pills without materially reducing efficiency.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt; Temperature stability up to 55&amp;nbsp;°C and shelf lives of 14 months have been shown for some types of phages in pill form.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;

Application in liquid form is possible, stored preferably in refrigerated vials.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;

Oral administration works better when an [[antacid]] is included, as this increases the number of phages surviving passage through the stomach.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;

Topical administration often involves application to gauzes that are laid on the area to be treated.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;

IV phage drip therapy was successfully used to treat a patient with [[Multiple drug resistance|MDR]] ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' in [[Thornton Hospital]] at [[UC San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx|title=Novel Phage Therapy Saves Patient with Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infection – UC San Diego Health|date=25 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
{{criticism section|date=May 2015}}

The high bacterial strain specificity of phage therapy may make it necessary for clinics to make different cocktails for treatment of the same infection or disease because the bacterial components of such diseases may differ from region to region or even person to person. In addition, this means that 'banks' containing many different phages must be kept and regularly updated with new phages.&lt;ref name="phage" /&gt;

Further, bacteria can evolve different receptors either before or during treatment; this can prevent phages from completely eradicating bacteria for as bacteria evolves, bacteriophages must evolve as well to keep up with the ever changing bacteria. In the case all bacteria is eliminated, the specific phage might evolve and attack good bacteria in the specific area of injection.&lt;ref name="horizon" /&gt;

The need for banks of phages makes regulatory testing for safety harder and more expensive under current rules in most countries. Such a process would make difficult the large-scale use of phage therapy. Additionally, [[patent]] issues (specifically on living organisms) may complicate distribution for pharmaceutical companies wishing to have exclusive rights over their "invention", which would discourage a commercial corporation from investing capital in this.

As has been known for at least thirty years, [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' have specific bacteriophages.&lt;ref name="Hatfull" /&gt; No [[Lytic cycle|lytic]] phage has yet been discovered for ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', which is responsible for many [[nosocomial infection|nosocomial diseases]], but some ''[[temperate phage]]s'' (integrated in the genome, also called [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic]]) are known for this species; this opens encouraging avenues but with additional risks as discussed below.

Funding for phage therapy research and clinical trials is generally insufficient and difficult to obtain, since it is a lengthy and complex process to patent bacteriophage products. Scientists comment that 'the biggest hurdle is regulatory', whereas an official view is that individual phages would need proof individually because it would be too complicated to do as a combination, with many variables. Due to the specificity of phages, phage therapy would be most effective with a cocktail injection, which is generally rejected by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Researchers and observers predict that for phage therapy to be successful the FDA must change its regulatory stance on combination drug cocktails.&lt;ref name="phage" /&gt; Public awareness and education about phage therapy are generally limited to scientific or independent research rather than mainstream media.&lt;ref name="Brüssow-2" /&gt;

The negative public perception of viruses may also play a role in the reluctance to embrace phage therapy.&lt;ref name="pmid17927471" /&gt;

== Legislation ==

Approval of phage therapy for use in humans has not been given in Western countries with a few exceptions. In the United States, Washington and Oregon law allows [[Naturopathy|naturopathic physicians]] to use any therapy that is legal any place in the world on an experimental basis,&lt;ref name="Faltys" /&gt; and in Texas phages are considered natural substances and can be used in addition to (but not as a replacement for) traditional therapy (they have been used routinely in a wound care clinic in Lubbock, TX, since 2006).&lt;ref name="Kuchment-2" /&gt;

In 2013 "the 20th biennial Evergreen International Phage Meeting ... conference drew 170 participants from 35 countries, including leaders of companies and institutes involved with human phage therapies from France, Australia, Georgia, Poland and the United States."&lt;ref name="Evergreen-2013" /&gt;

=== Safety ===

Much of the difficulty in obtaining regulatory approval is proving to be the risks of using a self-replicating entity which has the capability to evolve.&lt;ref name="kera" /&gt;

As with antibiotic therapy and other methods of countering bacterial infections, [[endotoxin]]s are released by the bacteria as they are destroyed within the patient ([[Herxheimer reaction]]). This can cause symptoms of fever; in extreme cases [[toxic shock]] (a problem also seen with antibiotics) is possible.&lt;ref name="Evergreen-2" /&gt; Janakiraman Ramachandran&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; argues that this complication can be avoided in those types of infection where this reaction is likely to occur by using [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] bacteriophages which have had their gene responsible for producing endolysin removed. Without this gene the host bacterium still dies but remains intact because the lysis is disabled. On the other hand, this modification stops the exponential growth of phages, so one administered phage means one dead bacterial cell.&lt;ref name="Thiel" /&gt; Eventually these dead cells are consumed by the normal house-cleaning duties of the [[Phagocytosis|phagocytes]], which utilise enzymes to break down the whole bacterium and its contents into harmless proteins, polysaccharides and lipids.&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt;

[[Temperate phage|Temperate]] (or [[Lysogeny|Lysogenic]]) bacteriophages are not generally used therapeutically, as this group can act as a way for bacteria to exchange DNA; this can help spread [[antibiotic resistance]] or even, theoretically, make the bacteria pathogenic (see [[Cholera]]). Carl Merril claimed that harmless strains of [[corynebacterium]] may have been converted into [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae|''C. diphtheriae'']] that "probably killed a third of all Europeans who came to North America in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref name="Kuchment-3" /&gt; Fortunately, many phages seem to be [[Lytic cycle|lytic only]] with negligible probability of becoming [[lysogenic]].&lt;ref name="Kuchment-4" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

[[Brigham Young University]] has been researching the use of phage therapy to treat [[American foulbrood]] in [[honeybees]].&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;&lt;ref name="byu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://universe.byu.edu/2016/05/06/byus-bee-team-successfully-treats-honeybee-loss1/ |title=BYU's bee team successfully treats honeybee loss |last=Stolworthy |first= Lauren |date= May 6, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date=September 24, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phage therapy is also being investigated for potential applications in [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name="Richards2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards GP | title = Bacteriophage remediation of bacterial pathogens in aquaculture: a review of the technology | journal = Bacteriophage | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = e975540 | year = 2014 | pmid = 26713223 | pmc = 4590005 | doi = 10.4161/21597081.2014.975540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural impact ==

The 1925 novel and 1926 Pulitzer prize winner ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'' used phage therapy as a plot point.&lt;ref name="pmid1918921" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phage Findings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SparkNotes: Arrowsmith: Chapters 31–33" /&gt;

[[Greg Bear]]'s 2002 novel ''[[Vitals (novel)|Vitals]]'' features phage therapy, based on Soviet research, used to transfer genetic material.

The 2012 collection of military history essays about the changing role of women in warfare, "Women in War – from home front to front line" includes a chapter featuring phage therapy: "Chapter 17: Women who thawed the Cold War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/churchill-bulletin/bulletin-048-jun-2012/churchill-the-wartime-feminist/|title=Churchill the Wartime Feminist|date=3 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homemade pooper-scooper.jpg|thumb|A homemade pooper-scooper]]
A '''pooper-scooper''', or '''poop scoop''', is a device used to pick up animal feces from public places and yards, particularly those of dogs. Pooper-scooper devices often have a bag or bag attachment.  'Poop bags' are alternatives to pooper scoopers, and are simply a bag, usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. Sometimes, the person performing the cleanup is also known as the pooper-scooper.

==History==
The invention is credited to Brooke Miller, of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. The design she [[patent|patented]] is a metal bin with a rake-like edge attached to a wooden stick. It also includes a rake-like device to scoop the poop into the scooper and a hatch that can be attached to a garbage bag that fits onto the base. The generic term ''pooper-scooper'' has been included in [[dictionary|dictionaries]] since the early 1970s.

==Legislation==
A number of jurisdictions, including [[New York City]], have laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog, cat or other animal shall not permit the animal to commit a nuisance on a sidewalk of any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care &amp; Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets.&lt;!-- Consolidated 2 references into 1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1)

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such laws are often nicknamed "pooper-scooper laws", though the laws only stipulate that dog owners remove their dogs' feces, not the method or device used (thus using a hand-held plastic bag to remove feces complies with these laws).

==Health concerns==
[[File:Borf face on pooper scooper sign.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A sign instructing park-goes to be courteous and pick up after their pet with an image of a pooper-scooper.]]
Dog droppings are one of the leading sources of ''[[E. coli]]'' ([[fecal coliforms]]) bacterial pollution, ''[[Toxocara canis]]'' and ''[[Neospora caninum]]'' [[helminth]] parasite pollution. One gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 ''E. coli'' cells.&lt;ref&gt;Coliform and ''E. coli'' are commonly used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human)&lt;/ref&gt;  While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area can create serious problems due to contamination of soil and [[Water resources|water supplies]]. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creating health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is particularly dire{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} in [[Germany]], where an estimated 1400 [[tonne]]s of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan that would break even at about seven months.  [[DNA]] samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal.  Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits.  Evidence would be submitted to a [[forensics]] laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog.  The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Poulaphouca Reservoir''', officially '''Pollaphuca''' ({{Irish derived place name|Poll a' Phúca|the [[Púca]]'s hole}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/113024.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,700174,709645,3 Ordnance Survey Ireland - Online map viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; is an active reservoir (for both water supply and electricity generation) and area of wild bird conservation in west [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is also known locally as "[[Blessington]] Lakes".
__NOTOC__
==History==

It was created between 1937 and 1947, with flooding beginning in at 10 am on 3 March 1940 by [[dam]]ming the [[River Liffey]] at [[Poulaphouca]] as part of the [[Electricity Supply Board]] project to build a second [[hydroelectric]] station in [[Ireland]], [[Ardnacrusha power plant|Ardnacrusha]] on the [[River Shannon]] being the first.
[[File:The Púca's Hole (10940771815).jpg|thumb|left|Construction at Poulaphouca in the 1930s]]
The reservoir is one of two major sources of [[Dublin]]'s [[water supply]], the other major supply being [[Vartry Reservoir]] in east Wicklow. 

Between 1938 and 1940, 76 houses were demolished, and the bridges at Humphreystown, Baltyboys and Burgage blown up, in anticipation of the flooding of the valley for the Poulaphouca hydroelectric powerstation.

==Nature==
[[Image:IMG Poulaphouca5543w.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Remains of excavations from the construction of Poulaphouca Dam]]
The reservoir is sometimes known as "lakes" due to its shape, which arises because it lies in not one but two river valleys - that of the Liffey and, primarily, that of the King River.  The King's River joined the Liffey at Baltiboys, at which point it was the larger flow, and when the Liffey was dammed upstream of the confluence, the King's River Valley was flooded far to the south.

A ridge of land, on which the village of [[Valleymount]] lies, divides the southern part of the reservoir.

The [[goosander]], recently arrived as a breeding species in Ireland, can sometimes be seen here.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Rabies''' is a [[viral disease]] that exists in Haiti and throughout the world. It often causes fatal [[encephalitis|inflammation of the brain]] in humans and other [[mammals]], such as dogs and mongooses in Haiti.&lt;ref name = WHO2017/&gt; The term "rabies" is derived from a Latin word that means "to rage";&lt;ref name="cdckids"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabiesandkids/facts.html|title=Get the Facts - CDC Rabies and Kids|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=9 May 2017}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; rabid animals sometimes appear to be angry. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure,&lt;ref name = WHO2017/&gt; followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and [[loss of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; Once symptoms appear, death is nearly always the outcome.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; The time period between contracting the disease and showing symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than a week to more than a year.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; The time between contraction and the onset of symptoms is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name = WHO2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|title=Rabies|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rupp2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rupprecht|first1=Charles E|last2=Millien|first2=Max F.|last3=Pierre-Louis|first3=Jocelyne B.|last4=Wallace|first4=Ryan|last5=Caldas|first5=Eduardo|last6=Rwangabgoba|first6=Jean M.|last7=Poncelet|first7=Jean L.|last8=Cosivi|first8=Ottorino|last9=Del Rio Vilas|first9=Victor J.|title=Control of Dog Mediated Human Rabies in Haiti: No Time to Spare|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=9|issue=6|year=2015|pages=e0003806|issn=1935-2735|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti is one of five remaining countries in the Americas where canine rabies is still a problem. It has the highest rate of human rabies deaths in the western hemisphere with an estimated two deaths each week. Only about seven deaths are reported to health authorities each year due to poor surveillance, limitations in diagnostic capacity, and lack of awareness and education about the disease among Haitians.&lt;ref name="CDCrabies"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/worldrabiesday/haiti.html|title=Rabies in Haiti - World Rabies Day - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=8 May 2017}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology ==
Globally, 59,000 people die from rabies each year. This is the equivalent of one person dying every nine minutes, with half of the people who die from rabies being under the age of 15.&lt;ref name="cdckids" /&gt; The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Pan American Center of foot-and-mouth disease (PANAFTOSA) led a mission to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in the American region by 2015. These organizations are cognizant of the regional control of rabies. The PAHO and PANAFTOSA visited Haiti in early December, 2013, and the objectives of the mission were to assess the status of Haiti’s rabies program as delivered by the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR) and the Ministry of Health (MSPP). The mission was to seek opportunities for collaboration between Haiti, Brazil, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Rupp2015"/&gt;

Even in 2017, rabies in Haiti is still identified as a national problem, even with PEP proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2017|title=In this month’s Bulletin|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/3/17-000317.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=95|issue=3|pages=165–165|doi=10.2471/BLT.17.000317|issn=0042-9686}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The American region had pledged to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies by 2015. As part of the efforts, the findings of a desk-and-field mission review of Haiti’s rabies situation by the end of 2013 is described. While government officials recognize the importance of dog-mediated rabies control, and that the national rabies plan adequately contemplates the basic capacities to that effect, regular and sufficient implementation is hampered by limited funding.--&gt;

==Treatment ==
{{See also|Rabies vaccine}}
In Haiti, few cases of human rabies are reported to health authorities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Ryan M.|last2=Etheart|first2=Melissa D.|last3=Doty|first3=Jeff|last4=Monroe|first4=Ben|last5=Crowdis|first5=Kelly|last6=Augustin|first6=Pierre Dilius|last7=Blanton|first7=Jesse|last8=Fenelon|first8=Natael|title=Dog-Mediated Human Rabies Death, Haiti, 2016|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/11/16-0826_article|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=22|issue=11|pages=1963–1965|doi=10.3201/eid2211.160826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, a report of a woman who had been exposed to rabies three months prior and was showing symptoms went to the hospital where no treatment was administered to her.  Even after being reported to both the CDC and the national Department of Epidemiology and Laboratory Research (DELR), as required by Haiti's surveillance program, the woman ended up passing away.  This goes to show the lack of communication and effectiveness in caring for human subjects in Haiti, and the continued focus is on eliminating dog-mediated rabies altogether.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Human [[diploid cell]] culture [[rabies vaccine]] ([[rabies vaccine|HDCV]]) and purified [[chick embryo cell culture]] rabies vaccine ([[PCEC]]) are used to treat post-exposure immunization against a human rabies infection.&lt;ref name="hdcdr"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Human diploid cell culture rabies vaccine (HDCV) and purified chick embryo cell culture rabies vaccine (PCECV) both confer protective immunity against infection with the silver-haired bat rabies virus strain (SHBRV)|first1=B.|last1=Dietzschold|first2=D.

Health care providers are encouraged to administer a regimen of four 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCEC vaccines. According to the CDC, these injections should be administered intramuscularly to persons who have not yet been vaccinated for rabies.&lt;ref name="cdctreatment" /&gt;

For those who are unvaccinated, the first of four doses is administered immediately after exposure to the rabies virus. Additional doses are given three, seven, and fourteen days after the first vaccination. Exposure usually means a bite from a rabid animal.&lt;ref name="cdctreatment"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/vaccine.html|title=CDC - Medical Care: Rabies Vaccine - Rabies|accessdate=8 May 2017}} {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an individual patient level, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of local treatment of the wound, vaccination, and administration of immunoglobulin, if necessary [3]. At the program level, several components are critical, including: adequate and prompt recognition of the need for PEP by the public, if exposed, and by health officials, prompt and sufficient availability of high-quality PEP, and adequate follow-up of PEP use. Health officials' awareness of the need for PEP after a dog bite can only be achieved if the exposure is attended to immediately and communicated effectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millien|first=Max F.|last2=Pierre-Louis|first2=Jocelyne B.|last3=Wallace|first3=Ryan|last4=Caldas|first4=Eduardo|last5=Rwangabgoba|first5=Jean M.|last6=Poncelet|first6=Jean L.|last7=Cosivi|first7=Ottorino|last8=Del Rio Vilas|first8=Victor J.|date=2015-06-25|title=Control of Dog Mediated Human Rabies in Haiti: No Time to Spare|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806|issn=1935-2727|pmc=4481514|pmid=26110845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal treatment ==
Dog vaccination is most effective for controlling dog-mediated rabies. This can be seen throughout the American region where medical authorities have achieved rabies control.

In Haiti, the CDC is mainly focusing on dog-mediated rabies. Specifically in collaboration with the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission, the CDC has trained, to date, more than 20 MARNDR laboratory personnel in rabies diagnostic methods (Direct Fluorescent Antibody [DFA] and Direct Rapid Immunohistochemistry Test [dRIT]).  The organizations have also improved a diagnostic laboratory in Port-au-Prince by providing it with advanced equipment. The surveillance system is a bite-reporting model where the public and medical providers report bite events to rabies control officers. In addition, more than 30 field veterinary and health agents were trained in rabies surveillance, in support of this effort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, the CDC along with MARNDR initiated a five-year rabies infrastructure improvement program that focused on surveillance, diagnostics, and education. The MSPP also helped out by improving public education on rabies. Because Haiti has a gross national income per capita of US $1,035, it is the only country in the American region that is part of the group of low-income countries. The World Bank has classified 33 other low-income countries in Africa and Asia, where dog-mediated rabies is a major problem and results in thousands of deaths annually. The persistence of dog rabies is connected to limited resources and weak governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In conducting a rabies assessment, rabies control officers try to locate the offending animal. Animals that have bitten a victim are either euthanized and tested or quarantined for 14 days while remaining in their owner's residence. In addition, animals who show signs of rabies are tested, regardless of human exposure. This surveillance program is restricted to two of the ten geographical departments of the country (West and Artibonite) for security reasons.  The area includes approximately 50 percent of the Haitian population. The CDC and the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission support the mission by maintaining four Haitian staff in the West Department and three in the Artibonite Department, respectively. Results of this mission showed the level of under-reporting of canine rabies. Specifically, six cases of rabid dogs in early December, 2012, were reported for the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the first nine months of the surveillance mission, 42 rabid dogs were identified in just three communities in Port-au-Prince during the first nine months in 2012. That being said, no laboratory-based surveillance exists for the human population that is exposed to rabies and all diagnoses are based on clinical history. This is because of the lack of laboratory facilities, making it difficult to identify evidence for the virus in humans and shed light on the disease as a whole for them, in Haiti. There are insufficient numbers of pathologists to collect samples for human rabies, as well.  There do exist other methods for viral antigen detection that may merit study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013, the CDC and its partners began an animal rabies surveillance program in several regions of Haiti and saw an 18-fold rise in detection of rabid animals. In 2015, the CDC evaluated Haiti’s canine rabies vaccination program and found that only 45 percent of dogs were vaccinated, far short of the 70 percent needed to stop the spread of rabies in the dog population. In addition, the researchers found that Haiti had nearly 1,000,000 dogs, twice as many as previously thought.&lt;ref name="CDCrabies" /&gt;

The CDC and its partners had already begun a dog vaccination trial in evaluating the best vaccination methods for dogs in Haiti. As a part of this effort, they vaccinated 3,000 dogs in just four days during the summer of 2016 and planned to vaccinate a total of 8,000 dogs as part of this campaign.&lt;ref name="CDCrabies" /&gt;

==Challenges==
In Haiti, the control of dog rabies is led by the MARNDR while the MSPP manages health-care and rabies prevention in the human population. The separation of these ministries makes it easier for responsibilities to be divided among them.  Communication about finding the source of exposure and implementing control methods to prevent further cross-species transmission is also more effective. This task is difficult enough within departments of the same ministry, (e.g., health care and epidemiology), which can be seen in experiences elsewhere. This is why a comprehensive evaluation of Haiti's rabies program should heavily consider the costs and benefits of this separation of responsibilities between the two ministries early on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite a planned mass vaccination for dogs in 2013, no campaign was actually conducted. Authorities in Haiti relied on funds donated by the World Bank for the purchase of approximately 500,000 doses of inactivated, injectable vaccine (IMRAB by Merial).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imrab.us.merial.com/imrab/index.shtml|title=The Benefits of IMRAB {{!}} IMRAB®  The world’s leading rabies vaccine|website=imrab.us.merial.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the funds were awarded in April 2013, the vaccine itself did not arrive until 2014 when the dog vaccination finally went underway in September 2014. The process as a whole was expected to terminate in January 2015. The lack of manpower needed to deliver faster implementation made it impossible for the campaign to be completed in less than four months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another challenge presented is vaccination failure, which usually leads to recurrent rabies in dogs and inconsistent control of the disease.  The failures that disrupt annual campaigns or have insufficient coverage, for example, are seen as the main cause for this problem. Another factor is that in Haiti, dog vaccinations have been inconsistently applied. Back in 2012 when the last mass vaccination was led by the MARNDR, approximately 400,000 dogs were vaccinated. With this in mind, considering a current human population of approximately 10,000,000, a relation of one dog per ten people, and aiming to attain 70 percent of vaccine coverage, 700,000 dogs would have to be vaccinated. Assessing the effectiveness of this vaccination campaign is difficult because the dog population figures are unreliable (estimates range from 800,000 to 1,200,000 dogs), and though the overall success seems to be limited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The number of rabid dogs detected by the MARNDR, MSPP, and CDC is a huge risk to people and is not accurately reflected in their surveillance figures. Although international support is common in both technical help and donations, it is not comprehensive. In addition, the MARNDR, MSPP, and other actors do not communicate effectively because of human resource limitations. That being said, the 2015 elimination goal in the region was compromised and control of the disease could not yet be achieved, despite the efforts of resolute national officials. In conclusion, rabies in the dog population is still a problem and major threat to the Haitian population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;!--==Funding==
Funding:MFM, JBPL, and RW received no specific funding for this work. EC, VJDRV, JMR, JLP, and Contributed to the work as part of PAHO regional technical cooperation role, for which general funds exist. Both CDC and PAHO had a role in the studydesign and other stages. CDC support the dog surveillance activities, and PAHO the mission to Haiti(for EC and VJDRV), involvement of colleagues from PAHO Haiti office (JMR and JLP) and Panaftosa(OC). Neither PAHO nor CDC supported the ministries or their employees (MFM and JBPL).Competing Interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.

gathered during the mission that comprised a review of the evidence and control plans to date,compare them against the basic capacities of a comprehensive rabies programme, and discuss-the findings in the light of the elimination goal in the region by 2015.

==Section one and intro==
The Context PAHO’s regional programme of rabies control defines Haiti as a priority country, i.e., countries where canine rabies variants are either circulating or did so in the recent past. The context and capacities of priority countries are diverse, and efforts are undergoing to evaluate the best port-folio of actions to address country-specific limitations [2]. Brazil, for example, remains a priority country because of the persistent, albeit well-circumscribed, occurrence of dog-mediated human rabies in the northeast of the country, in the state of Maranhao [3]. Even with this occurrence,

=='''Brazil'''==
remains a successful example in the control of dog-mediated rabies, and constitutes an important technical reference in the region. With the aim of promoting south-to-south collaboration, the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the ministry solely responsible for the control of dog-transmitted rabies in the country, assisted PAHO’s mission to Haiti. Specifically on rabies, Brazil has donated human and canine vaccines to Haiti in the past. One of the objectives of the PAHO mission was to explore ways to enhance this collaboration, for example, in the form of direct technical assistance on the ground. Such assistance would complement the activities currently conducted by the CDC.

To help with this basic capacity, the CDC has conveyed to the MSPP its willingness to assist in human sample collection, shipping of samples, and diagnostic testing at CDC’s  rabies laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, US. To date, only one sample has been shipped to the CDC, which tested negative for rabies.At a meeting during the mission, MSPP officials reported three human cases in 2013, eightin 2012, 13 in 2011, and one in 2010, all allegedly due to canine rabies. These numbers indicate severe under-reporting when compared with modeling figures that show Haiti as the main contributor of the estimated 200 human deaths by dog-transmitted rabies per year in the region[3]. The above structural limitations do not extend to animal samples that are analysed at the MARNDR rabies laboratory.

Tosupport the vaccination campaign, MARNDR is implementing a solar-powered cold chain(Fig 1), over and above the available cold chain facilities in MSPP field premises, previouslyused to support dog vaccination campaigns.
==sec==
On this note, dogbites are now, together with six notifiable conditions, part of the daily reporting requirements from 114 health units (out of more than 900 in the country) to a central epidemiology unit in Port-au-Prince, the capital. This intensive reporting pressure on health officials should increase rabies awareness across the health system, and lead to an increase in the number of dog attacks reported. The aggregation of this information, analysis, and feedback to the sources on a regu-lar basis would further improve awareness among health officials of the rabies risks.As reported by health officials, 1,657 dog bites were recorded in 2013 by the 114 sentinelhealth centers. For a population of approximately 10 million people, this results in a 0.016% of the population bitten by dogs; five times lower than the 0.08% average reported by the coun-tries that attended the 14thmeeting of National Rabies Programme Managers (REDIPRA inSpanish) in Lima (Perú) in 2013 [7], and many more times lower than the 1.8% reported inother countries where canine rabies is also endemic [8]. Analyses of the number of animalaggressions reported by the public may inform the level of awareness within the populationwith regard to the risk of rabies. A simple and short questionnaire about the motivation of thevisit by the dog bitten patient, i.e., whether it was related to fear of rabies, could be administeredto refine this inference. Further checks on the quality of the data should help explain apparentreporting artifacts, such as the fact that all registered victims of dog attacks were five years oldor older, a finding that challenges results elsewhere that consistently report young children asPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20154 / 10

==chidren==
the main victims of dog bites [9,10,11]. The surveillance artifact may hide greater under-reporting of rabies cases if this population group is not captured by the bite registration mecha-nisms, and should trigger questions as to where do children younger than five years old go forbite treatment.At the time of the review, the MSPP had more than 15,000 doses of human vaccine for PEPin stock. These vaccines belonged to a lot of 20,000 Vero cell rabies vaccines for intramuscularadministration donated by Brazil in 2013. This volume of vaccine should be enough to coverthe needs of the country for at least two years given the current use rate of 8,000 doses per year.In addition to sufficient numbers, vaccine must be stored in adequate conditions and in such away that allows its prompt availability across the country.

A national consultant hired byPAHO/Haiti visited twelve sites in Port-au-Prince during the last months of 2013 and reportedadequate cold chain. We had no data about the conditions outside the capital.At an annual use rate of 8,000 human vaccine doses (as per PAHO/Haiti’s warehouse rec-ords), the country could face a surplus of several thousand doses by the end of their shelf life inearly 2015. Solutions to the adequate use of this potential excess of vaccine, before they reachtheir expiration date, might contemplate increasing the distribution of vaccine to areas where itis not currently available, e.g., outside the capital. According to MSPP officials, all large hospi-tals in the country (between 40 and 50) had stocks of human vaccine. Ensuring that vaccineFig 1.

==sec==
regimens after exposure are taken fully by as many patients as possible is also critical. MSPPofficials confirmed that they do not record this key performance indicator. At the time of the mission, the amount and availability of any stock of immunoglobulin was not ascertained.Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis The 2013 WHO expert consultation on rabies report [3] indicates the administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis for those populations at continuous or high risk of rabies, especially children. Although the current stock of vaccine could support such strategy, and indirectly reduce the potential surplus of vaccine by 2015, the logistics of the distribution, rationale for application, and the required follow-up would make this operation impossible given the current avail-able resources.Outbreak Control Activities This capacity comprises surveillance, awareness raising, and control specific activities, within a defined time and space context, implemented following the confirmation of a case of rabies.These can include enhanced surveillance of animal populations at risk, ring vaccination, and awareness campaigns for the population. The rabies national plan provides protocols to guarantee the exchange of information between MSPP and the MARNDR after the occurrence of rabies events.

For example, the communication of dog attacks by the MSPP to the MARNDR,for the latter to initiate surveillance and control activities, occurs after a number of dog attacks are recorded for a specific area. At the time of this review, it was not possible to ascertain the criteria, e.g., number of dogs and period of time that trigger this communication, nor was it possible to verify the completeness of epidemiological reports around the cases.Reactive vaccination of susceptible animals after confirmation of rabies within the local community is also part of these case control activities, however, the amount of canine vaccine available for this purpose at the time of the mission, around 1,000 doses, appeared insufficient. Education Rabies educational capacity comprises activities towards health professionals and the general public to enhance and maintain awareness of rabies risks.

==sec==

To this end, the MSPP conducted a training activity for 40 health officials of the central region on PEP in 2013. This training fol-lowed four similar courses delivered in 2012. It was not possible to ascertain if these activities were all part of a training plan.MSPP and PAHO/Haiti officials stated the critical importance of training for health official son PEP, data form completion, etc., and stressed the ongoing need for these activities given thehigh staff turnover. Training on PEP application should help to change the current practice of delaying prophylaxis after exposure if the animal can be observed. This practice can lead to fatal delays [3] and it needs to be replaced with the immediate application of PEP after expo-sure even if the animal can be observed.For MARNDR officials, there are currently no training plans, although the CDC trained more than 30 veterinary officials in June 2013, and delivers regular training to personnel of theMARNDR laboratory responsible for rabies diagnosis.Identification of Other Risks Cases of canine rabies together with the significant numbers of mongoose cases reported from the Dominican Republic could be seen as a threat to Haiti’s rabies status [7]. Despite this beinga genuine concern, and an indication of a source of rabies in Haiti’s wildlife, it is not high in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20156 / 10

the list of priorities given the many limitations affecting the other capacities. Any medium- orlong-term strategy in the future must contemplate the wildlife source. In the short term,enhanced communication and coordination of control efforts with the neighbouring Domini-can Republic would bring benefits to the two countries.DiscussionDespite having a National Rabies Plan for the period 2007–2012, and an evaluation of it in 2011, little of the plan could be delivered due to insufficient resources at the MSPP andMARNDR. Whereas in other countries in the region the main interest resides on how rabiescontrol activities are operationalised, as the focus is on the optimization of well-establishedprocesses, in Haiti this is not the case, as some basic rabies capacities are still wanting. This istrue for the episodic mass canine vaccination campaigns, and the lack of diagnostic facilitiesfor human rabies cases. Given that canine vaccination is the most effective measure to controldog-mediated human rabies, the intermittent nature of the mass campaigns and their insuffi-cient coverage will not allow for the control of the disease any time soon, let alone itselimination.The inconsistent and insufficient canine vaccination campaigns will also stop short of deliv-ering a number of related positive effects associated with vaccination, e.g., increased awarenessin the population due to the high visibility of the campaigns, and a sense of purpose among theofficials responsible for rabies control. Not only that, the ongoing occurrence of dog cases dueto low levels of immunity in the population, despite large logistic efforts, can easily lead to frus-tration among officials and hamper participation by the population [12].Following recommendations from the 14thREDIPRA meeting [7] canine rabies vaccine hasbeen recently added to PAHO’s Revolving Fund (RF). Countries in the region can now requestcanine vaccine from the RF.

==sec==
Despite the advantages provided by the inclusion of the caninevaccine in the RF, e.g., consistent vaccine quality and more competitive prices, the evidence tosupport the allocation of funds within the MSPP and MARNDR to purchase rabies vaccine isnot sufficient. This evidence can only be gathered by means of adequate surveillance to informthe burden of rabies against that of other diseases.Although there are models that estimate a much larger number of human rabies cases inHaiti [3], these cases remain unobserved, and lead to no reaction by the already overstretchedand under-resourced Haitian health system. This appears logical as the impact of these esti-mated, but unobserved, cases is difficult to demonstrate relative to that of other conditions thatprovide counts of actual data and lead to health care expenditure. Disease estimates adjustedfor under-ascertainment trigger little policy action [13], at least at the operational level, and arenot a substitute for actual surveillance data. The dog surveillance work conducted by theMARNDR with technical support by the CDC is, therefore, critical. Short of reliable records onthe real count of human rabies cases, measures of rabies risk approximated by the dog surveil-lance figures, in combination with dog bite data, can provide an indication of the much higherlevel of rabies exposure in the population.Surveillance findings need to be disseminated to attain their objective: inform and influencedecision, at as many levels as possible. There is value in reporting back to the sources of data for awareness and motivation reasons, to local authorities to inform strategic and operationaldecisions pertaining to the rabies programme, and to international forums to raise awareness about the situation in Haiti. To this end, Haiti should return to the regular reporting of surveil-lance figures and details of the cases to the regional database on rabies (SIRVERA) held atPANAFTOSA [6]. By having up-to-date data by country and aggregated figures, PAHO canreport progress towards the goal of elimination in the region, and identify countries in need ofPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20157 / 10

==sec==

greater focus, such as Haiti. At this critical stage in the race to elimination, with fewer cases and diminishing resources and available skill pool in the region, collecting and sharing as much information as possible on the epidemiology and, critically, on the processes leading to the surveillance and control of the disease remains as important as ever.Following from the recommendations of the last REDIPRA meeting [7], PAHO coordinated in 2014 a proficiency exercise for 35 laboratories from 23 countries to assess regional consistency in direct fluorescent antibody techniques.

Haiti’s MARNDR reference laboratory has participated in this exercise. This shows the commitment of the Haitian authorities to improve their processes. This willingness should be extended to seek the utilization of the MARNDR laboratory premises for the diagnoses of human rabies cases, over and above legitimate administrative and organizational concerns. On this note, as of July 2014, there is discussion about developing a plan for a joint human and animal rabies diagnostic facility in the North Depart-ment. If successful, this will represent the second animal rabies diagnostic facility and first human rabies diagnostic facility in the country. The initiative to create a joint human/animal rabies diagnostic laboratory would maximize the use of the limited human resource and infra-structure capital. Given the current low recognition of human rabies, and the fact that the majority of routine diagnostic testing will be on animal samples, it is not feasible to create diagnostic facility solely devoted to human diagnostics, nor train personnel in human rabies diagnostics alone.

==Brazil again==
The Brazilian Ministry of Health is willing to help Haiti by extending its donations of vaccine to on-field technical support.  This includes aiding areas that are planning vaccine campaigns, administering PEP training, and more. This contribution will add to the increasing need for a strategic framework with clear objectives like controlling dog-mediated rabies first to ensure the efficient elimination of dog mediated human cases, and coordination between donors. The impact of missions like this appears reduced in terms of observing rapid changes in response to limitations that are well known by the local officials.

The benefit could come in the form of notes like this and their dissemination:to increase awareness among international donors, senior authorities in Haiti, and within PAHO. A planned communication campaign is just one of the activities contained in the strategic document, being drafted at the time of writing, to support a rabies task force in Haiti. Keyto this strategy, and responding to a critical lack of this capacity, is the need for coordination among the multiple partners that deliver rabies activities in Haiti. Better integration among partners should lead to greater impact and more efficient use of resources. Coordination and speaking with one voice before Haitian authorities would also increase the critical mass of rabies control efforts and deliver a more consistent and rotund message. The funding of a rabies coordinator/rabies champion, who will work primarily towards ensuring regular and sufficient canine vaccination campaigns and prompt availability of human vaccine for the next two to three years, is being discussed at the time of writing.

The current situation in Haiti clearly impacts the region’s 2015 elimination goal [1] as it was not achieved. The countries of the region will have to make a new goal that recognizes the distinct situations across the region. Most of the areas where dog-mediated human rabies is no longer a public health problem will benefit from efficiency gains and enhanced knowledge management to ensure institutional memory and experience dissemination. These efforts should also benefit the reduced number of countries and areas, such as Haiti, where rabies remains a public health concern. Specific plans for dog rabies control, such as those described above, will require contributions from a number of regional partners and neighboring countries.

forthcoming 2015 REDIPRA meeting will provide the platform to hold these discussions and agree on a new regional goal.A general limitation of the findings described here is that they originate from unstructured questions, observations, and notes from meetings and field visits. A more comprehensive plat-form to collect precise information on the levels of performance within the capacities, as well as on process-related indicators, is the subject of current work by PANAFTOSA.--&gt;

In 2004, Jowell faced resistance to proposals for a series of so-called "super casinos", to be sanctioned as part of the [[Gambling Act 2005]] which liberalised Britain's [[gaming laws]]. Although [[problem gambling]] has ruined the lives of many ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacErlean|first=Neasa|date=14 July 2012|title=The problem with gambling: New figures show more people than ever are ruining their lives|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/the-problem-with-gambling-new-figures-show-more-people-than-ever-are-ruining-their-lives-7942230.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the run up to the Bill, Jowell dismissed much of the criticism as being elitist, commenting that "opponents of the Government's gambling reforms are [[snob]]s who want to deny ordinary people the right to bet". Former Labour Welfare Minister [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] said her comments were crass, declaring, "I think this whole [[New Labour]] line that you insult people rather than engage in argument is deeply disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kite|first=Melissa|date=24 October 2004|title='Opponents of new gambling law are snobs', says Tessa Jowell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474933/Opponents-of-new-gambling-law-are-snobs-says-Tessa-Jowell.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Jowell announced a new governance system for the BBC: the BBC Trust, to replace the long-established Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/02/bbc.broadcasting1|title=BBC governors to be scrapped|first1=Owen|last1=Gibson|first2=Tara|last2=Conlan|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2005|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust was introduced in 2007 but in 2012 was shown to be 'not fit for purpose', leading to the resignation of the Director General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9699031/The-BBC-can-get-out-of-this-hole.html|location=London, UK|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Greg|last=Dyke|title=The BBC can get out of this hole|date=23 November 2012|archivedate=24 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124173417/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9699031/The-BBC-can-get-out-of-this-hole.html|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC#cite note-34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gordon Brown's [[reshuffle]] in June 2007, following his succession as Labour leader and [[Prime Minister]], Jowell was demoted from her position as [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]]. She retained her Olympics portfolio, however, and was also appointed [[Paymaster General]] and [[Minister for London]], being allowed to attend Cabinet, although not as a full member.&lt;ref name="Guardian reshuffle Oct2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/28/publicservices.politics |title=Brown appoints first female home secretary |first=Deborah |last=Summers |work=The Guardian |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was further demoted on 3 October 2008, losing her Minister for London role to [[Tony McNulty]], and being allowed to attend cabinet only when her area of responsibility was on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7651229.stm |title=In full: Reshuffle changes |work=BBC News |date=6 October 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2009 reshuffle, Brown reappointed her to the Cabinet as [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/05/gordon-brown-new-cabinet-list|title=Who's who in Gordon Brown's government?|work=The Guardian|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political positions===
Jowell was a zealous supporter of the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], reportedly saying on one occasion that she would "jump under a bus" for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time for Jowell to jump may be near|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 February 2006|last=Tweedie|first=Neil|location=London, UK|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511666/Time-for-Jowell-to-jump-may-be-near.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112162313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511666/Time-for-Jowell-to-jump-may-be-near.html|archivedate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Tessa Jowell: A loyalist to the bitter end|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|work=The Observer|location=London, UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/22/profile-tessa-jowell-david-mills|last=Bright|first=Martin|date=22 February 2009|archivedate=1 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301190650/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/22/profile-tessa-jowell-david-mills|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was very supportive of [[New Labour]] and was fully loyal to its agenda, earning herself a strong reputation as a [[Blairite]]. In 2007, she supported [[Hazel Blears]] for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/17/labourdeputy.labour1|title=Hazel Blears's backers|work=The Guardian|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she was mentioned as a possible Cabinet minister who might resign over the leadership of [[Gordon Brown]] in order to trigger a leadership contest – a suggestion which proved unfounded. In opposition, Jowell supported [[David Miliband]]'s campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/16/ed-miliband-stands-against-david-miliband|title=Ed Miliband stands against brother David in fight for Labour leadership|first1=Polly|last1=Curtis|first2=Matthew|last2=Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=16 May 2010|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but served in [[Ed Miliband]]'s Shadow Cabinet when he became Leader of HM Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11499638|title=Ex-Home Secretary Johnson is named shadow chancellor|work=BBC News|date=8 October 2010|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 she briefly appeared as a landmark on [[Google Maps]], as a result of a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10637726 |title=MP Tessa Jowell becomes a landmark on Google Maps |work=BBC News |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was involved in the [[Blue Labour]] movement in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and was a contributor to ''[[Purple Labour|The Purple Book]]'', drawing on her background on the [[right-wing|Right]] of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/tessa-jowell-calls-community-led-commissioning/governance/article/1094186|title=Tessa Jowell calls for 'community-led commissioning'|first=John|last=Plummer|work=[[Third Sector (magazine)|Third Sector]]|date=22 September 2011|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jowell set up the [[Sure Start]] programme, Jowell said, "I am very proud of setting up Sure Start [the national nurture and childcare programme], because the first three years of a child’s life are absolutely critical in determining the chances they have subsequently."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/26/tessa-jowell-proud-setting-up-sure-start "Tessa Jowell: ‘I’m most proud of setting up Sure Start"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===London 2012 Olympics===
Jowell was in charge of London's successful bid to host the [[2012 Olympics]]. She came up with the idea in 2002, during her time as Culture Secretary, when she said there was very little support from within the Cabinet, with many colleagues thinking that Paris' bid would win. Jowell convinced the Government to support the bid, however, and went ahead with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19179711|title=Who's who: Political credit from London Olympics |first=Chris|last=Mason|work=BBC News|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/06/international-olympic-committee-london-summer-olympics | title=Jumping Through Hoops |first= Michael Joseph |last=Gross |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she launched the bid and, when the Games were awarded to London, she was appointed Olympics Minister (in addition to her responsibilities as Culture Secretary), and held full ministerial responsibility for the bid from 2006.  Despite being moved from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2007, she retained her position as Olympics Minister throughout Labour's time in office.&lt;ref name="Guardian reshuffle Oct2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tessa-jowell-dead-cancer-brain-tumour-london-olympics-2012-labour-party-age-a8349256.html|title=Remembering Dame Tessa Jowell, the Labour politician who helped to secure the 2012 London Olympics|date=2018-05-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the general election of May 2010, at which Labour lost power, she became Shadow Olympics Minister. She remained on the 2012 Olympics Organising Committee, with [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]] and [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]]. She was appointed [[Deputy Mayor]] of the [[East Village, Stratford|Olympics Village]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/london-2012-tessa-jowell-takes-virtual-ride-through-east-village-1-1460375 |title=London 2012: Tessa Jowell takes virtual ride through East Village |first=Sarah |last=Shaffi |work=Newham Recorder |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; being responsible for making the Olympics take place.

In November 2013, Jowell announced that she would not contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|next general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-25045930/tessa-jowell-to-stand-down-as-mp-at-next-election|title=Tessa Jowell to stand down as MP at next election|work=BBC News|date=21 November 2013|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was nominated for [[life peer]]age in the [[2015 Dissolution Honours]] by the Labour leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34076465|title=Full list of new peers and other honours|work=BBC News|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised to the peerage as Baroness Jowell of Brixton in the London Borough of [[Lambeth]], on 27 October 2015.&lt;ref name="Gazette peerage"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61396|date=2 November 2015|page=21422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Jowell got a standing ovation in the House of Lords for a speech. She began by speaking of how she came to be diagnosed with an extremely lethal form of [[brain cancer]] called [[glioblastoma multiforme]]. She went on to advocate making more cancer treatments available in the [[National Health Service|NHS]].  She said, "In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. I hope that this debate will give hope to other cancer patients, like me, so that we can live well together with cancer, not just dying of it. All of us, for longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2018/jan/25/tessa-jowell-former-labour-mp-delivers-moving-speech-on-brain-cancer-diagnosis-video|title=Tessa Jowell: former Labour MP delivers moving speech on brain cancer diagnosis – video|work=The Guardian|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Jowell, Mills and Berlusconi===
{{main|David Mills financial allegations}}
Jowell's husband [[David Mills (lawyer)|David Mills]] was an international corporate lawyer who has acted for [[Silvio Berlusconi]], then the [[Italian Prime Minister]]. Mills was investigated in Italy for [[money laundering]] and alleged [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax fraud]].&lt;ref name=Owen2006&gt;{{cite news|title=How Jowell's husband played host to Berlusconi at the Garrick Club|author=Richard Owen and Sam Coates|date=22 February 2006|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London, UK|registration=yes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article733486.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211171713/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article733486.ece|archivedate=11 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 February 2006|title=Jowell has nothing to do with Italian bribe allegations, insists her husband|newspaper='The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 March 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1511137/Jowell-has-nothing-to-do-with-Italian-bribe-allegations-insists-her-husband.html|first1=Neil|last1=Tweedie|first2=Hilary|last2=Clarke|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531090815/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1511137/Jowell-has-nothing-to-do-with-Italian-bribe-allegations-insists-her-husband.html|archivedate=31 May 2009|location=London, UK|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jowell was investigated by the [[Cabinet Secretary]] [[Gus O'Donnell]] over the allegations surrounding her husband, because of a possible conflict of interest between her personal life and ministerial duties. O'Donnell stated that, "it is the Prime Minister, not me, who, constitutionally, is the right and proper person to take a view on matters arising based on the [[Ministerial Code]]" in his letter,&lt;ref name=BBC20060302L&gt;{{cite news|date=2 March 2006|newspaper=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4766978.stm|title=In Full: Tessa Jowell inquiry letter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221091247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4766978.stm|archivedate=21 February 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Blair]] decided that she was "not in breach" of the ministers' code of conduct.&lt;ref name=BBC20060302&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC News|date=2 March 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4761194.stm|title=Blair clears Jowell of wrongdoing|archivedate=12 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4761194.stm|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2006, it was announced that Jowell and Mills had separated, after the allegations had begun to damage her political standing. Jowell said "although we are separated I have never doubted his innocence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jowellgate-italian-judge-will-press-charges-over-bribery-allegations-468294.html|newspaper=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|title=Jowellgate: Italian judge will press charges over bribery allegations|date=2 March 2006|location=London, UK|first1=Peter|last1=Popham|first2=Colin|last2=Brown|first3=Matthew|last3=Beard|accessdate=25 May 2010|archivedate=31 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531082049/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jowellgate-italian-judge-will-press-charges-over-bribery-allegations-468294.html|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skepticism that Jowell was unaware of the details of her husband's dealings with Berlusconi led to a ''[[Private Eye]]'' front cover of her with a speech bubble saying: "I have never met my husband".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day: ''Being Berlusconi: The Rise and Fall from Cosa Nostra to Bunga Bunga'', St Martin's Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Mills allegedly admitted to being "an idiot", and has expressed his remorse about the impact of his dealings upon his wife.

On 17 February 2009, an Italian court sentenced Mills to four years and six months in jail after finding him guilty of accepting a bribe from Berlusconi to give false evidence on his behalf during corruption trials which had taken place in 1997 and 1998. His defence counsel said that the sentence went "against the logic and dynamic of the evidence presented". The judgment was appealed by Mills. On 27 October 2009, the Italian Appeal Court upheld his conviction and prison sentence.

Mills argued that he received the money in 1999, and not 2000 as Prosecutors had previously argued, thus taking advantage of the statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;According to the prosecutor the crime occurred on 11 November 1999, when "Mills, on his own, and not as manager of the interests of others, provided instructions for the transfer of about $ 600,000 from the Janus Capital Fund and the Torrey Fund" and February 29, 2000 when the money was actually made available, as is determined by the Court of appeal, and the different date means that the offence expired [after the 10-year rule]. The prosecutor in the indictment also pointed out that "the delay of the final step in the ownership of the shares does not affect the time of when the expiry of the offence takes effect but stems from the desire of Mills to complicate the reconstruction of this illegal transfer of money and its origins" and that "when there is uncertainty about the date of committing an offence, the rule of favor rei applies: and the effect of the 10-year expiry must be fixed at the most favourable date for the accused&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other controversies===
In 2001, Jowell was widely criticised for 'interfering' in [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) rulings on complaints regarding ''[[Brass Eye]]''. ''The Guardian'' newspaper suggested that "for the Culture Secretary to speak directly to the head of a TV network about a specific programme smacks of the Soviet commissar and the state broadcaster".&lt;ref name=Leader2001&gt;{{cite news|title=Brass Eye was degrading: But the government is wrong to interfere|date=31 July 2001|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|accessdate=25 May 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/31/broadcasting.politics1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330211037/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/31/broadcasting.politics1|archivedate=30 March 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward2001&gt;{{cite news|title=TV spoof to bring tougher regulation|last=Ward|first=Lucy|date=30 July 2001|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/30/broadcasting.politics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306182648/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/jul/30/broadcasting.politics|archivedate=6 March 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20010730&gt;{{cite news|title=Programme causes predictable storm|date=30 July 2001|newspaper=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_at_one/1465145.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005090006/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_at_one/1465145.stm|archivedate=5 October 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITC reminded Jowell that she should not be interfering in their processes, resulting in a Channel Four interviewer suggesting Jowell and her colleagues "must feel like idiots".&lt;ref name=Jury2001&gt;{{cite news|title=It was C4's most vetted programme.

In May 2014 a temporary personal assistant to [[Richard Scudamore]], chief executive of England's [[Premier League]], read private emails between Scudamore and colleagues and friends. These included comments about women's football, which the assistant felt to be inappropriate. She passed them on to a national newspaper, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. Jowell defended the reading and passing-on of the emails, declaring that, "in the world of social media and email, there is no public and private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Scudamore comments 'undermine women's game'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27361047|access-date=18 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership fellow==
Jowell served as a Richard L. and Ronay A. Menschel Senior Leadership Fellow at [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] in 2016.

==Personal life==
Jowell's first marriage was to fellow [[London Borough of Camden|Camden Councillor]] [[Roger Jowell]] in 1970; this was dissolved in 1976, but she continued to use his [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=tmc.net|title=The Minister And A £350,000 'Gift'|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/02/23/1402656.htm|date=23 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Jowell co-founded and directed Social &amp; Community Planning Research (SCPR), now the National Centre for Social Research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCCR|url=http://www.natcen.ac.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.natcen.ac.uk|archivedate=30 June 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for its British Social Attitudes Surveys.

She married [[David Mills (lawyer)|David Mills]] on 17 March 1979. They separated in March 2006, following the controversy over Mills's links to Berlusconi. Their professed hopes to "restore their relationship over time", rather than seek divorce, caused some to regard this as a politically expedient gesture to save her political career.&lt;ref name=BBC20060304&gt;{{cite news|title=Tessa Jowell splits from husband|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4773468.stm|work=BBC News|date=4 March 2006|archivedate=21 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021085357/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4773468.stm|quote=The culture secretary and her husband are to separate after the 'strains' of allegations about their finances.|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jowell said on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' programme in September 2012 that she was seeing Mills regularly, saying that they had "reached a state of stability which I never thought possible".&lt;ref name="Tel190912"/&gt; She had a son and daughter, as well as three stepchildren (including journalist [[Eleanor Mills (journalist)|Eleanor Mills]]) from her husband's first marriage.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In April 2016, her son Matthew Mills married food writer [[Ella Woodward]], who is also his business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lexi Finnigan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/25/deliciously-ella-ties-the-knot-on-the-tropical-island-of-mustiqu|title=Deliciously Ella ties the knot on the tropical island of Mustique|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 April 2016|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneur of the Year Awards|url=http://www.ey.com/uk/en/about-us/entrepreneurship/entrepreneur-of-the-year/uk_eoy_home-winners-2017|website=ey.com|publisher=Ernst and Young|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Jess Mills is a singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/can-you-guess-whose-daughter-this-is-6286300.html |title=Can you guess whose daughter this is? |first=Nick |last=Clark |work=The Independent |date=7 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tine van der Maas''' (born 15 March 1954) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-born [[South Africa]]n [[nutritionist]] and [[HIV/AIDS denialism|HIV/AIDS denialist]].&lt;ref name="Grauniad"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/15/matthiasrath.aids | title=No drugs, just take vitamins: the dangerous advice to cure HIV | work=The Guardan | date=September 15, 2008 | accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family is originally of Dutch origin before immigrating to South Africa. She started treating people with AIDS in 1989.

Van der Maas was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].  She is best known for her natural treatment of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and related diseases with a lemon mixture, garlic and beetroot. She was the caretaker of [[Nozipho Bhengu]], who died in 2006 from an AIDS-related illness after being persuaded to stop taking her medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nozipho Bhengu, victim of AIDS and quackery, died on May 19th, aged 32|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7033269|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhengu posthumously became a center of awareness on HIV/AIDS.

Former South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] questioned the link between [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]]. In his speech to the [[13th International AIDS Conference]] in [[Durban]] (2000), he stated, "The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill health and suffering across the globe, including South Africa, is extreme poverty." This occurred at the same time Tine van der Maas came to public attention working with then  Minister of Health, Dr. [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]].
