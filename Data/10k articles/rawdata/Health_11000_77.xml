''' Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics''' ('''ALSO''') is a program that was developed by the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP). This course helps [[physicians]], certified [[nurse midwife|nurse midwives]] (CNM), [[OBGYN]] [[registered nurses]], and other health care providers involved in potential emergencies in perinatal care of mothers.  This course is important and even required in some hospitals for family practice physicians as well as a learning tool in most family practice residencies.&lt;ref name=ALSO&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/cme/aafpcourses/clinicalcourses/also/aboutalso.html About ALSO - Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics - American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ALSO was developed at [[University of Wisconsin]] Department of [[Family Medicine]] by Dr. Damos and John W.

ALSO aims to decrease [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] for both the mother and baby.  ALSO does this by incorporating both [[didactic]] and practical hands on workstations with lifelike mannequins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.also.net.au/whatis.html What is ALSO?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719070100/http://www.also.net.au/whatis.html |date=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics include assisted vaginal delivery, [[Doppler fetal monitor]]ing, fetal [[dystocia]]s, [[neonatal]] [[resuscitation]], management [[premature labor]], management of [[postpartum hemorrhage]], along with [[forceps]] and [[vacuum]]-assisted delivery. Participants must pass a written test as well as a practical hands-on case management of a birth (mega-delivery) incorporating many elements learned throughout the course.

ALSO helps serve the same function as [[advanced trauma life support]] (ATLS) and [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS) to help keep physicians who work with rural or underserved populations up to date on [[evidence-based medicine]] and curriculum.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;

'''The Foundation for AIDS Research (AmfAR)''' is an international [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the support of [[AIDS research]], [[HIV prevention]], treatment education, and the advocacy of AIDS-related public policy. 

amfAR is a tax-exempt corporation under Internal Revenue Code section [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kintera.org/site/lookup.asp?c=gmK3LlO1LnKaF&amp;b=9289207&amp;msource=0615ALTSEFB|title=Syringe Exchange Saves Lives and Money|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates as an independent nonprofit with worldwide initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amfar.org/globallink/|title=amfAR :: Around The World :: The Foundation for AIDS Research :: HIV / AIDS Research|website=www.amfar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; amfAR was formed in New York City in September 1985 by [[Mathilde Krim|Dr. Mathilde Krim]], along with physician [[Joseph Sonnabend|Dr. Joseph Sonnabend]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/sonnabend.pdf|title=Joseph A.

The name change came as a result of the AMF's merge with the California-based National AIDS Research Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/30/nyregion/painful-political-lesson-for-aids-crusader.html|title=Painful Political Lesson for AIDS Crusader|last=Carmody|first=Deirdre|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sought to actively engage in HIV-related drug development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=And The Band Played On|last=Shilts|first=Randy|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-312-00994-6|location=London, England|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; What resulted was a foundation that prioritized both research and development as well as policy influence. This foundation was one of the first of its kind to embody both aspects of healthcare.

amfAR currently has three headquarters, located in [[New York City]]; [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]; and [[Bangkok|Bangkok, Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amfar.org/contact/|title=amfAR :: Contact Us :: The Foundation for AIDS Research :: HIV / AIDS Research|website=www.amfar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;amfAR spurs research and development through providing grants and fellowships to organizations, such as the Family Institute of Health, and individuals through the Mathilde Krim Fellowships in Basic Biomedical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-08-09|title=The history and challenge of HIV prevention|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608608843|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=372|issue=9637|pages=475–488|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60884-3|pmid=18687461|issn=0140-6736|last1=Merson|first1=Michael H.|last2=O'Malley|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Serwadda|first3=David|last4=Apisuk|first4=Chantawipa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocs.yale.edu/career-resource/amfar-allan-rosenfield-md-hiv|title=amfAR: Allan Rosenfield, M.D., HIV/AIDS Public Policy Internship and Fellowship program  {{!}} Office of Career Strategy {{!}} Yale University|website=ocs.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; amfAR has provided over 3,300 grants to research teams across the world and has invested over $400 million to research aiming to effectively treat HIV and AIDS related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.campbellfoundation.net/amfar-grant-tripled|title=amFAR Grants Tripled {{!}} Fort Lauderdale {{!}} The Campbell Foundation|website=Funding AIDS/HIV research {{!}} Fort Lauderdale{{!}} The Campbell Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; amfAR's funds historically have gone to funding research, and as a result have helped pioneer community-based clinical research trials in the 1980s, as well as the involvement of AIDS patients in the drug approval process (''see also: [[Denver principles|Denver Principles]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mathilde-Krim|title=Mathilde Krim {{!}} American medical researcher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in leadership have marked changes in focus, resulting in shifts from public health outreach (needle exchange program pushes)&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarlais|first=Don C.

==History==

=== Origins ===
In the early 1980s, a group of researchers and scientists including [[Mathilde Krim]], Ph.D., then a researcher at New York's [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], formed an informal study group to investigate the condition that came to be known as AIDS. In 1983, Dr. Krim, Dr. [[Joseph Sonnabend]], [[Michael Callen]], and several others launched the New York-based AIDS Medical Foundation. In Los Angeles, Dr. [[Michael S. Gottlieb]] and amfAR Founding National Chairman Dame Elizabeth Taylor spearheaded the creation of the National AIDS Research Foundation. The two organizations merged in September 1985 to become "'''am'''erican '''f'''oundation for '''A'''IDS '''R'''esearch" (amfAR). The merged organization was launched with a $250,000 contribution from [[Rock Hudson]] shortly before his AIDS-related death in October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Plague on All Our Houses|last=Hillman|first=Bruce|publisher=ForeEdge|year=2016|isbn=978-1611688757|location=Brandeis University|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership Under Krim ===
Krim's achievements during her time as the head of amfAR involved increased public education and direct political action. Primarily, Krim spearheaded the publishing of amfAR's first HIV/AIDS Treatment Directory, which provides medical professionals updated information on the treatment of HIV/AIDS, as well as clinical trials that [[People With AIDS|People with AIDS (PWAs)]] can participate in.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-03-23|title=AmFAR HIV/AIDS treatment directory available|journal=AIDS Treatment News|issue=362|pages=8|issn=1052-4207|pmid=11569958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing of this directory continued for 11 volumes until the year 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art31984.html|title=amfAR HIV/AIDS Treatment Directory Available|work=TheBody.com|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the increased involvement of AIDS activists and patients with the drug approval process, Krim (along with [[Elizabeth Taylor]]) testified before the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Health]] and Congress on the importance of clinical trials within community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petricciani|first=John C.|date=1993|title=Global immunization against AIDS: economic considerations|journal=Vaccine|volume=11|issue=8|pages=873–877|doi=10.1016/0264-410x(93)90364-4|issn=0264-410X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These testimonies and lobbying efforts by Krim led to the first [[Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group]], which allowed people with AIDS and HIV to actively take part in the testing needed to approve AIDS drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1997-10-01|title=The relationship between study design, results, and reporting of randomized clinical trials of HIV infection|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197245697000974|journal=Controlled Clinical Trials|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=431–444|doi=10.1016/S0197-2456(97)00097-4|issn=0197-2456|last1=Ioannidis|first1=John P.A.|last2=Cappelleri|first2=Joseph C.|last3=Sacks|first3=Henry S.|last4=Lau|first4=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krim further shaped the structure of amfAR's fellowships, as she impelled the first grant of money to [[Peter Piot]] for his landmark study on female-to-male AIDS transmission in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HIV Prevention: A Comprehensive Approach|last=H.

Amid the 1980s [[War on drugs|"War on Drugs,"]] Krim's thoughts on sterile needle exchange is reflected in a quote, saying, "It was a brilliant idea. It would work—the drug users would use the clean needles—and it would be inexpensive.”&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Krim worked with the Outside In needle exchange program in Portland, Oregon in 1989, and funded trials of needle exchange programs in Tacoma, Washington between 1989-1991.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; amfAR used the results of these studies, as well as a study in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]] to compile a report with the National Academy of Science which concluded that syringe exchange programs were safe and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=T.

In 2005, Mathilde Krim stepped down as founding chair. According to amfAR, she served as CEO from 1990 through 2004, and is described as the "heart and soul" of the organization. Charles Kaiser described Krim as "determined to prevent America from using AIDS to stigmatize homosexuals" in his book ''The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America|last=Kaiser|first=Charles|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1997|isbn=978-0802143174|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was widely viewed as someone who fought on the front lines against prejudices against many people with AIDS. Apart from aiding research for life saving drugs, Krim was equally a proponent of reshaping public opinion, as noted by the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] tributes to her and those who interacted with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/obituaries/mathilde-krim-mobilizing-force-in-an-aids-crusade-dies-at-91.html|title=Mathilde Krim, Mobilizing Force in an AIDS Crusade, Dies at 91|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== amfAR After Krim ===
The year after Krim stepped down in 2004, the CDC reported that 1,000,000 Americans were living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|title=HIV in the United States {{!}} Statistics Overview {{!}} Statistics Center {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|date=2018-08-06|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to reduce the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS, amfAR's new chairman [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/fashion/thursdaystyles/from-kenneth-cole-a-new-solidarity.html|title=From Kenneth Cole, a New Solidarity|last=Wilson|first=Eric|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; led amfAR to partner with [[Viacom|Viacom Inc.]] and the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] to launch an initiative called KNOW HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00034096/|title=Kenneth Cole Launches New Public Service Campaign on World AIDS Day|date=2005-12-02|work=Kaiser Health News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program funded an AIDS awareness campaign titled, "We All Have AIDS,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berwick|first=Donald|date=2002-01-26|title="We all have AIDS": case for reducing the cost of HIV drugs to zero|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|volume=324|issue=7331|pages=214–216|issn=0959-8138| pmc = 1122133|pmid=11809645}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked a more controversial tone in amfAR's new public strategy.

=== Institute for HIV Cures Research ===
In 2015 amfAR announced a collaboration with the University of California San Francisco, Medical School to create their first Institute for HIV Cures Research.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ari.ucsf.edu/research/amfar-institute-hiv-cure-research|title=amfAR Institute for HIV Cure Research {{!}} AIDS Research Institute|website=ari.ucsf.edu|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This facility works to foster research and was founded with the goal of finding a cure to AIDS by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/opinion/an-opening-in-the-war-against-aids.html|title=Opinion {{!}} An Opening in the War Against AIDS|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the institute are Paul Volberding, MD who is the head of the UCSF AIDS Research Institute; Satish Pillai, PhD who part of the Blood Systems Institute as well as Warner Greene, MD, PhD, who helps direct the program.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; To remark on the progress that the institute had been making since its foundation, Dr. Volberding told CBS News in 2016:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To see the pace from the days that we could do very little other than watch our patients die to finding the first treatments and then working hard to make those treatments better to where we are now has been remarkable. We have a lot of different options of three or four drug combinations put together in a single pill that a person takes once a day. It's remarkably easier than it used to be."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Bangkok, Thailand Headquarters ===
amfAR established its first international headquarters in Klongtoey, Bangkok, Thailand in 2001 to accompany its TREAT Asia network.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iedea.org/regions/asia-pacific/|title=Asia-Pacific – IeDEA International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS|website=www.iedea.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters establishes closer contact to its 21 adult and 20 pediatric clinics in 12 countries across East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amfar.org/treat-asia-network-sites/|title=amfAR :: TREAT Asia Network Sites :: The Foundation for AIDS Research :: HIV / AIDS Research|website=www.amfar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters is internationally run as well, and works to streamline the logistics of projects in TREAT Asia.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Former Chairman Kenneth Cole announced that the decision to move headquarters to Thailand was due to the ability to use the government's generous resources that have been committed to treating the crisis, and have effectively reduced the HIV prevalence in the country to under 1.1% due to quick mobilization and dedicated work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/thailand|title=HIV and AIDS in Thailand|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives and Campaigns ==
With $20 million over five years, the amfAR Institute for HIV Cure Research will support the work of scientists at UC San Francisco (UCSF), the Gladstone Institute for Virology and Immunology (GIVI), the Blood Systems Research Institute (BSRI) and other academic partners who are at the forefront of the effort to cure AIDS, rather than simply treating it as a chronic disease.

=== National Initiatives ===

==== Countdown to a Cure for AIDS ====
amfAR has long intended to find a scientific cure to AIDS by the year 2020, and it created the Countdown to a Cure for AIDS in February 2014 as a way of speeding up this process.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curecountdown.org/overview/|title=Overview|website=Countdown to a Cure for AIDS|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Countdown" is an investment initiative that intends to give $100 million to scientists working to find a cure. Most grants are given through applications at the University of California, San Francisco. By the year 2017, amfAR had granted $42 million to researchers, and it gave over $3.5 million in grants to six research teams under the amfAR Research Consortium on HIV Eradication (ARCHE), and later $1.2 million to AIDS innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aumag.org/2017/10/16/novel-cure-research-supported-by-amfar/|title=Novel Cure Research Supported by amfAR {{!}} A&amp;U Magazine|last=Needle|first=Chael|website=aumag.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/CURE/research-projects-funding|title=Research Projects &amp; Funding {{!}} Treatment Action Group|last=|first=|date=|website=www.treatmentactiongroup.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the Countdown, along with ARCHE had granted money to 139 principal investigators and key personnel across 16 states and 9 countries.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

the amfAR Institute for HIV Cure Research at the University of California, San Francisco began in 2015 as the central facility to achieve their Countdown to a Cure for AIDS by 2020. It began from a $20 million grant to UCSF. Many researchers who receive fellowships and grants from amfAR and ARCHE work at the new facilities at UCSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ari.ucsf.edu/research/scientists-frontline-cure-research|title=Scientists on the frontline of cure research {{!}} AIDS Research Institute|website=ari.ucsf.edu|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Countdown to a Cure for AIDS, amfAR hosts an annual HIV Cure Summit, which aims to hear from voices in the research community on breakthroughs, as well as discuss discoveries that have motivated AIDS research, such as the breakthrough with the [[The Berlin Patient|Berlin patient]], who spurred the countdown in the first place.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Timothy Ray|date=2015-01-01|title=I Am the Berlin Patient: A Personal Reflection |journal=AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses|volume=31|issue=1|pages=2–3|doi=10.1089/aid.2014.0224|issn=0889-2229| pmc = 4287108|pmid=25328084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide amfAR Galas ===
amfAR's largest source of revenue comes from its fundraising events,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; large portions of that money comes from one of its annual charity event held at the [[Hôtel du Cap-Eden Roc|Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc]] in [[Antibes, France]] titled "amfAR's Annual Cinema Against AIDS."&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2018/05/10/exclusive-extravagant-amfar-gala-auction-items-at-the-2018-cannes-film-festival/#16208e3f355f|title=Exclusive: Extravagant Celebrity amfAR Gala Auction Items At The 2018 Cannes Film Festival|last=Dobson|first=Jim|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gala aims to raise money through auctioning items, as well as selling a limited number of tickets.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; Since the first amfAR gala, the charity has raised over $210 million to support AIDS research causes.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/malaysia/the-borneo-post-sabah/20180519/282905206211947|title=Star Power Dims at Post-Weinstein Cannes Aids Gala|last=Sabah|date=19 May 2018|website=The Borneo Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent gala held in [[Cannes]] raised around $20 million&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; at its 2016 gala, which is a marked decrease from the over $25 million it raised in the same 2016 and 2017 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/fashion/celebrities-raise-more-than-25-million-at-amfars-gala-in-cannes.html|title=Celebrities Raise More Than $25 Million at amfAR’s Gala in Cannes|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that this decrease in funding was due to both the absence of its largest donor [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein]], as well as the scandal surrounding the ousting of [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-filmfestival-cannes-amfar/cannes-swankiest-party-goes-ahead-without-driving-force-weinstein-idUSKCN1II2TD|title=Cannes' swankiest party goes ahead without 'driving force' Weinstein|last=Pomeroy|first=Robin|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Health Education and Outreach ==

=== Syringe Exchange Programs ===
Krim's original view on needle exchange was largely affected by exposure through visits to foundational needle exchange programs:&lt;blockquote&gt;On one visit, Mathilde met a clearly pregnant woman coming to exchange syringes. Mathilde was very upset. After the woman left the exchange, Mathilde spoke to the exchange worker. “That woman should be in treatment, not exchanging syringes.” “Yes,” the worker replied, “but the prenatal clinics do not accept drug addicts, and the drug abuse treatment programs do not accept pregnant women.”

-Don C. Des Jarlais, Ph.D.&lt;/blockquote&gt;After interactions like these, Krim began work with the Outside In needle exchange program in Portland, Oregon beginning in 1989;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; this program was a service program for youth who had run away. Led by Kathy Oliver, amfAR helped gain insurance support for the program, and later compiled a report that showed the effectiveness of the study: needle discard rates in Portland neighborhoods decreased as a result of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236650/|title=Behavioral and Community Impact of the Portland Syringe Exchange Program|last=Programs|first=National Research Council (US) and Institute of Medicine (US) Panel on Needle Exchange and Bleach Distribution|date=1994|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krim later used amfAR's research funding apparatus to help David Purchase begin a needle and syringe exchange program in Tacoma, Washington.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; He used the money granted to analyze Tacoma's syringe exchange programs. Similarly to the results found in the Portland study, Purchase found that hepatitis B, C and HIV rates were much lower for users in Pierce County who exchanged their needles than those who did not. The study also found low HIV rates among women who use the exchange for IUD injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagan|first=H|last2=Jarlais|first2=D C|last3=Friedman|first3=S R|last4=Purchase|first4=D|last5=Alter|first5=M J|date=1995-11|title=Reduced risk of hepatitis B and hepatitis C among injection drug users in the Tacoma syringe exchange program.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=1531–1537|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.11.1531|pmc=1615682|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== amfAR ''AIDS Handbook'' ===
The first AIDS handbook was published in 1999&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; as an effort to give a "comprehensive" and "concise" description of HIV/AIDS and methods of prevention. This 496-page book was intended for the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-amfar-aids-handbook-darrell-e-ward/1113144166|title=The AmFAR AIDS Handbook: The Complete Guide to Understanding HIV and AIDS|last=Noble|first=Barnes &amp;|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to their ''HIV/AIDS Treatment Directory'' intended for medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-AmFAR-AIDS-Handbook/|title=The AmFAR AIDS Handbook {{!}} W.

=== Trans Pacific Partnership Opposition ===
In May 2015 amfAR released a report showing that increases in intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical countries would drive up the price of some drugs that are desperately needed in the developing world, namely countries who rely on affordable [[antiretroviral drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/_amfarorg/Articles/On_The_Hill/2015/IB_TPP_Brief_RC_050615.pdf|title=Trans-Pacific Partnership: Curbing Access to Medicines Now and in the Future|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=American Foundation for AIDS Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group says that would hamper the global fight against AIDS (and other diseases) at an unsustainable rate. This report marked the first time that amfAR involved itself in economic policy that indirectly pertained to AIDS, and its rally against Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) reached national attention as a provision of the TPP that was traditionally seen to be benign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584025/tpp-amfar-aids-generics|title=A major AIDS research group says the TPP will make it harder to fight AIDS|work=Vox|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Harvey Weinstein Scandal ====
At amfAR's 22&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;nd&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; annual benefit in [[Cannes]], France in May 2015, [[Harvey Weinstein]] made a deal with amfAR chairman [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]. The deal is as follows: Weinstein would auction off two items (one being a sitting with a famous fashion photographer and the second being tickets to a Hollywood film awards event) on the condition that $600,000 of the proceeds raised at the auction would be donated as a charitable gift to the [[American Repertory Theater]]. The reason for this contingent was that the [[American Repertory Theater]] promised Weinstein a $1.25 million reimbursement and a $500,000 charitable donation to the play [[Finding Neverland (musical)|''Finding Neverland'']], which Weinstein was producing at the theater, on the condition that third parties donate the same amount to the production.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt;

While the arrangement raised $309,669 for amfAR and was ruled "legitimate and lawful" by the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Cutcher, investigations and public outrage ensued surrounding the charity's financial integrity. A rift formed between Chairman [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]] and CEO Kevin Robert Frost, as evidenced by an email from Frost in 2015 saying, “Nothing about this deal feels right to me, and I believe we have not done due diligence to understand exactly what this money is being directed to or why amfAR is being used to facilitate these transfers."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair Weinstein article"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/harvey-weinstein-nightmare-finding-neverland-amfar-money|title='Nothing About This Deal Feels Right to Me': Inside Harvey Weinstein's Other Nightmare|last=Cohan|first=William D.|date=December 20, 2017|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AmfAR's management initially refused, citing their longstanding policy against doing so, but Weinstein was persistent. He had apparently donated $2 million to ART on the condition that if he could raise more money from others before June 1, 2015, they would return the contribution. Cole and Weinstein reportedly agreed that ART and AmfAR would split any money from the lots up to $1.2 million evenly, and all money above that amount would be exclusively AmfAR's. Except for a last-second insert attributed to Cole noting that ART would get some of the money from one of the lots, a fashion shoot with [[Mario Testino]], there was nothing else to indicate to bidders where their money was going. Cole told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' later that he had always felt bullied by Weinstein, and the insert was a small act of resistance.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair Weinstein article" /&gt;

Weinstein demanded AmFAR repay him immediately instead of waiting for the money for the lots to come in. In early 2016 the organization's board retained an attorney to investigate the transaction, who concluded that Weinstein's failure to disclose all relevant information had exposed AmfAR to material risks to its reputation if the deal had turned out to be illegal. The report divided the board, with several members resigning over what they saw as Cole's failures. After Weinstein found out that some of the people the lawyer talked to had shared information about [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|his rumored history of sexual misconduct]], information that became public knowledge in September 2017, Weinstein demanded that board members who had read the report sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, leading to more resignations.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair Weinstein article" /&gt;

In April 2017, 19 members of the Board of Trustees contacted the Attorney General to explain that Cole had proceeded with this deal in spite of the objections of the wider executive management team, as confirmed by their spokesperson Steven Goldberg. Following legal struggles surrounding the benefit to private investors of charitable donations, Weinstein pushed amfAR to sign nondisclosure agreements that indicated no wrongdoing and no further probing. As a result, four members (Mervyn Silverman, Vincent Roberti, Arlen Andelson and Jonathan Canno) refused to sign and went to petition the Attorney General on the impropriety of [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]. In that time two other board members had resigned.

==== Cole's Tenuous Term Limit Proposal ====
On November 13, NBC News obtained a letter signed by 60 gay rights community members calling for his resignation. This letter was signed by [[Greg Louganis]], an Olympic diver; [[Larry Kramer]], playwright and activist and amfAR contributor [[Peter Staley]], among others. As a result of the scandal, Kenneth Cole stepped down as chairman after a 14-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/02/08/kenneth-cole-resigns-amfar-chairman-following-harvey-weinstein-controversy/319180002/|title=Kenneth Cole resigns as amfAR chairman following Harvey Weinstein controversy|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole initially couched his decision to step down, along with four other board members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-kenneth-cole_us_59e4bfa1e4b03a7be58224de|title=How Harvey Weinstein And Kenneth Cole Covered Up A Shady Deal|last=Ali|first=Yashar|date=2017-10-18|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the result of term limits being imposed by the amfAR Board of Trustees with his support.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/kenneth-cole-resigns-amfar-chair-wake-weinstein-flap-n845951|title=Kenneth Cole pushed out as amfAR chair in wake of Weinstein flap|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, the attorney general's charity bureau sent a letter to the board on 2 February, which exposed a proposal by Cole which allowed him to maintain his role as chairman in spite of new term limits.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The attorney general's office sent a second letter on 6 February that mandated the board update its term limits and end Cole's tenure.

The '''Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS)''' is a [[ciliopathy|ciliopathic]] [[human]] [[genetic disorder]] that produces [[pleiotropy|many effects]] and affects many body systems.  It is characterized principally by [[obesity]], [[retinitis pigmentosa]], [[polydactyly]], [[hypogonadism]], and [[kidney failure]] in some cases.&lt;ref name=jmg199906&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beales P, Elcioglu N, Woolf A, Parker D, Flinter F |title=New criteria for improved diagnosis of Bardet–Biedl syndrome: results of a population survey |journal=J.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The symptoms of Bardet-Biedl disorder vary among people within a family. Affected people won't have the greater part of the indications talked about underneath. Moreover, the seriousness of particular indications may shift enormously also. The effects of this disorder include cone-rod dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, truncal obesity, kidney abnormalities and learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bardet-biedl-syndrome/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and appointments==
Brian Morris grew up in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, where he graduated from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1972. He then completed his PhD at [[Monash University]] and the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1975. From 1975–1978 he did [[postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]] at the [[University of Missouri]], and the [[University of California, San Francisco]], first as a CJ Martin fellow, and then as an Advanced Fellow of the [[American Heart Association]].

==Career==
Morris studied the [[Renin–angiotensin system]] (RAS) for most of his career.  His interest in RAS began during his undergraduate studies, when he worked for a while in the laboratory where [[Eugenie Lumbers]] had just found early clues to the existence of prorenin (the [[protein precursor]] of [[renin]]) during her PhD work. He remain interested in the field, and had the good fortune to move to the University of California, San Francisco in the mid-1970s, a center for the development of the tools of [[biotechnology]] and [[molecular cloning]].  He joined others in applying those tools to RAS, and was among the pioneers is isolating the gene for [[renin]] itself, along with the prorenin and [[kallikrein]] genes, and the cardiac [[myosin]] heavy chain gene.&lt;ref name=Dahl2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/thriving-under-pressure-scientist-unlocks-mysteries-of-hypertension-20111030-1mqh6.html | title=Thriving under pressure: scientist unlocks mysteries of hypertension | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=31 October 2011 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Metherell, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

He and his team were among first to elucidate the [[anabolism|biosynthetic pathway]] of renin, as well as key molecular mechanisms in renin's transcriptional and posttranscriptional control.&lt;ref name=Dahl2011/&gt;  Taking that work further, he helped pioneer the field of [[Essential_hypertension#Genetic_variation|genetic variation in hypertension]].&lt;ref name=Dahl2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=B.

Morris strongly supported male circumcision throughout his career, with around a quarter of his publications being on that topic, and joining the [[Circumcision controversies|public debate]].&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt; He has likened those who oppose circumcision to anti-vaccine advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=R.|title=Ugly, messy and nasty debate surrounds circumcision|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=28 November 2011|volume=184|issue=1|pages=E25–E26|doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-4017|pmid=22125336|pmc=3255195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/02/new-journal-argues-circumcisions-should-be-mandatory.html | title=New Study Says Benefits of Circumcision Outweigh Risks 100 to 1 | work=The Daily Beast | date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=31 March 2015 | author=Zadrozny, Brandy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticised the circumcision policies of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=BJ |last2=Bailis |first2=SA |last3=Castellsague |first3=X |last4=Wiswell |first4=TE |last5=Halperin |first5=DT |title=RACP's policy statement on infant male circumcision is ill-conceived. |journal=Australian and New Zealand journal of public health |date=February 2006 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=16-22; discussion 22-5 |pmid=16502947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=BJ |last2=Wodak |first2=AD |last3=Mindel |first3=A |last4=Schrieber |first4=L |last5=Duggan |first5=KA |last6=Dilley |first6=A |last7=Willcourt |first7=RJ |last8=Lowy |first8=M |last9=Cooper |first9=DA |title=The 2010 Royal Australasian College of Physicians' policy statement 'Circumcision of infant males' is not evidence based. |journal=Internal medicine journal |date=July 2012 |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=822-8 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02823.x |pmid=22805686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, he began to study the genetics of longevity, including the roles of [[FOXO3]] and the [[sirtuins]].&lt;ref name=Bosch/&gt;{{rp|154-155}}

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]]' [[Edgeworth David Medal]] in 1985 and in 1993 the University of Sydney awarded him a DSc. In 2003 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the American Heart Association Council for High Blood Pressure Research. In 2010 he gave the Lewis K. Dahl Memorial lecture, an award sponsored by the Council for High Blood Pressure Research in association with the American Heart Association.  In 2014 the AHA awarded him the Irvine Page--Alva Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award. He was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] in the Queens Birthday Honours Awards in 2018.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dahl2011/&gt;

He received his B.S. from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1978 and his Ph.D. in Economics and [[statistics]] from [[Iowa State University]] in 1981.  Although his research includes many papers on topics in the fields in which he was trained—[[environmental economics]], [[resource economics]], and [[agricultural economics]]—he is better known for his cross-disciplinary work in [[environmental epidemiology]] and [[public health]].  He is world-renowned for his seminal work on the effects of [[particulate]] [[air pollution]] on [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] and [[health]].  His articles have helped establish the connection between air pollution and health problems, including [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular]], and [[pulmonary disease]].  These research findings have influenced [[environmental policy]] in the United States and [[Europe]], contributing to the establishment of [[emission standard]]s for [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] pollution.

==Air pollution research==

Early in Pope's career he published a paper that made him an academic cornerstone of environmental science and policy called "Respiratory hospital admissions associated with PM10 pollution in Utah, Salt Lake, and Cache Valleys".&lt;ref name="pope91"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/00039896.1991.9937434 | last=Pope | first=C. A. | title=Respiratory hospital admissions associated with PM10 pollution in Utah, Salt Lake, and Cache Valleys | journal=Arch. Environ. Health | year=1991 | volume=46 | issue=2 | pages=90–97 | pmid=2006899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Utah Valley]] the [[Geneva Steel]] Mill generated large quantities of particulate matter which is a byproduct of [[fossil fuel]] consumption.  The mill was shut down temporarily.  Pope compiled hospital admissions data for the time before, during, and after the temporary closing of the mill and was the first to convincingly show the immediate health harms associated with [[atmospheric particulate matter]].{{fact|date=August 2018}} [[Asthma]], [[wikt:mortality|mortality]], and [[respiratory]] admissions generally were twice as high while the plant was operating than the year in which it was closed. [[Utah]] made a particularly suitable [[natural experiment]] as the various valleys included in the study trap pollution in the winter months when [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversions]] stifle the escape of pollution.  His abstract states:

{{cquote|This study assessed the association between respiratory hospital admissions and PM10 pollution in Utah, Salt Lake, and Cache valleys during April 1985 through March 1989. Utah and Salt Lake valleys had high levels of PM10 pollution that violated both the annual and 24-h standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Much lower PM10 levels occurred in the Cache Valley. Utah Valley experienced the intermittent operation of its primary source of PM10 pollution: an integrated steel mill. Bronchitis and asthma admissions for preschool-age children were approximately twice as frequent in Utah Valley when the steel mill was operating versus when it was not. Similar differences were not observed in Salt Lake or Cache valleys. Even though Cache Valley had higher smoking rates and lower temperatures in winter than did Utah Valley, per capita bronchitis and asthma admissions for all ages were approximately twice as high in Utah Valley. During the period when the steel mill was closed, differences in per capita admissions between Utah and Cache valleys narrowed considerably. Regression analysis also demonstrated a statistical association between respiratory hospital admissions and PM10 pollution. The results suggest that PM10 pollution plays a role in the incidence and severity of respiratory disease.|20px||C. Arden Pope&lt;ref name="pope91"/&gt;}}

Pope came under hostile political pressure and his findings became a firestorm of controversy.  Intense scrutiny revealed that his results were accurate.  In 2004 Pope was awarded the [[Utah Governor's Medal in Science and Technology]]. In 2006 Dr. Pope was recognized as BYU's distinguished faculty through reception of the [[Karl G. Maeser]] award.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-honors-outstanding-faculty-staff-annual-university-conference&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
===History===
Cannabis was probably introduced to [[Southeast Asia]] around the 16th century, and used medicinally and in cuisine.&lt;ref name="Cohen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sidney Cohen|title=The Therapeutic Potential of Marihuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89vTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-4286-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis has been traditionally grown in [[Cambodia]] and is a common ingredient in food. By 1961 in compliance with the Single Convention on Narcotics treaty it was technically made illegal but the law was unenforced, and marijuana was openly sold. In 1992 during a [[United Nations]] intervention the drug was specifically made illegal but still the law remained unenforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/high-life |title=The high life |website=phnompenhpost.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
Although it is illegal, police do not harass cannabis users and businesses openly sell cannabis products to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marijuanatravels.com/cities/khm |title=Cambodia, Country |website=marijuanatravels.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the [[UNODC]] stated that cannabis production cultivation had "ceased to be a major concern" in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="Brownfield2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William R. Brownfield|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report: Volume I: Drug and Chemical Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jnyNWFuhXYC&amp;pg=PA179|date=May 2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-8272-5|pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Marijuana is openly sold in markets, restaurants, and bars. "Happy pizza" is the term for cannabis infused pizza frequently sold in restaurants across Cambodia. Among Cambodians it is viewed as something older people use and is not popular with the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/content/1998/11/01/1403 |title=Cannabis Cambodia: smoker’s paradise |website=cannabisculture.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In tourist heavy areas "happy pizza" is more commonly sold due to its popularity among travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/cambodia/articles/visitors-are-so-happy-to-try-marijuana-laced-pizza-in-cambodia/ |title=Visitors are so happy to try marijuana-laced pizza in Cambodia |website=theculturetrip.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A randomized double-blind controlled trial.|journal=JAMA|date=17 August 1994|volume=272|issue=7|pages=519–23|pmid=8046805|doi=10.1001/jama.272.7.519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each item on the scale is scored independently, and the summation of the scores yields an aggregate value that correlates to the  severity of alcohol withdrawal, with ranges of scores designed to prompt specific management decisions such as the administration of [[benzodiazepines]]. The maximum score is 67; Mild alcohol withdrawal is defined with a score less than or equal to 15, moderate with scores of 16 to 20, and severe with any score greater than 20. 
The ten items evaluated on the scale are common symptoms and signs of alcohol withdrawal, and are as follows: 
*[[Nausea]] and vomiting
*Tremor
*[[Paroxysmal]] sweats
*Anxiety
*Agitation
*[[Touch|Tactile]] disturbances
*[[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]] disturbances
*[[Visual disturbances]]
*[[Headache]]
*Orientation and clouded [[sensorium]]
All items are scored from 0–7, with the exception of the orientation category, scored from 0–4. The CIWA scale is validated and has high inter-rater reliability. A randomized, [[double blind]] trial published in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' in 1994&lt;ref&gt;Saitz M, Mayo-Smith MF, Redmond HA, Bernard DR, Calkins DR. Individualized treatment for alcohol withdrawal. A randomized double-blind controlled trial. JAMA 1994;272:519-23.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that management for alcohol withdrawal that was  guided by the CIWA scale resulted in decreased treatment duration and total use of [[benzodiazepines]]. The goal of the CIWA scale is to provide an efficient and objective means of assessing alcohol withdrawal. Studies have shown that use of the scale in management of alcohol withdrawal leads to decreased frequency of over-sedation with benzodiazepines in patients with milder alcohol withdrawal than would otherwise be detected without use of the scale, and decreased frequency of under-treatment in patients with greater severity of withdrawal than would otherwise be determined without the scale.&lt;ref name="pmid9214531"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayo-Smith|first1=MF|title=Pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal.

The CIWA-Ar is actually a shortened, yet improved version of the CIWA, geared towards objectifying alcohol withdrawal symptom severity. It retains validity, usefulness and reliability between raters.&lt;ref name="pmid9214531" /&gt;

{{'}}'''Conjoint analysis'''{{'}} is a survey-based statistical technique used in market research that helps determine how people value different attributes (feature, function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to survey respondents and by analyzing how they make preferences between these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.

Conjoint originated in [[mathematical psychology]] and was developed by marketing professor [[Paul E. Green]] at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. Other prominent conjoint analysis pioneers include professor [[V Srinivasan|V. "Seenu" Srinivasan]] of Stanford University who developed a linear programming (LINMAP) procedure for rank ordered data as well as a self-explicated approach, Richard Johnson who developed the Adaptive Conjoint Analysis technique in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Richard M. | last = Johnson | title = History of ACA | booktitle = Proceedings of the Sawtooth Software Conference | date = September 2001 | location = Victoria, BC, Canada | url = http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/support/technical-papers/conference-proceedings/proceedings2001 | pages = 205–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan Louviere (University of Iowa) who invented and developed choice-based approaches to conjoint analysis and related techniques such as [[best–worst scaling]].

Today it is used in many of the social sciences and applied sciences including [[marketing]], [[product management]], and [[operations research]]. It is used frequently in testing customer acceptance of [[new product development|new product designs]], in assessing the appeal of [[advertising|advertisements]] and in [[service design]]. It has been used in [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]], but there are some who raise problems with this application of conjoint analysis.

Conjoint analysis techniques may also be referred to as multiattribute compositional modelling, discrete choice modelling, or stated preference research, and is part of a broader set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic analysis of decisions. These tools include Brand-Price Trade-Off, [[Simalto]], and mathematical approaches such as [[Analytic hierarchy process|AHP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparison of analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis methods in assessing treatment alternatives for stroke rehabilitation|vauthors=Ijzerman MJ, van Til JA, Bridges JF|year=212|pmid=22185216|doi=10.2165/11587140-000000000-00000|volume=5|journal=Patient|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary algorithms]] or [[rule-developing experimentation]].

== Conjoint design ==
A product or service area is described in terms of a number of attributes. For example, a television may have attributes of screen size, screen format, brand, price and so on. Each attribute can then be broken down into a number of levels. For instance, levels for screen format may be LED, LCD, or Plasma.

Respondents would be shown a set of products, prototypes, mock-ups, or pictures created from a combination of levels from all or some of the constituent attributes and asked to choose from, rank or rate the products they are shown. Each example is similar enough that consumers will see them as close substitutes, but dissimilar enough that respondents can clearly determine a preference. Each example is composed of a unique combination of product features. The data may consist of individual ratings, rank orders, or preferences among alternative combinations.

As the number of combinations of attributes and levels increases the number of potential profiles increases exponentially. Consequently, [[fractional factorial design]] is commonly used to reduce the number of profiles that have to be evaluated, while ensuring enough data are available for statistical analysis, resulting in a carefully controlled set of "profiles" for the respondent to consider.

== Types ==
The earliest forms of conjoint analysis were what are known as Full Profile studies, in which a small set of attributes (typically 4 to 5) are used to create profiles that are shown to respondents, often on individual cards. Respondents then rank or rate these profiles. Using relatively simple [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]] [[regression analysis]] the implicit utilities for the levels can be calculated. Two drawbacks were seen in these early designs.

Firstly, the number of attributes in use was heavily restricted. With large numbers of attributes, the consideration task for respondents becomes too large and even with fractional factorial designs the number of profiles for evaluation can increase rapidly. In order to use more attributes (up to 30), hybrid conjoint techniques were developed. The main alternative was to do some form of self-explication (rating of separate components) before the conjoint tasks and some form of adaptive computer-aided choice over the profiles to be shown.

The second drawback was that the task itself was unrealistic and did not link directly to behavioural theory. In real-life situations, the task would be some form of actual choice between alternatives rather than the more artificial ranking and rating originally used. Jordan Louviere pioneered an approach that used only a choice task which became the basis of [[choice-based conjoint analysis]] and [[discrete choice analysis]]. This stated preference research is linked to [[econometric modeling]] and can be linked to [[revealed preference]] where choice models are calibrated on the basis of real rather than survey data. Originally choice-based conjoint analysis was unable to provide individual level utilities as it aggregated choices across a market. This made it unsuitable for market segmentation studies. With newer hierarchical [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] analysis techniques, individual level utilities can be imputed back to provide individual level data.

== Information collection ==
Data for conjoint analysis are most commonly gathered through a market research survey, although conjoint analysis can also be applied to a carefully designed [[configurator]] or data from an appropriately designed [[test market]] experiment. Market research rules of thumb apply with regard to statistical sample size and accuracy when designing conjoint analysis interviews.

The length of the research questionnaire depends on the number of attributes to be assessed and the method of conjoint analysis in use. A typical adaptive conjoint questionnaire with 20-25 attributes may take more than 30 minutes to complete{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Choice based conjoint, by using a smaller profile set distributed across the sample as a whole may be completed in less than 15 minutes. Choice exercises may be displayed as a store front type layout or in some other simulated shopping environment.

==Analysis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Sample-output-of-conjoint-analysis.png|thumb|Sample output of conjoint analysis with application to marketing (a choice-based experiment on ice-cream performed on [http://www.conjoint.online/ Conjoint.ly])]]
Depending on the type of model, different econometric and statistical methods can be used to estimate utility functions. These utility functions indicate the perceived value of the feature and how sensitive consumer perceptions and preferences are to changes in product features. The actual estimation procedure will depend on the design of the task and profiles for respondents, in the type of specification, and the scale of measure for preferences (it can be ratio, ranking, choice) which can have a limited range or not. For rated full profile tasks, [[linear regression]] may be appropriate, for choice based tasks, [[maximum likelihood estimation]], usually with [[logistic regression]] are typically used. The original methods were monotonic analysis of variance or linear programming techniques, but contemporary marketing research practice has shifted towards choice-based models using multinomial logit, mixed versions of this model, and other refinements. [[Bayesian estimator]]s are also very popular. Hierarchical Bayesian procedures are nowadays relatively popular as well.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
* estimates psychological tradeoffs that consumers make when evaluating several attributes together
* measures preferences at the individual level
* uncovers real or hidden drivers which may not be apparent to the respondent themselves
* realistic choice or shopping task
* able to use physical objects
* if appropriately designed, the ability to model interactions between attributes can be used to develop needs based segmentation

===Disadvantages===
* designing conjoint studies can be complex
* with too many options, respondents resort to simplification strategies
* difficult to use for product positioning research because there is no procedure for converting perceptions about actual features to perceptions about a reduced set of underlying features
* respondents are unable to articulate attitudes toward new categories, or may feel forced to think about issues they would otherwise not give much thought to
* poorly designed studies may over-value emotional/preference variables and undervalue concrete variables
* does not take into account the number items per purchase so it can give a poor reading of market share

==Practical applications==

===Market research===

One practical application of conjoint analysis in business analysis is given by the following example: A real estate developer is interested in building a high rise apartment complex near an urban Ivy League university. To ensure the success of the project, a market research firm is hired to conduct focus groups with current students. Students are segmented by academic year (freshman, upper classmen, graduate studies) and amount of financial aid received. Study participants are given a series of index cards. Each card has 6 attributes to describe the potential building project (proximity to campus, cost, telecommunication packages, laundry options, floor plans, and security features offered). The estimated cost to construct the building described on each card is equivalent. Participants are asked to order the cards from least to most appealing. This forced ranking exercise will indirectly reveal the participants' priorities and preferences. Multi-variate [[regression analysis]] may be used to determine the strength of preferences across target market segments.

===Litigation===

Federal courts in the United States have allowed expert witnesses to use conjoint analysis to support their opinions on the damages that an infringer of a patent should pay to compensate the patent holder for violating its rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 609 F. Supp. 2d 279 (N.D.N.Y. 2009); Sentius Int'l, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00825, 2015 WL 331939 (N.D. Cal.

'''Dentistry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that consists of the study, [[diagnosis]], prevention, and treatment of [[diseases]], disorders, and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]], commonly in the [[dentition]]  but also the [[oral mucosa]], and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ada.org/glossaryforprofessionals.aspx |title = Glossary of Dental Clinical and Administrative Terms |publisher = [[American Dental Association]] |accessdate = 1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although primarily associated with [[teeth]] among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the [[craniofacial]] complex including the [[temporomandibular joint]] and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures. 

Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct [[medical specialty]] of [[stomatology]] (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions.{{where|date=May 2018}}

Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a [[dentist]] and [[Dental auxiliary|dental auxiliaries]] ([[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, as well as [[dental therapist]]s). Most dentists either work in private practices ([[primary care]]), dental hospitals or ([[secondary care]]) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC. Remains from the early Harappan periods of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] ({{circa|3300}} BC) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm |work = BBC News |title = Stone age man used dentist drill |date = 6 April 2006 |accessdate = 24 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that dental surgery was the first specialization from [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=Suddick1990&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cro.sagepub.com/content/1/2/135.long |last1=Suddick |first1=RP | last2=Harris |first2=NO |title =Historical perspectives of oral biology: a series |journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine |date=1990 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=135–51 |doi =10.1177/10454411900010020301 |pmid = 2129621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term dentistry comes from ''dentist'', which comes from French ''dentiste'', which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=dentistry|title=dentistry - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is '''odontology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ὀδούς (odoús, "tooth")) – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.

==Dental treatment==
Dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity.&lt;ref name=Gambhir2015&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gambhir RS| title=Primary care in dentistry - an untapped potential | journal=J Family Med Prim Care | year= 2015 | volume= 4 | issue= 1 | pages= 13–8 | pmid=25810982 | doi=10.4103/2249-4863.152239 | pmc=4366984 | type=Review }} &lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.&lt;ref name=WHOoraldisease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/oral_health/disease_burden/global/en/|title=What is the burden of oral disease?|publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common [[Dental disease|oral diseases]] which are [[dental caries]] (tooth decay) and [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the [[dental restoration|restoration of teeth]], [[dental extraction|extraction]] or surgical removal of teeth, [[scaling and root planing]] and endodontic [[endodontic therapy|root canal]] treatment.

All dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a "[[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]" (DDS) or "[[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]" (DMD). Dentists need to complete additional qualifications or continuing education to carry out more complex treatments such as [[sedation]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], and [[dental implant]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), prosthetic ([[dentures]]), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[sedative]]s, and any other drugs used in patient management.

Dentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper [[hygiene]] and regular, twice yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes]], [[celiac disease]] or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Gambhir2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIHCDdiagnosis /&gt;&lt;ref name=EstrellaBoynton2010&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Estrella MR, Boynton JR| title=General dentistry's role in the care for children with special needs: a review | journal=Gen Dent | year= 2010 | volume= 58 | issue= 3 | pages= 222–9 | pmid=20478802 | type=Review }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daFonseca2010&gt;{{cite journal| author=da Fonseca MA| title=Dental and oral care for chronically ill children and adolescents | journal=Gen Dent | year= 2010 | volume= 58 | issue= 3 | pages= 204–9; quiz 210-1 | pmid=20478800 | type=Review  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have also shown that [[gum disease]] is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, [[heart disease]], and [[preterm birth]]. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as "oral-systemic health".

Dr. John M. Harris started the world's first dental school in [[Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio|Bainbridge, Ohio]], and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a [[Harris Dental Museum|dental museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1217–1218.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dental college, [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine|Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery]], established in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = History |url = http://www.dental.upenn.edu/about_us/history |website = Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine |accessdate = 13 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Temple University]] accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Clinical decision making in restorative dentistry, endodontics, and antibiotic prescription |journal = J Dent Educ |volume = 72 |issue = 1 |pages = 81–6 |date = January 2008 |pmid = 18172239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even from different dental schools in one country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Decision making of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Dental Schools graduates in every day dentistry—is there a difference? |journal = J Isr Dent Assoc |volume = 23 |issue = 2 |pages = 19–23 |date = April 2006 |pmid = 16886872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from [[Israel]]i dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic [[Tooth impaction|impacted]] [[third molar]] (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Zadik Yehuda |author2 = Levin Liran |title = Decision making of Israeli, East European, and South American dental school graduates in third molar surgery: is there a difference? |journal = J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume = 65 |issue = 4 |pages = 658–62 |date = April 2007 |pmid = 17368360 |doi = 10.1016/j.joms.2006.09.002 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WKF-4N8JDW3-J&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=734474d0fe654970b56c219106722fb6 |accessdate = 16 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the 1878 British Dentists Act and 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of "dentist" and "dental surgeon" to qualified and registered practitioners.&lt;ref name="125years"&gt;Gelbier, Stanley. [http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v199/n7/full/4812875a.html 125 Years of Developments in Dentistry]. British Dental Journal (2005); 199, 470–473. Page accessed 11 December 2007. The 1879 register is referred to as the "Dental Register".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdatimeline" /&gt; However, others could legally describe themselves as "dental experts" or "dental consultants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BEdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2752%2C3609354 |title = Banning Clerks, Colliers and other Charlatans |author=J Menzies Campbell |work = [[The Glasgow Herald]] |date = 8 February 1955 |page=3 |accessdate = 5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.rcsed.ac.uk/media/4014/dentistry_history.pdf History of Dental Surgery in Edinburgh (PDF)], hosted on the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh website. Page accessed 11 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Dental Association]], formed in 1880 with Sir [[John Tomes]] as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally.&lt;ref name="125years" /&gt; Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the [[General Dental Council]].

In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]]) or Doctor of Dental Medicine ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]]). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc]]) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/preprofessional/documents/Dentist.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.)|website=Purdue.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Union]] the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.

==Specialties {{anchor|Specialities&lt;!--alt spelling--&gt;}}==
{{Main article|Specialty (dentistry)}}
Some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:

* [[Dental public health]] – The study of [[epidemiology]] and social health policies relevant to oral health.
* Conservative dentistry and endodontics: The art and science of restoring the tooth form and function when destructed by carious and non carious lesions affecting the teeth, before involvement of pulp or root canal is termed as conservative dentistry. When the root canal are involved, the speciality is known as endodontics. This speciality degree is awarded in India.
* [[Endodontics]] (also called endodontology) – [[Root canal therapy]] and study of diseases of the [[dental pulp]] and periapical tissues.
* [[Forensic odontology]] – The gathering and use of dental evidence in law. This may be performed by any [[dentist]] with experience or training in this field. The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.
* [[Geriatric dentistry]] or Geriodontics – The delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial pathology]] – The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial radiology]] – The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]] (also called oral surgery) – [[Extraction (dental)|Extractions]], [[Dental implant|implants]], and surgery of the jaws, mouth and face.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The scope of Oral and maxillofacial surgery is variable. In some countries, both a medical and dental degree is required for training, and the scope includes head and neck oncology and craniofacial deformity.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oral biology]] – Research in dental and craniofacial biology
* [[Oral Implantology]] – The art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants.
* [[Oral medicine]] – The clinical evaluation and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[oral cavity|oral]] [[oral mucosa|mucosal]] [[oral pathology|diseases]]
* [[Orthodontics]] and [[dentofacial orthopedics]]  – The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
* [[Pediatric dentistry]] (also called pedodontics) – Dentistry for children
* [[Periodontology]] (also called periodontics) – The study and treatment of diseases of the [[periodontium]] (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
* [[Prosthodontics]] (also called prosthetic dentistry) – [[Denture]]s, [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] and the restoration of implants. Some prosthodontists further their training in "oral and maxillofacial prosthodontics", which is the discipline concerned with the replacement of missing facial structures, such as ears, eyes, noses, etc.
* [[Special needs dentistry]] (also called special care dentistry) – Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities.
* [[Veterinary dentistry]], a speciality of [[veterinary medicine]] – The field of dentistry applied to the care of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.avdc.org/ |title = AVDC Home |publisher = Avdc.org |date = 29 November 2009 |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.evdc.info/ |title = EVDC web site |publisher = Evdc.info |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tooth decay was low in [[Paleolithic diet|pre-agricultural]] societies,  the growth in [[Agriculture|farming]] society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in [[tooth decay]] (cavities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160229-how-our-ancestors-drilled-rotten-teeth |title = How our ancestors drilled rotten teeth |last = Barras |first = Colin |publisher = BBC |date = 29 February 2016 |accessdate = 1 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.discovery.com/history/oldest-dentistry-found-in-14000-year-old-tooth-1507156.htm |title = Oldest Dentistry Found in 14,000-Year-Old Tooth |publisher = [[Discovery Channel]] |date = 16 July 2015 |accessdate = 21 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the Neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://news.ku.edu/2017/06/23/analysis-neanderthal-teeth-marks-uncovers-evidence-prehistoric-dentistry |title = Analysis of Neanderthal teeth marks uncovers evidence of prehistoric dentistry |publisher = The University of Kansas |date = 28 June 2017 |accessdate = 1 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC.&lt;ref name="Coppa"&gt;Coppa, A. et al. 2006.

An ancient [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text describes a "[[tooth worm]]" as the cause of [[dental caries]].&lt;ref name="adahistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp |title=History of Dentistry: Ancient Origins |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QNWCvbtm?url=http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp |archive-date=16 July 2007 |work=American Dental Association |accessdate=9 January 2007 |df=dmy |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, [[Egypt]], Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the writings of [[Homer]]{{where|date=April 2016}}, and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon [[Guy de Chauliac]] still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.&lt;ref name="suddickhistorical"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Suddick Richard P., Harris Norman O. |year=1990 |title=Historical Perspectives of Oral Biology: A Series |url=http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/1/2/135.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=135–151 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218025641/http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/1/2/135.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] scholars [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with [[forceps]], and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws.&lt;ref name="History Of Dentistry"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://completedentalguide.co.uk/history-of-dentistry/ |title = History Of Dentistry |work = Complete Dental Guide |accessdate = 29 June 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150814/http://completedentalguide.co.uk/history-of-dentistry/ |archivedate = 14 July 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the first use of dental appliances or [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] comes from the [[Etruscans]] from as early as 700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://edwardmoondds.com/history-of-dentistry-research-group/ |title = History of Dentistry Research Page, Newsletter |publisher = Rcpsg.ac.uk |accessdate = 9 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Egypt, [[Hesy-Ra]] is the first named "dentist" (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] medical writer [[Cornelius Celsus]] wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing [[emollients]] and [[astringents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://science.jrank.org/pages/1995/Dentistry-Skill-superstition.html |title = Dentistry – Skill And Superstition |publisher = Science.jrank.org |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dentaltreatment.org.uk/history.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091201213847/http://www.dentaltreatment.org.uk/history.html |archivedate = 1 December 2009 |title = Dental Treatment in the Ancient Times |publisher = Dentaltreatment.org.uk |accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgams]] were first documented in a [[Tang Dynasty]] medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.&lt;ref name="Bjørklund1"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bjørklund G |title = The history of dental amalgam (in Norwegian) |journal = Tidsskr nor Laegeforen |volume = 109 |issue = 34–36 |pages = 3582–3585 |date = 1989 |pmid = 2694433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=czarnetzki&gt;{{cite journal |last = Czarnetzki |first = A. |author2 = Ehrhardt S. |title = Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe |journal = International Journal of Anthropology |date = 1990 |volume = 5 |issue = 4 |pages = 325–332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as [[The Canon of Medicine|The Canon in medicine]] written by [[Avicenna]] and Al-Tasreef by [[Al-Zahrawi]] who is considered the greatest [[surgeon]] of the [[Middle ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)|last=Meri|first=Josef|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0415966900|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. while Al-Zahrawi made a lot of surgical tools that resemble the modern tools.

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the [[Middle Ages]] and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general [[physician]]s. [[Barber]]s usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated [[pain]] and associated chronic tooth [[infection]]. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, [[Guy de Chauliac]] most probably invented the dental pelican&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-pelican/|title = Pelican|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used to perform [[dental extraction]]s up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the [[dental key]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-toothkey-2/|title = Toothkey|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.dmd.co.il/antique-dental-instruments/antique-dental-forceps/|title = Forceps|author=Gregory Ribitzky|accessdate = 23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Device-teeth-fauchard.jpg|thumb|right|Dental [[needle-nose pliers]] designed by Fauchard in the late 17th century to use in [[prosthodontics]]]]

The first book focused solely on dentistry was the "Artzney Buchlein" in 1530,&lt;ref name="History Of Dentistry" /&gt; and the first dental textbook written in English was called "Operator for the Teeth" by Charles Allen in 1685.&lt;ref name="bdatimeline"&gt;[http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx The story of dentistry: Dental History Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309235717/http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx |date=9 March 2012 }}, hosted on the British Dental Association website. Page accessed 2 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 9 |date = July 1979 |publisher = HMSO |isbn = 0-10-176150-3 |url = http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-9/ |accessdate = 19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dentistry===

[[File:Microscope,The Dental cosmos (1907).jpg|thumb|right|A microscopic device used in dental analysis, {{circa|1900}}]]

It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' ({{circa|1656}} pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:

{{Quote|quote=The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}

The French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the "father of modern dentistry". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watchmaker]]s, [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.&lt;ref name="Besombes"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard (1678–1761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality |author = André Besombes |author2 = Phillipe de Gaillande |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy |date = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberger"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago |author = Bernhard Wolf Weinberger |date = 1941 |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]

Fauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of [[ivory]] or [[bone]]. He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included "basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery".&lt;ref name="Besombes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberger" /&gt;

[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Dentist's chair]]

After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Moore, Wendy |authorlink = Wendy Moore |title = The Knife Man |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC |accessdate = 8 March 2012 |date = 30 September 2010 |publisher = Transworld |pages = 223–224 |isbn = 978-1-4090-4462-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |format=PDF |title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |first=Helen |last=Dingwall |date=April 2004 |work=History of Dentistry Newsletter |issue=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191323/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards in modern dentistry===
{{main|Occupational hazards in dentistry}}
Long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and [[tinnitus]]. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss|website=NIDCD|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&amp;p_part_number=1910|website=Osha.gov|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[NIOSH]]), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.

Within the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=M|title=Is someone listening to the din of occupational noise exposure in dentistry|journal=RDH|date=1999|issue=19|pages=34-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merrel|first1=HB|title=Noise pollution and hearing loss in the dental office|journal=Dental Assisting Journal|date=1992|volume=61|issue=3|pages=6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.D.|title=Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: A pilot study|journal=Journal of Dental Hygiene|date=2002|volume=76|issue=4|pages=262-269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational Health Problems in Modern Dentistry: A Review|journal=Industrial Health|date=2007|volume=45|issue=5|pages=611-621|doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational hygiene practices of dentists in southern Thailand|journal=International Dentistry Journal|date=2001|issue=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.

'''Ernesto Pugibet''', or, '''Ernet Pugibet''' in French, (May 12, 1853 - March 5, 1915) was a [[French Mexican]] entrepreneur. He is regarded as one of the key figures in Mexico's industrial revolution, at the turn of the 20th century, and a pioneer of early advertising.&lt;ref name=rfm&gt;[http://www.rfm.org.mx/boletin5rfm.pdf ''Racines français au Mexique'' (RFM), bulletin n°5, November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Saint-Martory]], [[Haute-Garonne]], France, in 1853. He left his motherland in 1875  heading for Cuba where he would learn about the [[tobacco industry]]. In 1879 he immigrated to Mexico where he would later establish the cigarette factory known as [[El Buen Tono]]. He married Guadalupe de la Portilla in 1887 and fathered three children, Juan, Ernesto and Ana Maria. He died on March 5, 1915 in Paris, France.

'''Felipe Contepomi''' (born 20 August 1977) is an [[Argentine]] rugby coach who is currently the backs coach at [[Leinster Rugby]]. He was a [[rugby union]] footballer who played [[Fly-half (rugby union)|fly-half]] or [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]]; his last club was [[Club Newman]], in the first division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires|URBA]] championship. He was also a key player for [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]], having played 15 years for the national team. His twin brother [[Manuel Contepomi|Manuel]] was also a ''Puma''. In June 2015 he was appointed coach of Argentina XV. Contepomi was inducted into the [[World Rugby Hall of Fame]] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/news/293371?lang=en |title=Five legends inducted into World Rugby Hall of Fame |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Born 20 August 1977 in [[Buenos Aires]], Contepomi started playing rugby for his secondary school [[Colegio Cardenal Newman]], and then for [[Newman Club (rugby)|Club Newman]] in Buenos Aires. In 2003 he joined [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] from [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] on a four-year contract following Bristol's relegation in the [[2002–03 Zurich Premiership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/3039375.stm|title=Leinster sign Contepomi|date=19 May 2003|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a major role in Leinster's run in the [[2005–06 Heineken Cup]], helping Leinster to a 41–35 win over Cup holders [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]], scoring 21 points in the process and winning the man of the match award. That year he was top scorer in both the [[2005–06 Celtic League]] and the Heineken Cup.

In late January 2006, Contepomi's former girlfriend, Paula, gave birth to their daughter, Catalina. Only hours later, Contepomi played for Leinster the [[Pro14|Celtic League]] match against the [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Border Reivers]], a game in which he went on to score 22 points.&lt;ref&gt;Magners League. [http://www.magnersleague.com/matchcentre/1720.php Leinster crush Border Reivers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130128132350/http://www.magnersleague.com/matchcentre/1720.php |date=28 January 2013 }}, 22 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November of that year, [[Agustín Pichot]] said that Contepomi was a better player than [[All Black]] fly-half, [[Dan Carter]], the winner of the 2005 [[IRB International Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;Fox Sports, [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20721251-23217,00.html Contepomi "better than Carter"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223702/http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20721251-23217,00.html |date=26 September 2007 }}, 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2007, the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] in Dublin conferred him with the medical degrees of MB BCh BAO ([[National University of Ireland|NUI]]) LRCP&amp;SI. He subsequently worked in [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin]].

Contepomi won the 2007 Rugby Writers of Ireland Player of the Year award. While playing at Leinster, his nominal 'local club' of origin was County Carlow [[Co Carlow Football Club]], a provincial side which later got into financial difficulties and is now a minor Junior concern.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Examiner [http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/rugby/difficulties-may-force-carlow-rfc-to-close-doors-145425.html], 16 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2009, it was announced that Contepomi would be leaving Leinster at the end of the season, and that he had signed a 4-year deal to join French side [[RC Toulonnais|RC Toulon]] from the [[2009–10 Top 14 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/12_12379.php|title=Contepomi Makes Toulon Switch|date=12 March 2009|publisher=European Rugby Cup|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/7940731.stm|title=Contepomi to leave Leinster fold |date=13 March 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contepomi played a role in the Leinster win over Munster in the [[Heineken Cup]] semi-final on 2 May 2009. After scoring a drop goal after 15 minutes in, he was helped off the pitch after suffering a knee injury half an hour in. An MRI scan confirmed he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out of action for 6 months post-op.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8031989.stm|title=Contepomi to miss Heineken final |date=3 May 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost exactly on schedule, he made his Toulon debut on 21 November against [[CA Brive|Brive]], coming off the bench and scoring a penalty in Toulon's 19–10 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scrum.com/francetop14/rugby/story/106010.html |title= Top 14 – Round 13 Review: Castres rout Toulouse |publisher=''Scrum.com'' |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contepomi left RC Toulon to take the fly-half position at Stade Français in time for the 2011–12 season.

==International career==
[[File:Felipe Contepomi 2011.jpg|thumb|Contepomi during [[2011 Rugby World Cup]]]]

Contepomi was one of the stars of world rugby and was also set to lead the [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina national team]] into a new era after being named captain in 2008. The former U19, U21 and Sevens international made his Pumas debut against Chile in 1998 and has been an integral part of Argentinean rugby ever since.

The multi-talented Contepomi made his international break-through at fly-half and while he has played much of his rugby in that position he recently has found his place at inside centre with Juan Martin Hernandez preferred at No.10.

He was named in José Luis Imhoff and Alex Wyllie's squad for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] squad, where the Pumas made the quarter-finals for the first time. Marcelo Loffreda took charge of the national side in 2000 and Contepomi retained his place, eventually nailing down a starting berth 2001.

He notably notched a full house on his way to 25 points in the 30–16 victory over Wales in Cardiff on 10 November 2001. He was also part of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] squad, featuring in three of the Pumas' pool games as they were forced to play four games in a fortnight.

In 2004, Contepomi weighed in with 14 points as Argentina condemned France to their first defeat at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille. He also faced the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2005 and at the end of 2006 he was part of the Pumas side that scored their first ever victory over England at Twickenham.

The Pumas stunned the rugby world with an inspired performance at the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in France. Contepomi was a key player throughout the campaign – featuring in all seven matches as the Pumas claimed third place in the sport's global showpiece.

He was the second highest points scorer in the tournament – notably kicking four penalties in the shock opening victory over hosts France and 11 points in both the pool victory over Ireland and the quarter-final against Scotland. Contepomi was nominated by the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] as one of five candidates for the 2007 [[IRB International Player of the Year|International Player of the Year]] award, which was won by [[Bryan Habana]].

Following the retirement of veteran scrum-half [[Agustín Pichot]], Contepomi was handed the captaincy of the Pumas in 2008 by new coach Santiago Phelan ahead of the opening clash of the year against Scotland.

A knee injury suffered in Leinster's [[Heineken Cup]] semi-final victory over [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] in 2009 ruled him out of action for over a year but he returned to Pumas colours in 2010 and won a 31-point haul in their 41–13 victory over Six Nations champions France.

He was part of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup squads#Argentina|Argentine squad]] for the [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] [[Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand playing as captain.

Contepomi played his last international game with Argentina on Saturday 5 October 2013 in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] during [[The Rugby Championship]]. At the time of his retirement, Contepomi achieved the most test matches played for Argentina (87)&lt;ref name=caps/&gt;&lt;ref name=canchallena/&gt; and the most points scored in international games (651).&lt;ref name=goals/&gt; He worked with his father in their medical practice in [[Buenos Aires]] and as assistant coach in the Super XV for new Argentine franchise [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)]].

==Coaching career==
Contepomi joined Argentina XV in 2015 as a head coach alongside Ricardo Le Fort. In 2018, he was appointed as new Backs Coach to Leinster, succeeding Girvan Dempsey, who moved to Bath.

'''Fuck for Forest''' ('''FFF''') is a non-profit [[environmental organisation]] founded in 2004 in [[Norway]] by Leona Johansson and Tommy Hol Ellingsen. It funds itself through a website of sexually explicit videos and photographs, charging a membership fee for access. A portion of funds are donated to the cause of rescuing the world's [[rainforest]]s. It is the world's first eco-porn organization and may be the only porn website specifically created to raise money for a cause.  The group moved from [[Oslo, Norway]] to [[Berlin, Germany]] following the trial of its founders for having sex in public.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-04-13/home-and-garden/17366933_1_fff-forest-rain |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] |title=Eco-porn: Great Sex For A Good Cause |date=April 13, 2005 |first=Gregory |last=Dicum |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grist&gt;
{{Cite news |author= Harris, Lissa |title= Norwegian Wood. Porn activists go all the way to save the rainforest |url= http://www.grist.org/article/harris-naked/ |work= [[Grist (magazine)|Grist]] |date= October 6, 2004 |accessdate= October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Fuck for Forest co-founders Leona Johansson and Tommy Hol Ellingsen had backgrounds in progressive and green theater and teaching troubled teens.  The two started Fuck for Forest to protest the state of the world's rainforests and to make a difference. In its first six months of existence the group received seed funding from the government of Norway for the creation of an alternative environmental group.  Ellingsen believes that "eco-porn" is the obvious choice to make a difference.  He explained: "Porn makes really, really a lot of money, so why not use that money for good?" In 2004, its first year of existence, the organisation's website netted over $100,000 for rain forest protection through the sale of paid memberships.&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;&lt;ref name=grist/&gt;&lt;ref name=city-journal/&gt;

==Operations==
Website subscribers pay $20 per month and the organization says that over 80 percent of the money goes to charities that work to preserve the world's rain forests.  The organisation's unorthodox methods have made it difficult to distribute the money it makes. Both the Norwegian chapter of the [[Rainforest Foundation Fund]], and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] in the [[Netherlands]] have refused to accept donations from FFF.  As a result, Fuck for Forest is working on a project to work directly with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] communities in [[Costa Rica]] and the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;&lt;ref name=grist/&gt;&lt;ref name=city-journal/&gt;

==Public sex controversy==
The group's founders gained notoriety when they had sex on stage during a 2004 [[Quart Festival]] concert featuring Norwegian singer [[Kristopher Schau]] and his band [[The Cumshots]]. After delivering a brief talk on the impact humans have on forests, Ellingsen asked "How far are you willing to go to save the world?" and the pair began stripping.  A banner was raised on stage informing the audience of 5,000 that the couple was having sex to save the rainforest.&lt;ref name=sex&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pub.nettavisen.no/nettavisen/english/article250240.ece |work=NETTAVISEN |title=Couple had sex on stage during concert |date=July 7, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting on the event Ellingsen said, "I had a bit of a stagefright, but it disappeared as soon as I got going."  Johansson added that "I got turned on by all the people."&lt;ref name=sexcomments&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/couple-has-sex-on-stage-at-norwegian-music-festival-photos-available/#jtE2kAjT1VKKYR0r.99 |title=Couple Has Sex On Stage At Norwegian Music Festival: Photos Available |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingsen and Johansson were fined 10,000 Kroner (US$1,470) each for a public sex act, a violation of Norwegian law. Commenting on their arrest, Ellingsen said "It is ridiculous that we are prosecuted and sentenced on a moral basis at the same time as Norway is in the war against Iraq...Violence is aired on TV every day, and if this is so terrible, we could have called this performance art, and we wouldn't have been fined then?"  The event promoters were not fined because they claimed they were not aware beforehand.&lt;ref name=NETTAVISEN&gt;{{cite news |url= http://pub.nettavisen.no/nettavisen/english/article250722.ece |work= NETTAVISEN |title= Couple refuses sex fine |date=August 7, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two made their court appearance dressed in children's clothes. Ellingsen dropped his trousers and showed his penis during a break in the court proceedings. Ellingsen told [[Nettavisen]] that "We would have liked to have fucked here in court as well, it’s a nice space, but we would probably be thrown in jail."&lt;ref name=appearance&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/2004/11/10/lack-of-discretion-award/ |title=Lack of Discretion Award |work=NETTAVISEN |date=November 11, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consequently moved its headquarters to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;&lt;ref name=city-journal&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon_08_26_05td.html |work=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]] |first=Theodore |last=Dalrymple |title=Ethical Pornographers? |date=August 26, 2005|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingsen said that within three months of their arrest, the website has attracted more than 1,000 new members, each paying $15 per month.&lt;ref name=grist/&gt;

On 2 June 2011, Fuck for Forest members simulated intercourse in [[Oslo Cathedral]] during Mass. The leader of Oslo Bishopry told Norwegian media that the stunt makes him "sad on behalf of those who did it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=kl.10:02 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/06/03/nyheter/kirke/innenriks/16775501/ |title=Blir mest trist - nyheter |publisher=Dagbladet.no |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two of the individuals performing in the Cathedral were ordered by the [[Oslo District Court]] to pay fines of 9,000 ($1171.86) and 7,500 ($976.55) [[Norwegian krone|krone]]r for indecent behavior and outraging public decency (''seksuelt krenkende og uanstendig adferd''),  and also to pay 2,000 kroner ($260.41) each for the trial cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10088204 Verdens Gang - Fikk 15 500 i bot for sex-stunt i kirke]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
The 2006 [[documentary film]] ''[[Fuck (film)|Fuck]]'' was released during the [[Cannes Film Festival]] (though not as a part of the festival). The poster for the film showed FFF onstage during the Quart Festival incident. The film sought to explore artists who experiment with modes of expression that challenge prevailing social mores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Karlsen, Morten Ø. |author2=Johnsen, Vibeke |title= Fuck for Forest i Cannes |url= http://www.side2.no/film/article641966.ece |work= [[Nettavisen]] |language= Norwegian |date= May 21, 2006 |accessdate= October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature-length cinema documentary entitled ''[[Fuck for Forest (film)|Fuck for Forest]]'' was released in 2012. The film, directed by Michał Marczak, is a narrative-driven story that loosely revolves around the group's environmental projects, but focuses on subjects like sexuality, contemporary lifestyles, western morals and cultural variants of human perception.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39746">The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Tanzania was 790. This is compared with 449 in 2008 and 610.2 in 1990. The UN Child Mortality Report 2011 reports a decrease in under-five mortality from 155 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 76 per 1,000 live births in 2010, and in neonatal mortality from 40 per 1,000 live births to 26 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Child Mortality Report 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2011_Final.pdf|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the report The State of the World's Midwifery is to highlight ways in which the [[Millennium Development Goals]] can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal health. In Tanzania there are only two midwives per 1,000 live births; and the lifetime risk of death during delivery for women is one in 23.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|access-date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal and child health status===
Both maternal and child health are interdependent and substantially contributing to high burden of [[Death|mortality]] worldwide. Every year, 289,000 women die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and 6.6 million children below 5 years of age die of complications in the newborn period and of common childhood diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Consultation on improving measurement of the quality of maternal, newborn and child care in health facilities|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/128206/1/9789241507417_eng.pdf?ua=1|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (SSA), which includes [[Tanzania]], contribute higher proportion of maternal and child mortality. Due to considerable proportion of mortality being attributed by maternal and child health, the [[United Nations]] together with other international agencies incorporated the two into [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5. In this regard, Tanzania through the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]] (MoHSW) adopted different strategies and efforts to promote safe motherhood and improve [[child survival]]. Similarly, in an effort to improve maternal and child health, Tanzania’s government has declared maternal and child health services to be exempt from user fees in government facilities.

===Maternal health indicators===

====Maternal mortality ratio====

Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries. Statistically, maternal mortality contributes to only 2.3 per cent of the total mortality.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web | author=UNDP | title=Tanzania MDG 5: Improve maternal health | url=http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg5 | accessdate=2 September 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907074303/http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg5/ | archivedate=7 September 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) represents the risk associated with each pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHOMM"&gt;{{cite web | author=World Health Organization | title=Health statistics and information systems-MMR | url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en | accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMR is estimated by using both number of [[maternal deaths]] and live births. Many low-income countries have no or very little data and modelling is used to obtain a national estimate.&lt;ref name="WHOMM"/&gt; According to estimates in 2013, total maternal deaths and MMR in Tanzania were 7,900 and 410 per 100,000 live births respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Countdown 2014 report for Tanzania | url=http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/documents/2014Report/TanzaniaURep_Country_Profile_2014.pdf | accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to MDG 5, Tanzania is supposed to reach the MMR of 230 per 100,000 live births by 2015. Reduction of maternal deaths is one of the main goals of the Tanzanian poverty reduction strategy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr1117.pdf ''National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty II'', Tanzania Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, July 2010, page 73, accessed 26 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and the health sector reform program, but progress has been slow. The slow progress in reducing maternal mortality on mainland Tanzania is compounded by the impact of the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

====Antenatal care coverage====

Good care during pregnancy is important for the health of the mother and the development of the unborn baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | title=Antenatal care -chapter 2 | url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_2.pdf | accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health problems in pregnant women can be prevented, detected, and treated during antenatal care visits with trained health workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | title=Global Health Observatory (ANC) | url=http://www.who.int/gho/maternal_health/reproductive_health/antenatal_care_text/en | accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a minimum of four antenatal care (ANC) visits. The ''Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010'' showed that 98 percent made at least one ANC visit and 43 percent made four or more visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/references/2010TDHS.pdf Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010, National Bureau of Statistics, Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, April 2011, page 129, accessed 26 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skilled birth deliveries====
This indicator is directly linked to a process of giving birth by pregnant woman, and most of maternal [[Death|mortality]] are likely to happen at this stage. Most maternal deaths result from haemorrhage, complications of unsafe [[abortion]], pregnancy-induced [[hypertension]], [[sepsis]] and [[obstructed labour]].&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNFPA|title=REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN REFUGEE SITUATIONS: AN INTER-AGENCY FIELD MANUAL|url=https://www.unfpa.org/emergencies/manual/3.htm|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these proportions of causes for maternal deaths are likely to differ from one country to another. According to official estimates, more than 20 women die of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications every day in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=White Ribbon Alliance|title=TANZANIA JOINS GLOBAL EFFORTS TO SAVE MOTHERS, NEWBORN LIVES|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/wra-page-release/tanzania-joins-global-efforts-save-mothers-newborn-lives/|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ensuring that mothers have access to a skilled attendant during labour can dramatically reduce the risk of death for the mother and newborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WAHA|title=Health topic: Maternal health|url=http://www.waha-international.org/?health-topics|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 [[Tanzania]] DHS, about 51% of deliveries were assisted by skilled personnel. While it was 41% in 1999 Tanzania DHS. Potentially the current figure national-wide will be more than 51 per cent. Shortage of health providers, among others, are limiting factors to be delivered by skilled provider. The ratio of doctors to patients in Tanzania is 1:25,000 and the ratio of nurses to patients is 1:23,000. While the ratio in the [[United States]] is 1:300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jakaya Kikwete|title=THE FIGHT FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA|url=http://www.ghdnews.com/index.php/global-health-challenges/maternal-and-child-health/45-the-fight-for-maternal-and-child-health-in-sub-saharan-africa|publisher=GHD WINTER 2014 DIGITAL EDITION|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President]] [[Jakaya Kikwete]] on May 2014 appealed to health workers in Tanzania to ensure that lives of women and children are not at risk during delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucas Lukumbo|title=PRESIDENT KIKWETE TO HEALTH WORKERS: YOU CAN STOP MATERNAL AND CHILD DEATHS|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/media/president-kikwete-health-workers-can-stop-maternal-child-deaths/|publisher=IPP MEDIA, White Ribbon Alliance|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tanzania, two thirds of women give birth in their own homes, because there are very few health facilities within reach that can provide life-saving emergency services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=White Ribbon Alliance|title=CAMPAIGN UPDATE: TANZANIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO LIFE SAVING CARE FOR WOMEN|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/opinions/campaign-update-tanzania-one-step-closer-life-saving-care-women/|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postnatal care coverage====
Every year in [[Africa]], at least 125,000 women and 870,000 newborns die in the first week after birth, yet this is when coverage and programmes are at their lowest along the continuum of care.&lt;ref name="WHOPMNCH"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Postnatal care -chapter 4|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_4.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since up to 50 per cent of maternal deaths occurs after delivery, a midwife or a trained and supervised Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) should visit all mothers as soon as possible within the first 24–48 hours after birth.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"/&gt; The 2010 figure in utilizing postnatal care in Tanzania was only 31 per cent according to TDHS.&lt;ref name="TDHS"&gt;{{cite web|author=USAID|publisher=TANZANIA DHS|date=2010|title=Demographic and Health Survey|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR243/FR243%5B24June2011%5D.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coverage of postnatal check-up within 4 hours after birth varies from 9 percent in the Lake zone to 34 percent in the Southern zone in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;  Postnatal care (PNC) programmes are among the weakest of all reproductive and child health programmes in [[Tanzania]] and [[Sub-Saharan African]] in general.&lt;ref name="WHOPMNCH"/&gt; Given the absence of PNC guidelines in Tanzania, the Reproductive and Child Health Section (RCHS) of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]] [Tanzania] reported in 2009 that is in the process of developing it to be used country-wide.&lt;ref name="MRISHO"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mrisho|date=2009|title= The use of antenatal and postnatal care: perspectives and experiences of women and health care providers in rural southern Tanzania|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2393-9-10.pdf|publisher=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|accessdate=2 September 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern family planning use====
The policy environment for [[family planning]] in Tanzania is mixed, but promising. At the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, President [[Kikwete]] highlighted Tanzania's continued efforts to improve family planning. He mentioned the [[National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty]] (MKUKUTA II) which has a strong family planning component, and the National Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan (2010) which endeavors to reach a contraceptive prevalence target of 60% of all women by 2015 and will require $88.2 million between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|url=http://advancefamilyplanning.org/tanzania|title=Tanzania|access-date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania's once successful family planning program has slowed markedly, with rates of contraceptive prevalence well below levels needed to reach current demand and country goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FHI360|title=PROGRESS in Tanzania: National Family Planning Costed Implementation Program|url=http://www.fhi360.org/projects/progress-tanzania-national-family-planning-costed-implementation-program|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, 34.4 percent of married women in 2010 reported use of any method of contraception, while modern methods reached a prevalence of 27.4 per cent.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; Factors limiting contraceptive prevalence in Tanzania include widespread misconceptions and concerns about side-effects, low acceptance of long–acting methods, erratic supplies and a limited range of choices, gaps in provider knowledge and skills (along with provider bias), competing priorities pursuing scarce resources, limited male involvement, poor communication between spouses, and the perceived value of large families also contribute to low use of family planning methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PATHFINDER|title=Reproductive Health and Family Planning in Tanzania: The Pathfinder International Experience|url=http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Reproductive-Health-and-Family-Planning-in-Tanzania-The-Pathfinder-International-Experience.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723213857/http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Reproductive-Health-and-Family-Planning-in-Tanzania-The-Pathfinder-International-Experience.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child health indicators===

====Infant and under-five mortality rate====

Children in sub-Saharan Africa are about over 16 times more likely to die before the age of five than children in developed regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | title=Fact sheet- reducing child mortality | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs178/en | accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania has reduced the [[infant mortality]] rate (IMR) of 101 to 38 per 1000 live births from 1990 to 2012 respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Infant mortality | url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.526?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has reduced substantially the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 166 to 54 per 1000 live births from 1990 to 2012 respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Under 5 mortality | url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.525?lang=en | accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malaria]] is the leading cause of death for Tanzanian children and is a major cause of maternal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=GHI | title=Tanzania Global Health Initiative Strategy 2010 -2015 | url=http://www.ghi.gov/whereWeWork/docs/TanzaniaStrategy.pdf | accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania is making considerable progress in the reduction of child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=UNICEF | title=Tanzania’s progress in maternal and child health | url=http://www.unicef.org/tanzania/6906_10741.html | accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that respect, Tanzania is likely to achieve MDG 4 of reducing child mortality.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"&gt;{{cite web | author=UNDP | title=Tanzania MDG4: Reduce child mortality | url=http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg4 | accessdate=3 September 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907052451/http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg4/ | archivedate=7 September 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant contribution to the reduction of under-five mortality is improved control measures of malaria, Acute Respiratory Infections, diarrhea; improved personal hygiene, environmental sanitation; and preventive, promotive as well as curative health services.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"/&gt; Tanzania's average annual rate of reduction of child mortality over the last 15 years was 4.6%, while, the Millennium Development Goal rate set by UN is an annual average rate of reduction of 4.3 percent.&lt;ref name="GAPMINDER"&gt;{{cite web | author=GAPMINDER | title=Tanzania: Fast drop in child mortality! | url=http://www.gapminder.org/news/tanzania-fast-drop-in-child-mortality/#.VAdgRfmSzRs | accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaccination coverage====
There have been improvements in the planning process, community ownership and involvement, improving coverage, effective mobilization of funds for the Expanded Program of Immunisation, improvements in the safety of vaccine delivery and introduction of new and underutilized vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Tanzania:Immunization and vaccines development (IVD)|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/tanzania/country-programmes/3112-immunization-and-vaccines-development-ivd.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2010 Demographic and Health Survey in Tanzania, 66% at 12 months of age were fully immunised during the survey.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; The 2010 DHS in Tanzania which is the latest, presents the BCG coverage of 95.5%, [[DPT vaccine]] coverage of 88%; Polio (Pol3) coverage of 84.9% and Measles coverage of 84.5%. The proportion of children vaccinated against measles increased from 80% in 2005 to 85% in 2010.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"/&gt; But the vaccination coverage in Tanzania presented to be more that 90% for each of the above vaccines according to [[World Health Organization]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="WHOA824"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Immunization|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A824?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Tanzania via the Minister of Health and Social Welfare, has urged in 2012 partners and stakeholders in the country to join the National Immunization Coordination Committee to ensure that all children in Tanzanian are covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IPP MEDIA|title=Minister: Children's immunization coverage satisfactory|url=http://www.ippmedia.com/frontend/?l=48917|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Electronic Immunisation Register has been established, which permits online access to the medical records of mothers and infants, enabling vaccination teams in remote areas to operate more effectively, especially with nomadic people.  It also helps to coordinate stock levels and order new supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Good data saves lives |url=http://gotlife.gavi.org/features/good-data-saves-lives/ |accessdate=28 November 2018 |publisher=Gavi |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exclusive breastfeeding====
In Tanzania by 2010, [[breastfeeding]] was initiated within the first hour of birth in 46.1% of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victor |first1=R |last2=Baines |first2=SK |last3=Agho |first3=KE |last4=Dibley |first4=MJ |date=7 January 2013|title=Determinants of breastfeeding indicators among children less than 24 months of age in Tanzania: a secondary analysis of the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/1/e001529.full.pdf+html |journal=BMJ Open |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e001529 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001529|pmid=23299109 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 97 percent of mothers in Tanzania do breastfeed, however, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in infants aged 0–6 months is 50 percent.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository -Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1100?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the national average reported to be 50% prevalence, one regional study focusing on Kilimanjaro region only revealed the general prevalence of 88.1% at one month, 65.5% at three months and 20.7% for an infant of six months of age, which is very low and did not vary between rural and urban.&lt;ref name="MGONGO"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mgongo|date=2013|title=Prevalence and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among women in Kilimanjaro region, Northern Tanzania: a population based cross-sectional study|url=http://www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/pdf/1746-4358-8-12.pdf|publisher=International Breastfeeding Journal|accessdate=3 September 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[multivariate analysis]] using 2010 TDHS data&lt;ref name="MGONGO"/&gt; revealed that the risk of delayed initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth was significantly higher among young mothers aged &lt;24 years, uneducated and employed mothers from rural areas who delivered by caesarean section and those who delivered at home and were assisted by traditional birth attendants or relatives. The risk factors associated with non-exclusive breastfeeding, during the first 6 months, were lack of professional assistance at birth and residence in urban areas.

====Child malnutrition====
[[Malnutrition]] in Tanzania is a contributing factor in an estimated 130 child deaths every day.&lt;ref name="UNICEF TANZANIA"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNICEF|title=Tanzania overview -nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/tanzania/10787_11047.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to 2010 TDHS, about 42 percent of children are stunted, 16 percent are underweight and 5 percent are wasted.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; Different efforts have been adopted in Tanzania to improve children nutrition status. Within a one-year interval from 2010 and 2011, significant reduction in malnutrition observed. In 2011 according to [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates on child malnutrition in Tanzania, children aged &lt;5 years stunted was 34.8% in 2011; underweight was 13.6% in 2011; wasted was 6.6% in 2011 and overweight was 5.5% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository -Child malnutrition|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1095?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions in Tanzania like [[Iringa]], [[Mbeya]] and [[Rukwa]] are among the five regions with the highest stunting and are all areas with high food production.&lt;ref name="UNICEF TANZANIA"/&gt; The case in Tanzania, is inconsistent with the common assumption that increasing agriculture and food production will automatically lead to improvements in nutrition.

==== Neonatal and under-five mortality 2030 ====
Reducing the number of children dying before their fifth birthday has been targeted in the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] under the health related goals. [[Tanzania]] has made an improvement in attaining the reduction of child mortality;&lt;ref name="Tanzania MDG report 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA|title=Country Report on Millennium Development Goals 2014, Entering 2015 with better MDG Scores|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/MDG/english/MDG%20Country%20Reports/MDGR%202014_TZ.pdf|website=UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, based on the Sustainable Development Goals, the country should further reduce in exact numbers the neonatal and under-five mortality rates by 2030.&lt;ref name="United Nations:Sustainable Development Goals" /&gt;

=====Sustainable Development Goals=====
[[Sustainable development goals]] have been developed as a new development agenda after the expiration of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in 2015. The third sustainable development goal aims to enhance healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.&lt;ref name="United Nations:Sustainable Development Goals"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=Sustainable Development Goals|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====SDG 3, target 3.2=====
The health related [https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ Sustainable Development Goal 3, target 3.2] targets a reduction of neonatal mortality to 12 per 1000 live births and under five mortality rate to 25 per 1000 live births by 2030.&lt;ref name="United Nations:Sustainable Development Goals" /&gt; The world under five mortality rate has declined from 90 in 1990 to 46 in 2013.&lt;ref name="UNICEF:State of the World's Children 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNICEF|title=State of the World's Children 2015|url=http://sowc2015.unicef.org/|website=UNICEF|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, the U5MR has declined from 167 in 1990 to 52 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.525]&lt;/ref&gt; The country ranks the 48 in the world in 2013 in under five mortality out of 194 countries.&lt;ref name="WHO:Under-five mortality data by country"&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Under-five mortality data by country|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.525|website=WHO: Global Health Observatory Data Repository|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 1 shows a comparison of under five mortality rate between the World and Tanzania with data from State of the World's Children 2015 Report&lt;ref name="UNICEF:State of the World's Children 2015" /&gt; and WHO,Global Health Observatory Data Repository.&lt;ref name="WHO:Under-five mortality data by country" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
Tanzania faces a "mature", generalized [[HIV]] epidemic. Among the 1.4 million people living with [[HIV]]/AIDS, 70.5 percent are 25 to 49 years old, and 15 percent are 15–24 years. In young women ages 15 to 24, there is an HIV prevalence rate of 3.8 percent, which is significantly higher than the 2.8 percent prevalence rate among young men in the same [[Demographic profile|age group]]. More than half of available hospital beds are occupied by HIV-infected persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccs_tza_en.pdf|title=WHO country cooperation strategy 2002-2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV is the leading cause of mortality in Tanzania, accounting for 17% of the annual deaths in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/tanzania/|title=Global health Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of deaths has been declining since 2001 from 339/100,000 to 159/ 100,000 in 2013 however prevalence rates have increased from 4.3% to 5.3%  and incidence has progressively decreased from 381/100,000 to 146/100,000 during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.afro.who.int/profiles_information/images/c/c8/Tanzania-Statistical_Factsheet.pdf|title=Tanzania Statistical Factsheet 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria===
[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|right|thumb|Malaria Clinic in Tanzania in partnership with [[Extreme Blue#Projects|SMS for Life]] program which organizes [[malaria vaccine]] delivery]]
Malaria exists throughout the year and is predominantly due to [[P. falciparum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/tza/en/|title=Tanzania, United Republic of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country had a decline of malaria cases over the years from 18.1% in 2001 to 9.7% in 2009 in under 5 year olds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://malariaworld.org/sites/default/files/mwjournal/article/MWJ2013_4_19.pdf|title=Towards malaria elimination and its implication for vector control, disease management and livelihoods in Tanzania|first=Leonard E.G. |last=Mboera |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is seen in the reduction of under 5 mortality rates which decreased from 165/ 100,000 in 1990 to 49/ 100,000 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_SOWC_2016.pdf|title=The State of the World's Children 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in malaria prevalence is also shown in the Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey 2015–16 (DHS-MIS 2015-16) with a 14% prevalence in 2015. This varied from Kagera's 41% and Geita's 38% to Zanzibar's &lt;1%. It is also 18% in the rural area and urban 4% and also highest in the poorest quintile (23%) and lowest among the richest quintile (1%).

===Diarrhoeal diseases===
For the year 2014, 6% of the deaths in Tanzania were attributed to diarrhoeal diseases. It is imperative to reduce diarrheal diseases if the country is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In the [[UNICEF]] Pneumonia and Diarrhea Report 2016, there are strategies outlined for the low income countries to adopt in the fight against these two leading killer diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/UNICEF-Pneumonia-Diarrhoea-report2016-web-version_final.pdf|title=UNICEF Pneumonia Diarrhea Disease Report 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower respiratory tract infections===
This is listed as the second leading cause of mortality in Tanzania according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] Tanzania Global Health Facts. According to the [[DHS-MIS 2015-16|Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey 2015–16]], there have been no changes over time of occurrence of LRTIs. However, the [[Expanded Program of Immunisation|EPI]] has included the [[pentavalent vaccine]] which protects against [[Haemophilus influenzae]], a common cause of [[pneumonia]].

===Tuberculosis===
There were 327/100,000 new cases of [[Tuberculosis|TB]] in 2014, up from 236/100,000 in 2001. The case detection rate dropped to 36% in 2014 from 68% in 2001 [[DHS-MIS 2015-16| Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey 2015–16]]. TB deaths have increased from 17/100,000 in 2001 to 58/100,000 in 2014. (These cases were in HIV negative people.) Tuberculosis accounted for 5% of deaths in Tanzania in 2014. 

===Non communicable diseases===
Tanzania has seen an increase of non communicable diseases as some of the leading causes of death. The major ones by contribution include: cancer 5%, ischemic heart disease 3% and stroke 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/tanzania/|title=Global health Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double burden of disease is causing an extra strain to the already fragile health system that is struggling to cope with the scourge of communicable diseases and high child and maternal mortality and morbidity.

== Occupational health ==
[[Tanzania]] is a [[United Republic]] of Former [[Tanganyika]] (currently referred to Tanganyika mainland) and Zanzibar. The estimated population has dramatically increased from 12.3 to 44.9 million people from 1967 to 2012 respectively (Figure 1. below),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=nbs|title=The United Republic of Tanzania: Population Distribution by Administrative Units: key findings: 2013.|url=http://nbs.go.tz/nbs/sensa/PDF/2012%20PHC%20POPULAR%20VERSION.pdf|website=nbs|accessdate=5 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083544/http://nbs.go.tz/nbs/sensa/PDF/2012%20PHC%20POPULAR%20VERSION.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current working group (15– 64 years of age)  of is estimated to be 52.2%. The National economy still depend mostly on agriculture that holds up to 40% of gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=tzdpg|title=Ministry of Health Tanzania: Human Resource For Health Country Profile 2012/13.|url=http://www.tzdpg.or.tz/fileadmin/documents/dpg_internal/dpg_working_groups_clusters/cluster_2/health/Key_Sector_Documents/HRH_Documents/Final_Country_Profile_2013.pdf|website=tzdpg|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agriculture sector employs 76.5% of workforce in the Country; Industry sector (4.3%); and services (19.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=kpmg|title=Monitoring African Sovereign Risk: Tanzanian Snapshort: 2013 Quarter 3|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Africa/en/KPMG-in-Africa/Documents/2013%20Q3%20Snapshots/KPMG_Tanzania%202013Q3.pdf |website=kpmg|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational health in Tanzania perspective===
The country had been operating under Factories Ordinances Cap. 297 of 1950 that provided for [[occupational health and safety]] standards in the country. Through various sector reform programmes, The National established Occupational Health and Safety Authority under The Executive Agency Act No. 30 of 1997 which become officially operational late 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Authority- Tanzania: Background|url=http://osha.go.tz/index.php/about-osha/background|website=OSHA-TANZANIA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909014147/http://osha.go.tz/index.php/about-osha/background|archivedate=2015-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2003 the Occupational Health and Safety Act No. 5 was enacted giving the authority mandatory objectives of providing the safety, health and welfare of persons at work in factories and other places of work; to provide for the protection of persons other than persons at work against hazards to health and safety arising out of or in connection with activities of persons at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Republic of Tanzania: The Occupational Health and safety Act No.5 of 2013|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_151291.pdf|website=ILO|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other initiatives the country has gone through includes incorporation of [[occupational health]] and safety matters in other Principal legislation such as The Tropical Pesticides Research Institute Act of 1979;  The Pharmaceuticals and Poison Act of 1978; The Atomic Energy Act of 2003, The Industrial and Consumer Chemicals Act of 1985;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational safety and health: Tanzania Country profile, 2004|url=//www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/policy/wcms_187634.pdf|website=ILO|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mining Act of 2010 and Employment and labour relation Act No.6 of 2004 with subsequent establishment of Labour Court (being part of The High Court of Tanzania).

In 2008 another important step was made – the establishment of Workers' Compensation Fund through Workers Compensation Act No. 20 of 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Republic of Tanzania: Workers Compensation Act No. 20 of 2008|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_125593.pdf|website=ILO|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with objectives of providing for compensation to employees for disablement of death caused by or result from injuries or diseases sustained or contracted in the course of employment; to establish Fund for administration and regulation of workers compensation and to provide for related matter.

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), estimates that more than 2.3 million people die of work-related accidents and diseases every year and 317 million accidents annually occur due to workplace hazards. The figures further explain that out of 2.34 million occupational fatalities every year; only 321,000 are due to accidents, the remaining 2.02 million deaths are caused by various types of work-related diseases, which correspond to a daily average between 5,500 up to 6,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Labour Organization: Health and Safety at Work: facts and Figures|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/media-centre/issue-briefs/WCMS_206117/lang--en/index.htm|website=ILO|accessdate=7 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913202847/http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/media-centre/issue-briefs/WCMS_206117/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational injuries===
Every individual worker needs good working environment that is safe and free from any kind of life - threatening hazards. This may be possible where most if not all health risks are identified at workplace and correct measures are put in place and adhered by all workers around.
Mining sector is fast growing in a country and significant number of workers both in conventional and small scale mining are employed.

Status of [[occupational accidents]] and [[injuries]] varies considerably between different sources. It is estimated that in [[mining]]/quarry, the injury rate is 17 per 1,000 workers whereas [[Industry]] sector is responsible for 10.1% of total occupational accidents, 9.6% of [[Death|fatalities]], 12.2% of partial disabilities and about 7.4% of temporary disability and the [[injury rate]] is 9.9 per 1,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TCRB|title=Contractors registration Board: Status of Occupational Health and Safety in Tanzanian Construction Industry|url=http://www.crbtz.org/documents/newsletter/dec2009/ohsstatus.pdf|website=tcrb|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presented information may be challenged by several other factors as reporting system is not well functional.  There were a total of 6,599 registered workplaces equivalent to 24% of eligible workplaces. This challenges is a challenge to The Authority dealing with Occupational safety and Health in Tanzania. Accelerated development as a result of new large discoveries and investments in [[Oil]], [[gas]] and [[Uranium]] and expected spill - over effects calls for serious investments in this areas as more workers will be involved and exposure to [[occupational hazards]] will need serious interventions.

The '''Indian Association for Medical Informatics''' ('''IAMI''') is a [[professional society]] that plays a role in promoting and furthering the application of [[Health informatics|informatics]] in the fields of [[healthcare]], [[bioscience]] and [[medicine]] in [[India]]. It was established in 1993.

== Goals and objectives ==
The objectives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iami.org.in/objectives.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; of the IAMI are to sensitize the Indian [[medical]] community to the benefits of [[Information Technology]] (IT), bring about awareness and ensure greater utilization of IT in healthcare facilities across the length and breadth of India. The IAMI also aims to provide necessary assistance and guidance to other organizations to implement and reap the benefits of IT for health care. It supports introduction of [[computer literacy]] along with medical education, development of computerized as well as medical [[Digital library|digital libraries]], access to [[information]] and creation of [[database]]s. IAMI emphasizes research and development of medical informatics as an independent [[Academic discipline|discipline]]. It provides various communication and interaction channels among its members by means of e-groups and through publication of a [[Academic journal|scholarly journal]].

== Affiliation ==
It is the Indian National Member at [[IMIA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imia.org/action.lasso?-database=organizations.fp5&amp;-response=member_profile.html&amp;-layout=CGI&amp;-sortField=country&amp;-sortOrder=ascending&amp;-op=bw&amp;type=national&amp;-maxRecords=1&amp;-skipRecords=18&amp;-search]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IAMI was registered in September 1993 with its Registered Office being the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], India.

It has been organising a conference every two years on roles and applications of informatics in medicine, health and allied fields in various states of India.

The first biennial conference was held in 1995 at Hyderabad.

The second conference was held in 1997 at [[Indian Institute of Science]], [[Bangalore]].

The third conference in 1999 in Hyderabad was postponed due to natural calamities. A workshop was also held at NIMS in lieu later.

The third conference was held in 2001 in New Delhi.

The fourth conference was held in 2003 at PGIMER, [[Chandigarh]].

A mid-conference was held in 2004 at the [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South-Eastern Railways]] Hospital, [[Kolkata]].

The fifth conference was held in 2005 at Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences in [[Amritsar]].

IAMI has conducted many beginners' courses for [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[paramedic]]al [[personnel]] and [[computer]] [[professional class]]. This enabled the association in enrolling many [[hospital]]s, [[institute]]s and [[organization]]s as Institutional Life Members. It is aiming at making Medical Informatics as one of the elective subjects in the UG curriculum for all medical colleges in India and to get academic credits from the [[Medical Council of India]] and other autonomous bodies under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India), [[Government of India]] for all the delegates participating in the [[Academic conference|conferences]], [[seminar]]s and [[workshop]]s organized by the association.

In 2001, it started a discussion group for medical informatics. Which has now grown into the de facto information source for medical informatics-related activities in India for its members as well as non-members. Its active members include almost everyone in the medical informatics scene of India. IAMI got its own website in 2002. Its ''Indian Journal of Medical Informatics'' (''IJMI'', {{ISSN|0973-0397}}) was started in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iami.org.in/history.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
IAMI membership consists of Personal, Institutional and Honorary Members.

Many of its key office bearers are part of several [[Government of India]] (GOI) initiatives in the areas of telemedicine, especially in the area of development of standards and guidelines for the practice of [[telemedicine]], [[E-learning|online medical education]] and [[electronic medical record]]s or [[electronic health record]]s.

== Journal ==
It produces the [[scientific journal]] called ''Indian Journal of Medical Informatics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalinformatics.org.in/ojs/index.php/ijmi/index]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion group==
Members of the association have an active discussion group&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/iami_gen]&lt;/ref&gt; where healthcare IT enthusiasts discuss topics of their interest. Several discussion threads run in parallel. There is also a "topic of the month" which is the main focus of the discussion.

The '''Irish Lumper''' is a varietal white [[potato]] of historic interest. It has been identified as the variety of potato whose widespread cultivation throughout [[Ireland]], prior to the 1840s, is implicated in the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Great Famine]] in which an estimated 1 million died.&lt;ref name="IrishCentral"&gt;{{cite web

== Agricultural features ==
The 'Irish Lumper' is noted for its ability to flourish on [[Lazy bed|garden beds]] that are poor in nutrients, wet-footed, or both. Until the 1840s, it was closely adapted to growing conditions in [[Ireland]], particularly [[West Region, Ireland|western Ireland]]. The [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] of Ireland noted that the Lumper was a "very old variety, and ... probably well known when first recorded by Dutton (1808) in his Agricultural Survey of County Clare. ... It was described by Andrews (1835) as a 'coarse species' and was recommended by Howden (1837) as stock feed due to its enormous yield."&lt;ref name="daff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Potato Varieties of Historical Interest in Ireland|date=2008|publisher=[[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]|location=Dublin, Ireland|isbn=978-0-9565715-0-2|pages=45–46|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/farmingsectors/crops/seedcertification/topspotatocentre/PotatoBook010610.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, infestations of ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' devastated a series of potato harvests, leading to widespread [[famine]] and [[Irish diaspora|emigration]]. The cumulative effects of both catastrophes lowered Ireland's total population by approximately 2 million, of which approximately 1 million were fatalities.

After almost disappearing from cultivation, the 'Irish Lumper' was regrown, starting in 2008, by Michael McKillop of [[County Antrim]] for harvest sale as an [[heirloom plant|heirloom varietal]].&lt;ref name=pope&gt;{{cite news|last=Pope|first=Conor|title=Great Famine spud returns after almost 170 years|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2013/0302/1224330699102.html|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=2 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302173952/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2013/0302/1224330699102.html|archivedate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culinary use ==
The 'Irish Lumper' has been characterized as a "wet, nasty, knobbly old potato."  Its texture upon boiling is described as more "waxy" than "floury", indicating a starch content on the lower side of that typical for white potatoes.&lt;ref name=dailyspud&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Aoife|title=Spud Sunday: Return of the Lumper|url=http://www.thedailyspud.com/2013/03/11/lumper-potatoes/|work=The Daily Spud|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Educational use ==
Schools in Ireland are starting to cultivate the 'Irish Lumper' as a project of historical education.  The Lumpers are cultivated in [[Raised-bed gardening|raised garden beds]], as their ancestors were in the 1840s.&lt;ref name=BelfastTelegraph&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Famine's lost potato: knobbly Lumper unites schoolchildren|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/famines-lost-potato-knobbly-lumper-unites-schoolchildren-30174685.html|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">'''Iron oxide adsorption''' is a [[water treatment]] process that is used to remove [[arsenic]] from [[drinking water]].  Arsenic is a common natural contaminant of [[Water well|well]] water and is highly [[carcinogenic]].  [[Iron oxide]] [[adsorption]] treatment for arsenic in groundwater is a commonly practiced removal process which involves the chemical treatment of arsenic species such that they adsorb onto iron oxides and [[flocculation|create larger particles]] that may be [[filtration|filtered]] out of the water stream.

The addition of [[ferric chloride]], FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, to well water immediately after the well at the influent to the treatment plant creates ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and hydrochloric acid, HCl.  

:3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3HCl

Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water is a strong adsorbent of arsenate, As(V), provided that the pH is low.  HCl lowers pH, assuring arsenic adsorption, and the disassociated chlorine oxidizes iron in solution from Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;, which then may bond with hydroxide ions, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, thus creating more adsorbent.

This adjustment also lowers the pH of the well water, decreasing alkalinity and allowing more cationic species such Fe(+) or As(+) as to exist freely within the flow.  Low pH also decreases the solubility of some iron and arsenic species as well as increasing the adsorptive reactivity of arsenate, As(V).

Additional oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;, also referred to as iron(II) and iron(III), is induced by the addition of [[sodium hypochlorite]], NaOCl, at the well head.  NaOCl is usually added for [[disinfection]] although it may be used in this case towards the objectives of a distribution system free chlorine residual of 1 mg/L ''and'' the oxidation of aqueous As(III) to As(V), and aqueous iron Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;, which will bond with hydroxide for further adsorption.

The filter media usually consists of [[anthracite]], iron-manganese oxidizing sand, and [[garnet]] sand over support [[gravel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title = Chemistry of Water Treatment| date = 1998 | author = Faust, Aly | publisher = CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kennack Sands''' is a beach and [[Dune#Coastal dunes|sand-dune]] system on the east coast of the [[Lizard Peninsula]], [[Cornwall]], England, [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explorer Map 103. The Lizard|date=2010|publisher=Ordnance Survey|location=Southampton|isbn=978-0-319-24117-2|edition=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The beach is approximately {{convert|500|m|ft}} long and backed by cliffs, Kennack Towans (sand-dune system) and [[Tor (rock formation)|Carn]] Kennack. Inland is the abandoned Gwendreath Quarry. The beach is used for recreation and divided into two by an outcrop of rocks called the Caerverracks. Kennack Sands has a gentle sloping beach so the tidal range is quite large. At high tide there is still a large amount of beach to make use of but at low tide the beach seems to get a lot bigger. There is a rocky outcrop that splits the beach into two so the beach may be referred to as Kennack Sands west and Kennack Sands East. The rock that splits the beaches is called Caerverracks and the hill above this Carn Kennack. There is a path that runs over Carn Kennack allowing access to the east beach which is a designated nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gocornwallbeaches.com/destination/the-lizard-falmouth-and-helston/kennack-sands-beach/|title=Kennack Sands Beach - Go Cornwall Beaches|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a popular site for launching [[Inflatable boat|inflatables]] for [[underwater diving]]. Less than {{convert|400|m|ft}} off-shore the depth of water is over {{convert|16|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="dsc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larn|first1=Richard|title=Dive South Cornwall|date=1996|publisher=Underwater World Productions|location=Teddington, Middlesex|isbn=0 946020 25 6|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest village is [[Kuggar]], {{convert|1|km|mile}} inland. There is a car park and café on the western side of the beach and on the road to Kuggar there are caravan and camping sites.

==History==
Pill boxes and an anti-tank wall were built on the back of the beach in case of invasion during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monument No. 1419309 |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1419309&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a&amp;class1=None&amp;period=None&amp;county=1306805&amp;district=None&amp;parish=None&amp;place=GRADE%20RUAN&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;source=text&amp;rtype=&amp;rnumber=&amp;p=9&amp;move=n&amp;nor=154&amp;recfc=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093858/http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1419309&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a&amp;class1=None&amp;period=None&amp;county=1306805&amp;district=None&amp;parish=None&amp;place=GRADE%20RUAN&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;source=text&amp;rtype=&amp;rnumber=&amp;p=9&amp;move=n&amp;nor=154&amp;recfc=0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 December 2015 |website=Pastscape |publisher=Historic England |accessdate=20 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monument No. 1419311 |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1419311&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a&amp;class1=None&amp;period=None&amp;county=1306805&amp;district=None&amp;parish=None&amp;place=GRADE%20RUAN&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;source=text&amp;rtype=&amp;rnumber=&amp;p=9&amp;move=n&amp;nor=154&amp;recfc=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104316/http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1419311&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a&amp;class1=None&amp;period=None&amp;county=1306805&amp;district=None&amp;parish=None&amp;place=GRADE%20RUAN&amp;recordsperpage=10&amp;source=text&amp;rtype=&amp;rnumber=&amp;p=9&amp;move=n&amp;nor=154&amp;recfc=0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 December 2015 |website=Pastscape |publisher=Historic England |accessdate=20 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">The '''King Edward VII Memorial Hospital''' in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands]] is the base for the Falkland Islands Government Health Service.  There is a hospital of the same name in [[Bermuda Hospitals Board|Bermuda]].

Health services are funded by fish licence revenue and by income tax. They are entirely free at the point of delivery to Islands residents and to British residents under a [[reciprocal health agreement]].  In 2003 the provision of the service cost £950 per head of population per year, similar to the cost in the UK.  Services are provided to about 3000 residents. The military base provides its own health care, but makes use of the hospital facilities as necessary.

This is the only hospital on the Islands. All the islands' medical, dental and community health services are based there.  There are 18 acute beds, one maternity bed, a single bedded isolation unit, a two bedded intensive care unit and seven long-stay nursing beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health|url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/our-people/daily-life/health-services/|website=Falklands Islands Government|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rebuilt in 1987 after a fire destroyed the earlier wooden building.  The range of equipment and facilities is surprisingly comprehensive, as it has to be almost entirely self-sufficient and takes referrals from [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], and [[Antarctica]].  Before 1982 medical services on the islands were very basic, but there has been considerable investment since.  [[Colorectal cancer]] was particularly common on the islands, linked to a very unusual gene mutation and a three-yearly colorectal screening programme was introduced in 1997. It reached 99% of the population and appears to have virtually eliminated colorectal carcinoma.

There are four full-time GPs and one part-time.  A consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist do four month tours of duty on the Islands. A radiographer, a biomedical scientist, and a dental hygienist are seconded from [[NHS trust]]s. There are 2 practice nurses, a part-time nurse practitioner, 2 casualty nurses, ward nurses and healthcare assistants. The GPs have to provide all medical care apart from surgery or anaesthesia, supported by visiting specialists, mostly from the UK who help to keep them up to date. Consultations take place by telephone for patients in remote locations.  There are weekly visits by GPs to patients outside Stanley. There are three midwives, and about 30 babies are born  each year. A medicine chest is provided for these patients and replenished as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diggle|first1=R|title=Medicine in the Falkland Islands|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=2003|volume=79|issue=927|page=3|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/content/79/927/3.full|accessdate=18 October 2015|doi=10.1136/pmj.79.927.3|pmc=1742590}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients, or doctors, can be transported by the [[Falkland Islands Government Air Service]] if necessary. Serious emergencies are taken to Chile.

'''Lactation suppression''' refers to the act of suppressing [[lactation]] by medication or other non pharmaceutical means. The breasts may become painful when engorged with milk if breastfeeding is ceased abruptly, or if never started. This may occur if a woman never initiates breastfeeding, or if she is weaning from breastfeeding abruptly. Historically women who did not plan to breastfeed were given [[diethylstilbestrol]] and other medications after birth to suppress lactation. However, its use was discontinued, and there are no medications currently approved for lactation suppression in the US and the UK.

== Reasons ==
After birth, some women may desire to stop the production of breast milk, for example when the mother decides to [[Infant formula|bottle feed]] from birth, or in the case when the [[Infant mortality|infant dies]]&lt;ref name="Moore_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore DB, Catlin A | title = Lactation suppression: forgotten aspect of care for the mother of a dying child | journal = Pediatric Nursing | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–4 | date = 2003 | pmid = 14651312 | doi = | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/31cb/efb18dd6f2df78cca0cdeda3b0f6941e255b.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; or is [[Adoption|surrendered at birth]]. Additionally, women who are breastfeeding may need to stop breastfeeding abruptly, for instance if she is taking [[Breastfeeding and medications|medication contradicted for breastfeeding]] or undergoes surgery. The abrupt weaning process may lead to severe [[Breast engorgement|engorgement]], extremely painful breasts, and possibly [[mastitis]]. {{Citation needed span|text=Up to one third of women who do not breast-feed and who use a brassiere or binder, ice packs, or analgesics may experience severe breast pain. Specific studies of nonpharmacologic methods of lactation suppression were limited and inconclusive. Available data suggest that many women using currently recommended strategies for treatment of symptoms may nevertheless experience engorgement or pain for most of the first postpartum week.|date=March 2018|reason=}}

== Methods ==

=== Medication ===
[[Cabergoline]] (Dostinex™) is currently most effective option currently available, as it is available as a single dose (as opposed to [[bromocriptine]] which must be taken twice daily for 2 weeks.)&lt;ref name="Kataria_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kataria K, Srivastava A, Dhar A | title = Management of lactational mastitis and breast abscesses: review of current knowledge and practice | journal = The Indian Journal of Surgery | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–5 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24465097 | pmc = 3900741 | doi = 10.1007/s12262-012-0776-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be prescribed in the case of [[Mastitis|breast abscess]]. Although the preferred method of treatment for breast abscess and mastitis is actually to continue [[breastfeeding]], if the decision is made to stop breastfeeding, then chemical lactation suppression is indicated, particularly for severe cases. Carbergoline is not indicated for treatment of discomfort caused by engorgement.&lt;ref name="Kataria_2013" /&gt;

In the past, hormonal therapies, such as [[diethylstilbestrol]] and [[bromocriptine]] were routinely used in the [[Postpartum period|postpartum]] period, but these are no longer recommended due to side effects as they alter hormone levels dramatically and cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting,&lt;ref name="Kataria_2013" /&gt; and severe potential side effects such as [[thromboembolism]], cerebral accident, and myocardial infarction (DES is also a known carcinogen).{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Estrogen containing birth control pills]] may have the same side effect. [[Pseudoephedrine]] may also suppress lactation, as it is known to cause [[Low milk supply|low supply]].&lt;ref name="Aljazaf_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aljazaf K, Hale TW, Ilett KF, Hartmann PE, Mitoulas LR, Kristensen JH, Hackett LP | title = Pseudoephedrine: effects on milk production in women and estimation of infant exposure via breastmilk | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–24 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848771 | pmc = 1884328 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.01822.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US. Spitz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spitz AM, Lee NC, Peterson HB | title = Treatment for lactation suppression: little progress in one hundred years | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 179 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1485–90 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9855585 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9378(98)70013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 100-year review of all available information concluded that there was nothing new or helpful to assist with the mammary involution or milk suppression process or to treat the pain or discomfort of severely engorged breasts.

===Other methods===

By simply not stimulating the breasts after birth, after a few days the production of milk will decease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} If breastfeeding has already been established, the production of milk typically takes longer to decrease and may take several weeks. Women may experience pain and discomfort from engorgement. This discomfort is may be relieved by hand-expressing milk or the use of a [[Breast pump|pump]] to reduce engorgement and prevent mastitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Linda J. | last = Smith | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/dryupfst.htm | title = Guidelines For Rapid Reduction of Milk Supply | publisher = BFLRC Ltd. | date = 1998 | access-date = 2018-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discomfort can also be treated with analgesics. However, as much as one third of all women will experience severe pain in this process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Historically, [[Breast binding|binding the breasts]] by use of tight-fitting bras or ace bandages was used, but this is now discouraged as this may cause blocked milk ducts and mastitis.&lt;ref name="Kataria_2013" /&gt; Fluid restriction is also not recommended as it is likely ineffective and unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Swift_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swift K, Janke J | title = Breast binding... is it all that it's wrapped up to be? | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–9 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12774875 | doi = 10.1177/0884217503253531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cabbage]] leaves are a common recommendation to reduce discomfort from engorgement. However, a Cochrane review of three studies on this subject concluded that there was no statistically significant evidence that interventions were associated with a more rapid resolution of symptoms; in these studies women tended to have improvements in pain and other symptoms over time whether or not they received active treatment.&lt;ref name="Mangesi_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mangesi L, Zakarija-Grkovic I | title = Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD006946 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27351423 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006946.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Cochrane review other interventions such as hot/cold packs, Gua-Sha (scraping therapy), acupuncture, and proteolytic enzymes may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement, but there is insufficient evidence to justify widespread implementation.&lt;ref name="Mangesi_2016" /&gt;

'''Louis Alexander Slotin''' (1 December 1910&amp;nbsp;– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who took part in the [[Manhattan Project]]. He was born and raised in the [[North End, Winnipeg|North End]] of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. After earning both his [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees from the [[University of Manitoba]], Slotin attended [[King's College London]], where he obtained his doctorate in physical chemistry in 1936. Afterwards, he joined the [[University of Chicago]] as a research associate to help design a [[cyclotron]]. In 1942, he was invited to participate in the Manhattan Project.

As part of the Manhattan Project, Slotin performed experiments with [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]] to determine their [[critical mass]] values. After World War II, Slotin continued his research at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. On May 21, 1946, Slotin accidentally began a fission reaction, which released a burst of [[hard radiation]]. Slotin was rushed to the hospital, and died nine days later on May 30, the victim of the second [[criticality accident]] in history, following the death of [[Harry Daghlian]], who had been exposed to radiation by the same [[demon core|core]] that killed Slotin.

Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent the deaths of his colleagues. However, some physicists argue that this was a preventable accident. The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.

== Early life ==
Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking refugees who had fled the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms of Russia]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at [[St. John's High School (Winnipeg)|St. John's High School]], Slotin was academically exceptional. His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother "had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours."&lt;ref name="zeilig22"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeilig |first=Martin |date=August–September 1995 |title=Louis Slotin and 'The Invisible Killer' |journal=The Beaver |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=20–27 |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |accessdate=28 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101332/http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |archive-date=16 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Slotin entered the [[University of Manitoba]] to pursue a degree in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in geology from the university in 1932 and a [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] degree in 1933. With the assistance of one of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at [[King's College London]] under the supervision of [[Arthur John Allmand]],&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; the chair of the chemistry department, who specialized in the field of applied [[electrochemistry]] and [[photochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1951 |title=In memoriam: Arthur John Allmand, 1885–1951 |journal=[[Faraday Transactions|Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=X001–X003 |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=TF951470X001&amp;JournalCode=TF |doi= 10.1039/TF951470X001|accessdate= 19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== King's College ===
While at King's College, Slotin distinguished himself as an [[amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave the impression that he had fought for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] and trained to fly a fighter with the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=H.

Slotin: 1912–1946 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |issue=2695 |pages=182–183 |url=  |doi=10.1126/science.104.2695.182 |pmid=17770702|bibcode = 1946Sci...104..182A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Robert Jungk]] recounted in his book ''[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists]]'', the first published account of the [[Manhattan Project]], that Slotin "had volunteered for service in the [[Spanish Civil War]], more for the sake of the thrill of it than on political grounds. He had often been in extreme danger as an anti-aircraft gunner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Jungk |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Jungk | title=[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]] | publisher= Harcourt Brace |year=1958| location=New York  |isbn=0-15-614150-7  |oclc=181321 | pages= 194–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview years later, Sam stated that his brother had gone "on a walking tour in Spain", and he "did not take part in the war" as previously thought.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; Slotin earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[physical chemistry]] from the university in 1936.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; He won a prize for his thesis entitled "An Investigation into the Intermediate Formation of Unstable Molecules During some Chemical Reactions." Afterwards, he spent six months working as a special investigator for [[Dublin]]'s [[Great Southern Railways]], testing the [[nickel-zinc battery|Drumm nickel-zinc rechargeable batteries]] used on the [[Harcourt Street railway line|Dublin–Bray line]].&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== University of Chicago ===
In 1937, after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada's [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer'| publisher = The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association, Inc.| author = Martin Zeilig | date = August–September 1995 | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_2.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Chicago]] accepted him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first [[cyclotron]] in the midwestern United States.&lt;ref name="science.ca"&gt;{{cite web| title = science.ca Profile: Louis Slotin| publisher = GCS Research Society  | date = 7 November 2007| url = http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=290&amp;pg=0| accessdate = 21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with [[Earl Evans (scientist)|Earl Evans]], the head of the university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon ([[carbon-14]] and [[carbon-11]]) from the cyclotron.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that [[plant cell]]s had the capacity to use [[carbon dioxide]] for [[carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate synthesis]], through [[carbon fixation]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- The referenced bio article says "animal cells" like photosynthetic plants. This is clearly in error. Plants cells are meant--&gt; {{cite web|title = Earl Evans, 1910–1999|publisher = [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] | date = 5 October 1999|url = http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19991005-evansobit.html|accessdate = 20 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotin might have been present at the start-up of [[Enrico Fermi]]'s "[[Chicago Pile-1]]", the first [[nuclear reactor]], on 2 December 1942; the accounts of the event do not agree on this point.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;A 1962 University of Chicago document says that Slotin "was present on 2 December 1942, when the group of 'Met Lab' [Metallurgical Laboratory] scientists working under the late Enrico Fermi achieved man's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in a pile of [[graphite]] and uranium under the West Stands of [[Stagg Field]]." Slotin's colleague, Henry W. Newson, recollected that he and Slotin were not present during the scientists' experimentation.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Slotin also contributed to several papers in the field of [[radiobiology]]. His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the [[Manhattan Project]], the United States' effort to develop a nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name="science.ca"/&gt; Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Eugene Wigner]] at the university and later at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. He moved to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of [[Robert Bacher]].&lt;ref name="zeilig22"/&gt;

== Work at Los Alamos ==
At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties consisted of dangerous [[Critical mass|criticality]] testing, first with [[uranium]] in [[Otto Robert Frisch]]'s experiments, and later with [[plutonium]] [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]]. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of [[fissile]] materials to near-critical levels to establish their [[critical mass]] values.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brigitt |date=December 1999 |title=The Secret Life of Louis Slotin 1910–1946 |journal= Alumni Journal of the University of Manitoba |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= | url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |accessdate= 22 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071007121854/http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |archivedate = 7 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] as "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who compared the experiments to "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last= Weber |first= Bruce |title=Theater Review; A Scientist's Tragic Hubris Attains Critical Mass Onstage |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3EF933A25757C0A9679C8B63 |publisher=New York Times |date=10 April 2001 |accessdate=12 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November–December 2002 |title=Science as Theater: The Slip of the Screwdriver |journal=[[American Scientist]] |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=550–555 |bibcode = 2002AmSci..90..550S |doi = 10.1511/2002.6.550 |last1= Shepherd-Barr |first1= Kirsten |last2= Lustig |first2= Harry }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for [[Trinity test|Trinity]], the first detonated atomic device, and became known as the "chief armorer of the United States" for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Durschmied | first=Erik | title= Unsung Heroes: The Twentieth Century's Forgotten History-Makers | publisher= [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | location=London, England | year = 2003|isbn=0-340-82519-7 | page=245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on the project.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

[[File:Louis Slotin and the Gadget Bomb.jpg|thumb|Louis Slotin with [[the Gadget]] bomb during the Trinity test]]

In the winter of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold action. He repaired an instrument six feet under water inside the [[Clinton Pile]] while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]].&lt;ref name="ziegler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Karl Ziegler|last2=Peterson|first2=Ken M.|title=The Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QunaUpeENl4C&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=30 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3122-1|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettler Jr. |first=Fred A. |author2=Voelz, George L. |title=Major Radiation Exposure – What to Expect and How to Respond |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=16 May 2002 |volume=346 |issue=20 |pmid=12015396 |url=http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~higley/Radiation%20Biology/Exams%20and%20quizzes/major%20radiation%20exposure%20what%20to%20expect%20and%20how%20to%20respond%20mettler.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2012 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra000365 |pages=1554–61 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226030448/http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~higley/Radiation%20Biology/Exams%20and%20quizzes/major%20radiation%20exposure%20what%20to%20expect%20and%20how%20to%20respond%20mettler.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harry Daghlian's death ===
On 21 August 1945, laboratory assistant [[Harry Daghlian]], one of Slotin's close colleagues, was performing a critical mass experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy [[tungsten carbide]] brick onto a {{convert|6.2|kg|adj=on}} [[plutonium-gallium alloy]] bomb core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Newtan | first=Samuel Upton | title= Nuclear War I and Other Major Nuclear Disasters of the 20th Century | publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] | location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]] | year = 2007|isbn=1-4259-8510-6 | page=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-year-old Daghlian was irradiated with a large dose of [[neutron radiation]]. Later estimates would suggest that this dose might not have been fatal on its own, but he then received additional delayed [[gamma radiation]] and [[beta burns]] while disassembling his experiment.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt; He quickly collapsed with [[acute radiation poisoning]] and died 25 days later in the Los Alamos base hospital.

=== Planned return to teaching ===
After the war, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, "I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to my disgust."&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, "I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into [[biophysics]] and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, [[Alvin C. Graves]], to take over his Los Alamos work.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

=== Criticality accident ===
[[File:Tickling the Dragons Tail.jpg|thumb|A re-creation of the Slotin incident. The inside hemisphere with the thumb-hole next to the demonstrator's hand is beryllium (replacing the uranium tamper of the same size in a [[Fat Man]] bomb). There is an external larger metal sphere of aluminum under it (replacing the pusher sphere in this bomb's design). The plutonium "[[demon core]]" was inside the spheres at the time of the accident and is not visible, but its dimensions are comparable with the two small half-spheres shown resting nearby.]]

On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a [[Nuclear fission|fission reaction]] by placing two half-spheres of [[beryllium]] (a [[neutron reflector]]) around a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} plutonium core. The experiment used the same {{convert|6.2|kg|lb|1|adj=on}} plutonium core that had irradiated [[Harry Daghlian]], later called the "[[demon core]]" for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 228.6&amp;nbsp;mm (9-inch) beryllium hemisphere&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt; with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the [[shim (engineering)|shims]] normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

At 3:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a "[[prompt critical]]" reaction and a burst of [[hard radiation]].&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of [[Ionized air glow|air ionization]] and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of [[neutron radiation]].&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; At the time of the accident, [[dosimetry]] badges were in a locked box about {{convert|100|ft|m}} from the accident. Realizing that no one in the room had their film badges on, "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly".&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt; This peculiar response was attributed to "[[vertigo]]" and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;

Others in the room at the time included [[Raemer E. Schreiber]], [[Alvin C. Graves|Alvin Cushman Graves]], Stanley Allan Kline, Marion Edward Cieslicki, Dwight Smith Young, Theodore P. Perlman, and Pvt. Patrick J. Cleary.&lt;ref name=hempelman&gt;{{cite conference|last=Hempelman|first=Louis Henry|last2=Lushbaugh|first2=Clarence C.|last3=Voelz |first3=George L.|title=What Has Happened to the Survivors of the Early Los Alamos Nuclear Accidents?|conference=Conference for Radiation Accident Preparedness|date=1979-10-19|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/pdf/accidentsurvivorslanl.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2013|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge|id=LA-UR-79-2802}}There have been five studies done of the amount of radiation each person involved received in the accident; these are the latest, dated 1978, from a table in this reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schreiber"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear Niaveté|author=Larry Calloway|publisher=Albuquerque Journal|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/trinity/trinity2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/31/us/re-schreiber-88-nuclear-bomb-physicist.html | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Pace | title=R.E.

As soon as Slotin left the building, he [[Vomiting|vomited]], a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense [[ionizing radiation]]. Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but the radiation damage was irreversible.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

By 25 May 1946, four of the eight men exposed during the incident had been discharged from hospital. The Army doctor responsible for the hospital, Captain Paul Hageman, said that Slotin's, Graves', Kline's and Young's "immediate condition is satisfactory."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Slotin's death ====
Despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate blood for [[blood transfusion|transfusions]], Slotin's condition rapidly deteriorated.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;  Slotin called his parents and they were flown at Army expense from Winnipeg to be with their son. They arrived on the fourth day after the incident, and by the fifth day Slotin's condition started to rapidly deteriorate.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

Over the next nine days, Slotin suffered an "agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas", including severe [[diarrhea]], reduced urine output, swollen hands, [[erythema]], "massive blisters on his hands and forearms", [[intestinal paralysis]], and [[gangrene]]. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a "three-dimensional sunburn." By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of "mental confusion." His lips turned blue and he was put in an [[oxygen tent]]. He ultimately experienced "a total disintegration of bodily functions" and slipped into a coma.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Chris Austill | title=Decision-Making in the Nuclear Age | publisher= Halcyon Press| location=[[Weston, Massachusetts]] | year = 1983 |oclc=9778139 | page= 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May, in the presence of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4814517/atomic_injuries_fatal_to_scientist/|title=Atomic injuries fatal to scientist Louis Slotin (radiation) (1948) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Shaarey Zedek Cemetery, [[Winnipeg]], on 2 June 1946.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

==== Other injuries and deaths ====
Graves, Kline and Young remained hospitalized after Slotin's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4814567/atomic_injuries_fatal_to_scientist/|title=Atomic injuries fatal to scientist, Louis Slotin (radiation) (1948) 2 - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves, who was standing the closest to Slotin, also developed [[acute radiation sickness]] and was hospitalized for several weeks. He survived, although he lived with chronic neurological and vision problems. Young also suffered from acute radiation syndrome, but recovered. By 28 January 1948 Graves, Kline and Perlman sought compensation for damages suffered during the incident. Graves settled his claim for $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4814954/kline_graves_perlman_seek/|title=Kline, Graves &amp; Perlman seek compensation for radiation exposure (1948) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the observers eventually died of conditions that are known to be promoted by radiation: Graves of a [[heart attack]] 20 years later at age 55;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/magazine/america-s-radiation-victims-the-hidden-files.html?scp=1&amp;sq=America%27s+Radiation+Victims%3A+The+Hidden+Files&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=print|date=1989-11-19|title=America's Radiation Victims: The Hidden Files|author=Clifford T. Honicker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cieslicki of [[acute myeloid leukemia]] 19 years later at age 42; and Young of [[aplastic anemia]] and bacterial infection of the heart lining 27 years later at age 83. Although some of those deaths were probably latent [[stochastic]] (random) effects of the accident, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.&lt;ref name=hempelman /&gt;

==== Disposition of core ====
The core involved was intended to be used in the [[Operation Crossroads#Test Able|Able detonation]], during the [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] series of nuclear weapon testing. Slotin's experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core's detonation and was intended to be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical.&lt;ref name="Millerp69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard L.|title=Under the Cloud: The Decades of Nuclear Testing |publisher= Two Sixty Press|location=[[The Woodlands, Texas]]|year = 1991|isbn=0-02-921620-6|oclc=13333365|pages=69, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the criticality accident it needed time to cool. It was therefore rescheduled for the third test of the series, provisionally named ''Charlie'', but this was cancelled due to the unexpected level of radioactivity after the underwater ''Baker'' test and the inability to decontaminate the target warships.  It was later melted down and reused in a later core.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] | last=Wellerstein| first=Alex| title=The Demon Core and the Strange Death of Louis Slotin| url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/demon-core-the-strange-death-of-louis-slotin?intcid=mod-latest| date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiation dosage ===
[[File:Slotin criticality map.png|thumb|right|300px|A sketch used by doctors to determine the amount of radiation to which each person in the room had been exposed during the excursion]]
[[File:Slotin criticality drawing.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A drawing based on the above sketch.]]
The radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A large part of the dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Joseph G.|title=Radiation Doses in the Pajarito Accident of May 21, 1946|date=1948-05-26|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/pajarito.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2012|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory|id=LA-687|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tentative" estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, some of which are now known to be grossly incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of [[sodium]] activation in the victims' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to [[equivalent dose]]s of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]] (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80&amp;nbsp;keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930&amp;nbsp;R ([[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]]) of X-ray with 114&amp;nbsp;R of gamma, while Daghlian's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480&amp;nbsp;R of X-ray with 110&amp;nbsp;R of gamma.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;  Five hundred [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]] is usually a fatal dose for humans.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

In modern times dosimetry is done very differently. Equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen; they would be calculated with different weighting factors, and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as [[absorbed dose]]s. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287&amp;nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]&lt;ref name=ziegler /&gt; to 21&amp;nbsp;[[sievert]].&lt;ref name="la-13638"&gt;{{cite web| title = LA-13638 A Review of Criticality Accidents| publisher =Los Alamos National Laboratory |date=May 2000 | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf| pages=74–76| accessdate = 2007-12-05 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|Gy]](n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=James N. P.|title=Internal Memorandum on Los Alamos Criticality Accidents, 1945–1946, Personnel Exposures|date=6 October 1978|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory|id=H-l-78}}&lt;/ref&gt; These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.&lt;ref name=hempelman /&gt;

== Legacy ==
After the accident, Los Alamos ended all hands-on critical assembly work. Future criticality testing of fissile cores was done with remotely controlled machines, such as the "[[Godiva device|Godiva]]" series, with the operator located a safe distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Jungk |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Jungk | title=[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]] | publisher= Harcourt Brace |year=1958| location=New York  |isbn=0-15-614150-7  |oclc=181321 | page= 302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 1946, the associate editor of the ''Los Alamos Times'', Thomas P. Ashlock, penned a poem entitled "Slotin – A Tribute":

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
May God receive you, great-souled scientist!
While you were with us, even strangers knew
The breadth and lofty stature of your mind
Twas only in the crucible of death
We saw at last your noble heart revealed.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room: "Dr. Slotin's quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity."&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; This interpretation of events was endorsed at the time by Alvin Graves, who stood closest to Slotin when the accident occurred.&lt;ref name=pfiles /&gt; Graves, like Slotin, had previously displayed a low concern for nuclear safety, and would later allege that fallout risks were "concocted in the minds of weak malingerers."&lt;ref name=pfiles /&gt; Another witness to the accident, Raemer E. Schreiber, spoke out publicly decades later, arguing that Slotin was using improper and unsafe procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself. Robert B. Brode had reported hearsay to that effect back in 1946.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt;

The event was recounted in [[Dexter Masters]]' 1955 novel ''The Accident'', a fictional account of the last few days of the life of a nuclear scientist suffering from [[radiation poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schonberg |first= Harold C |title= Dexter Masters, 80, British Editor; Warned of Perils of Atomic Age |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91E38F935A35752C0A96F948260 |publisher=New York Times|date=6 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Lawrence |last=Badash |first2=Joseph O. |last2=Hirschfelder |first3=Herbert P. |last3=Broida| title=Reminiscences of Los Alamos, 1943–1945 | publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|D.

In 1948, Slotin's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the ''Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund'' for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] and [[Hans Bethe]]. The memorial fund lasted until 1962.&lt;ref name="zeilig22" /&gt; In 2002, an [[asteroid]] discovered in 1995 was named [[12423 Slotin]] in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=12423+Slotin |title=12423 Slotin (1995 UQ16) |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dollar unit of reactivity ===
According to Weinberg and Wigner,&lt;ref&gt;Alvin M. Weinberg and Eugene P. Wigner. ''The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958. Page 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Slotin was the first to propose the name [[dollar (reactivity)|dollar]] for the interval of reactivity between delayed and [[prompt critical]]ity; 0 is the point of self-sustaining chain reaction, a dollar is the point at which slowly released, delayed neutrons are no longer required to support chain reaction, and enters the domain called "prompt critical". Stable nuclear reactors operate between 0 and a dollar; excursions and nuclear explosives operate above a dollar. The hundredth part of a dollar is called a [[cent (reactivity)]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh C. Paxton: ''A History of Critical Experiments at Pajarito Site''. Los Alamos Document [http://www.atomictraveler.com/LANLPajarito.pdf LA-9685-H], 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  When speaking of purely prompt critical events, some users refer to cents "over critical" as a relative unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McLaughlin| first=Thomas P.| title=A Review of Criticality Accidents|year=2000| publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory| location=Los Alamos| url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf| id=LA-13638| accessdate=5 November 2012| page=75|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">The '''mental environment''' refers to the sum of all societal influences upon [[mental health]].

The term is often used in a context critical of the mental environment in industrialized societies. It is argued that just as industrial societies produce physical [[toxins]] and [[pollutants]] which harm humans physical health, they also produce psychological toxins (e.g. television, excessive noise, violent marketing tactics, [[Internet addiction]], [[social media]]) that cause psychological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/the-mental-environment-mostly-about-mind-pollution-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912004053/http://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/the-mental-environment-mostly-about-mind-pollution-0 |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}{{full|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

This poor mental environment may help explain why rates of mental illness are reportedly higher in industrial societies which might also have its roots in poor educational environment and mechanical routinised life present. Magico-religious beliefs are an important contribution of such communal settings. Delusions such as these rooted from childhood are often hard to completely regulate from a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000285035 |pmid=9168565 |title=Magico-Religious Beliefs and Psychosis |journal=Psychopathology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=93–9 |year=1997 |last1=Vlachos |first1=Ioannis O. |last2=Beratis |first2=Stavroula |last3=Hartocollis |first3=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The idea has its roots in [[evolutionary psychology]], as the deleterious consequences of a poor mental environment can be explained by the mismatch between the mental environment humans  evolved to exist within and the one they exist within today.

"We live in both a mental and physical environment. We can influence the mental environment around us, but to a far greater extent we are influenced by the mental environment. The mental environment contains forces that affect our thinking and emotions and that can dominate our personal minds." - Marshall Vian Summers

[[File:Transverse myelitis MRI.jpg|thumb|MRI image of transverse myelitis patient's spinal cord]]
'''Myelitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[spinal cord]] which can disrupt the normal responses from the [[brain]] to the rest of the body, and from the rest of the body to the brain. Inflammation in the spinal cord, can cause the [[myelin]] and [[axon]] to be damaged resulting in symptoms such as paralysis and sensory loss. Myelitis is classified to several categories depending on the area or the cause of the lesion; however, any inflammatory attack on the spinal cord is often referred to as [[transverse myelitis]].
[[File:Nerve.nida.jpg|thumb|alt=Myelination surrounding the axon|Myelitis damages the myelin sheath that wraps the axon.]]

==Types of myelitis==
Myelitis lesions usually occur in a narrow region but can be spread and affect many areas.
*[[Acute flaccid myelitis]]: a polio-like syndrome that causes muscle weakness and paralysis.
*[[Poliomyelitis]]:&lt;ref name="pmid16630313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly H | title = Evidence for a causal association between oral polio vaccine and transverse myelitis: A case history and review of the Literature | journal = J Paediatr Child Health | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 155–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16630313 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2006.00840.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; disease caused by viral infection in the gray matter with symptoms of muscle paralysis or weakness
*[[Transverse myelitis]]: caused by axonal [[demyelination]] encompassing both sides of the spinal cord
*Leukomyelitis: lesions in the white matter
*Meningococcal myelitis (or meningomyelitis): lesions occurring in the region of [[meninges]] and the spinal cord

Osteomyelitis of the [[vertebra|vertebral]] bone surrounding the spinal cord (that is, [[vertebral osteomyelitis]]) is a separate condition, although some infections (for example, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection) can occasionally cause both at once. The similarity of the words reflects that the combining form ''[[wikt:myelo-#Prefix|myel(o)-]]'' has multiple ([[homonym]]ous) senses referring to bone marrow or the spinal cord.

==Symptoms==
Depending on the cause of the disease, such clinical conditions manifest different speed in progression of symptoms in a matter of hours to days. Most myelitis manifests fast progression in muscle weakness or paralysis starting with the legs and then arms with varying degrees of severity. Sometimes the dysfunction of arms or legs cause instability of posture and difficulty in walking or any movement. Also symptoms generally include [[paresthesia]] which is a sensation of tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin with no apparent long-term physical effect. Adult patients often report pain in the back, extremities, or abdomen.&lt;ref name="pmid9055531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas M, Thomas J | title = Acute transverse myelitis | journal = J La State Med Soc | volume = 149 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–7 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9055531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients also present increased urinary urgency, bowel or bladder dysfunctions such as bladder incontinence, difficulty or inability to void, and incomplete evacuation of bowel or constipation. Others also report fever, respiratory problems and intractable vomiting.&lt;ref name="pmid16808820"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasay M, Arif H, Khealani B, Ahsan H | title = Neuroimaging of tuberculous myelitis: analysis of ten cases and review of literature | journal = J Neuroimaging | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–205 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16808820 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6569.2006.00032.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Myelitis occurs due to various reasons such as infections. Direct infection by viruses, bacteria, mold, or parasites such as human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] types I and II (HTLV-I/II), [[syphilis]], lyme disease, and [[tuberculosis]] can cause myelitis but it can also be caused due to non-infectious or inflammatory pathway. Myelitis often follows after the infections or after vaccination. These phenomena can be explained by a theory of autoimmune attack which states that the autoimmune bodies attack its spinal cord in response to immune reaction.

===Mechanism of myelitis===
The theory of autoimmune attack claims that a person with neuroimmunologic disorders have genetic predisposition to auto-immune disorder, and the environmental factors would trigger the disease. The specific genetics in myelitis is not completely understood. It is believed that the immune system response could be to viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection; however, it is not known why the immune system attacks itself. Especially, for the immune system to cause inflammatory response anywhere in the central nervous system, the cells from the immune system must pass through the [[blood brain barrier]]. In the case of myelitis, not only is the immune system dysfunctional, but the dysfunction also crosses this protective blood brain barrier to affect the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myelitis.org|title=Transverse Myelitis Association - Advocating for individuals with rare neuro-immune disorders|author=|date=|website=The Transverse Myelitis Association|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious myelitis &lt;ref name="pmid22927022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mihai C, Jubelt B | title = Infectious myelitis | journal = Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 633–41 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22927022 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-012-0306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;===    

[[Image:Polio spinal diagram-en.svg|thumb|The location of [[motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn cells]] of the [[spinal column]] will be affected by the polioviruses causing poliomyelitis.]]

*[[Viral myelitis]]
Most viral myelitis is acute, but the [[retrovirus]]es (such as HIV and HTLV) can cause chronic myelitis. [[Poliomyelitis]], or gray matter myelitis, is usually caused by infection of [[anterior horn of the spinal cord]] by the [[enterovirus]]es ([[poliovirus]]es, enteroviruses (EV) 70 and 71, [[echovirus]]es, [[coxsackievirus]]es A and B) and the [[flavivirus]]es (West Nile, [[Japanese encephalitis]], [[tick-borne encephalitis]]). On the other hand, [[transverse myelitis]] or [[leukomyelitis]], or [[white matter myelitis]], are often caused by the [[herpesvirus]]es and [[influenza virus]]. It can be due to direct viral invasion or via immune mediated mechanisms.

*[[Bacterial myelitis]]
Bacterial myelitis includes ''[[Mycoplasma Pneumoniae]]'', which is a common agent for respiratory tract. Studies have shown respiratory tract infections within 4–39 days prior to the onset of transverse myelitis. Or, [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], and [[brucellosis]] are also known to cause myelitis in immune-compromised individuals. Myelitis is a rare manifestation of bacterial infection.

*[[Fungal myelitis]]
[[Fungi]] have been reported to cause spinal cord disease either by forming [[abscesses]] inside the bone or by [[granuloma]]. In general, there are two groups of fungi that may infect the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and cause myelitis - primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens include the following: ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', ''[[Blastomyces dermatitides]]'', and ''[[Hystoplasma capsulatum]]''. Secondary pathogens are opportunistic agents that primarily infect immunocompromised hosts such as [[Candida species]], [[Aspergillus]] species, and [[zygomycetes]].

*[[Parasitic myelitis]]
Parasitic species infect human hosts through larvae that penetrate the skin. Then they enter the lymphatic and circulatory system, and migrate to liver and lung. Some reach the spinal cord. Parasitic infections have been reported with [[Schistosoma]] species, ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', [[Echinococcus]] species, ''[[Taenia solium]]'', ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', and [[Plasmodium]] species.

===Autoimmune myelitis===

In 2016 it was identified in [[Mayo clinic]] an autoimmune form of myelitis due to the presence of anti-[[glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]] autoantibodies. [[Immunoglobulin]]s directed against the α-isoform of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP-IgG) predicted an special meningoencephalomyelitis termed [[autoimmune GFAP Astrocytopathy]]&lt;ref name="pmid30032117"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sechi E, Morris PP, McKeon A, Pittock SJ, Hinson SR, Weinshenker BG, Aksamit AJ, Krecke KN, Kaufmann TJ, Jolliffe EA, Zalewski NL, Zekeridou A, Wingerchuk DM, Jitprapaikulsan J, Flanagan EP | title = Glial fibrillary acidic protein IgG related myelitis: characterisation and comparison with aquaporin-4-IgG myelitis | journal = J.

==Diseases associated with myelitis==
Conditions associated with myelitis include:

*[[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]]: autoimmune demyelination of the brain causing severe neurological signs and symptoms
*[[Multiple sclerosis]]: [[demyelination]] of the brain and spinal cord
*[[Neuromyelitis optica]] or [[Devic's disease]]: immune attack on [[optic nerve]] and [[spinal cord]]
*[[Sjögren's syndrome]]: destruction of the exocrine system of the body
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]: a systemic autoimmune disease featuring a wide variety of neurological signs and symptoms
*[[Sarcoidosis]]:&lt;ref name="pmid7254896"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baum J, Solomon M, Alba A | title = Sarcoidosis as a cause of transverse myelitis: case report | journal = Paraplegia | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–9 | date = 1981 | pmid = 7254896 | doi = 10.1038/sc.1981.34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic inflammatory cells form as nodules in multiple organs
*[[Atopy]]: an immune disorder of children manifesting as [[eczema]] or other allergic conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid4115166"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stenius B, Wide L, Seymour WM, Holford-Strevens V, Pepys J | title = Clinical significance of specific IgE to common allergens.

==Diagnosis==
Myelitis has an extensive differential diagnosis. The type of onset (acute versus subacute/chronic) along with associated symptoms such as the presence of pain, constitutional symptoms that encompass fever, [[malaise]], weight loss or a cutaneous rash may help identify the cause of myelitis. In order to establish a diagnosis of myelitis, one has to localize the spinal cord level, and exclude cerebral and neuromuscular diseases. Also a detailed medical history, a careful neurologic examination, and imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed. In respect to the cause of the process, further work-up would help identify the cause and guide treatment. Full spine MRI is warranted, especially with acute onset myelitis, to evaluate for structural lesions that may require surgical intervention, or disseminated disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21669935"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitley JL, Leite MI, George JS, Palace JA | title = The differential diagnosis of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis | journal = Mult. Scler. | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–85 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21669935 | doi = 10.1177/1352458511406165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding gadolinium further increases diagnostic sensitivity. A brain MRI may be needed to identify the extent of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Lumbar puncture is important for the diagnosis of acute myelitis when a tumoral process, inflammatory or infectious cause are suspected, or the MRI is normal or non-specific. Complementary blood tests are also of value in establishing a firm diagnosis. Rarely, a biopsy of a mass lesion may become necessary when the cause is uncertain. However, in 15–30% of people with subacute or chronic myelitis, a clear cause is never uncovered.&lt;ref name="pmid22927022"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Since each case is different, the following are possible treatments that patients might receive in the management of myelitis.

*[[Intravenous steroids]]
High-dose intravenous [[methyl-prednisolone]] for 3–5 days is considered as a standard of care for patients suspected to have acute myelitis, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise. The decision to offer continued steroids or add a new treatment is often based on the clinical course and MRI appearance at the end of five days of steroids.&lt;ref name = "Johns Hopkins TM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/transverse_myelitis/about-tm/treatment.html|title=Transverse Myelitis (TM) Treatment – Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center|author=|date=|website=hopkinsmedicine.org|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Plasma exchange]] (PLEX)&lt;ref name="pmid22156988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott TF, Frohman EM, De Seze J, Gronseth GS, Weinshenker BG | title = Evidence-based guideline: clinical evaluation and treatment of transverse myelitis: report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | volume = 77 | issue = 24 | pages = 2128–34 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22156988 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31823dc535  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Patients with moderate to aggressive forms of disease who do not show much improvement after being treated with intravenous and oral steroids will be treated with PLEX. Retrospective studies of patients with TM treated with IV steroids followed by PLEX showed a positive outcome. It also has been shown to be effective with other autoimmune or inflammatory central nervous system disorders. Particular benefit has been shown with patients who are in the acute or subacute stage of the myelitis showing active inflammation on MRI. However, because of the risks implied by the lumbar puncture procedure, this intervention is determined by the treating physician on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name = "Johns Hopkins TM"/&gt;
*[[Immunosuppressants]]/[[Immunomodulatory agents]]
Myelitis with no definite cause seldom recurs, but for others, myelitis may be a manifestation of other diseases that are mentioned above. In these cases, ongoing treatment with medications that modulate or suppress the immune system may be necessary. Sometimes there is no specific treatment. Either way, aggressive rehabilitation and long-term symptom management are an integral part of the healthcare plan.

===Prospective research direction===
Central nervous system nerve regeneration would be able to repair or regenerate the damage caused to the spinal cord. It would restore functions lost due to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Karumbaiah, L., Bellamkonda, R.. ''Neural Tissue Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Engineering endogenous repair
Currently, there exists a [[hydrogel]] based scaffold which acts as a channel to deliver nerve growth-enhancing substrates while providing structural support. These factors would promote nerve repairs to the target area. Hydrogels' macroporous properties would enable attachment of cells and enhance ion and nutrient exchange. In addition, hydrogels' biodegradability or bioresolvability would prevent the need for surgical removal of the hydrogel after drug delivery. It means that it would be dissolved naturally by the body's enzymatic reaction.
*Biochemical repair
:*Neurotropic factor therapy and gene therapy
:*Neurotropic growth factors regulate growth, survival, and [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the [[axon]]. They benefit nerve regeneration after injury to the nervous system. They are a potent initiator of sensory axon growth and are up-regulated at the lesion site. The continuous delivery of [[neurotropic growth factor]] (NGF) would increase the nerve regeneration in the spinal cord. However, the excessive dosing of NGF often leads to undesired plasticity and sprouting of uninjured sensory nerves. Gene therapy would be able to increase the NGF efficacy by the controlled and sustained delivery in a site-specific manner.
*[[Stem cell based therapies]]
The possibility for nerve regeneration after injury to the spinal cord was considered to be limited because of the absence of major [[neurogenesis]]. However, Joseph Altman showed that cell division does occur in the brain which allowed potential for stem cell therapy for nerve regeneration.&lt;ref name="pmid5861717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altman J, Das GD | title = Autoradiographic and histological evidence of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in rats | journal = J. Comp.

'''''O'Connor v. Donaldson''''', 422 U.S. 563 (1975), was a [[landmark decision]] in [[mental health law]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by themselves or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. Since the trial court jury found, upon ample evidence, that petitioner did so confine respondent, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court's conclusion that petitioner had violated respondent's [[right to liberty]].&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;{{cite web |title=O'Connor v.

==Overview==
Kenneth Donaldson (confined patient) had been held for 15 years in [[Florida State Hospital]] at [[Chattahoochee, Florida|Chattahoochee]], due to needs of "care, maintenance, and treatment." He filed a [[lawsuit]] against the hospital and staff members claiming they had robbed him of his constitutional rights, by confining him against his will. Donaldson won his case (including monetary damages) in [[United States District Court]], won the appeals, and in 1975 the victory was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.

A finding of "[[mental illness]]" alone cannot justify a State's locking a person up against his will and keeping him indefinitely in simple custodial confinement. Assuming that that term can be given a reasonably precise content and that the "mentally ill" can be identified with reasonable accuracy, there is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom.

{{quote|May the State confine the mentally ill merely to ensure them a living standard superior to that they enjoy in the private community? That the State has a proper interest in providing care and assistance to the unfortunate goes without saying. But the mere presence of mental illness does not disqualify a person from preferring his  home to the comforts of an institution. Moreover, while the State may arguably confine a person to save him from harm, incarceration is rarely if ever a necessary condition for raising the living standards of those capable of surviving safely in freedom, on their own or with the help of family or friends. May the State fence in the harmless mentally ill solely to save its citizens from exposure to those whose ways are different? One might as well ask if the State, to avoid public unease, could incarcerate all who are physically unattractive or socially eccentric. Mere public intolerance or animosity cannot constitutionally justify the deprivation of a person's physical liberty. In short, a State cannot constitutionally confine without more a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. ...&lt;ref name=findlaw/&gt;}}

==Kenneth Donaldson==
The origins of Donaldson's institutionalization began in 1943, at age 34, when he suffered a traumatic episode. He was hospitalized and received treatment, before resuming life with his family.

In 1956 Donaldson travelled to Florida to visit his elderly parents. While there, Donaldson reported that he believed one of his neighbors in Philadelphia might be poisoning his food. His father, worried that his son suffered from paranoid delusions, petitioned the court for a sanity hearing. Donaldson was evaluated, diagnosed with "[[paranoid schizophrenia]]," and civilly [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to the Florida State mental health system. At his commitment trial, Donaldson did not have legal counsel present to represent his case. Once he entered the Florida hospital, Donaldson was placed with dangerous criminals, even though he had never been proved to be dangerous to himself or others. His ward was understaffed, with only one doctor (who happened to be an [[obstetrician]]) for over 1,000 male patients. There were no psychiatrists or counsellors, and the only nurse on site worked in the infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/13338/O-Connor-v-Donaldson.html |title=O'Connor v. Donaldson - Significance, Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, Further Readings |website=JRank Articles: Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |publisher=Net Industries }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|{{subst:September 2018}}|reason=Citation does not support claims.|date=September 2018}}{{dubious|date=September 2018}}

He spent 15 years as a patient; he did not receive any treatment, actively refusing it, and attempting to secure his release. Throughout his stay he denied he was ever mentally ill, and refused to be put into a [[halfway house]].

Donaldson later wrote a book about his experience as a mental patient titled ''Insanity Inside Out''.

==Life and career==
Philip Morris was the son of a recent immigrant to England from Germany who had taken the name Bernard Morris. In 1847, Philip Morris's family opened a tobacco shop on [[Bond Street]] in [[London]]. By 1854, he had started making his own cigarettes. In 1870, Morris began to produce Philip Morris Cambridge and Philip Morris Oxford Blues (later called Oxford Ovals and Philip Morris Blues).  

Morris died of cancer in 1873 while his widow Margaret and brother Leopold Morris carried on his cigarette trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=Sold on Radio: Advertisers in the Golden Age of Broadcasting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwVkMMLqMdkC&amp;pg=PA205|date=23 May 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5176-0|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Primary sclerosing cholangitis''' ('''PSC''') is a long-term progressive disease of the [[liver]] and [[gallbladder]] characterized by [[inflammation]] and scarring of the [[bile duct]]s which normally allow [[bile]] to drain from the gallbladder. Affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms of liver disease such as [[jaundice|yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes]], [[pruritus|itching]], and abdominal pain.

&lt;!-- Cause and Pathophysiology --&gt;
The bile duct scarring which occurs in PSC narrows the ducts of the biliary tree and impedes the flow of [[bile]] to the intestines. Eventually, it can lead to [[cirrhosis]] of the liver and [[liver failure]]. PSC increases the risk of various cancers including [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], [[gallbladder carcinoma]], [[colorectal cancer]], and [[cholangiocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazaridis|first1=KN|last2=LaRusso|first2=NF|title=Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=September 2016|volume=375|issue=12|pages=1161–70|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1506330|pmid=27653566|pmc=5553912|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folseraas2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Folseraas|first1=T|last2=Boberg|first2=KM|title=Cancer Risk and Surveillance in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=February 2016|volume=20|issue=1|pages=79–98|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2015.08.014|pmid=26593292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The underlying cause of PSC is unknown. Genetic susceptibility, [[autoimmunity|immune system dysfunction]], and [[dysbiosis|abnormal composition of the gut flora]] may play a role.&lt;ref name="Kummen2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charatchar&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11894-006-0067-8|vauthors=Charatcharoenwitthaya P, Lindor KD | title = Primary sclerosing cholangitis: diagnosis and management  | journal = Current Gastroenterology Reports  | volume = 8  | issue = 1  | pages = 75–82  |date=Feb 2006  | pmid = 16510038}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further suggested by the observation that approximately 75% of individuals with PSC also have [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), most often [[ulcerative colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=MH|title=Sleisenger and Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, management|year=2006|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and Treatment --&gt;
There is no effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The most definitive treatment for PSC is a [[liver transplantation|liver transplant]] but it can recur after transplantation.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; Few people affected by PSC require a liver transplant.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
PSC is a rare disease and most commonly affects people with IBD.&lt;ref name="Folseraas2016"/&gt; Approximately 3–7.5% of people with ulcerative colitis have PSC and 80% of people with PSC have some form of IBD.&lt;ref name="Kummen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kummen|first1=M|last2=Schrumpf|first2=E|last3=Boberg|first3=KM|title=Liver abnormalities in bowel diseases|journal=Best Practice &amp; Research. Clinical Gastroenterology|date=August 2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=531–42|doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2013.06.013|pmid=24090940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis usually occurs in younger people in their 30s or 40s.&lt;ref name="Kummen2013"/&gt; Individuals of Northern European ancestry are affected more often than people of Southern European or Asian descent.&lt;ref name="Folseraas2016"/&gt; Men are affected more often than women.&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=KD|last2=Chapman|first2=RW|title=Primary sclerosing cholangitis: a clinical update|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=June 2015|volume=114|issue=1|pages=53–64|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldv019|pmid=25981516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease was initially described in the mid-1800s but was not fully characterized until the 1970s with the advent of improved medical imaging techniques such as [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)]].&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Nearly half of people with PSC do not have symptoms and are often incidentally discovered to have PSC due to abnormal [[liver function tests]],&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; but a substantial proportion will have debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabibian JH, Lindor KD | date = Sep 2014 | title = Ursodeoxycholic acid in primary sclerosing cholangitis: If withdrawal is bad, then administration is good (right?) | url = | journal = Hepatology | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 785–8 | doi=10.1002/hep.27180 | pmid=24752961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs and symptoms of PSC may include severe [[pruritus|itching]] and non-specific fatigue. [[Jaundice|Yellowing of the skin and white portion of the eyes]] may also be seen. Enlargement of the [[hepatomegaly|liver]] and [[splenomegaly|spleen]] are seen in approximately 40% of affected individuals. Abdominal pain affects about 20% of people with PSC.

Multiple episodes of life-threatening acute [[cholangitis]] (infection within the bile ducts) can be seen due to impaired drainage of the bile ducts, which increases the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabibian JH, Yang JD, Baron TH, Kane SV, Enders FB, Gostout CJ|title=Weekend Admission for Acute Cholangitis Does Not Adversely Impact Clinical or Endoscopic Outcomes|journal=Dig Dis Sci|year=2016|volume=61|issue=1|pages=53–61|doi=10.1007/s10620-015-3853-z|pmid=26391268}} Epub 2015 Sep 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dark urine due to excess [[conjugated bilirubin]], which is water-soluble and excreted by the kidneys (i.e. choluria)
* [[Malabsorption]], especially of [[fat]], and [[steatorrhea]] (fatty stool), due to an inadequate amount of bile reaching the small intestine, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s, [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], and [[vitamin K|K]].
* [[Portal hypertension]], a complication of [[cirrhosis]], which can manifest with [[Esophageal varices|esophageal]] and parastomal varices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabibian JH, Abu Dayyeh BK, Gores GJ, Levy MJ | year = 2015 | title = A novel, minimally-invasive technique for management of peristomal varices | url = | journal = Hepatology | volume =  63| issue = | pages =  1398–400| doi = 10.1002/hep.27925 | pmid=26044445}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[hepatic encephalopathy]] (mental status alteration/disturbance caused by liver dysfunction and shunting of blood away from the scarred liver; such that ammonia detoxification is reduced with concomitant encephalopathy).

==Cause==
The exact cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is  unknown and its pathogenesis is poorly understood.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; Although PSC is thought to be an [[autoimmune disease]], it does not demonstrate a clear response to immunosuppressants. Thus, many experts believe it to be a complex, multifactorial (including immune-mediated) disorder and perhaps one that encompasses several different hepatobiliary diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabiban JH, Lindor KD | date = Feb 2013 | title = Primary sclerosing cholangitis: a review and update on therapeutic developments | url = | journal = Expert Rev.

In addition, there are longstanding, well-recognized associations between PSC and [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) alleles (A1, B8, and DR3).&lt;ref name=Charatchar/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
PSC is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) with consequent stricturing (i.e., narrowing) and hardening ([[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]) of these ducts due to scar formation, be it inside and/or outside the liver.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Primary sclerosing cholangitis|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673613600963|journal = The Lancet|pages = 1587–1599|volume = 382|issue = 9904|doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(13)60096-3|first = Gideon M|last = Hirschfield|first2 = Tom H|last2 = Karlsen|first3 = Keith D|last3 = Lindor|first4 = David H|last4 = Adams|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting scarring of the bile ducts obstructs the flow of bile, which further perpetuates bile duct and liver injury.  Chronic impairment of bile flow due to blockage and dysfunctional bile transport ([[cholestasis]]) causes progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately biliary cirrhosis and liver failure.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Robbins SL, Kumar V, Cotran RS | title = Robbins basic pathology  | publisher = Saunders  | location = Philadelphia  | year = 2003  | pages = 620–1  | edition = 7th  | chapter = Chapter 16  | isbn = 0-7216-9274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary physiological function of bile is to assist in the breakdown and absorption of fat in the intestinal tract; a relative deficiency of bile can lead to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of [[fat-soluble vitamins]] (A, D, E, K).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Liver enlargement is seen due to portal hypertension caused by compression of [[portal vein]]s by the proximate sclerosed intrahepatic bile ducts, and leads to right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:CT of primary sclerosing cholangitis.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] findings in a case of primary sclerosing cholangitis.]]
[[File:Sclerosing cholangitis 0001.jpg|thumb|Ultrasound of ?sclerosing cholangitis in the common bile duct]]
PSC is generally diagnosed on the basis of having at least two of three clinical criteria after secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis have been ruled out:
* serum [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP) &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of normal for longer than 6 months;
* cholangiography demonstrating biliary strictures or irregularity consistent with PSC; and,
* liver biopsy consistent with PSC (if available).

Historically, a cholangiogram would be obtained via [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP), which typically reveals "beading" (alternating strictures and dilation) of the bile ducts inside and/or outside the liver. Currently, the preferred option for diagnostic cholangiography, given its non-invasive yet highly accurate nature, is [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP), a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] technique.  MRCP has unique strengths, including high spatial resolution, and can even be used to visualize the [[biliary tract]] of small animal models of PSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabibian JH, Macura SI, O'Hara SP, Fidler JL, Glockner JF, Takahashi N, Lowe VJ, Kemp BJ, Mishra PK, Tietz PS, Splinter PL, Trussoni CE, LaRusso NF|title=Micro-computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for noninvasive, live-mouse cholangiography|journal=Lab. Invest.|year=2013|volume=93|issue=6|pages=733–43|pmid=23588707|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2013.52|pmc=3875307|url=http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/v93/n6/full/labinvest201352a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people with PSC have evidence of [[autoantibodies]] and abnormal immunoglobulin levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabibian JH, Enders F, Imam MH, Kolar G, Lindor KD, Talwalkar JA|title=Association between serum IgE level and adverse clinical endpoints in primary sclerosing cholangitis|journal=Ann Hepatol.|year=2014|volume=13|issue=3|pages=384–9|pmid=24756015|pmc=4215553|url=http://www.annalsofhepatology.com/revista/numeros/2014/12_143_v13n3_2014_AssociationBetween.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, approximately 80% of people with PSC have perinuclear [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody#p-ANCA|anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]] (P-ANCA); however, this and other immunoglobulin findings are not specific to those with PSC and are of unclear clinical significance/consequence. [[Antinuclear antibodies]] and [[anti-smooth muscle antibody]] are found in 20%-50% of PSC patients and, likewise, are not specific for the disease but may identify a subgroup of PSC patients who also have autoimmune hepatitis (i.e. PSC-AIH overlap syndrome).&lt;ref name=Charatchar/&gt;

Other markers which may be measured and monitored are a [[complete blood count]], serum [[liver enzyme]]s, [[bilirubin]] levels (usually grossly elevated), [[kidney function]], and [[electrolyte]]s. [[Fecal fat]] measurement is occasionally ordered when symptoms of malabsorption (e.g., gross [[steatorrhea]]) are prominent.

The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cholangitis (formerly referred to as [[primary biliary cirrhosis]]), drug-induced [[cholestasis]], [[cholangiocarcinoma]], [[IgG4-related disease]], post-liver transplantation non-anastomotic biliary strictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabibian JH, Asham EH, Goldstein L, Han S, Saab S, Tong MJ, Busuttil R, Durazo FA|title=Endoscopic Treatment with Multiple Stents for Post-Liver Transplantation Nonanastomotic Biliary Strictures|journal=Gastrointest Endosc.|year=2009|volume=69|issue=7|pages=1236–1243|doi=10.1016/j.gie.2008.09.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[HIV]]-associated cholangiopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lazaridis KN, LaRusso NF|title=The Cholangiopathies|journal=Mayo Clin Proc|year=2015|volume=90|issue=6|pages=791–800|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.03.017|pmc=4533104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis are distinct entities and exhibit important differences, including the site of tissue damage within the liver, associations with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, response to treatment, and risks of disease progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Risk stratification in autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases: Opportunities for clinicians and trialists|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28128/abstract|journal = Hepatology|date = 2016-02-01|issn = 1527-3350|pages = 644–659|volume = 63|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/hep.28128|language = en|first = Palak J.|last = Trivedi|first2 = Christophe|last2 = Corpechot|first3 = Albert|last3 = Pares|first4 = Gideon M.|last4 = Hirschfield|pmid=26290473|pmc=4864755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is typically classified into three subgroups based on whether the small and/or large bile ducts are affected. The subgroups of PSC include the following:&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;
* Classic PSC 
* Small-duct PSC
* PSC associated with [[autoimmune hepatitis]]

==Management==
No pharmacologic treatment has been approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for PSC. Some experts recommend a trial of [[ursodeoxycholic acid]] (UDCA), a bile acid occurring naturally in small quantities in humans, as it has been shown to lower elevated liver enzyme numbers in patients with PSC and has proven effective in other cholestatic liver diseases. However, UDCA has yet to be shown to clearly lead to improved liver histology and survival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindor&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lindor KD, Kowdley KV, Luketic VA, Harrison ME, McCashland T, Befeler AS, Harnois D, Jorgensen R, Petz J, Keach J, Mooney J, Sargeant C, Braaten J, Bernard T, King D, Miceli E, Schmoll J, Hoskin T, Thapa P, Enders F | title = High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis  | journal = Hepatology  | volume = 50  | issue = 3  |pages=671–3|date=Sep 2009|pmid=19585548|doi=10.1002/hep.23082|pmc=2758780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines from the [[American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases]] and the [[American College of Gastroenterology]] do not support the use of UDCA but guidelines from the [[European Association for the Study of the Liver]] do endorse the use of moderate doses (13-15 milligrams per kilogram) of UDCA for PSC.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=R|last2=Fevery|first2=J|last3=Kalloo|first3=A|last4=Nagorney|first4=DM|last5=Boberg|first5=KM|last6=Shneider|first6=B|last7=Gores|first7=GJ|last8=American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases|title=Diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis|journal=Hepatology|date=February 2010|volume=51|issue=2|pages=660–78|doi=10.1002/hep.23294|pmid=20101749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindor2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindor|first1=KD|last2=Kowdley|first2=KV|last3=Harrison|first3=ME|last4=American College of Gastroenterology|title=ACG Clinical Guideline: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis|journal=American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=May 2015|volume=110|issue=5|pages=646–59|doi=10.1038/ajg.2015.112|pmid=25869391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EASL2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European Association for the Study of the Liver.|title=EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: management of cholestatic liver diseases|journal=Journal of Hepatology|date=August 2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=237–67|doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2009.04.009|pmid=19501929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supportive treatment for PSC symptoms is the cornerstone of management. These therapies are aimed at relieving symptoms such as itching with [[antipruritic]]s (e.g. [[bile acid sequestrant]]s such as [[cholestyramine]]); [[antibiotic]]s to treat episodes of [[ascending cholangitis]]; and [[vitamin]] supplements, as people with PSC are often deficient in fat-soluble vitamins ([[vitamin A]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]], and [[vitamin K]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Management of cholestatic liver diseases|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168827809003092|journal = Journal of Hepatology|pages = 237–267|volume = 51|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jhep.2009.04.009|first = European Association for the Study of the|last = Liver|pmid=19501929|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERCP and specialized techniques may also be needed to help distinguish between a benign PSC stricture and a bile duct cancer ([[cholangiocarcinoma]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabibian JH, Visrodia KH, Levy MJ, Gostout CJ|title=Advanced endoscopic imaging of indeterminate biliary strictures|journal=World J Gastrointest Endosc|year=2015|volume=7|issue=18|pages=1268–78|doi=10.4253/wjge.v7.i18.1268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liver transplantation]] is the only proven long-term treatment of PSC, although only a fraction of individuals with PSC will need it. Indications for transplantation include recurrent bacterial ascending cholangitis, decompensated cirrhosis, [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and complications of [[portal hypertension]]. Not all patients are candidates for liver transplantation, and some will experience disease recurrence afterward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The development of any of the cancers associated with PSC predicts a poor prognosis. Complications from PSC-associated cancers account for 40% of deaths from PSC.&lt;ref name="Folseraas2016"/&gt; Primary sclerosing cholangitis is one of the major known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma,&lt;ref name="Tsaitas2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsaitas C, Semertzidou A, Sinakos E |title=Update on inflammatory bowel disease in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis|journal=World J Hepatol|volume=6|issue=4|pages=178–87|date=April 2014|pmid=24799986|pmc=4009473|doi=10.4254/wjh.v6.i4.178}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cancer of the biliary tree, for which the lifetime risk among patients with PSC is 10-15%.&lt;ref name="Kummen2013"/&gt; This represents a 400-fold greater risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma compared to the general population.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;  Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC is encouraged, with some experts recommending annual surveillance with a specialized imaging study and serum markers,&lt;ref&gt;Tabibian JH, Lindor KD. Challenges of Cholangiocarcinoma Detection in Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. J Analytical Oncology. 2012;1(1):50-55.&lt;/ref&gt; although consensus regarding the modality and interval has yet to be established.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Similarly, a screening [[colonoscopy]] is recommended in people who receive a new diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis since their risk of colorectal cancer is 10 times higher than that of the general population.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;

PSC is strongly associated with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), in particular [[ulcerative colitis]] (UC) and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. As many as 5% of patients with IBD are co-diagnosed with PSC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Olsson R, Danielsson A, Järnerot G, etal |title=Prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with ulcerative colitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=100 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1319–23 |year=1991 |pmid=2013375 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 70% of people with PSC have IBD.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; Of note, the presence of colitis appears to be associated with a greater risk of liver disease progression and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) development, although this relationship remains poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Population-based epidemiology, malignancy risk, and outcome of primary sclerosing cholangitis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.26565/abstract|journal = Hepatology|date = 2013-12-01|issn = 1527-3350|pages = 2045–2055|volume = 58|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/hep.26565|first = Kirsten|last = Boonstra|first2 = Rinse K.|last2 = Weersma|first3 = Karel J.|last3 = van Erpecum|first4 = Erik A.|last4 = Rauws|first5 = B.W.

Various forms of gallbladder disease such as [[gallstone]]s and gallbladder [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s are also common in those with PSC.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; Approximately 25% of people with PSC have gallstones.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; Ultrasound surveillance of the gallbladder every year is recommended for people with PSC.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; Any person with PSC who is found to have a mass in the gallbladder should undergo [[cholecystectomy|surgical removal of the gallbladder]] due to the high risk of cholangiocarcinoma.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt; [[Osteoporosis]] (hepatic osteodystrophy) and [[hypothyroidism]] are also associated with PSC.

==Epidemiology==
There is a 2-3:1 male-to-female predilection in primary sclerosing cholangitis.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  PSC can affect men and women at any age, although it is commonly diagnosed in the fourth decade of life, most often in the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  PSC progresses slowly and is often asymptomatic, so it can be present for years before it is diagnosed and before it causes clinically significant consequences.  There is relatively little data on the [[Prevalence (epidemiology)|prevalence]] and [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of primary sclerosing cholangitis, with studies in different countries showing annual incidence of 0.068–1.3 per 100,000 people and prevalence 0.22–8.5 per 100,000; given that PSC is closely linked with ulcerative colitis, it is likely that the risk is higher in populations where UC is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feld JJ, Heathcote EJ |title=Epidemiology of autoimmune liver disease |journal=J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1118–28 |date=October 2003 |pmid=12974897 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1746.2003.03165.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-1746.2003.03165.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, an estimated 29,000 individuals have PSC.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;

==Research directions==
Although there is no curative treatment, several clinical trials are underway that aim to slow progression of this liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treatment of autoimmune liver disease: current and future therapeutic options|url = http://taj.sagepub.com/content/4/3/119|journal = Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 2040-6223|pmc = 3629750|pmid = 23634279|pages = 119–141|volume = 4|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/2040622313478646|first = Palak J.|last = Trivedi|first2 = Gideon M.|last2 = Hirschfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Obeticholic acid]] is being investigated as a possible treatment for PSC due to its antifibrotic effects. [[Simtuzumab]] is a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the pro-fibrotic enzyme [[LOXL2]] that is being developed as a possible therapy for PSC.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"/&gt;

'''The Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators''' ('''RACMA''') is an accredited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Education/Approved-Programs-of-Study.aspx?ref=Medical%20Practitioner&amp;type=Specialist |accessdate=2015-12-02 |title=RACMA Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; specialist [[medical college]] comprising medical practitioners with specialist training in management and leadership of health services and systems. Fellows of the college combine clinical knowledge, skill, and judgement and apply this at an organisation wide level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/MJACareers_194-01.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-02 |title=Managing chaos: a career in medical administration – Medical Journal of Australia Careers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include administering or managing a hospital or other health service, or developing health operational policy, or planning or purchasing health services. The college is responsible for the training of medical professionals as specialist health leaders in Australia and [[New Zealand]] and has responsibility for assessing candidates and awarding the qualification of Fellowship of the College (FRACMA) to medical practitioners.

==About==
The Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators was founded in 1967 in response to the emergence of medical leadership as a specialty in its own right.
There are currently more than 800 Fellows of the College&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racma.edu.au/ |accessdate=2015-12-02 |title=RACMA Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of medical specialists from diverse positions in public hospital networks, government, and private organisations.
   
The College reports that its roles are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racma.edu.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=418&amp;Itemid=204 |accessdate=2015-12-02 |title=Roles and Objectives – RACMA Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To set educational standards;
*Accredit educational programs;
*Organise a continuing education program for Fellows and Associate Fellows;
*Conduct examinations;
*Nurture, guide and encourage Candidates, Associate Fellows and Fellows; and
*Assist clinicians and public health personnel who are increasingly being required to manage their clinical departments and public health programs and in addition to providing a clinical service.

RACMA is a member, and current chair of the Steering Committee, of the [[World Federation of Medical Managers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfmm.org/wfmm-membership.html |accessdate=2015-12-02 |title=WFMM Membership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The college formed as the Australian College of Medical Administrators (ACMA) on 21 March 1967 with 279 founding fellows. On 6 August 1979, royal assent was granted for use of the prefix 'Royal' to the Australian College of Medical Administrators. In 1998, the college formed links with New Zealand and the college was renamed to the current Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators.

The College was formally recognised by the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee in 1980 as the appropriate examining body for the specialty of medical administration, rendering Fellowship a nationally recognised specialist medical qualification.

==Governance==
The Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators is a Company Limited by Guarantee governed under a constitution adopted in 2010. The College National office is located in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]].

In 2015, suicide was the seventh [[List of causes of death by rate|leading cause of death]] for males and the 14th leading cause of death for females.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/suicide-datasheet-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was the second leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 24 and the third leading cause of death for those between the ages of 10 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide/index.shtml |title=Suicide |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to 2010, the suicide rate among Americans aged 35 to 64 increased nearly 30 percent.

The [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] reported that in 2016 suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., imposing a cost of $69 billion to the US annually.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Other statistics reported are:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

# Men die by suicide 3.53x more often than women.
# Women attempt suicide 1.2x more often than men.
# On average, there are 123 suicides per day.
# White males accounted for 7 of 10 suicides in 2016.

# The rate of suicide is highest in middle age—white men in particular.
The U.S. government seeks to prevent suicides through its National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, a collaborative effort of [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], and [[Indian Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/suicideprevention/strategy.asp |title=Suicide Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |website=Mentalhealth.samhsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100202/http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/suicideprevention/strategy.asp |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan consists of eleven goals aimed at preventing suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/SMA01-3518/default.asp |title=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Publications&amp;#124; SAMHSA Store |website=Mentalhealth.samhsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528000945/http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/SMA01-3518/Default.asp |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older adults are disproportionately likely to die by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tuesday, 17 February 2009 12:05 |url=http://www.mental-health-matters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=916 |title=In Harm's Way: Suicide in America – MHM: Suicide |website=Mental-health-matters.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. jurisdictions have [[laws against suicide]] or against [[assisting suicide]].

Approximately half of suicides are committed using a firearm, accounting for two-thirds of all firearm deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm|title=FastStats|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms were used in 56.9% of suicides among males in 2016, making it the most commonly used method by them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on the NVDRS 2016 data, the ''New York Times'' acknowledged that, among men, those over 65—who make up a [[Demography of the United States#Ages|smaller proportion of the population]]—are at greatest risk of death by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Span|first1=Paula|title=In Elderly Hands, Firearms Can Be Even Deadlier Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/health/elderly-guns-suicide-dementia.html|accessdate=27 May 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NVDRS 2015 data showed that, among men of all races, men over 65 were the most likely to commit suicide (27.67 suicides per 100,000), closely followed by men 40–64 (27.10 suicides per 100,000). Men 20–39 (23.41 per 100,000) and 15–19 (13.81 per 100,000) were less likely to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Violent Death Reporting System|url=https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/nvdrs.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder–suicide==
{{Further information|Murder–suicide}}
There have been many high-profile incidents in the United States in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s of individuals thought to be attempting "[[suicide by cop]]" or killing others before killing themselves. Examples include the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], the 2007 [[Virginia Tech massacre]], the [[2010 Austin plane crash]], the 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] and the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]].

[[File:United States Army Suicide Prevention Poster.jpg|thumb|300px|A United States Army [[suicide prevention]] poster]]
A 2009 U.S. Army report indicates [[military veteran]]s have double the suicide rate of non-veterans, and more [[active-duty]] soldiers have died from suicide than in combat in the [[Iraq War]] (2003–2011) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)]].&lt;ref name=EmaxHealth&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Tyler|title=This Week Is National Suicide Prevention Week|url=http://www.emaxhealth.com/1357/25/33364/week-national-suicide-prevention-week.html|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=Emax Health|date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Carl Castro, director of military operational medical research for the Army noted "there needs to be a cultural shift in the military to get people to focus more on mental health and fitness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jelinek|first=Pauline|title=Army: soldier suicide rate may set record again|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-09-04-3529406939_x.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=USA Today/Associated Press|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the US Army reported 185 suicides among active-duty troops, exceeding the number of combat deaths in that year (176). This figure has significantly increased since 2001, when the number of suicides was 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=David|title=Army Chief Ray Odierno Warns Military Suicides 'Not Going To End' After War Is Over|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/25/ray-odierno-military-suicides_n_3984359.html|accessdate=11 July 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBTQ===
Attempted suicide rates for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) youth and adults in the U.S. are three times higher than national averages.&lt;ref name=WesternHerald&gt;{{cite news|last=Melin|first=Amy|title=AFSP walkathon raises suicide awareness|url=http://www.westernherald.com/news/afsp-walkathon-raises-suicide-awareness/|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=Western Herald|date=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic Pain===
Patients with chronic pain are twice as likely to attempt suicide compared with those without chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clinicalpainadvisor.com/chronic-pain/suicide-attempts-in-chronic-pain/article/697827/|title=Patients With Chronic Pain Are Twice as Likely to Attempt Suicide|date=4 October 2017|work=Clinical Pain Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
Studies have found very high rates of suicide in people with [[autism spectrum disorders]], including [[high functioning autism]] and what was formerly known as [[Asperger syndrome]]. Autism and particularly Asperger syndrome are highly associated with [[clinical depression]] and as many as 30 percent or more of people with Asperger syndrome also suffer from depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcuautismcenter.org/foundations/comorbidity.pdf|format=PDF|title=Comorbid psychopathology with autism spectrum disorder in children: An overview|author1=Johnny L. Matson|author2=Marie S. Nebel-Schwalm|website=Vcuautismcenter.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism has been found to be closely related to [[fibromyalgia]], a common chronic pain disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=25336035 | volume=18 | title=Fibromyalgia, autism, and opioid addiction as natural and induced disorders of the endogenous opioid hormonal system | year=2014 | journal=Discov Med | pages=209–20 |vauthors=Johnson B, Ulberg S, Shivale S, Donaldson J, Milczarski B, Faraone SV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thitinart Na Pattalung''', also stylized as '''DDnard''' ({{lang-th|ฐิตินาถ ณ พัทลุง}}, born March 23, 1969) is a [[self-help]] guru, healer, entrepreneur and bestselling author of the Life Compass series of books.&lt;ref name="Positioning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positioningmag.com/magazine/details.aspx?id=70579 |title=Positioning |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, over 1.5million copies of her books, written under the name "DDnard", have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walton |first=Lucy  |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/books/ddnard-the-compass-of-now-448075.html |title=Two-Thirds Of Brits Relying On Dream Cash Windfall To Clear Personal DebtExclusive interview with Ddnard  |publisher=Female First |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thitinart is based in Bangpakong, [[Thailand]].

== Early life and education ==
Thitinart graduated from the [[University of London]] at the age of 20 with two master's degrees in Economics and Business Administration.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddnard.blogspot.co.uk/ |title=DDNARD N. Profile - The Compass of Now Author |date=2013-05-18 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation, at the age of 25, she launched her own diamond retail business - opening nine stores in Thailand within one month.&lt;ref name="Positioning" /&gt;

== Personal hardship and new beginnings ==
In 1997, her husband died at the age of 34 of an accident, leaving Thitinart with an 11-month-old son to care for and a debt inheritance of 3 Million US Dollars. It was at this point that she began exploring [[Buddhist meditation]] to help provide insight and inner contentment. Within two years, she had managed to pay off the debt.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frostmagazine.com/2014/03/the-compass-of-now-by-ddnard-book-review/ |title=Frost Magazine |date=2014-03-11 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thitinart retired from the diamond business at the age of 35, and relocated from [[Bangkok]] to live a “peaceful life” with her son in [[Hua Hin]] and then Sriracha. She spent time volunteering and teaching meditation and spiritual to various organizations, studied Happiness Sciences, [[Hypnotherapy]], [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]], [[Behavioral Science]], and began work on the first title in what would become the Life Compass books series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.compassnlp.com/about_teacher.php?cat=1 |title=About Master DDnard |accessdate=2014-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407060115/https://www.compassnlp.com/about_teacher.php?cat=1 |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Life Compass and teachings ==
Her first book, entitled “The Life Compass”, was published in Thailand in December 2004. Since then, several more books in the Life Compass series have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2008-12-26 |title=The Life Compass |url=http://issuu.com/adaybulletin/docs/adb23 |language=Thai |journal=a day Bulletin |issue=23  |location=Thailand |publisher=เดย์โพเอทส์|accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the first English language-edition of The Compass of Now was released, published through The Life Compass Ltd. To date, Thitinart's books have sold more than 1.5million copies worldwide.

Her teachings, which blend traditional Buddhist thought with modern mind technique, provide guidance to students and readers on learning how to clear and focus the mind, deal with emotional and anger issues, work through fears and challenges, and find emotional and financial freedom.&lt;ref name="Frost" /&gt; In 2013, Thitinart demonstrated some of these techniques during an interview with Thai TV presenter [[Woody Milintachinda]] on his chat show 'Woody Kerd Ma Kui'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naewna.com/entertain/columnist/7104 |language=Thai |title=จิตวิทยา หรืออุปาทานหมู่!? |publisher=Naewna.com|accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thitinart is the founder of Life Compass Ltd, which hosts regular meditation retreats throughout the year in Thailand. She also gives speeches at prisons, hospitals, military bases, police forces, temples, schools, universities and government organizations throughout Thailand, and talks at venues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassofnow.com/ | title=About DDnard | website=Compass of Now |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Thitinart was selected as one of the '100 Greatest Thinkers of Thailand' by Thai magazine "A Day Bulletin". Her story is featured in "100 Interview The Thinker" Hard Copy Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2013 |title=100 Interview The Thinker |url=http://www.daypoets.com/Issue/402-100%20Interview%20:%20The%20Thinker.html |language=Thai |location=Thailand |publisher=เดย์โพเอทส์|isbn=9786163270375 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thrombophlebitis''' is a [[phlebitis]] (''[[inflammation]]'' of a [[vein]]) related to a [[thrombus]] (blood clot).&lt;ref name="pmid16868304"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Torpy JM, Burke AE, Glass RM |title=JAMA patient page. Thrombophlebitis |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=296 |issue=4 |pages=468 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16868304 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.4.468 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16868304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it occurs repeatedly in different locations, it is known as '''''thrombophlebitis migrans''''', ''(migrating thrombophlebitis)'' {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Signs and symptoms==
The following symptoms or signs are often associated with thrombophlebitis, although thrombophlebitis is not restricted to the veins of the [[lower limbs|legs]].&lt;ref name="med"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrombophlebitis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001108.htm|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrombophlebitis Clinical Presentation: History, Physical Examination, Causes|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1086399-clinical#showall|website=emedicine.medscape.com|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Pain]] (area affected)
* Skin redness/[[inflammation]] 
* [[Edema]] ([[ankle]] and [[foot]])
* Cord-like [[veins]]
* Tenderness (leg)
}}
===Complications===
In terms of complications, one of the most serious occurs when the superficial blood clot is associated with a deeper venous thrombosis; this can then dislodge, traveling through the [[heart]] and occluding the dense [[capillary]] network of the [[lungs]] This is a [[pulmonary embolism]] which can be life-threatening to the affected individual.&lt;ref name=sci/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Deep vein thrombosis of the right leg.jpg|thumb|130 px|Deep vein thrombosis/ right leg]]
Thrombophlebitis causes include disorders related to increased tendency for [[blood clotting]] and reduced speed of blood in the veins such as prolonged immobility; prolonged traveling (sitting) may promote a blood clot leading to thrombophlebitis but this occurs relatively less. High estrogen states such as pregnancy, [[estrogen replacement therapy]], or oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of thrombophlebitis.&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philbrick|first1=John T.|last2=Shumate|first2=Rebecca|last3=Siadaty|first3=Mir S.|last4=Becker|first4=Daniel M.|title=Air Travel and Venous Thromboembolism: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=23 October 2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=107–114|doi=10.1007/s11606-006-0016-0|pmc=1824715|issn=0884-8734|pmid=17351849}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specific disorders associated with thrombophlebitis include superficial thrombophlebitis which affects veins near the skin surface, [[deep venous thrombosis]] which affects deeper veins, and [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superficial Thrombophlebitis: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/463256-overview#showall|website=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=23 October 2016|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with familial clotting disorders such as [[protein S deficiency]], [[protein C deficiency]], or [[factor V Leiden]] are also at increased risk of thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis can be found in people with vasculitis including [[Behçet's disease]]. Thrombophlebitis migrans can be a sign of malignancy - [[Trousseau sign of malignancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|title=Trousseau's syndrome: multiple definitions and multiple mechanisms|journal=Blood|date=15 September 2007|volume=110|issue=6|pages=1723–1729|doi=10.1182/blood-2006-10-053736|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/110/6/1723?sso-checked=true|accessdate=23 October 2016|language=en|issn=0006-4971|pmid=17496204|pmc=1976377}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis for thrombophlebitis is primarily based on the appearance of the affected area. Frequent checks of the [[pulse]], [[blood pressure]], and [[temperature]] may be required. If the cause is not readily identifiable, tests may be performed to determine the cause, including the following:&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;
* [[Doppler ultrasound]]
* Extremity [[arteriography]]
* [[Blood coagulation]] studies ([[Blood clotting tests]])

==Prevention==
Prevention consists of walking, drinking fluids and if currently hospitalized, changing of [[Intravenous|IV lines]].&lt;ref name=med/&gt; Walking is especially suggested after a long period seated, particularly when one travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tamparo|first1=Carol D.|title=Diseases of the Human Body|date=2016|publisher=F.A. Davis|isbn=9780803657915|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMOCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=prevention+thrombophlebitis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyscSc_PHPAhWDOT4KHa3CD04Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prevention%20thrombophlebitis&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Ibuprofen3DanJ.gif|thumb|Ibuprofen (NSAID)]]
In terms of treatment for this condition the individual may be advised to do the following: ''raise'' the affected area to decrease [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], and relieve  pressure off of the affected area so it will encounter less pain. In certain circumstances drainage of the clot might be an option. In general, treatment may include the following:&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=P.|title=Thrombophlebitis☆|journal=Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences|date=1 January 2014|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.05368-X|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012801238305368X|accessdate=23 October 2016|publisher=Elsevier}}{{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* Low molecular weight [[heparin]] 
* [[Warfarin]]
* [[Surgery]]
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications ([[NSAIDS]]) ([[Ibuprofen]])
* Support [[stockings]] 
}}

==Epidemiology==
Thrombophlebitis occurs almost equally between women and men, though males do have a slightly higher possibility. The average age of developing thrombophlebitis, based on analyzed incidents, is 54 for men and 58 for women.&lt;ref name=sci/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13718">The '''United States Preventive Services Task Force''' ('''USPSTF''') is "an independent panel of experts in primary care and prevention that systematically reviews the [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence of effectiveness]] and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm Agency for Healthcare Research Quality&lt;/ref&gt; The task force, a panel of primary care physicians and epidemiologists, is funded, staffed, and appointed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfab.htm |title=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: About USPSTF|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;Factbox: [https://news.yahoo.com/factbox-u-preventive-services-task-force-works-131521046.htmlHow the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force works], By Alina Selyukh | Reuters via Yahoo News – Sun, Dec 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The USPSTF evaluates scientific evidence to determine whether [[medical screenings]], [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], and preventive medications work for adults and children who have no symptoms.

==Methods==
The methods of evidence synthesis used by the Task Force have been described in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methods and Processes - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/methods-and-processes|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, their methods were revised.&lt;ref name=pmid17576998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guirguis-Blake J, Calonge N, Miller T, [[Albert Siu|Siu A]], Teutsch S, Whitlock E|title=Current processes of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: refining evidence-based recommendation development|journal=Ann.

=== No weight given to cost-effectiveness ===
The USPSTF explicitly does not consider cost as a factor in its recommendations, and it does not perform cost-effectiveness analyses.&lt;ref name=":Branvani"&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Economic Framework For Preventive Care Advice|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/11/2034|journal=Health Affairs|date=2014-11-01|issn=0278-2715|pages=2034–2040|volume=33|issue=11|first=Mark V.|last=Pauly|first2=Frank A.|last2=Sloan|first3=Sean D.|last3=Sullivan|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0873|pmid=25368000}}&lt;/ref&gt; American health insurance groups are required to cover, at no charge to the patient, any service that the USPSTF recommends, regardless of how much it costs or how small the benefit is.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title = Forbidden Topic in Health Policy Debate: Cost Effectiveness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/upshot/forbidden-topic-in-health-policy-debate-cost-effectiveness.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date=2014-12-15|access-date=2015-10-22|issn=0362-4331|first=Aaron E.|last=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grade definitions===
The task force assigns the letter grades A, B, C, D, or I to each of its recommendations, and includes "suggestions for practice" for each grade. The Task Force also defined levels of certainty regarding net benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm|title=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: Grade Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
!Grade
!Result
!Meaning
|-
|Grade A
|Recommended
|There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.
|-
|Grade B
|Recommended
|There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
|-
|Grade C
|No recommendation
|Clinicians may provide the service to selected patients depending on individual circumstances. However, for most individuals without signs or symptoms there is likely to be only a small benefit.
|-
|Grade D
|Recommended against
|The Task Force recommends against this service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
|-
|I statement
|Insufficient evidence
|The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.
|}

Levels of certainty vary from high to low according to the evidence.

* '''High''': Consistent results from well-designed studies in representative populations that assess the effect of the service on health outcomes. 
* '''Moderate:''' The evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the service, but confidence is limited. The conclusion might change as more information becomes available.

The USPSTF has evaluated many interventions for prevention and found several have an expected net benefit in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = USPSTF A and B Recommendations by Date - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations-by-date/|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Aspirin in men 45 to 79 and women 55 to 79 for cardiovascular disease
* Colon cancer screening by colonoscopy, occult blood testing, or sigmoidoscopy in adults 50 to 75.
* Low-dose CT scans for adults 55 to 80 at increased risk of lung cancer
* Osteoporosis screening via bone [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA) in women over 65

==Breast cancer screening==
In 2009, the USPSTF updated its advice for screening [[mammogram]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid19920272&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement|journal=Ann. Intern. Med.|volume=151|issue=10|pages=716–26, W–236|date=November 2009|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-151-10-200911170-00008|pmid=19920272|url=http://www.annals.org/content/151/10/716.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening mammograms, or routine mammograms, are X-rays given to apparently healthy women with no symptoms or evidence of [[breast cancer]] in the hope of detecting the disease in an early, easily treatable stage.  The advice about using mammography in the presence of symptoms (such as a lump in the breast that can be felt) is unchanged.

The previous advice was for all women over the age of 40 to receive a mammogram every one to two years.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2002&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/breastCancer/brcanrr.htm  Screening for Breast Cancer:  Recommendations and Rationale] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The new advice is more detailed. For women between the ages of 50 and 74, they have recommended routine mammograms once every two years in the absence of symptoms.  Most American women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are diagnosed after age 60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html Cancer of the breast], [[SEER]] Stat Fact Sheets, summarizing Horner MJ, Ries LAG, Krapcho M, et al. (eds). [http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/ SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2006], [[National Cancer Institute]]. Bethesda, MD, based on November 2008 SEER data submission, posted to the SEER web site, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPSTF declared that there is insufficient evidence to make any statement about the use of mammograms in women over the age of 75, as very little research has been performed in this age group.

The Task Force made no recommendation about routine [[mammography]] to screen asymptomatic women aged 40 to 49 years for [[breast cancer]].  Patients in this age group should be educated about the risks and benefits of screening, and the decision whether to screen or not should be based on the individual situation and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm|title=Final Update Summary: Breast Cancer: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old advice was based on "weak" evidence for this age group.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2002/&gt; The new advice is based on improved scientific evidence about the benefits and harms associated with mammography and is consistent with recommendations by the [[World Health Organization]] and other major medical bodies.  Their recommendation against routine, suspicion-less mammograms for younger women does not change the advice for screening women at above-average risk for developing breast cancer or for testing women who have a suspicious lump or any other symptoms that might be related to breast cancer.

The change in the recommendation for younger women has been criticized by some physicians and cancer advocacy groups, such as [[Otis Brawley]], the chief medical officer for the [[American Cancer Society]],&lt;ref.[http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/11/16/mammography.recommendation.changes/index.html "Task force opposes routine mammograms for women age 40-49"] - Danielle Dellorto, CNN Medical Producer&lt;/ref&gt; and praised by physicians and medical organizations that support individualized and [[evidence-based medicine]], such as Donna Sweet, the former chair of the [[American College of Physicians]], who currently serves on its Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee.&lt;ref name=ACP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acponline.org/pressroom/sweet_testimony.htm?hp|title=Role of evidence based medicine in clinical decision-making addressed by ACP in testimony|publisher=American College of Physicians|date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPSTF recommendation, which focuses solely on [[clinical effectiveness]] without regard to cost,&lt;ref name=ACP2 /&gt; formally reduces the [[Evidence-based medicine#Categories of recommendations|grade given for evidence quality]] from "B" to "C" (limited evidence prevents a one-size-fits-all recommendation) for routine mammograms in women under the age of 50.&lt;ref name=Vitter-Mikulski&gt;{{cite news
|title=Senate Affirms Screening Mammography for 40-Year-Olds|author=Walker, Emily|date= 3 December 2009|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=3 December 2009|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/OnCallPlusBreastCancerNews/senate-affirms-screening-mammography-40-year-olds/story?id=9243563}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a grade C recommendation, physicians are required to consider additional factors, such as the individual woman's personal risk of breast cancer. Pending health care legislation would require insurance companies to cover any and all preventive services that receive an "A" or "B" grade, but permit them to use discretion on preventive services that receive a worse grade.&lt;ref name=Vitter-Mikulski/&gt;

The Vitter amendment to the Mikulski amendment to pending legislation in the [[U.S. Senate]] instructs insurers to disregard the task force's recommendation against frequent routine mammograms in asymptomatic younger women, and requires them to provide free annual mammograms, even for low-risk women, based on the outdated 2002 report.&lt;ref name=Vitter-Mikulski/&gt; This proposal is not yet law and may change. {{update-inline|date=May 2018}} The efforts by politicians to reject the committee's scientific findings have been condemned as an example of unwarranted [[Politicization of science|political interference in scientific research]].&lt;ref name=ACP2&gt;{{cite web|title= Statement On the Politicization of Evidence-based Clinical Research|url= http://www.acponline.org/pressroom/pol_ebcr.htm|author= Stubbs, Joseph W.|publisher= American College of Physicians|date= 24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostate cancer screening==

In the current recommendation published in 2012, the Task Force recommended against [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=TaskForce2012/&gt; The Task Force gave [[prostate cancer screening|PCa screening]] a D recommendation.&lt;ref name=TaskForce2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatefinalrs.htm|title=Screening for Prostate Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final statement published in 2018 recommends basing the decision to screen on shared decision making in those 55 to 69 years old.&lt;ref name=TF2017DraftPC/&gt; It continues to recommend against screening in those 70 and older.&lt;ref name=TF2017DraftPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Prostate Cancer: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate=19 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 1984 to 1989, the task force's stated purpose was to "develop recommendations for primary care clinicians on the appropriate content of periodic health examinations."&lt;ref&gt;http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/guidecps/uspstf.htm Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

===Radiation-induced===
[[Uterine cancer|Uterine]], [[vaginal cancer|vaginal]], [[rectal cancer|rectal]] and [[cervical cancer]]s are often treated with pelvic radiation therapy (RT). Radiation-induced vaginal stenosis can be a side effect of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harkenrider MM, Block AM, Alektiar KM, Gaffney DK, Jones E, Klopp A, Viswanathan AN, Small W | title = American Brachytherapy Task Group Report: Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy for early-stage endometrial cancer: A comprehensive review | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–108 | pmid = 27260082 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2016.04.005 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1538472116300496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris L, Do V, Chard J, Brand AH | title = Radiation-induced vaginal stenosis: current perspectives | journal = International Journal of Women's Health | volume = 9 | pages = 273–279 | date = 2017-05-02 | pmid = 28496367 | pmc = 5422455 | doi = 10.2147/IJWH.S106796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes are [[External beam radiotherapy|external beam radiation therapy]] (EBRT), or [[brachytherapy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is one of the most prevalent side effects of pelvic radiation, affecting about one third of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03090217|title=Pelvic Physiotherapy in the Prevention of Vaginal Stenosis Secondary to the Radiotherapy; ClinicalTrials.gov|access-date=2018-03-11 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eviq.org.au/clinical-resources/radiation-oncology/1867-management-of-radiation-induced-vaginal-steno|title=Management of radiation induced vaginal stenosis eviQ; (Australian, evidence-based health information)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eviq.org.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation-induced stenosis can be a late reaction to treatment. Damage to the vaginal epithelium causes abnormal collagen production that leads to atrophy, loss of muscle, decreased blood flow,  [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia,]] and [[fibrosis]]. [[Pallor|Pallor,]] [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], and fragility can be observed along with loss of elasticity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Congenital ===
The inadequate prenatal suppression of adrenal androgens leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This condition can result in the vagia being affected by stenosis as a result.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Stenosis of the vagina is treated with [[vaginal dilator therapy]], but the evidence is lacking for its efficacy.&lt;ref name="pmid20824858"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miles T, Johnson N | title = Vaginal dilator therapy for women receiving pelvic radiotherapy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 9 | pages = CD007291 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20824858 | pmc = 4171967 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007291.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198150|date = December 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White ID, Faithfull S | title = Vaginal dilation associated with pelvic radiotherapy: a UK survey of current practice | journal = International Journal of Gynecological Cancer | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 1140–6 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16803497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Washington Navy Yard shooting''' occurred on September 16, 2013, when a lone gunman, 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, fatally shot 12 people and injured three others in a [[mass shooting]] at the headquarters of the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA) inside the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast]] [[Washington, D.C.]] The attack, which took place in the Navy Yard's Building 197, began around 8:16&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT and ended when Alexis was killed by police around 9:25&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT.

It was the second-deadliest mass murder on a U.S. military base, behind only the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]].

He assembled the shotgun inside a bathroom, then emerged with the gun, crossed a hallway into the building's 4 West area, which is a cubicle area near the atrium, and began shooting at 8:16&amp;nbsp;a.m. Four people were hit; three of them died, while the fourth, a young woman, survived wounds to the head and hand.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name="Photos and video of Navy Yard Shooting released by FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Navy Yard shooting: Up to speed in 3 minutes |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/us/navy-yard-shooting-recap/index.html?on.cnn=1 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921074533/http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/us/navy-yard-shooting-recap/index.html?on.cnn=1 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 8:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., approximately one minute and 30 seconds after the first shots were fired,&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt; the first calls to [[9-1-1]] were made.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name="Photos and video of Navy Yard Shooting released by FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy Yard Shooting Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/17/navy-yard-shooting-timeline_n_3940925.html|title=Navy Yard Shooting Timeline|date=September 17, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., Alexis had shot and killed eight people on the fourth floor, and he made his way to the third floor, where he fatally shot two more people within the next two minutes. He also fired at several people on at least five separate occasions, wounding one woman in the shoulder as she ran up a stairwell. A NAVSEA employee described encountering a gunman wearing all-blue clothing in a third-floor hallway, saying, "He just turned and started firing."&lt;ref name="Photos and video of Navy Yard Shooting released by FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/09/201391613153627767.html |title=Thirteen killed in US Navy base shooting  |publisher= Al Jazeera |date=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After firing several shots on the third floor, Alexis went to the first floor.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;

===Police response===
At 8:23&amp;nbsp;a.m., officers from the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|D.C. Metropolitan Police Department]] and several other law enforcement agencies began arriving at Building 197. However, because there were many buildings on the base, officers were unable to discern Building 197's location and asked bystanders for its location. They eventually found Building 197 after moving towards the direction people were fleeing from. There was also confusion regarding the shooting also taking place in a nearby building; in reality, a wounded victim evacuated from Building 197 had been moved to an area located near the second building for medical attention.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy Yard Shooting Timeline"/&gt; The United States Capitol Police became embroiled in a public controversy when the police union accused the agency of ordering its personnel to stand down and not respond to the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/18/navy-yard-capitol-police-swat-team-recalled/2834079/|title=Report: Capitol Police thwarted from aiding at Navy Yard|publisher=|accessdate=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the first floor, the shooter moved around randomly before turning around and heading towards the front entrance. There, he fired at Richard Ridgell, the security officer stationed there, through a set of windows, killing him and taking his [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92FS]] [[9mm]] [[semiautomatic pistol]] afterwards. Ridgell, a former [[Maryland]] state trooper, had earlier been informed by two police officers to remain at his post and try to stop the gunman if he attempted to leave the building.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcwashington/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTshear/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news |title=DC gunman was suffering host of mental issues prior to shooting, report says |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/17/active-shooter-at-washington-navy-yard/ |publisher=Fox News |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron the shooter easily passed two background checks, bought shotgun from Sharpshooters in Lorton, Va.|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/17/aaron-alexis-easily-passed-two-background-checks-b/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HonorsCeremony"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/dc-police-honor-courage-dedication-of-navy-yard-massacre-responders/2014/02/21/7894b772-9aee-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html |title=D.C. police honor courage, dedication of Navy Yard massacre responders |publisher= Washington Post|date=February 21, 2014 |first=Clarence |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooter then fired his shotgun at a second security guard and a Navy military police officer at the first-floor atrium, missing both; the security guard fired back and the shooter fled down a hallway. Shortly afterwards, the shooter fired at two police officers and a [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] agent in another hallway before fleeing again.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;

At 8:34&amp;nbsp;a.m., the shooter went towards the west side of the building, where he encountered two men standing at a corner of the building in an alleyway. He tried to fire at them with his shotgun, but realized he was out of ammunition and switched to the stolen Beretta, shooting and killing one of the men with it; the other man managed to escape without injury.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt; Reports indicated the victim in the alleyway was hit by a "stray bullet".&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt; The shooter's use of the pistol during the alleyway shooting led police officials to initially believe the possibility of a second gunman involved.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;

After killing his final victim, the shooter moved to a cubicle area, where he discarded the shotgun. At the same time, a team of officers entered Building 197, but they became confused after gunshots echoed through the atrium, leading them to believe the gunman was on an upper floor. As a result, the officers headed up to the second floor, while the shooter remained on the first floor. At approximately 8:55&amp;nbsp;a.m., the shooter went to the third floor via stairwell and concealed himself inside a bank of cubicles. At 9:12&amp;nbsp;a.m., two officers and two NCIS agents entered the cubicle area,&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt; whereupon the shooter opened fire on them, hitting one of the officers, Scott Williams, in both legs.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcwashington/&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy Yard Shooting Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HonorsCeremony"/&gt; The other officer and the NCIS agents dragged Williams out of the area and alerted other officers to the shooter's presence. Williams was later taken down to the first floor for medical attention, recovering from his wounds.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt;

At 9:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., soon after Williams' evacuation, D.C. Police Emergency Response Team officer Dorian DeSantis and [[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]] officers Andrew Wong and Carl Hiott entered the cubicle area and searched the individual banks. Eventually, the shooter jumped out from one of the desks and fired at DeSantis from approximately five feet away, hitting him once in his tactical vest, and the three officers returned fire. DeSantis was uninjured by the gunshot.&lt;ref name="Police after-action report" /&gt; At 9:25&amp;nbsp;a.m., the shooter was fatally shot in the head by DeSantis, and his death was later confirmed at 11:50&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=whathappened/&gt;&lt;ref name="Photos and video of Navy Yard Shooting released by FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy Yard Shooting Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HonorsCeremony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoonewssept17"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/13-killed-washington-navy-yard-shooting-rampage-212545654.html |title=13 killed in Washington Navy Yard shooting rampage |publisher= [[Associated Press]] via [[Yahoo News]]|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'One of the worst things we've seen' - a timeline of Navy Yard shooting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/16/us/dc-navy-yard-tic-toc/?hpt=po_c1|title='One of the worst things we've seen' - a timeline of Navy Yard shooting|date=September 16, 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional work===
In March 2008, Alexis received a secret-level security clearance valid for ten years. Following the Navy Yard shooting, it was found that the federal personnel report that led to the clearance's approval did not mention that his 2004 arrest had involved a firearm. On his clearance application, Alexis said he had never been charged with a felony, and that he had not been arrested in the last seven years; the personnel report said Alexis had given these answers because the 2004 charge had been dismissed.&lt;ref name="Navy Yard shooter's personnel report left out gun-related details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-navy-shooter-20130924,0,3834322.story|title=Navy Yard shooter's personnel report left out gun-related details|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo46879 Internal Review of the Washington Navy Yard Shooting: A Report to the Secretary of Defense] [[United States Department of Defense]]&lt;/ref&gt; This security clearance investigation was conducted by [[USIS (company)|USIS]], the same contractor that had also vetted [[Edward Snowden]].

===Mental health issues===
After the Navy Yard shooting, the media speculated that Alexis had appeared to be suffering from [[mental illness]]. The media reported that Alexis had filed a police report in Rhode Island on August 2, 2013, in which he claimed to be the victim of harassment and that he was hearing voices in his head.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Tucker 18 September 2013.

''The Huffington Post.'' Retrieved: 22 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an FBI official after the shooting, Alexis was under the "belief that he was being controlled or influenced by [[Extremely low frequency|extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves]]". A message later obtained by federal authorities from Alexis' personal computing devices said, "Ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 months. And to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this."&lt;ref name=lowfrequency&gt;Greg Botelho and Joe Sterling. September 26, 2013.

Retrieved: 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2013, naval police were called to Alexis' hotel at [[Naval Station Newport]] and found that he had "taken apart his bed, believing someone was hiding under it, and observed that Alexis had taped a microphone to the ceiling to record the voices of people that were following him". At the time of the incident, he was working for the contractor at the base.&lt;ref name="Report: Concerns about Navy Yard shooter never reported"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/18/navy-yard-shooter-called-insider-threat/6558373/|title=Report: Concerns about Navy Yard shooter never reported|author=Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2013, Alexis showed up at a [[Providence, Rhode Island]] VA emergency room complaining of [[insomnia]], and he was prescribed 50 milligrams of [[Trazodone]], a [[serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor]] [[antidepressant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2014/01/aaron-alexis-navy-yard-shooter-fooled-veterans-affairs-doctors-99768.html|title=Aaron Alexis, Navy Yard shooter, fooled Veterans Affairs doctors|work=WJLA|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28, he sought treatment for insomnia in the emergency room of a VA medical center in Washington, D.C. where he told doctors he was not depressed and was not thinking of harming others. He was given 10 more tablets of Trazodone.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Vogel, Sari Horwitz and David A. Fahrenthold. 19 September 2013.

===Prior to the shooting===
At the time of the shooting, Alexis had been working for a subcontractor on a [[Hewlett-Packard]] Enterprise Services contract supporting a Navy Marine Corps (NMCI) computer network.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; Alexis arrived in the Washington, D.C., area on or around August 25, 2013, and stayed at various hotels. At the time of the massacre, he had been staying with five other civilian contractors at a [[Residence Inn]] hotel in southwest Washington D.C. since September 7.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FBI: Alexis acted alone, had only one weapon, arrived in D.C. 3 weeks ago |last1=Wolfgang |first1=Ben |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/17/fbi-alexis-acted-alone-had-only-one-weapon-arrived/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, September 14, two days before the massacre, Alexis visited the Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in [[Lorton, Virginia]], {{convert|15|mi}} south of Washington. He tested an [[AR-15]] [[semiautomatic rifle]] but did not seek to buy it, a lawyer for the store said. After testing the rifle, Alexis inquired about buying a [[handgun]] at the store, but was told federal law does not allow dealers to sell such guns directly to out-of-state customers. Alexis instead purchased a [[Remington 870]] Express Tactical 12-gauge shotgun and two boxes of shells, after passing a state and federal background check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside Sharpshooters, the Newington gun store where Aaron Alexis bought his shotgun |last1=Jackman |first1=Tom |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2013/09/18/inside-sharpshooters-the-newington-gun-store-where-aaron-alexis-bought-his-shotgun/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MILLER: New York Times gets it wrong, media obsessed with linking AR-15 with Navy Yard shooter |last1=Miller |first1=Emily |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/17/miller-new-york-times-gets-it-wrong-about-navy-yar/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MILLER: New York Times corrects AR-15 Navy Yard story, still misses the mark |last1=Miller |first1=Emily |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/20/new-york-times-corrects-ar-15-navy-yard-story-stil/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='NYT' Corrects D.C.

On September 16, many roadways and bridges were temporarily closed,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; and flights out of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] were temporarily suspended.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; Eight schools were locked down, with the closest, Brent Elementary School, being locked down until 1 PM. &lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Shortly after 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., [[United States Senate]] buildings went on lock-down for about an hour "out of an abundance of caution", according to the [[Senate Sergeant at Arms]].&lt;ref name="post_updates" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate lockdown lifted|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/senate-lockdown-over-large-shooting-suspect/|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=September 16, 2013|author=Stephen Dinan|work=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Nationals]] baseball team postponed their scheduled evening game, owing to the proximity of [[Nationals Park]] to the Navy Yard area (the facilities are close enough to [[Navy Yard – Ballpark (WMATA station)|share a Metro station]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2013/09/16/status-of-nationals-braves-game-unclear-after-navy-yard-shootings/|title=Nationals-Braves game canceled after Navy Yard shootings (updated)|last=Kilgore|first=Adam|author2=James Wagner |date=September 16, 2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drinking water supply and sanitation in Argentina''' is characterized by relatively low tariffs, mostly reasonable service quality, low levels of metering and high levels of consumption for those with access to services. At the same time, according to the [[WHO]], 21% of the total population remains without access to house connections and 52% of the urban population do not have access to sewerage. The responsibility for operating and maintaining water and sanitation services rests with 19 provincial water and sewer companies, more than 100 municipalities and more than 950 cooperatives, the latter operating primarily in small towns. Among the largest water and sewer companies are Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos (AYSA) and Aguas Bonarenses S.A. (ABSA), both operating in [[Greater Buenos Aires]], Aguas Provinciales de [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and Aguas Cordobesas SA, all of them now publicly owned. In 2008 there were still a few private concessions, such as Aguas de [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]] SA, which is majority-owned by Argentine investors, and Obras Sanitarias de [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] (OSM).

Most service providers barely recover operation and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While private operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery, since the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine financial crisis]] in 2002 tariffs have been frozen and the self-financing capacity of utilities has disappeared. Roughly two-thirds of provincial water and sanitation spending since 2002 has come from general transfers from the federal government, the remainder coming from various national programs directed specifically to the sector.

Services are regulated by the 23 [[Provinces of Argentina|Provinces]], in the case of 14 through regulatory agencies that have some limited autonomy from the government. Overall, however, responsibilities are not always clearly defined, and institutions are often weak, subject to political interference and lacking enforcement powers. The various national institutions with policy-setting responsibilities in the sector are not always well coordinated. There is no coherent national policy in terms of sector financing, subsidies, tariffs and service standards. The federal structure of the country and the dispersion of sector responsibilities between and within various levels of government make the development of a coherent sector policy all the more difficult.

Between 1991 and 1999, as part of one of the world's largest privatization programs covering a range of sectors, water and sanitation concessions with the private sector were signed covering 28% of the country's municipalities and 60% of the population.&lt;ref name="Galiani"&gt;{{cite web

The impact of private sector participation in water and sanitation is a controversial topic. While the public perception of the mostly international concessionaires is overwhelmingly negative in Argentina, some studies show positive impacts. For example, a 2002 study assessed the impact of privatization on child mortality based on household survey data, finding that child mortality fell 5 to 7 percent more in areas that privatized compared to those that remained under public or cooperative management.&lt;ref name="iadb.org"&gt;{{cite web

==Access==
In Argentina, in 2015, 99% of the population had access to "special" water, 98.9% in urban areas  and 99.9% in rural areas. Still, in 2015, around 390 thousand lacked access to "improved" water. Regarding access to "improved" sanitation it includes 96% of the population, 96% and 98%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Approximately, 1.5 million of people were still without access to "improved" sanitation, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/argentina/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Argentina|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas of Argentina, service is generally continuous and of potable quality.&lt;ref name="PAHO"/&gt; However, water rationing occurs in some cities during the summer months, and drinking water quality is sometimes sub-standard.

In Buenos Aires, in 2008 there were two water treatment plants and a new one was about to begin.&lt;ref name="clarin"&gt;{{cite web

Concerning sanitation, existing sewage collection systems are insufficient to handle the increasing flows as a growing number of households connect to the sewer systems, leading to frequent sewer overflows.

The level of wastewater treatment varies among the Argentinean regions. According to the Pan American Health Organization, at the national level 10% of the collected wastewater was being treated in 2000. Whereas in many regional capitals, such as [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], [[Neuquén, Argentina|Neuquén]], [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]], [[Salta]] and [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], most of the wastewater was treated, in the two largest [[urban area]]s of the country, [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]] and [[Greater Rosario|Rosario]], there was practically no treatment at all, resulting in serious environmental problems. However, in 2008 a bidding process was launched to build a wastewater treatment plant in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="clarin" /&gt;

== History and recent developments ==
From 1880 until 1980, the national utility ''Obras Sanitarias de la Nación'' (OSN) was in charge of providing water and sewer services in the main cities, while in smaller cities it was the responsibility of provincial governments, municipalities and cooperatives.

In 1980 the military government under [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] decentralized the provision of water and sanitation services in the main cities served by OSN, except for the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires where OSN continued to provide services. In other cities OSN transferred its responsibilities to provincial governments. Each province chose its model of service provision (municipal, public enterprises, cooperatives or others).

Between 1991 and 1999 under the government of [[Carlos Menem]], as part of one of the worlds largest privatization programs covering a range of sectors, water and sanitation concessions with the private sector were signed in 28% of the country's municipalities covering 60% of the population.&lt;ref name="Galiani" /&gt; The highest profile concession was signed in 1993 with a consortium led by the French firm [[Suez (company)|Suez]] for [[Greater Buenos Aires|the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires]]. After the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|2001 economic crisis]], under the government of [[Néstor Kirchner]], many concessions were renegotiated. Some were even terminated and the responsibility for service provision reverted to public entities, as it was the case in Buenos Aires where the newly created public enterprise ''Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos'' took over the responsibility for service provision in 2006.&lt;ref name="argentina.gov.ar" /&gt; At the beginning of 2008, the government of the [[Mendoza Province|Province of Mendoza]] announced that it is interested in increasing its control of the provincial water utility ''Obras Sanitarias de Mendoza'', of which it owns 20%, buying another 20% from Saur International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Impact of private sector participation ===
So far there has been no comprehensive, objective assessment of the impact of private sector participation in water supply and sanitation in Argentina. However, there has been some partial evidence. For example, a 2002 study assessed the impact of privatization on child mortality based on household survey data, finding that in the 1991-1997 period child mortality fell 5 to 7 percent more in areas that privatized compared to those that remained under public or cooperative management. It also found that the effect was largest in poorest areas (24%).&lt;ref name="iadb.org"/&gt; The authors estimate that the main reason is the massive expansion of access to water, which was concentrated in poorer areas that did not receive services before private sector participation was introduced.

==== The Buenos Aires concession ====

The largest and best-known case of private sector participation in the Argentine water and sanitation sector was the Buenos Aires concession, signed in 1993 and revoked in 2006. Its impact remains controversial and in early 2008 an arbitration case was still pending with the [[International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) of the World Bank Group.

Critics argue that the concessionaire failed to achieve the targets set under the concession contract. When the government rescinded the concession in March 2006, it argued that Aguas Argentinas did not comply with obligations concerning expansion and quality. According to the government, the supplied water had high levels of nitrate, pressure obligations were not kept and scheduled waterworks were not executed by the concessionaire.&lt;ref name="Solanes 2006 124–148"/&gt; On the other hand, proponents of private participation state that a freeze in tariffs at the time of the devaluation of the Peso during the Argentinean economic crisis in 2001 substantially reduced the real value of tariff revenues and thus made it difficult to achieve the original targets.

One factor which may have caused the cancellation of the concession contract was the precipitate preparation. Alcazar et al. list some features of the concession which indicate an overhasty process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Solanes points out that without this practice companies may seek financing in local capital markets to avoid currency fluctuations. He also argues that the needs of the poor were not addressed in the concession. No subsidies were provided for the poor and the tariff system did not encourage expansion of coverage to poor areas, since new connections were often unaffordable and new users also had to pay the costs of expanding the network.&lt;ref name="Solanes 2006 158-164"&gt;{{cite journal

The concessionaire did invest much more than its public predecessor and achieved substantial increases in access to water and sewerage. According to the Argentinean economist Sebastian Galiani, the public company OSN had invested only US$25m per year between 1983 and 1993, while the private concessionaire Aguas Argentinas increased investments to around US$200&amp;nbsp;m per year between 1993 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to [[Suez (company)|Suez]], during the 13&amp;nbsp;year-duration of its concession it extended access to water to 2&amp;nbsp;million people and access to sanitation to 1&amp;nbsp;million people, despite the economic crisis. Between 2003 and 2005 alone about 100,000 inhabitants of poor neighborhoods and slums are said to have been connected through a "participatory management model" piloted by Aguas Argentinas. Aspects of the model have been adopted by the government to extend services to another 400,000 people in La Matanza in the province of Buenos Aires in the project "Water plus work" ("Aguas más trabajo").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suez Environment |first= |authorlink= |title=Argentinean official website |work= |publisher= |url=http://argentina.suez-environnement.com/en/nos-engegagements/agua-mas-trabajo/sustainable-solutions/sustainable-solutions/ |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215225236/http://argentina.suez-environnement.com/en/nos-engegagements/agua-mas-trabajo/sustainable-solutions/sustainable-solutions/ |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== An example of local private sector participation: Salta ====

The government of [[Salta Province]] initiated the reform of its water sector in 1996. At the same time many other Argentinean provinces and municipalities brought in the private sector to improve water and sanitation services. While Salta also followed this approach, the process differed somewhat from the one in many other parts of Argentina.&lt;ref name="Saltiel"&gt;{{cite web

  |format=
  |doi=
  |accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the provincial government conducted a series of meetings with municipalities and user organizations to discuss the benefits and risks of the concession before it was bid out. This process of consultations was continued by the private concessionaire after the contract was awarded. Second, the government decided from the onset that water and sanitation services in the poor province could not be financed entirely through tariff revenues. It thus decided to finance much of the investments to be undertaken by the private concessionaire with public grants, in addition to providing consumption subsidies. Third, the regulatory agency allowed the concessionaire to provide services at a lower standard in remote or isolated areas that were deemed unprofitable at conventional service standards. Fourth, the provincial regulatory agency granted tariff increases before and even after the 2001 economic crisis. These tariff increases were lower than it would have been necessary without subsidies or flexible service standards. And fifth, the government "ignored the traditional paradigm of only permitting companies with significant previous experience in water supply and sanitation to compete in the bidding process". This provision had favored a few large multinational water firms in other bidding processes. In Salta, however, the bid was won by the Argentinean construction, power and toll road enterprise MECON S.A. which signed a technical assistance contract with the Brazilian [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] State public utility SANEPAR.&lt;ref name="Saltiel" /&gt;

The private concession led to a substantial increase in access to water and sanitation from the time of concession award in 1999 to 2005. It also provided a significant decrease in service interruptions and improved customer service. 13 more municipalities joined the concession contract after it had been signed in order to share in its benefits, bringing the total number of municipalities served by the concessionaire to 56.&lt;ref name="Saltiel" /&gt;

While most other private water concessions in Argentina were rescinded in the years after the 2001 economic crisis, the Salta concession has been upheld until 2009 despite a number of problems. In February 2008 the regulatory agency initiated penal proceedings against the concessionaire because one of its wastewater treatment plants discharging to the Arenales River was not functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.iruya.com/content/view/3190/412/ Aguas de Salta denunciada penalmente por vertido de líquidos cloacales al río Arenales]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 the company was accused of not having complied with contractual targets for the installation of meters, water pressure, continuity of supply, drinking water quality norms, and of applying excessive interests on late payments.&lt;ref&gt;Iruya.com:[http://noticias.iruya.com/content/view/9794/417/ Santos Jacinto Dávalos:Por la re-estatización del agua de Salta], June 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 [[Juan Manuel Urtubey]], governor of the Province, terminated the concession contract because of non-compliance and created a transition unit to provide services until a state company would be created whose shares would be held by the Province (90%) and workers (10%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Télam]]:[http://www.bnamericas.com/news/aguasyresiduos/Salta_rescinde_contrato_de_concesion_y_constituye_sanitaria_estatal1 Salta rescinde contrato de concesión y constituye sanitaria estatal], May 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===

Provinces have responsibility for setting rules and policies in the sector for their area. Institutions are weak, subject to political interference and lacking in enforcement powers. 14 out of 23 provinces have regulatory bodies, but they often have limited capacity and unclear institutional responsibilities. In most cases, they act as supervisors of private concession contracts, not covering public and cooperative service providers. This autonomy of provinces resulted in a highly heterogeneous system of water supply and sanitation.&lt;ref name="WB 69"&gt;{{cite web

Despite recent progress in clarifying responsibilities, the institutional framework at the national level still lacks coherence and coordination among federal actors is weak. The [http://www.obraspublicas.gov.ar/ Ministry of Public Works] proposes sector policies to the [http://www.minplan.gov.ar/ Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services] which approves them. Within this policy framework the [http://www.enohsa.gov.ar/ National Agency for Water and Sanitation Works (ENOHSA)], a decentralized agency under the Ministry of Public Works, provides financing and technical assistance to service providers. As an advisor to the Ministry of Public Works it de facto influences sector policies. ENOHSA has also been given the faculty to directly execute infrastructure works. There has been some confusion between its position as conceding power (in the [[Buenos Aires]] concession) and as policy-maker for the overall sector. There is no coherent national policy in terms of sector financing, subsidies, tariffs and service standards. Nor is there a sector law for water and sanitation. The federal structure of the country and the dispersion of sector responsibilities between and within various levels of government make the development of a coherent sector policy all the more difficult.

=== Service provision ===

Provision of water and sanitation supply in Argentina is organized on a municipal or provincial basis by around 1,650 public, cooperative and private entities of various forms. 14 service providers are provincial (Argentina has 23 provinces), but do not necessarily serve the entire province. Some are multi-municipal, some serve a single municipality and others parts of a municipality. There are at least 990 mostly smaller cooperative service providers in Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Financial aspects ==

===Tariffs===
[[File:AySA.JPG|thumb|250px|Bills of '''Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos''']]
In 2000, the Argentinean water and sanitation tariff levels were high, given the low quality of services. According to the Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO), the mean tariff for water and sanitation was US$0.79 per m3.&lt;ref name="PAHO" /&gt; There are two different tariff systems. The first method is based on the former OSN tariff system. It estimates the consumption of each user according to characteristics such as dwelling size, location of residence and type of dwelling. The second tariff system contains a fixed charge and a variable part which is based on metered consumption. This latter method was made possible by the extensive introduction of [[Water supply#Metering|water metering]], which was included in many concession contracts in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WB 65" /&gt; The average household expenditure for water supply and sanitation in 2002 was 2.6%, ranging from 2.1% in the highest (wealthiest) quintile to 3.5% in the lowest (poorest) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Cost recovery ===
Most service providers barely recover operation and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While private operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery and to substantially expand services before the crisis, since 2002 their tariffs have been frozen and their self-financing capacity has disappeared. Service providers thus are almost entirely dependent on federal transfers for investment financing. Roughly two-thirds of provincial water and sanitation spending over the period has come from general transfers from the federal government, the remainder coming from various programs directed specifically to the sector, including for flood protection and water resources management.

When the [[Argentine Currency Board|linkage of the Argentinean peso to the US-Dollar]] was abandoned due to a [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|serious economic crisis]] in 2002, the tariffs did not increase but converted 1 to 1 to the devalued peso, resulting in various contract renegotiations. This decision worsened the financial situation of the suppliers. The lack of financial resources results in problems concerning even in maintaining the supply system.&lt;ref name="WB 69" /&gt;

Cutting off water services for non-payment is prohibited in Argentina based on a common interpretation of the constitution.

'''Water supply and sanitation''' ('''WSS''') '''in the European Union''' ('''EU''') is the responsibility of each member state, but in the 21st century union-wide policies have come into effect.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Water resources are limited and supply and sanitation systems are under pressure from urbanisation and [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Indeed, the stakes are high as the European Environmental Agency found that one European out of ten already suffers a situation of water scarcity&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/featured-articles/water-scarcity&lt;/ref&gt; and the IEA measured the energy consumption of the water sector to be equivalent to 3,5% of the electricity consumption of the EU&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WorldEnergyOutlook2016ExcerptWaterEnergyNexus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

The water policy of the [[European Union|EU]] is primarily codified in the following [[European Union directive|directives]]:

* The Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC) of 1976 replaced by the Directive 2006/7/EC
* The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) of 21 May 1991 concerning discharges of municipal and some industrial [[waste water]]s;
* The Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) of 3 November 1998 concerning potable [[water quality]];
* The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) of 23 October 2000 concerning [[water resources]] management.

EU member states have enacted national legislation in accordance with these directives. The institutional organisation of public water supply and sanitation does not fall under the purview of the EU, but remains a prerogative of each member state.

== Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive of 1991 ==
{{main|Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive}}
The [[Urban Waste Water Directive|Council Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0271:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 31991L0271 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain industrial sectors. Its aim is to protect the environment from any adverse effects due to discharge of such waters.

According to the directive's timetable:

* by 31 December 1998: all agglomerations of more than 10 000 [[Population equivalent|population equivalents (PE)]] which discharge water into sensitive areas had to have a proper collection and treatment system requiring meeting the most stringent quality standards, usually referred to as tertiary treatment (Art. 5);
* by 31 December 2000: agglomerations of more than 15 000 p.e. outside sensitive areas had to have a collection and treatment system which enables them to satisfy less stringent requirements, usually referred to as secondary treatment (Art. 4);
* by 31 December 2005: all agglomerations of between 2 000 and 10 000 [[Population equivalent|PE]]. which discharge water into sensitive areas, and all agglomerations of between 2 000 and 15 000 p.e. which do not discharge into such areas had to have a collection and treatment system (Art. 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/water_protection_management/l28008_en.htm | title = Summaries of EU Legislation: Urban waste water treatment | accessdate = 2009-07-18 | date = 7 September 2007 | publisher = [[European Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the case of Spain changes were made at the time of transposing the Directive. In Article 2 of the Directive, a collecting system means "a system of conduits which collects and conducts urban waste water" and therefore all sewers and drains, both public and private were included. However, in the Spanish transposition (Real Decreto-Ley 11/1995 of 28 December 1995), the definition of a collecting system was changed to mean “all systems of conduits which collect and conduct urban waste water, from the municipal sewer and drainage networks and go to the treatment plants.” The added words mean that when the Spanish definition is applied to Article 3 of the Directive the municipal sewer and drainage networks are excluded. If the municipal network did not exist, as in the case of many urbanisations (housing estates) developed in the 1960s and 1970s and within agglomerations of over 2000 p.e. no collecting system needed to be provided at all, under the Real Decreto-Ley 11/1995. Obviously if waste water is not collected it cannot be treated, therefore the changed definition also affected Article 4 of the Directive. Even so, Spain had to and still has to comply fully with the Directive.
On 5 March 2009, the Catalan Autonomous Government finally approved a law (La Llei de la millora d’urbanizacions) to deal with deficits of infrastructures, such as sewers in urbanisations in Catalonia, 18 years after the Directive was approved by the European Parliament.

The directive also allows the establishment of less sensitive coastal areas, for which primary treatment would be sufficient, if it can be shown that there is no adverse impact on the environment (Art. 6).

Member states had to establish lists of sensitive areas. It has been estimated that in 2004 about 34 percent of the pollutant load from [[wastewater]] that falls under the scope of the directive is discharged into sensitive areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2004/com2004_0248en01.pdf |title=European Commission 2004, p. 107 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Directive was amended by the Commission Directive 98/15/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0015:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 31998L0015 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation challenges ===
[[Commission Decision]] 93/481/EEC defines the information that Member States should provide the Commission on the state of implementation of the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993D0481:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 31993D0481 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] published three reports on the implementation of the directive, the latest in 2004. The report noted that the wastewater treatment situation in Europe is still very unsatisfactory and that none of the deadlines has been met by all member countries. Only Austria, Denmark and Germany fully complied with the directive. The report noted that [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] levels in European rivers have been reduced by 20–30 percent since the enactment of the directive, but that other pollution parameters such as nitrogen levels remained high. The reason is that much of the nitrogen pollution comes from non-point sources in agriculture, and the still insufficient nutrient removal by wastewater treatment plants. The [[eutrophication]] of the [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]] and considerable parts of the [[Mediterranean]] thus remains a "severe problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2004/com2004_0248en01.pdf |title=European commission 2004, p. 106 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also noted that it is estimated that more than 50 percent of the discharges into sensitive areas was not treated sufficiently. Even for non-sensitive areas, although the picture was less bleak, only 69% of the discharge received treatment and the 2000 deadline was not met by most member countries. 25 out of 556 cities in the EU still had no wastewater treatment system at all.

The directive triggered substantial investment in [[sewage treatment]] throughout the EU. A controversial aspect of the directive is the requirement for all agglomerations with more than 2,000 inhabitants to have a wastewater collection system, which has been widely interpreted as requiring connection to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] system even if existing on-site sanitation systems perform adequately. The cost of connecting houses to sewers in small rural towns with dispersed housing patterns is often very high and imposes a high financial burden on users.

According to the European Commission, the directive represents the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector. The EU estimates that the equivalent of €152 billion were invested in wastewater treatment from 1990 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission 2004, op. cit., p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The EU provides support for the implementation of the directive in the order of 5 billion Euro per year.

=== Planned revision ===

The European Commission is currently undergoing a consultation on the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. As the directive was adopted in 1991, its challenge will be to integrate the commitments taken with the [[Paris Agreement|Paris agreement]] as the wastewater treatment sector consumes 1% of the global total energy consumption&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WorldEnergyOutlook2016ExcerptWaterEnergyNexus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Under a business as usual scenario, this figure is expected to increase by 60% by 2040 compared to 2014. With the introduction of energy efficiency requirements, the energy consumption of the wastewater treatment sector can be reduced by 50% only by using current technologies. On top of that, there are also opportunities to produce enough energy from wastewater to turn the whole water sector energy neutral. It uses the energy embedded in the [[Sludge|sludge]] by producing biogas through [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digestion]]. These features have been mainly overlooked due to the over-riding objective for utilities to meet existing and future needs for wastewater treatment.

== Drinking water directive of 1998 ==
{{main|Drinking water directive}}

=== Content ===
The Directive is intended to protect human health by laying down healthiness and purity requirements which must be met by drinking water within the Community (see [[water quality]]). It applies to all water intended for human consumption apart from natural mineral waters and waters which are medicinal products.

Member States shall ensure that such [[drinking water]]:

* does not contain any concentration of [[micro-organism]]s, [[parasite]]s or any other substance which constitutes a potential human health risk;
* meets the minimum requirements (microbiological and chemical [[parameter]]s and those relating to [[radioactivity]]) laid down by the directive.
* They will take any other action needed to guarantee the healthiness and purity of water intended for human consumption.

In setting contaminant levels the directive applies the [[precautionary principle]]. For example, the EU contaminant levels for [[pesticides]] are up to 20 times lower than those in the WHO drinking water guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]]:[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/gdwq3/en/ Guidelines for drinking-water quality, third edition, incorporating first and second addenda], accessed on 6 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; because the EU directive not only aims at protecting human health but also the environment. The WHO contaminant levels themselves are already set so that there would be no potential risk if the contaminant was absorbed continuously over a person's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.cieau.com/toutpubl/sommaire/texte/0/f04.htm Centre d'Information sur l'Eau]:[http://www.cieau.com/toutpubl/sommaire/texte/5/f52.htm Les normes de qualité de l'eau potable sont très rigoureuses], accessed on 6 May 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413140638/http://www.cieau.com/toutpubl/sommaire/texte/0/f04.htm |date=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EU drinking water standards and cases where these standards are temporarily exceeded by a small margin should be interpreted in this context.

Compared to the previous European drinking water directive of 1980 the number of parameters has been reduced, allowing member to add parameters such as [[magnesium]], total [[hardness]], [[phenols]], [[zinc]], [[phosphate]], [[calcium]] and [[chlorite]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;"Europe paves the way for revision of the Drinking Water Directive", Water 21, Journal of the International Water Association, August 2006, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive requires member states to regularly monitor the quality of water intended for human consumption by using the methods of analysis specified in the directive, or equivalent methods. Member states also have to publish drinking water quality reports every three years, and the [[European Commission]] is to publish a summary report. Within five years Member States had to comply with the Directive. Exemptions can be granted on a temporary basis, provided that they do not affect human health.

=== Implementation challenges and planned revision ===

Until 2006 the European Commission has not published a summary report on drinking water quality. No EU country achieves full compliance with the directive, mainly because of the geological nature of its soil and agricultural activity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt; in 2003 the European Commission initiated a broad consultation process to prepare a revision of the Directive. One key aspect of the revision would be to move away from a pure end-of-pipe standard setting approach. Instead the whole water supply process from the basin to the tap would be assessed to identify risk and the most effective control points, through so-called [[Water safety plan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The pivotal role of water safety plans", Water 21, Journal of the International Water Association, August 2006, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Another important challenge will be to integrate the new environmental, climate and energy goals of the EU. The issue is substantial as in average 23% of the treated water in the EU is leaked, with some countries facing leakage rates as high as 60%. &lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1519213340992&amp;uri=CELEX:52017SC0449&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Water Framework Directive of 2000 ==

=== Content ===
{{main|Water Framework Directive}}
Under this Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l28002b.htm |title=Water Framework Directive |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; member states have to identify all the [[river basin]]s lying within their national territory and assign them to individual river basin districts. By 22 December 2003 at the latest, a competent authority had to be designated for each of the river basin districts. In addition, member states have to analyse the characteristics of each river basin and have to carry out an economic analysis of water use. Nine years after the entry into force of the directive, a management plan must be produced for each river basin district. The measures provided for in the river basin management plan seek to:

* prevent deterioration, enhance and restore bodies of surface water, achieve good chemical and ecological status of such water and reduce pollution from discharges and emissions of [[hazardous substance]]s;
* protect, enhance and restore all bodies of [[groundwater]], prevent the pollution and deterioration of groundwater, and ensure a balance between abstraction and recharge of groundwater;
* preserve [[protected area]]s.

By 2010, Member States must ensure that water pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently and that the various economic sectors contribute to the recovery of the costs of water services including those relating to the environment and resources. This cost recovery rule is expected to impact particularly irrigated agriculture, where users have not paid the full costs of water supply.

At the latest twelve years after the date of entry into force of the Directive, the [[European Commission]] has to publish a report on the implementation of the Directive.

=== Implementation challenges ===

Some countries, such as France and Spain, had already established basin agencies before the enactment of the directive. They should thus find it easy to implement that part of the directive. Other countries that have historically managed their water resources through institutions whose geographical limits were determined by administrative boundaries, such as in the case of Germany where the states (Laender) manage water resources, are in the process of setting up co-ordinating mechanisms for each river basin. Other elements of the directive, such as the protection of groundwater and cost recovery rules, may be more difficult to implement, especially in Southern member countries that have extensive irrigated agriculture.

In March 2007 the EU commission published its first progress report on the implementation of the EU Framework Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/implrep2007/pdf/sec_2007_0362_en.pdf |title=Water Framework Directive Implementation Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report notes mixed results. Almost all member countries have transposed the directive into national law, but the report notes that "the legal transposition of the Directive in national law is poor and in many cases inadequate". Indeed, the report finds that only in three countries the national law (Austria, Malta and Portugal) is in conformity with the Directive. Furthermore, there have been significant delays in the analysis of the characteristics of each river basin. Since the establishment of this knowledge base is a precondition for Basin Plans, this delay jeopardises progress of the implementation of the entire Directive.

== Water Supply and Sanitation ==

=== Access ===

Average connection rates to [[sanitation]] systems between 80%–90% are reported for Northern, Southern and Central Europe. Eastern Europe still copes with much lower rates of 40%–65% of the population connected to primary [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/regions/central-and-eastern-europe-and-commonwealth-independent-states/|title=Central and Eastern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=WASHwatch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe in general is improving: Over the last decade more households accessed public treatment plants or even upgraded their treatment system (e.g. from secondary to tertiary treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/urban-waste-water-treatment/urban-waste-water-treatment-assessment-2 |title=Data on waste water treatment by European Statistical Office |publisher=Eea.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service quality ===

As access is dependent on each member state so is service quality. It ranges from very good service quality in Northern and Southern States of the European Union for example in [[Water supply and sanitation in Spain|Spain]] or [[Public water supply and sanitation in Germany|Germany]] to insufficient or poor services especially in Eastern European states. The history of WSS within the member states and different states in development can partly explain the heterogeneous state of the supply and treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewerhistory.org/articles/whregion/finland/european_cities.pdf |title=About the history of European WSS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of WSS sector ===

The supply of water and its disposal has been managed in Europe for many centuries. Centralised water supply and sanitation started with the Romans who were responsible for the construction of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s and systems to collect and distribute water. During the [[Middle Ages]] water was distributed through private carriers or/and organised through local communities or cities. The [[industrial revolution]] and the construction of modern industrialised conurbations in Europe was dependent upon managed water supplies. The United Kingdom pioneered urban planning at that time.

The time of industrialisation and development of cities (between 1800–1900) in terms of WSS is called the time of simple regime followed by the regimes of lower complexity between 1900–1950, medium (1980–1970), high complexity (1970–1985) and the era finally ended up in an so called attempt of integration from 1985 onwards. The terms reflect the approach of most (Western) European countries towards WSS at that time. It steadily developed from privately organised co-operations to governmental influenced systems. Together with water management in general, it nowadays comes back to private initiatives manifested in Public-Private co-operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewerhistory.org/articles/whregion/finland/european_cities.pdf |title=About the history of WSS in Europe |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Waters ===

The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Waters is the EU's policy response to the challenges of the implementation of the EU [[Water Framework Directive]]. It is basically structured in four parts:
* The review of actions taken to mitigate [[water scarcity]] and droughts,
* So called Fitness-Checks identifying overlapping or redundant policy structures and recommend improvement strategies,
* The assessments of  (a) river basin management plans (by Member States) and (b) vulnerability of water resources due to climate change.

=== Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform ===

Main text:[[Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform]]

One international nonprofit association (under Belgian law) supporting the European Union in dealing with the challenges of water related issues is the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform|WssTP]]. This platform was built up in 2004 with financial support of the [[European Commission]] and is steadily growing ever since. The association is dealing with water supply and sanitation issues within Europe and all over the world. Nowadays, it is funded through fees paid by its 127 members from industry, research and education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsstp.eu/files/WSSTPX0001/position%20paper/Position%20on%20Green%20Paper%2020-06%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The aim of the association is to support the development of the water related sector within Europe, assist both the EU and developing countries in achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]], and provide Research and Development roadmaps and recommendations on water related issues especially involving the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsstp.eu/content/default.asp?PageId=750&amp;LanguageId=0 |title=The WssTP online |publisher=Wsstp.eu |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water Information System for Europe ===

The Water Information System for Europe (WISE) is a partnership of the [[European Commission]], the [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)]], [[Eurostat]], the [[Joint Research Centre]] and the [[European Environment Agency]]. Since 2007 this web-based service platform provides the public with information about ongoing research projects, policies, data, and reports connected to water in the EU. The target group of this online information system is researches and professionals dealing with water related issues within the framework of the EU. The platform helps to store and administer data and output handed in by member states and agencies connected to the reporting requirements of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.europa.eu/info |title=The WISE online |publisher=Water.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EAP Task Force ===

The Environmental Action Programme (EAP) is a policy adopted by Environment Ministers in 1993 in a conference in Switzerland. An international Task Force was established later on to support mainly states of countries in the [[EECCA|Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia]]. In WSS they are supporting the financial strategies of a number of countries to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Furthermore, they are working on indicators and monitoring systems in those countries to collect data of water utilities to check their performance. Apart from that, the EAP task force is figuring out the potentials of the private sector to participate in the water sector especially in water supply and sanitation in the [[EECCA]] countries and they consult local partners in financial planning and investment. They are also collaborating with the EU Water Initiative since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/33/24/39270866.pdf |title=About the EAP Task Force |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major challenges ==

Major challenges of the EU concerning WSS are connected with modern pressures to the system. [[Climate change]], [[Demography|demographic developments]], urbanization, economic progress, social changes influence the water sector in many ways. The [[European Union]] is said to be very effective concerning water management and policies. However, especially the new member states located in Eastern Europe are in need of enormous investments to ensure the sustainability of the water infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.europa.eu/webpub/eca/special-reports/drinking-water-12-2017/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing and foreseen problems are the lack of investments in the rural and municipal water supply which led to poor services (e.g. water leakages, interruption of service, insufficient water availability during drought, etc.), the limited availability of water resources and its energy consumption which can represent up to 50% of municipalities' electricity bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeandcis.undp.org/environment/wg/show/FA47A40B-F203-1EE9-BE886D4884BD6A92 |title=About Problems in WSS in Eastern Europe and CIS |publisher=Europeandcis.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/29/46/36388760.pdf |title=About financing WSS in EECCA countries |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WorldEnergyOutlook2016ExcerptWaterEnergyNexus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are actually available and with a quick return on investment but the sole focus on water quality  has diverted the attention for the increasing need of sustainability from the water sector in the context of climate change. 

Water supply limitation counts as major concern. The first and most rational answer should be to tackle the water leakage problem Europe is facing as almost 1/4 of treated water is leaked in average in the EU&lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1519213340992&amp;uri=CELEX:52017SC0449&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, research shows that water reuse and recycling are also solutions in the long-term. Furthermore, expert's advice say that water supply and waste water treatment systems should be decentralised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdzv-drustvo.si/si/VD-05_Referati/Wilderer.pdf |title=Article about the major challenges |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another challenge within the water sector in Europe is privatisation and lobbyism in the water sector. In France, recent problems emerged regarding the privatising of water supply companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watermakesmoney.com/images/stories/pdf/CEO_EU_turning-on-the-taps.pdf |title=About Lobbyism in the EU water sector |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wastewater reuse ==
According to an EU-funded study, "Europe and the Mediterranean countries are lagging behind" California, Japan, and Australia "in the extent to which reuse is being taken up." According to the study "the concept (of reuse) is difficult for the regulators and wider public to understand and accept."&lt;ref name="IWA"&gt;"Reuse of water in the EU and the Mediterranean", by Bill McCann, Water 21, Journal of the International Water Association, April 2008, p. 42-44, quoting the [http://www.aquarec.com Aquarec project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest waste reclamation program in the world is in [[Water supply and sanitation in Spain|Spain]], where 12% of the nation's waste is treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Article.aspx?id=183787 |title= Wastewater wonders|author= MELANIE LIDMAN  |date= 6 August 2010 |work= |publisher= Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indirect potable reuse (IDP) project in Wulpen, [[Belgium]], discharges recycled water to an unconfined dune aquifer. Initially the recycled water comprised 90% RO permeate and 10% MF permeate (approx. 6,000,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year). However, it was observed that some herbicides were present in the recycled water at levels below drinking water standards due to detection of herbicides in the MF permeate. As a result, since May 2004, only the RO permeate after UV disinfection is injected into the aquifer with addition of sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techneau.org/fileadmin/files/Publications/Publications/Presentations/Workshop_NF_UF/van-Houtte.pdf|title=The IWVA Torreele water re-use plant: operational experiences (IWVA)|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Van Buynder|first2=Paul|last3=Lugg|first3=Richard|last4=Blair|first4=Palenque|last5=Devine|first5=Brian|last6=Cook|first6=Angus|last7=Weinstein|first7=Philip|date=17 March 2009|title=Indirect Potable Reuse: A Sustainable Water Supply Alternative|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1174–1203|doi=10.3390/ijerph6031174|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Clemencia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">'''Yvonne M. Agazarian''' (born Feb 17, 1929; died Oct 9, 2017) was the principal architect of [[systems-centered therapy]], based on a theory of Living Human Systems that she also developed. Agazarian taught, trained, and supervised systems-centered therapists internationally, was the founder of the [http://www.systems-centered.org Systems-Centered Training &amp; Research Institute], and practiced in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

==Awards and achievements==

In 1997, the American Psychological Association awarded her Group Psychologist of the Year "for her involvement in research, publication, teaching and training. She exemplifies the finest in scholarship in the discipline of psychology. As a group psychologist, she has contributed to expanding our knowledge of the boundaries between clinical and social psychology with the investigation of living human systems and systems-centered group and individual therapy. Her considerable body of work illustrates the highest blend of creativity and learning".&lt;ref&gt;Agazarian, ''Theory and Practice'' p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book, ''Systems-Centered Therapy for Groups'', was also published in 1997.

==Origins of theory==

Agazarian had from the sixties been interested in the paradigm clash presented by her training in individual psychotherapy and in group therapy, and in the possibility of overcoming it: from the eighties onwards, she explored the possibility of resolving it through [[general systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Gantt, p. xvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the challenge presented in the following decade by [[health maintenance organization]]s and their stress on short-term therapy, that propelled her into devising systems-centered therapy, in order (she stated) to discover "how to think about short-term therapy in a way that maintained the integrity and values of our work".&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Agazarian, ''A Systems-Centered Approach to Inpatient Group Psychotherapy'' (2001) p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences she credited on her work range from [[W. R. Bion]] and [[John Bowlby]] to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]],&lt;ref&gt;Agazarian, ''Inpatient'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting both her intellectual range and the trajectory of her movement from [[psychoanalysis]] through whole-group therapy to systems=centered therapy.
