The '''Arab Satellite Communications Organization''' (often abbreviated as '''Arabsat''') is a [[communications satellite]] operator in the [[Arab World]], headquartered in the city of [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Arabsat was created to deliver satellite-based, public and private telecommunications services to the Arab States, in accordance with International Standards. With 21 member countries, the organization plays a vital role of enhancing communications in the Arab World.&lt;ref name=emiratesweek-2010051224 /&gt;

The '''Arabsat''' [[satellite]]s are a series of [[geostationary]] [[communications satellite]]s launched from 1985 through 2011. Some of the later satellites in the series remain operational in orbit, while others have been retired and are [[:Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth|derelict]].

==History==
The foundation of Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat) dates from the late 1960s. In 1967, information ministers of Arab states developed a series of principles in relation to a satellite network, to create an integration of social and cultural activities among the [[Arab League]] countries. On the other hand, the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU) was established in 1969. [[Saudi Arabia]] did not join this Egypt-led and Cairo-based union until 1974, most probably due to the tense relationship between Saudi Arabia and [[Egypt]] at the time.

On 14 April 1976, Arabsat was formed under Arab League jurisdiction with the goal of serving the information, cultural and educational needs of its member states. Saudi Arabia was the main financier of the new organization due to its expanded financial resources as a result of its flourishing oil-exporting industry. [[Riyadh]] housed Arabsat's headquarters.

The first launch [[Arabsat-1A]] was performed by a French Ariane rocket. The American [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] launched Arabsat's second satellite, [[Arabsat-1B]], in 1985. Arabsat-1A and -1B were switched off in 1992 and 1993, respectively.

==Satellites==

=== Arabsat-1 ===
'''Arabsat-1''' was the model designator for a series of first-generation satellites built by an international team led by [[Aérospatiale]] of France. It is a satellite with three-axis stabilized [[Spacebus#Spacebus 100|Spacebus 100]]  spacecraft with two deployable solar array wings, making it almost 68&amp;nbsp;ft (20.7 m) long and over 18&amp;nbsp;ft (5.5 m) wide when deployed in orbit. It weighs about 2,800&amp;nbsp;lb (1,270&amp;nbsp;kg) in its initial orbit, but some 1,490&amp;nbsp;lb (675&amp;nbsp;kg) of this is propellant. It has an onboard low-thrust motor that utilizes hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, and transfers from an initial elliptical to geosynchronous orbit by firing this motor. The remaining propellant is then used for station-keeping or moving over the life of the satellite.

'''[[Arabsat-1A]]''', the first Arabsat satellite, was launched by [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]] on 8 February 1985.  Shortly after launch it suffered a solar panel extension malfunction. Coupled with other failures, the satellite was soon relegated to backup status until it was abandoned completely in late 1991.

'''[[Arabsat-1B]]''', the second flight model, was deployed in June 1985, from the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] on mission [[STS-51-G]], and placed into service near 26° East, and remained in operation until mid-1992.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''[[Arabsat-1C]]''' the third satellite of the series, was launched by Ariane on 26 February 1992, as a stop-gap measure to maintain network services until the Arabsat second generation spacecraft became available.

'''Arabsat-1D''' was renamed from the Anik-D2 (a Hughes HS-376 bus originally carrying 24 active C-band transponders).

===Arabsat-2===
By the end of 1994, the Arabsat system had been reduced to only one operational satellite.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A contract for two Arabsat second-generation satellites was signed with Aérospatiale in April 1993, to build several additional comsats based on the [[Spacebus#Spacebus 3000|Spacebus 3000A]] platform.

'''Arabsat-2A''', was launched on 9 July 1996.

'''Arabsat-2B''', was launched on 13 November 1996.

'''Arabsat-2C''' was leased from PAS-5 in May 2002 and moved from the Western Hemisphere during November 2002 to a position at 26° E.

'''Arabsat-2D''' was leased from Hotbird 5 and moved from the position 13° E during November 2002 to a position at 26° E.

===Arabsat-3===
On 7 November 1996, a contract was signed with Aérospatiale to provide the first of the third-generation satellites, to be based on a [[Spacebus#Spacebus 3000B2|Spacebus 3000B2]] platform.

BADR-3 (technically: Arabsat-3A) was launched as the first satellite of the third generation, on 26 February 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/arabsat-3a.htm Gunter's Space Page, ''BADR-3'']&lt;/ref&gt; Half of its transponders were switched off on 7 December 2001 after a solar-panel malfunction.

===Arabsat-4===
Arabsat let a contract on 22 October 2003 for the manufacture and launch of the fourth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's [[Eurostar (satellite bus)|Eurostar E2000+]] platform and [[Alcatel Space]] payload. The first of these, '''Arabsat-4A''', was lost in space due to a launcher failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/proton/arabsat4a/ Spaceflight Now &amp;#0124; Proton Launch Report &amp;#0124; Proton rocket fails in Arab satellite launch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=22 February 2007 |title=Mystery Over Australia |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=26 February 2007 |title=A Rocket Debris Cloud Drifts |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the ordering of '''BADR-6''' (technically: Arabsat-4AR) on 31 May 2006. The second fourth generation satellite, named [[BADR-4]] (technically: Arabsat-4B), was launched on 8 November 2006. BADR-6 was launched on 7 July 2008 on an [[Ariane 5]], to replace the lost Arabsat-4A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/releases/presrel08_07_07.html|title=Another successful Arianespace launch: ProtoStar I and BADR-6 are in orbit|publisher=Arianespace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabsat-5===
Arabsat let a contract on 16 June 2007 for the manufacture and launch of the fifth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's [[Eurostar E3000]] platform and [[Thales Alenia Space]] payloads:
* The first of the fifth-generation satellites, named BADR-5 (technically: Arabsat-5B), was launched by Proton at Arabsat's 26° East Direct-to-Home television "Hot Spot" on 3 June 2010.
* The second of the fifth-generation satellites, [[Arabsat-5A]], was launched by Ariane at the 30.5° East orbital location on 26 June 2010.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* The third of the fifth-generation satellites, Arabsat-5C, was launched to the new 20° East orbital location on 21 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/ariane/va204/status.html SpaceFlight.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabsat-6===
* Badr-7 ('''Arabsat-6B''') was launched successfully in tandem with GSat-15 on 10 November 2015 from the Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, atop an [[Ariane 5]] launcher.
* The launch of '''ArabSat 6A''' with a [[Falcon Heavy]] rocket is planned for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/29/arabsat-contracts-go-to-lockheed-martin-arianespace-and-spacex/|title=Arabsat contracts go to Lockheed Martin, Arianespace and SpaceX|date=April 29, 2015|work=Spaceflight Now|last1=Clark|first1=Stephen|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bag''' (also called '''''Corral''''' or '''''Cave''''') is a binary-determination [[logic puzzle]] published by [[Nikoli (publisher)|Nikoli]].

==Rules==

Bag is played on a rectangular grid, usually of dashed lines, in which numbers appear in some of the cells.

The object is to draw a single, continuous loop along the lines of the grid, which contains all the numbers on the grid.  Additionally, each number denotes the sum of all cells visible in any orthogonal direction before line of the loop is reached. For example, a 2 cell will have one cell adjacent to it, followed by a wall of the loop. In other words, if we treat the loop as a wall, each number denotes the number of cells can be seen from the cell with the number when looking orthogonally, the cell itself included.

==Solution methods==

The easiest starting place is to find a "maximum cell"; that is, a numbered cell which if the walls are not at the maximum distance possible, the number is not satisfied. For example, in a 10x10 grid which has not started to be solved, a 19-cell is a maximum cell, since if the four walls are not at the edges of the grid, the number of cells visible wouldn't be enough. After making some progress, "minimum cells" appear, where if the walls are not at the minimum distance possible, the number is not satisfied.

Many of the solution methods for Bag are very similar to those used for [[Kuromasu]], as the rules are also very similar. The most notable difference is the use of the loop as a part of the solution, as opposed to shaded cells.

==Computational Complexity==
Decision question (Friedman, 2002): Does a given instance of Corral Puzzle have a solution?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedman|first1=Erich|title=Corral Puzzles are NP-complete|url=http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/papers/corral/corral.html|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision question is NP-complete. This is proven by reducing the decision problem of [[Graph coloring#Computational complexity| deciding the 3-colorability of a planar graph]], which is known to be NP-complete, to a Corral Puzzle.

'''Blackface''' is a form of theatrical make-up used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a caricature of a [[black people|black person]]. It is and has been a racially insensitive representation of blackness by the African American community. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of [[racial stereotype]]s such as the "happy-go-lucky [[List of ethnic slurs#D|darky]] on the plantation" or the "[[dandy|dandified]] [[List of ethnic slurs#Coon|coon]]".&lt;ref&gt;For the "darky"/"coon" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, ''The American Diary of a Japanese Girl'', Temple University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1592135552}}. See also Lewis A. Erenberg (1984), ''Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890–1930'', University of Chicago Press, p. 73, {{ISBN|0226215156}}. For more on the "darky" stereotype, see J. Ronald Green (2000), ''Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux'', Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, {{ISBN|0253337534}}; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific "coon" archetype.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, blackface [[minstrel]] shows were an American national art of the time, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William John|last=Mahar|title=Behind the Burnt Cork Mask: Early Blackface Minstrelsy and Antebellum American Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orsJVN4dhLsC|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1999|page=9|isbn=978-0252066962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D5cVSVbOu2EC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage Frank W.

== History ==
Blackface was an important performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'', which ended in 1978,&lt;ref name="Black_and_white_minstrel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''{{'}}s Christmas specials [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1976]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Father Christmas Affair |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1|station= |airdate=1976-12-06 |season= |seriesno=4 |number=7 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1981]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Roots? |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1 |station= |airdate=1981-12-24 |season= |seriesno=8 |number=8 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.

Stereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, Eric. "Blackface and Blackness: The Minstrel Show in American Culture", in Annemarie Bean, James V. Hatch, and Brooks McNamara (eds), ''Inside the minstrel mask: readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In some quarters, the caricatures that were the legacy of blackface persist to the present day and are a cause of ongoing controversy. Another view is that "blackface is a form of [[cross-dressing]] in which one puts on the insignias of a sex, class, or race that stands in opposition to one's own."&lt;ref&gt;Rogin, Michael (University of California Press 1998) ''Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot'' (p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, changing attitudes about race and racism effectively ended the prominence of blackface makeup used in performance in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[Blackface in contemporary art]] remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or [[satire]].

There is no consensus about a single moment that constitutes the origin of blackface. [[John Strausbaugh]] places it as part of a tradition of "displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers" that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites routinely portrayed the black characters in the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] theater (see [[English Renaissance theatre]]), most famously in ''[[Othello]]'' (1604).&lt;ref name="Black_and_white_minstrel" /&gt; However, ''Othello'' and other plays of this era did not involve the emulation and caricature of "such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism", etc. that Strausbaugh sees as crucial to blackface.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], a white blackface actor of [[American Company]] fame, brought blackface in this more specific sense to prominence as a theatrical device in the United States when playing the role of "Mungo", an inebriated black man in ''[[The Padlock]]'', a British play that premiered in New York City at the [[John Street Theatre (Manhattan)|John Street Theatre]] on May 29, 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tosches |first= Nick |title= Where Dead Voices Gather |publisher= Back Bay |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0316895378 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play attracted notice, and other performers adopted the style. From at least the 1810s, blackface [[clown]]s were popular in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; British actor [[Charles Mathews]] toured the U.S. in 1822–23, and as a result added a "black" characterization to his repertoire of British regional types for his next show, ''A Trip to America'', which included Mathews singing "Possum up a Gum Tree", a popular slave freedom song.&lt;ref name=gotham&gt;[[Edwin G.

Rice]], who truly popularized blackface. Rice introduced the song "[[Jump Jim Crow]]" accompanied by a dance in his stage act in 1828&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored stardom with it by 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice traveled the U.S., performing under the [[stage name]] "Daddy Jim Crow". The name ''Jim Crow'' later became attached to [[Jim Crow law|statutes]] that codified the reinstitution of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L.

In the 1830s and early 1840s, blackface performances mixed skits with comic songs and vigorous dances. Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as ''[[entr'acte]]s'' in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the matronly [[mammy archetype|mammy]] mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=130–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured many other, mostly [[ethnicity|ethnically]]-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal [[Jew]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Jody Rosen (2006), album notes to ''Jewface'', Reboot Stereophonic CD RSR006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strausbaugh-131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; drunken brawling [[Ireland|Irishmen]] with [[wikt:blarney|blarney]] at the ready;&lt;ref name="Strausbaugh-131" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael C.

1830s and early 1840s blackface performers performed solo or as duos, with the occasional trio; the traveling troupes that would later characterize blackface minstrelsy arose only with the minstrel show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City in 1843, [[Dan Emmett]] and his [[Virginia Minstrels]] broke blackface minstrelsy loose from its novelty act and ''entr'acte'' status and performed the first full-blown minstrel show: an evening's entertainment composed entirely of blackface performance. ([[E. P. Christy]] did more or less the same, apparently independently, earlier the same year in [[Buffalo, New York]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=102–03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their loosely structured show with the musicians sitting in a semicircle, a [[tambourine]] player on one end and a [[bones (instrument)|bones]] player on the other, set the precedent for what would soon become the first act of a standard three-act minstrel show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1852, the skits that had been part of blackface performance for decades expanded to one-act farces, often used as the show's third act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs of [[Northern United States|northern]] composer [[Stephen Foster]] figured prominently in blackface minstrel shows of the period. Though written in dialect and certainly [[Political correctness|politically incorrect]] by today's standards, his later songs were free of the ridicule and blatantly racist caricatures that typified other songs of the genre. Foster's works treated [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and the [[Southern United States|South]] in general with an often cloying sentimentality that appealed to audiences of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Key, Susan. "Sound and Sentimentality: Nostalgia in the Songs of Stephen Foster." ''American Music'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (Summer 1995), pp. 145–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

White minstrel shows featured white performers pretending to be blacks, playing their versions of black music and speaking [[:wikt:ersatz|ersatz]] [[African-American English|black dialects]]. Minstrel shows dominated popular show business in the U.S. from that time through into the 1890s, also enjoying massive popularity in the UK and in other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the minstrel show went into decline, blackface returned to its novelty act roots and became part of vaudeville.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Blackface featured prominently in [[film]] at least into the 1930s, and the "aural blackface"&lt;ref name="Strausbaugh-225"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' radio show lasted into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Strausbaugh-225" /&gt; Meanwhile, amateur blackface minstrel shows continued to be common at least into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=145–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one such blackface popular in the 1950s was Ricardo Warley from [[Alston, Cumbria]] who toured around the North of England with a monkey called Bilbo.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, Harry. ''Minstrel Show Collection'', p. 149 (1959), UTA.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the genre played an important role in shaping perceptions of and prejudices about blacks generally and [[African American]]s in particular. Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for whites' fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', "The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening&amp;nbsp;– and male&amp;nbsp;– Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at least initially, blackface could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society. As early as 1832, a blacked-up [[Thomas D. Rice]] was singing, "An' I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey'll in de gutter lay." It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, "Aldough I'm a black man, de white is call'd my broder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashny|first=LeRoy|title=With Amusement for All|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=2006|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of film, black characters were routinely played by whites in blackface. In the first known [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (film adaptations)|film]] of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1903) all of the major black roles were whites in blackface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=203–04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1914 ''Uncle Tom'' starring African-American actor [[Sam Lucas]] in the title role had a white male in blackface as Topsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=204–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) used whites in blackface to represent all of its major black characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=211–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reaction against the film's racism largely put an end to this practice in dramatic film roles. Thereafter, whites in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or "ventriloquizing" blackness&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rogin, ''Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot'' (1998), University of California Press, p. 79, {{ISBN|0520213807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stands in contrast to made-up whites routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=214–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities regarding [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] began to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and [[bigotry]].&lt;ref name=Kenrick /&gt; Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' (1928–60) constituted a type of "aural blackface", in that the black characters were portrayed by whites and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225}}; the televised version (1951–53) used African-American actors.&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons. Strausbaugh estimates that roughly one-third of late 1940s [[MGM]] cartoons "included a blackface, coon, or mammy figure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bugs Bunny]] appeared in blackface at least as late as ''[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ballet ===

In 1910, the [[ballet]] ''[[Sheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Sheherazade]]'', choreographed by [[Michael Fokine]], premiered in Russia. The story behind the ballet was inspired by a tone poem written by [[Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his [[scimitar]]. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When ''Petrushka'' is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as ''[[La Bayadère]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Au, Susan. ''Ballet and Modern Dance'', 2nd ed.

=== Black minstrel shows ===

[[File:Bert Williams blackface 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bert Williams]] was the only black member of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] when he joined them in 1910. Shown here in blackface, he was the highest-paid African American entertainer of his day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By 1840, black performers also were performing in blackface makeup. [[Frederick Douglass]] generally abhorred blackface and was one of the first people to write against the institution of blackface minstrelsy, condemning it as racist in nature, with inauthentic, northern, white origins.&lt;ref&gt;Granville Ganter, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113646013.html "He made us laugh some": Frederick Douglass's humor], originally published in ''African American Review'', December 22, 2003. Online at HighBeam Encyclopedia. Accessed online 2 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass did, however, maintain: "It is something to be gained when the colored man in any form can appear before a white audience."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass, [http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/minstrel/miar03at.html Gavitt's Original Ethiopian Serenaders], originally published in ''The North Star'' (Rochester), 29 June 1849.

When all-black minstrel shows began to proliferate in the 1860s, they often were billed as "authentic" and "the real thing". These "colored minstrels"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; always claimed to be recently freed slaves (doubtlessly many were, but most were not)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=198, 236–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were widely seen as authentic. This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like "animals in a zoo"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivalled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels may have been the country's most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These "colored" troupes&amp;nbsp;– many using the name "Georgia Minstrels"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– focused on "plantation" material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=179, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the execution of authentic black music and the [[percussion instrument|percussive]], [[polyrhythm]]ic tradition of ''[[Juba dance|pattin' Juba]]'', when the only [[musical instrument|instruments]] performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was [[Sam Hague]]'s Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by [[Charles Hicks]]. This company eventually was taken over by [[Charles Callendar]]. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became [[J. H. Haverly|Haverly's Colored Minstrels]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;

From the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from "Negro subjects", black troupes took the opposite tack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] and other ''jubilee singers'' had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by blacks, especially [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word "jubilee", originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for "plantation" material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=236–37, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the jubilee singers tried to "clean up" Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, blacks could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s "colored" troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen "corked up", but the other performers "astonished" commentators by the diversity of their hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the [[African-American upper class|black bourgeoisie]]. [[James Monroe Trotter]] &amp;nbsp;– a middle-class African American who had contempt for their "disgusting caricaturing" but admired their "highly musical culture"&amp;nbsp;– wrote in 1882 that "few ... who condemned black minstrels for giving 'aid and comfort to the enemy'" had ever seen them perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=226–28}}, including the quotation from Trotter.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, and took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of [[Moms Mabley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=258–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most blacks were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, "corking (or blacking) up" provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of [[African-American music]], humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;ref name="Watkins 82" /&gt; It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior. It was also a forum for the sexual [[double entendre]] gags that were frowned upon by white moralists. There was often a subtle message behind the outrageous vaudeville routines:

{{quote|The laughter that cascaded out of the seats was directed parenthetically toward those in America who allowed themselves to imagine that such 'nigger' showtime was in any way respective of the way we live or thought about ourselves in the real world.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Ted |title=Showtime at the Apollo |location=Rhinebeck, NY |publisher=Mill Road Enterprises |year=2003 |isbn=978-0972370011 |id={{OCLC|680471611|54084944|9393699}} |origyear=1983|hdl=2027/uc1.32106017681500 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|5, 92–92, 1983 ed.}}}}

[[File:Hotmikado.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A poster for the 1939 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[The Hot Mikado (1939 production)|The Hot Mikado]]'' using blackface imagery]]In the [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (TOBA), an all-black vaudeville circuit organized in 1909, blackface acts were a popular staple. Called "Toby" for short, performers also nicknamed it "Tough on Black Actors" (or, variously, "Artists" or "Asses"), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like [[Tim Moore (comedian)|Tim Moore]] and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers&amp;nbsp;– black and white&amp;nbsp;– many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly's European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the "Grand Old Man of the [[Negro]] Stage".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1968). ''Black Manhattan'', p. 90. Quoted in {{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City's famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt "naked" without it.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;{{rp|4, 1983 ed.}}

The minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Blacks took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]] has written:

{{quote|It is essential to realize that ... the idea of white men imitating, or caricaturing, what they consider certain generic characteristics of the black man's life in America is important if only because of the Negro's reaction to it. (And it is the Negro's ''reaction'' to America, first white and then black and white America, that I consider to have made him such a unique member of this society.)&lt;ref name=leroy /&gt; }}

The black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The [[cakewalk]] is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:

{{quote|If the cakewalk is a Negro dance caricaturing certain white customs, what is that dance when, say, a white theater company attempts to satirize it as a Negro dance? I find the idea of white minstrels in blackface satirizing a dance satirizing themselves a remarkable kind of irony&amp;nbsp;– which, I suppose is the whole point of minstrel shows.&lt;ref name=leroy&gt;{{cite book

== Authentic or counterfeit ==
The degree to which blackface performance drew on authentic African-American culture and traditions is controversial. Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of African-American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems clear, however, that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.

{{quote|In the early years of the nineteenth century, white-to-black and black-to-white musical influences were widespread, a fact documented in numerous contemporary accounts.... [I]t becomes clear that the prevailing musical interaction and influences in the nineteenth century American produced a black populace conversant with the music of both traditions.&lt;ref name=powerblack&gt;{{Closed access}}

Early blackface minstrels often said that their material was largely or entirely authentic to African-American culture; John Strausbaugh, author of ''Black Like You'', said that such claims were likely to be untrue. Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constance Rourke]], one of the founders of what is now known as [[cultural studies]], largely assumed this as late as 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting no later than Robert Toll's ''Blacking Up'' (1974), a "third wave" has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on African-American culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}; {{Harvnb|Toll|1974}} ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when many African Americans became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer's instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.

Author Strausbaugh summed up as follows: "Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks," writes Strausbaugh. "The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot. It was a mix, a mutt – that is, it was American music."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== "Darky" iconography ==
The darky icon itself&amp;nbsp;– [[Googly eyes|googly-eyed]], with inky skin, exaggerated white, pink or red lips, and bright, white teeth&amp;nbsp;– became a common motif in entertainment, children's literature, mechanical banks, and other toys and games of all sorts, [[cartoons]] and [[comic strips]], advertisements, jewelry, textiles, postcards, sheet music, food [[brand]]ing and packaging, and other consumer goods.

In 1895, the [[Golliwog]] surfaced in Great Britain, the product of children's book illustrator [[Florence Kate Upton]], who modeled her rag doll character after a minstrel doll from her American childhood. "Golly", as he later affectionately came to be called, had a jet-black face, wild, woolly hair, bright, red lips, and sported formal minstrel attire. The generic British golliwog later made its way back across the Atlantic as dolls, toy tea sets, ladies' perfume, and in myriad of other forms. The word "golliwog" may have given rise to the [[ethnic slur]] "[[wog]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/golliwog/ "The Golliwog Caricature"], Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, Ferris State University.

U.S. cartoons from the 1930s and 1940s often featured characters in blackface gags as well as other racial and [[ethnic group|ethnic]] caricatures. Blackface was one of the influences in the development of characters such as [[Mickey Mouse#First gloved appearance|Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Sacks and Sacks 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Artists]] 1933 release "[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name a corruption of "[[melodrama]]" thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows&amp;nbsp;– was a film short based on a production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by the Disney characters. Mickey, of course, was already black, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers; and his now trademark white gloves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hakes.com/images.asp?ItemNo=63253&amp;ImageNo=001 "Mickey's Mellerdrammer.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120094351/http://www.hakes.com/images.asp?ItemNo=63253&amp;ImageNo=001 |date=2012-11-20 }}" Linen-mounted movie poster.

In the U.S., by the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] had begun calling attention to such portrayals of African Americans and mounted a campaign to put an end to blackface performances and depictions. For decades, darky images had been seen in the branding of everyday products and commodities such as ''[[Pickaninny|Picaninny]] Freeze'', the [[Coon Chicken Inn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywood.pdx.edu/html/coon_chicken_inn.html Coon Chicken Inn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127021655/http://hollywood.pdx.edu/html/coon_chicken_inn.html |date=2014-01-27 }} Photos and history of the restaurant chain.&lt;/ref&gt; [[restaurant chain]], and [[Nigger#Commercial products|Nigger Hair Tobacco]]. With the eventual successes of the modern day [[Civil Rights Movement]], such blatantly racist branding practices ended in the U.S., and blackface became an American [[taboo]].

=== Continued Use in Asia ===

However, blackface-inspired iconography continue in popular media in Asia.  In Japan, in the early 1960s, a toy called [[Dakkochan]] became hugely popular. ''Dakkochan'' was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being distinguished by a bow. The black skin of the dolls was said to have been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist [[Tensei Kawano]] went as far as to state, "We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. In a way we are like Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939182,00.html | work=Time | title=JAPAN: Dakkochan Delirium | date=1960-08-29 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese cartoons continue to prominently feature characters inspired by "darky" iconography, including well-known Mr. Popo in popular series [[Dragonball Z]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avykp8/what-black-anime-fans-can-teach-us-about-race-in-america-805|title=What Black Anime Fans Can Teach Us About Race in America|date=5 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Blackface in contemporary art}}

=== Background ===
Over time, blackface and "darky" iconography became artistic and stylistic devices associated with [[art deco]] and the [[Jazz Age]]. By the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Europe, where it was more widely tolerated, blackface became a kind of ''[[wikt:outré|outré]]'', [[camp (style)|camp]] convention in some artistic circles. ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'' was a popular British musical [[variety show]] that featured blackface performers, and remained on British television until 1978 and in stage shows until 1989. Many of the songs were from the [[music hall]], [[country and western]] and folk traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2223239.stm Minstrels founder Mitchell dies], BBC, 29 August 2002.

The influence of blackface on branding and advertising, as well as on perceptions and portrayals of blacks, generally, can be found worldwide.

=== High tech ===
Digital media provide opportunities to inhabit and perform black identity without actually painting one's face. In 1999, Adam Clayton Powell III coined the term "high-tech blackface" to refer to stereotypical portrayals of [[List of black video game characters|black characters in video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/21/technology/blood-gore-sex-and-now-race.html|title=Blood, Gore, Sex and Now: Race|last=Marriot|first=Michael|date=October 21, 1999|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 12, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Leonard writes that "The desire to 'be black' because of the stereotypical visions of strength, athleticism, power and sexual potency all play out within the virtual reality of sports games." Leonard's argument suggests that players perform a type of [[identity tourism]] by controlling black avatars in sports games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=David|title=High Tech Blackface – Race, Sports Video Games and Becoming the Other|journal=Intelligent Agent|volume=4|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips and Reed argue that this type of blackface "is not only about whites assuming black roles, nor about exaggerated performances of blackness for the benefit of a racist audience. Rather, it is about performing a version of blackness that constrains it within the boundaries legible to white supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Amanda|last2=Reed|first2=Alison|year=2013|title=Additive Race: Colorblind Discourses of Realism in Performance Capture Technologies|journal=Digital Creativity|volume=24|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papa Lazarou]] was a character in the  comedy-horror TV show ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' in the 1990s, and a subsequent movie. His exaggerated form of gypsy-styled blackface embodied the 'local' characters' fear of outsiders. It was revealed at the end of the series that this was his actual skin colour.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A sketch in a 2003 episode of ''[[Little Britain]]'' features two characters who appear in blackface as minstrels, as regularly seen on British television until the 1980s. The same characters return for one 2005 sketch. In the sketches, the racist overtones are subverted with the characters presented as belonging to a race genuinely possessing the appearance of white men in blackface (referred to as "Minstrels") who are persecuted by the public and local government.

In October 2009, a talent-search skit on Australian TV's ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' reunion show featured a tribute group for [[Michael Jackson]], the "Jackson Jive" in blackface, with the Michael Jackson character in [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]]. American performer [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] was one of the guest judges and objected to the act, stating that he believed it was offensive to black people, and gave the troupe a score of zero. The show and the group later apologised to Connick, with the troupe leader of Indian descent stating that the skit was not intended to be offensive or racist.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyne Yamine, Gareth Trickey and Chris Scott.

The "Mohrenbrauerei" in Dornbirn, Austria, uses a blackface type drawing in its logo.

=== Belgium and Netherlands ===
In ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', cartoonist [[Hergé]] uses a blackface type drawing style to depict the native Congolese. And in the Dutch comic ''[[Sjors &amp; Sjimmie]]'', started in 1902, Sjimmy was initially depicted in the same way, but was gradually turned into a normal, but black, Dutch boy and in 1969, when [[Jan Kruis]] took over the comic, his transformation to a normal black boy was complete.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, people annually celebrate [[Sinterklaas|St. Nicolas Eve]] with [[Sinterklaas]] accompanied by multiple [[Zwarte Piet]]en in the form of adolescent boys and girls, and men and women, with their face painted black, or different colors or styles in some large city parades nowadays,  wearing Moorish [[Page (occupation)|page boy]] costumes. The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back to the middle of the 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children's book author, added a black servant to the Sinterklaas story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De oudst bekende naam van Zwarte Piet: Pieter-mê-knecht (1850) |year=1850 |url=http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/nl/nieuwsbriefteksten/nieuwsbriefuitgelicht/143677-de-oudst-bekende-naam-van-zwarte-piet-pieter-me-knecht-1850 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030062242/http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/nl/nieuwsbriefteksten/nieuwsbriefuitgelicht/143677-de-oudst-bekende-naam-van-zwarte-piet-pieter-me-knecht-1850 |archivedate=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with black faces appeared in Winter Solstice rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bas|2013|pages=32, 34, 42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of companions of Saint Nicholas, who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Niklaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland.

Up until the early 2000s, white comedians sometimes used makeup to represent a black person, most often as a parody of an actual person. Many of these segments have been aired during the annual New Year's Eve TV special "[[Bye Bye (TV series)|Bye Bye]]." For instance, the 1986 edition&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEPxh7HzsOY "Bye Bye '86"] (at 5:00, 19:33 and 56:03). YouTube. December 31, 2016.

* a multi-ethnic version of the series "Le temps d'une paix" ([[:fr:Le Temps d'une paix|fr]]), in which comedienne [[Michèle Deslauriers]] played the character Mémère Bouchard as if she hailed from Africa;
* a reference to a joint concert by Quebec rocker [[Marjo]] and U.S. diva [[Eartha Kitt]], in which Deslauriers and comic [[Dominique Michel]] alluded to Kitt spilling wine on Marjo during the show's press conference;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JriHQV_mMmg Marjo humiliée par Ertha (sic) Kitt]."

* a mock [[American Express]] commercial spoofing president [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy, in which Deslauriers, Michel and actor [[Michel Côté (actor)|Michel Côté]] played Middle-Eastern arms buyers.

The Montreal-based satiric group [[Rock et Belles Oreilles]] did its own blackface sketches, for instance when comedian [[Yves Pelletier]] disguised himself as comedian and show host [[Gregory Charles]], making fun of his energetic personality (not of his racial background) on his television game show "Que le meilleur gagne".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv3a-5JyCqs&amp;t=13s "Que le moins pire gagne"].

In Europe, there are a number of folk dances or folk performances in which the black face appears to represent the night, or the coming of the longer nights associated with winter.

The Tiernapojat show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as king Herod vanquishing the "king of the Moors", whose face in the play has traditionally been painted black. The character's color of skin is also a theme in the procession's lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulbrighterinfinland.blogspot.co.uk/2006_12_19_archive.html|title=Star Boys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, blackface was used in several theatrical productions.

Examples of theatrical productions include the many productions of the play "Unschuld" (Innocence) by the German writer [[Dea Loher]], although in this play about two black African immigrants, the use of black-face is not part of the stage directions or instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jenkenordalm.de/index.php?id=10 |title=Unschuld [Innocence] |language=German |work=Jenke Nordalm|accessdate=October 25, 2012}} Webpage of the director of the production at the Theater Freiburg with pictures&lt;/ref&gt;

The critics were invited to a discussion with the director, actors, theatre manager and other artists of the Deutsches Theater. As a result of the discussion, Deutsches Theater changed the design of actor make-up. Ulrich Khuon, the theatre manager, later admitted to being surprised by the protest and is now in a process of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/de/6593686,CmC=6588478.html |title=Aktuell: Das Deutsche Theater sieht weiß und/oder Schwarz? &amp;#124; Theaterensemble 'Label Noir' &amp;#124; Metropolis, Samstag ab 16.45 Uhr &amp;#124; Kultur entdecken  |work=arte.tv |year=2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202195810/http://www.arte.tv/de/6593686%2CCmC%3D6588478.html |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

German productions of [[Herb Gardner]]'s ''[[I'm Not Rappaport]]'' almost always cast the role of Midge Carter, the black character, famously portrayed in the U.S. by [[Ossie Davis]], with a white actor in black makeup. The 2012 production of the play at the Berlin Schlosspark-Theater was the subject of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16492222 |title=Germany's Schlosspark Theatre defends 'blackface' actor |work=bbc.co.uk |date=January 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/10/german-play-im-not-a-rapp_n_1197160.html |title=German Play, 'I'm Not Rappaport', Angers Critics With Blackface Actor |work=huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |first=Danielle |last=Cadet |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director, Thomas Schendel, in his response to critics, argued that the classical and common plays would not offer enough roles that would justify a repertoire position for a black actor in a German theatre company. The protest grew considerably and was followed by media reports. While advocates of the theatre indicated that in principle it should be possible for any actor to play any character and that the play itself has an anti-racist message, the critics noted that the letter unwillingly disclosed the general, unexpressed policy of German theatres, i.e., that white actors are accounted to be qualified for all roles, even black ones, while black actors are suitable only for black roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.vice.com/read/blackface-is-the-new-black |title=Blackface Is the New Black|first=Stefan |last=Lauer |work=vice.com  |accessdate=October 25, 2012|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors said that this problem in Germany generally exists for citizens with an immigrant background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6740:die-blackfacing-debatte-iii-man-muss-kein-neonazi-sein-um-rassistisch-zu-handeln&amp;catid=101:debatte&amp;Itemid=84 |title=Die Blackfacing-Debatte III – Man muss kein Neonazi sein, um rassistisch zu handeln |first=Lara-Sophie |last=Milagro |date=March 28, 2012 |work=nachtkritik.de |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103072524/http://www.nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6740%3Adie-blackfacing-debatte-iii-man-muss-kein-neonazi-sein-um-rassistisch-zu-handeln&amp;catid=101%3Adebatte&amp;Itemid=84 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5600:kommentar--migranten-spielen-auf-den-sprechbuehnen-keine-rolle&amp;catid=101:debatte&amp;Itemid=84 |title=Kommentar – Migranten spielen auf den Sprechbühnen keine Rolle |first=Özgür |last=Uludag |work=nachtkritik.de |date=May 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103080415/http://nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5600%3Akommentar--migranten-spielen-auf-den-sprechbuehnen-keine-rolle&amp;catid=101%3Adebatte&amp;Itemid=84 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate also received foreign media attention. The Schlosspark-Theater announced plans to continue the performances, and the German publishing company of ''Rappaport'' stated it will continue to grant permits for such performances.

=== Mexico ===

In modern-day Mexico there are examples of images (usually caricatures) in blackface (e.g., [[Memín Pinguín]]). Though there is backlash from international communities, Mexican society has not protested to have these images changed to racially sensitive images. On the contrary, in the controversial Memín Pinguín cartoon there has been support publicly and politically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hace EU el 'ridículo' al criticar a Memín Pinguín: Derbez (It was ridiculous for the EU to criticize Memín Pinguín) |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/457430.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003150100/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/457430.html |archivedate=2012-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (chancellor for Mexico, [[Luis Ernesto Derbez]]). Currently in Mexico, only 3–4% of the population are composed of [[Afro-Mexican]]s (this percentage includes [[Asian Mexican]]s).

A notorious example of blackface in Mexican media is a comedic episode based around the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] titled ''La guerra de secesión de los Estados Unidos'' (The U.S. Secession War) in which famous comedian [[Chespirito]] did a skit in blackface.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|-6qVH9q-4dQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panama ===
Portobelo's Carnival and Congo dance in Panama include a use of blackface as a form of celebration of African history, an emancipatory symbol. Black men paint their faces with charcoal representing three things. Firstly, the blackface is used as a tool to remember their African ancestors.  Secondly, the black face is representative of the disguise or concealment on the run slaves would have used to evade the Spanish colonizers. Lastly, the practice of blackface is used as a way to signify the code or "secret language" slaves would have used during the time of Spanish occupation. During the celebration, for example, good morning will mean good night, and wearing black, or in this case blackface, which normally denotes a time of mourning, is used as a way to represent a time of celebration instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elizabeth|first=Rhodes,|date=2004-01-01|title=Black Indians, Zulus and Congos; Transformation and Transference of Community Traditions in New Orleans and Panama|journal=Textual Resources|url=http://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/folklorico_textual/2/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal and Brazil ===
In Portugal, there is not a long history of use of actors in blackface for "serious" performances meant for realistic black character, but the use of blackface for comedy keeps being used frequently well into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bD_SFizfxI Revolta dos Pasteis de Nata &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – Ze Black &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; The talk-show [[5 Para A Meia-Noite|5 Para a Meia-Noite]], examples of which some episodes were hosted by Luís Filipe Borges&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzGs1BU_KzQ Boy N'Ass &amp; Dr. Pussy (parte 2) – Luís Filipe Borges – 5 Para a Meia Noite], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; and Pedro Fernandes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daOirPvm1e8 "Black N'Deck" episódio 6 – Pedro Fernandes – 5 Para a Meia Noite], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; who have both done it, used it almost on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IquSY27lGOg "Snoop Dogg" fala português – Pedro Fernandes – 5 Para a Meia Noite], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Eduardo Madeira dressed up as Serena Williams,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynqoru4WAC4 Serena Williams no 5 | 5 Para a Meia-Noite | RTP], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; adding an African accent the tennis player does not have in real life.

In Brazil, there has been at least some history of non-comedic use of blackface, using white actors for black characters like [[Uncle Tom's Cabin|Uncle Tom]] (although the practice of "racelift", or making black/mulatto characters into [[mestizo|mestiços]]/swarthy whites/[[caboclos]], is more frequent than blackface).&lt;ref&gt;[https://virtualia.blogs.sapo.pt/29596.html Os Negros Nas Novelas], blog ''Virtualia'', 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lostinjapan.portalnippon.com/2012/06/cor-de-gabriela-lost-in-japan.html A Cor de Gabriela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126103416/http://lostinjapan.portalnippon.com/2012/06/cor-de-gabriela-lost-in-japan.html |date=2013-01-26 }}, ''Lost in Japan'', 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://f5.folha.uol.com.br/televisao/988689-caixa-refaz-propaganda-e-mostra-machado-de-assis-mulato.shtml Caixa refaz propaganda e mostra Machado de Assis mulato], F5, ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 10 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of blackface in humor has been used more rarely than in Portugal, although it also continues into this century (but it creates major uproar among the sizeable and more politically active [[Afro-Brazilian]] community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pragmatismopolitico.com.br/2012/08/racismo-explicito-no-zorra-total-relembra-humor-segregacionista-dos-eua.html "Racismo explícito no Zorra Total relembra humor segregacionista dos EUA"], ''Pragmatismo Político'', 15 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===

Inspired by blackface minstrels who visited [[Cape Town]], South Africa, in 1848, former [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Ethnic Malay|Malay]] [[coolie]]s took up the minstrel tradition, holding emancipation celebrations which consisted of music, dancing and parades. Such celebrations eventually became consolidated into an annual, year-end event called the "Coon Carnival" but now known as the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival or the [[Kaapse Klopse]].

Today, carnival minstrels are mostly [[Coloured]] ("mixed race"), [[Afrikaans]]-speaking revelers. Often in a pared-down style of blackface which exaggerates only the lips. They parade down the streets of the city in colorful costumes, in a celebration of [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Participants also pay homage to the carnival's African-American roots, playing [[Negro spirituals]] and [[jazz]] featuring traditional [[Dixieland]] jazz instruments, including [[Brass instrument|horns]], [[banjo]]s, and tambourines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africapetours.com/Coon+Carnival.htm |title=Coon Carnival Cape Town |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027061922/http://www.africapetours.com/Coon%20Carnival.htm |archivedate=2005-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African actor and filmmaker [[Leon Schuster]] is well known for employing the blackface technique in his filming to little or no controversy. But in 2013, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (South Africa)|Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa]] halted the airing of an ad wherein Schuster portrayed a stereotypically dishonest African politician in blackface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/offensive-blackface-south-african-commercial-banned|title="Offensive" Blackface South African Commercial Banned|work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action was in response to the following submitted complaint:

{{quote|... the commercial is offensive as it portrays a stereotype that black politicians are liars. This technique is known as blackface, and is an inherently racist form of acting. The black character is depicted with derogatory intention, speaks with a thick accent, and recalls a stereotypical black dictator. To achieve the desired result of showing a corrupt official, there was no need for the man to be made out to be black.}}

[[Vodacom]] South Africa has also been accused of using non-African actors in blackface in its advertising as opposed to simply using African actors. Some have denounced blackface as an artefact of apartheid, accusing broadcasters of lampooning Black people. Others continue to see it as "harmless fun".&lt;ref name="Brundage2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Fitzhugh Brundage|title=Beyond Blackface: African Americans and the Creation of American Popular Culture, 1890–1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3P4LTFaAYQC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807834626|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, photos of two white [[University of Pretoria]] female students donning blackface makeup in an attempt at caricaturing Black [[domestic workers]] surfaced on [[Facebook]].

==== Poachers and rioters ====
From 1723–1823, it was a criminal offence to blacken one's face in some circumstances, with a punishment of death. The [[Black Act]] was passed at a time of economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions, and in response to a series of raids by two groups of [[poaching|poachers]] who blackened their faces to prevent identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Pat|year=1974|title=The Waltham blacks and the Black Act|journal=[[The Historical Journal]]|volume=17|issue=3|issn=0018-246X|ref=CITEREFRogers1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackening one's face with soot, lampblack, boot polish or coal dust being a traditional form of disguise, or masking, in the UK, especially at night when poaching.  It was also undertaken by smugglers off the South Coast of England, which is why many of the marchers representing smugglers in Lewes and other Sussex bonfire societies wear blackface.

The Welsh [[Rebecca Riots|Rebecca Rioters]] (1839–1843) used to blacken their faces and/or wear masks to prevent themselves being identified whilst breaking down turnpike gates, sometimes dressed as women.

==== Folk culture ====
South Western English traditional [[folk play]]s sometimes have a Turk Slaver character, probably from the [[Barbary pirates|Barbary Coast Slave raids]] on Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset in the early 17th Century by "[[Salé Rovers|Sallee Rovers]]" (where the English were the slaves captured and taken by force to North Africa). This character is usually played using a black face (or brownface).

Various forms of [[folk dance]] in England, including [[Morris dancing]], have traditionally used blackface; its continuing use by some troupes is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = Theresa Jill | year = 1990 | title = Black Faces, Garlands, and Coconuts: Exotic Dances on Street and Stage | journal = Dance Research Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–12 | jstor = 1477779 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RFP&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/incoming/straw-defends-nutters-twitter-picture-7026569 |title=Straw defends 'Nutters in Twitter picture row |newspaper=Rossendale Free Press |date=24 April 2014 |author=Beth Abbit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427163545/http://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/incoming/straw-defends-nutters-twitter-picture-7026569 |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T14&gt;{{citation |title=Meeting the dance troop who say 'blacking-up' is a badge of pride |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/10789789/Meeting-the-dance-troop-who-say-blacking-up-is-a-badge-of-pride.html |author=William Langley |newspaper=Sunday Telegraph |date=27 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molly dance|Molly Dancers]] and [[Guise dancing|Cornish Guise Dancers]], both of whom are usually traditionally associated with midwinter festivals, often use blacked faces as a disguise. As the Molly dancers wished to avoid being identified by the landlords and petty nobles, who were also usually the local Magistrates, when they played tricks on those who failed to be generous enough in their gifts to the dancers. And the Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.

In [[Bacup]], [[Lancashire]], the [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers]], wear black faces. Some{{Who|date=December 2013}} believe the origin of this dance can be traced back to the influx of Cornish miners to northern England, and the black face relates to the dirty blackened faces associated with mining.

In [[Cornwall]], several [[Mummer's Day]] celebrations are still held; these used to be sometimes known as "Darkie Day" (a corruption of the original "Darking Day", referring to the darkening or painting of the faces) and involved local residents dancing through the streets in blackface to musical accompaniment. Although the origins of blacking-up for Mummer's Day have no racial connotations&amp;nbsp;– the tradition is pagan in origin and goes back to the days of the Celts&amp;nbsp;– controversially, in the [[Padstow]] festival, minstrel songs, such as one song with the words "He's gone where the good niggers go", were formerly included due to the popularity of minstrel songs during the early 20th century, perhaps due to people not being aware of the pagan origins of the face painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdk4v11U4tQ |title=Darkie Day |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Chimney sweep#Good luck omen|wedding day chimney sweep]], that is considered to be good luck, sometimes has a partially blacked up face to suggest smears of soot. This depends on the performer but it was, and still is, unusual to have a full blackening.

These two traditions, of chimney sweep and folk dancing, coincide in the sometimes lost traditions of (chimney)sweepers festivals. [[Medway Council]] supports the Sweeps' Festival, revived in 1981, now claimed to be "the largest festival of Morris dance in the world". It takes place in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] around [[May Day]] and features a [[Jack in the Green]] character.

The wearing of blackface was once a regular part of the annual [[Mummers Parade]] in [[Philadelphia]].

[[Joni Mitchell]] has donned blackface numerous times throughout her career, even marketing her 1977 album using her alter ego "Art Nouveau" on her album cover ''[[Don Juan's Reckless Daughter]]''.

Mitchell has remained unapologetic about her alter 'persona,' citing that she "does not have the soul of a white woman ... I write like a black poet. I frequently write from a black perspective" in an interview with [[LA Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=165|title=Joni Mitchell Library – Thirty Years With a Portable Lover: LA Weekly, November 25, 1994|website=www.jonimitchell.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her denial of any fault has not gone without criticism, as [[Sheila Weller]] writes in her book ''[[Girls Like Us]]'' "Joni romanticized being black, without the disadvantages.

''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' is a 1986 American film featuring [[C. Thomas Howell]] as Mark Watson a pampered rich college graduate who uses 'tanning pills' in order to qualify for a Graduate school scholarship to Harvard Law only available to African American students. He expects to be treated as a fellow student and instead learns the isolation of 'being black' on campus. Mark Watson later befriends and falls in love with the original candidate of the scholarship, a single mother who works as a waitress to support her education. The character later 'comes out' as white, leading to the famous defending line "Can you blame him for the color of his skin?"
The film was met with vast criticism of a white man donning black face to humanize white ignorance at the expense of African American viewers. Despite a large box office intake, has scored low on every film critic platform.
"A white man donning blackface is taboo," said [[C Thomas Howell]] "Conversation over&amp;nbsp;– you can't win.

''[[Trading Places]]'' is a 1983 American film, telling the elaborate story of a commodities banker and street hustler crossing paths after being made part of a bet. The film features a scene between [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Denholm Elliott]], and [[Dan Aykroyd]] when they must don disguises to enter a train. For no reason relevant to the plot [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s character puts on full black face make up, a dread locked wig and a Jamaican accent to fill the position of a Jamaican pot head.

The film has received very little criticism for its use of racial and [[Ethnic stereotype]], [[Rotten Tomatoes]] even citing it as "featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, Trading Places is an immensely appealing social satire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trading_places/|title=Trading Places|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackface performances are not unusual within the Latino community of Miami. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A case in point is the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Brownface of Latinidad in Cuban Miami |first1=Ariana |last1=Hernandez-Reguant |first2=Jossianna |last2=Arroyo |publisher=Cuba Counterpoints |date=2015-07-13 |url=http://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/1600 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet writers and illustrators, while substantially ahead of their mainstream European and North American counterparts in condemning racism and colonialism and promoting the ideas of internationalism, sometimes inadvertently perpetuated stereotypes about other nations that are now viewed as harmful. For example, a Soviet children's book or cartoon might innocently contain a representation of black people that would be perceived as unquestionably offensive by the modern-day western standards, such as bright red lips and other exaggerated features, unintentionally similar to the portrayal of blacks in American minstrel shows. Soviet artists "did not quite understand the harm of representing black people in this way, and continued to employ this method, even in creative productions aimed specifically at critiquing American race relations".&lt;ref name="redrussia"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Wilson|date=31 August 2017|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-08-31/how-red-russia-broke-new-ground-portrayal-black-americans|title=How red Russia broke new ground in the portrayal of black Americans|publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Soviet political cartoon ''[[Black and White (1932 film)|Black and White]]'', created in 1932, managed to avoid the blackface style, confronting "precisely that paternalistic model of the ever-passive black subject awaiting enlightenment from the Comintern".&lt;ref name="blackandwhite"&gt;{{cite web|first=Christina|last=Kiaer|date=31 October 2017|url=https://www.aaihs.org/anti-racism-in-early-soviet-visual-culture/|title=Anti-racism in Early Soviet Visual Culture|publisher=Black Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon integrated "an avant-garde-influenced visual aesthetic with images derived from the many newspaper illustrations, cartoons, and posters of American racism that appeared in Soviet Russia at this time".&lt;ref name="blackandwhite"/&gt;

Soviet theater and movie directors rarely had access to black actors, and so resorted to using black makeup when dictated by the character's descent. Soviet actors portrayed black people mostly by darkening the skin and occasionally adjusting the hair style, without accentuating or exaggerating their facial features. In particular, [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] performed the role of [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]], an 18th century Russian general of African origin, in the 1976 Soviet film ''[[How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor]]'', while [[Larisa Dolina]] performed the role of Cuban singer Clementine Fernandez in the 1983 film ''[[We Are from Jazz]]''. The [[Othello (1956 film)|1956 Soviet film adaptation]] of [[Othello]] received the Best Director Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.

Blackface minstrelsy was the conduit through which African-American and African-American-influenced music, comedy, and dance first reached the white American mainstream.&lt;ref name="Watkins 82" /&gt; It played a seminal role in the introduction of African-American culture to world audiences.

{{quote|Though antebellum (minstrel) troupes were white, the form developed in a form of racial collaboration, illustrating the axiom that defined – and continues to define – American music as it developed over the next century and a half: African-American innovations metamorphose into American popular culture when white performers learn to mimic black ones.|[[Gary Giddins]], jazz historian&lt;ref&gt;Gary Giddings, ''[[Bing Crosby]]: A Pocketful of Dreams, The Early Years 1903–1940'' (2001), Back Bay Books, p. 78. {{ISBN|0316886459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many of country's earliest stars, such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]
and [[Bob Wills]], were veterans of blackface performance.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan Porterfield, ''Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler'' (1979), University of Indiana Press, p. 262, {{ISBN|0252007506}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Townsend, ''San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills'' (1986), University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|025201362X}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Tosches, ''Where Dead Voices Gather'' (2002), Back Bay, p. 66, {{ISBN|0316895377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the American country music television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' (1969–1993) had the format and much of the content of a minstrel show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immense popularity and profitability of blackface were testaments to the power, appeal, and commercial viability of not only black music and dance, but also of black style. This led to cross-cultural collaborations, as Giddins writes; but the often ruthless exploitation of African-American artistic genius, as well&amp;nbsp;– by other, white performers and composers; agents; promoters; publishers; and record company executives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, William.

While blackface in the literal sense has played only a minor role in entertainment in recent decades, various writers see it as epitomizing an appropriation and imitation of black culture that continues today. As noted above, Strausbaugh sees blackface as central to a longer tradition of "displaying Blackness".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; "To this day," he writes, "Whites admire, envy and seek to emulate such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism, the composure known as 'cool' and superior sexual endowment," a phenomemon he views as part of the history of blackface.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; For more than a century, when white performers have wanted to appear sexy, (like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]&lt;ref&gt;Kolawole, Helen.[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/15/elvis25yearson.elvispresley "He Wasn't My King.]" ''The Guardian Unlimited'', August 15, 2002.

[[Image:Green Bumble Ball.jpg|thumb|A green Bumble Ball on carpet]]
The '''Bumble Ball''' is a motorized children's toy made by [[Ertl Company|Ertl toys]].  They were popular in the early 1990s and come in varied colors, including a see-through light-up one and a mini version. Some are available in [[keychain|key clip]] form under the name Bumble Ball Jr. Variations were produced by Ertl such as the Bumble Ball Bolter, a colorful insect-like toy with several long legs, a head with synthetic blue hair, and a Bumble Ball torso.

The toy is powered by a motor box with batteries mounted eccentrically. Its power switch consists of a knob that starts the motor when pushed in and stops the motor when pulled out. This causes it to vibrate and bounce about, some play music such as the wipe out song, appealing for both infants and elder toy enthusiasts. The core of the Bumble Ball is hard plastic while the knobs are a more rubbery texture.

[[Silver (color)|Silver]] Bumble Balls were seen in [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] 1995 [[music video]] for his hit single, [[Scream/Childhood|"Scream."]]  Despite fan requests, this special ball was never made available to the public.

Since their early popularity in the 1990s, the Bumble Ball concept has been used by [[Fisher-Price]]. This has led to products more directly aimed toward [[toddler]]s such as a [[Mr. Potato Head]]-like toy and animal variations. These small versions use a pull-string to activate the vibration rather than a switch as featured on larger models.

In 2006 on ''[[Animal Planet]]'', footage of a dog (possibly an [[Irish Setter]]) with a Bumble Ball in its mouth has become a running gag where the host [[Keegan-Michael Key]] or the announcer would call it a "Jowl Jiggler."

'''Cabrito Rock''' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] rock festival, usually lasting about two days. Inspired by the [[Cosquin Rock]] festival, it takes place in [[Recreo]], [[Argentina]], the only festival of its kind in the [[Catamarca Province]].

==History==
The festival was first held on January 6, 2007 at "Club Union Sportiva" with an audience of over 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://cabritorock2007.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The second festival was held in 2008 at "Club Atlético Pedro Cano", opening to a larger crowd than the first year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11535">'''Deletion''' is a [[music industry]] term referring to the removal of a record or records from a [[record label|label]]'s official catalog, so that it is [[out of print]], but usually at a  record artist's request.&lt;ref name="Druckenbrod"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07154/790577-388.stm
|title=PSO discs see light of day again
|author=Andrew Druckenbrod
|date=June 3, 2007
|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]
|quote=The recording industry employs the harsh term "deleted" to describe CDs no longer being pressed. If demand for a certain title falls beneath a profitable standard, the label typically removes it from its catalog. The disc becomes unavailable except through second-hand sources.
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Deletion can be for a variety of reasons, but usually reflects a decline in sales so that distributing the record is no longer profitable.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/netmusic/story/0,,1689776,00.html
|title=Long-lost tunes dug up for jukebox of the net
|author=Owen Gibson
|date=January 19, 2006
|publisher=The Guardian
|quote=Records are normally deleted once they cease to sell in sufficient numbers to justify shelf space in stores. It is also not economical for firms to produce low-selling records. No such constraints exist on the net, and both record companies and Hollywood have recognised the advantages of digital content's "long tail" - they can market a huge back catalogue even if they sell only in small quantities.
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Single (music)|Singles]] are routinely deleted after a period of weeks, but an album by a major artist may remain in the catalog indefinitely.

When titles are deleted in the US, the remaining stock would be defaced with a [[cut-out (recording industry)|cut-out]] through the sleeve or case. Cut-out records formed a [[grey market]] outside the major distribution channels. In the 1993 book ''Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia'' Bill Knoedelseder wrote of how [[MCA Records]] became the subject of a federal investigation of its cut-out sales practices after a deal allegedly involving [[organized crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title='Stiffed' delves into controversial MCA cutout deal
|author=Bruce Haring
|date=January 21, 1993
|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]
|quote=Knoedelseder, a former Los Angeles Times reporter, spent the middle '80s tracking a story that bound up MCA in a media feeding frenzy concerning its ties to reputed organized crime figure Sal Pisello. He was the broker on a soured deal involving cut-outs (records deleted from regular industry catalogs, often noted with a corner of the jacket cut out) that soon expanded to include a government investigation of independent radio promotion and eventually reached into the highest corridors of power in both the entertainment industry and Washington, D.C. "Stiffed" tracks a load of cut-outs from MCA's warehouse to Pennsylvania dealer John LaMonte, who winds up in a complicated deal involving the late Roulette Records president [[Morris Levy]] and a host of reputed organized crime figures including Gaetano "Corky" Vastola, Frederico "Fritzy" Giovanelli and Pisello.
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Deletion in the music industry differs from print publishing in that [[recording contract]]s generally do not return the rights to the artist when a title ceases to be manufactured. When [[PolyGram]] took over [[JMT Records]], a small [[jazz]] label, in 1995, it was understood to have announced that the entire JMT catalogue would be deleted, shocking dozens of artists. According to [[Tim Berne]], "this means that the majority of my work simply vanishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;Jazz Label Finds That Innovation Isn't Enough
|author=Peter Watrous
|date=December 30, 1995
|publisher=The New York Times
|quote=Mr. Winter said -- and this is disputed by Chris Roberts, the president of Polygram's classical and jazz departments -- that the company planned to delete the label's back catalogue, taking the artists' work out of circulation. And record companies rarely return music rights to the creators. "It's like being erased," said Mr. Berne. "It's different in book publishing, where it's common to get the rights back. In music you don't have leverage, and this means that the majority of my work simply vanishes."
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Louis Barfe]], "many deleted gems are locked in archives, unheard and quite possibly deteriorating." Although he recommends that they digitize this music and offer it for download, he notes that "niche labels have sprung up specialising in reissuing out-of-copyright recordings".&lt;ref name="Barfe"&gt;{{cite news

|quote=... certain staples have been in print from the day they were released, but many deleted gems are locked in archives, unheard and quite possibly deteriorating, while original vinyl copies change hands for obscene money. Their entire archives could and should be digitised and sold as downloads. Unfortunately, that's unlikely as it involves vision and effort. In the meantime, niche labels have sprung up specialising in reissuing out-of-copyright recordings, providing the majors with healthy competition.
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[bootleg recording|bootlegs]] have been issued just so fans can obtain deleted recordings without having to search the second hand market for them.&lt;ref name="heylin"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saWBw9ZG2cgC&amp;pg=PA76 |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |title=Bootleg: The Rise &amp; Fall of the Secret Recording History|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2004|page=76|isbn=9781844491513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital media==
More recently, the rise of digital media has eliminated much of the cost of music distribution, and companies have begun to see deleted records for their [[The Long Tail|long tail]] potential, selling via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and other online means.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt; A single company, [[ArkivMusic]], has struck deals with all four major publishers (and numerous minor ones) of [[classical music]] recordings to make their deleted records available via a burn-on-demand service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]
|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
A prominent exception to the practice was the label [[Folkways Records]], whose founder [[Moe Asch]] "never deleted a single title from the ... catalogue". According to Asch, "Just because the letter J is less popular than the letter S, you don't take it out of the dictionary." When the label was disbanded, Asch enlisted the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to maintain the catalogue "in perpetuity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianglobalsound.org/archives_15.aspx |title=A Sound Legacy: 20 Years of Folkways Records at the Smithsonian |publisher=[[The Smithsonian Institution]] |quote=By the early 1980s, Asch began to consider Folkways' future and legacy. He wanted to find an enterprise that would continue to maintain the catalogue as he had, making every Folkways record available in perpetuity. Asch never deleted a single title from the Folkways catalogue. As he said, "Just because the letter J is less popular than the letter S, you don't take it out of the dictionary." He wanted the new director to continue to produce recordings regardless of sales. He also expected this entity to appreciate and make use of the volumes of unexplored master tapes that he had yet to turn into recordings. |accessdate=2007-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702210013/http://www.smithsonianglobalsound.org/archives_15.aspx |archivedate=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
''[[Scott 4]]'' was released late in 1969, the same year as ''[[Scott 3]]''. It was credited as being by [[Noel Scott Engel]]. It failed to chart and as a result, the album was deleted soon after release. 
  
In July 1972, the British music paper, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', reported that a cutprice LP issued by [[Virgin Records]] was facing deletion because, ironically, it was too popular. [[Faust (band)|Faust]]'s ''[[The Faust Tapes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faust-pages.com/records/tapes.html |title=Faust Record : The Faust Tapes |website=Faust-pages.com |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; then at number 18 in ''Melody Maker''{{'}}s chart, actually cost more to produce than its selling price (49p) and so Virgin lost supposedly £2,000 on sales of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faust-pages.com/publications/theraver.melodymaker.html |title=Faust Publication : Deleted: LP that was TOO Popular : The Raver |website=Faust-pages.com |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has since been argued that this move was merely a publicity stunt by Virgin's owner, [[Richard Branson]].

In 1990, [[Arista Records]] deleted [[Milli Vanilli]]'s album ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'' very quickly after [[Frank Farian]] admitted that [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]] did not sing on the record.

The British duo [[The KLF]] summarily deleted their entire back catalogue when they 'retired' from the music industry in 1992.

[[Manic Street Preachers]]' 2000 single "[[The Masses Against The Classes]]" was deleted on day of release as a promotional gimmick. This allowed it to reach Number 1 in the charts and remained in the charts for 7 weeks. However, copies of the single continued to be available until supplies ran out, making second hand copies plentiful.

The 2006 [[Gnarls Barkley]] single "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" was deleted by [[Warner Music]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollock |first=Adam |url=http://www.sfstation.com/gnarls-barkley-a2045 |title=Gnarls Barkley |publisher=SF Station |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; after six weeks at #1 in the UK as a deliberate move to protect it from overexposure. Deleted singles could not then remain on the UK Singles Chart, so the physical single no longer charted after two weeks. However, it remained as a high-selling download single and has continued to receive heavy airplay well after the single was deleted.

On 20 April 2013, Dutch composer [[John Ewbank (composer)|John Ewbank]] deleted his song "[[Koningslied]]" ("The King's Song") only two days after its initial release, citing an overload of criticism aimed at him personally and at the song itself from the general public and the media. The song had been commissioned to act as the official song of [[Willem Alexander]], Prince of Orange's upcoming investiture as the new King of the Netherlands on 30 April 2013. The song, already at number one in the iTunes download charts on the day of its release, was performed by a large number of well known Dutch artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22232304 |title=Willem-Alexander Dutch investiture: King's Song outcry |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5128">
The '''director of audiography''', (DA) within Indian-style [[filmmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/india/ The Culture-Specific Use of Sound in Indian Cinema (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the head of the sound department and the person responsible for planning the [[audiography]]  and managing the audiographers of a film. 
The title is not used professionally in most of the world. The role of audiographer and the title "director of audiography" derives from [[Bollywood]]-style filmmaking in India, where it is an established title credit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254967/fullcredits#cast Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276628/combined Yehi Hai Zindagi (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120456/fullcredits#cast Virasat (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0991346/fullcredits#cast Bhoothnath (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The DA works to carry out the [[Film director|director's]] vision, identifies the tasks necessary to realize this vision, budgets for those tasks and coordinates all the work from pre-production to post-production whilst keeping an eye on overall sound quality.

Since the onset of the "[[talkies]]", a creative and professional conflict has emerged from the ongoing tension between the visual and aural dimensions of film. Production sound crews often complain about the lack of consideration given to sound on film productions.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/production-sound/openletter.htm An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.0)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curleysound.com/soundltr.pdf  An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Having a DA in pre-production helps to exert a powerful presence to defend the dimension of sound in film.

In the early days of the Hollywood [[studio system]], every studio had a sound director (SD)&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or a recording director (RD), who headed the sound department and took sole credit for the work done by a large crew of sound technicians.
&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsound.org/murch/stretching.htm Walter Murch]&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood sound editor David Yewdall bemoans the loss of the SD in [[Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and recalls the story of [[film producer]] Ross Hunter, working on the film ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', who neglected to take the advice of sound editor Joe Sikorski to record aircraft sound effects on location; an SD would have immediately appreciated the financial implications of ''not'' taking such advice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 116) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the studio system and the loss of the sound director, part of this role was delegated to the post-production supervisor, [[supervising sound editor]], [[sound designer]] or [[production sound mixer]] - each role allegedly having less influence, responsibility and scope than the former SD. Where no DA is hired - as is the case when making films in the [[Western world|West]] - there has been some debate on the most appropriate role to head the sound department; a supervising sound editor is seen as a technical manager - comparable to an [[art director]] - whereas a sound designer is viewed as a creative visionary, analogous to a [[production designer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994), page. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sounds of Movies'' by Nicholas Pasquariello (1996, 1997), page. 130&lt;/ref&gt; 
In practice, the industry sees both roles as equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amps.net/ AMPS website] - see the note on Supervising Sound Editors in the Directory of Members PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The DA should not be confused with a production supervisor or post-production supervisor - both are administrative roles in the production department. In contrast, the DA is a technical role blending leadership, management and administrative skills with creative audiography ranging over pre-production, production and post-production - constrained only by the Director's vision and the production's schedule and budget. In many ways the DoA role is a natural extension of the more limited post-production role of supervising sound editor.

The term director of sound (DoS) has also been proposed as an alternative title to that of DA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/QA/sound-design-philosophy.htm Randy Thom]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ferrari Virtual Academy''''' (or '''''FVA''''') is a [[sim racing]] [[video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] developed by [[Kunos Simulazioni]] and released in September 2010. The simulation allows the player to drive a [[Ferrari]] against the clock at a race track. There are no other vehicles to race against in real time.&lt;ref name=FVAreview&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrari Virtual Academy 2010 – Mini Review|url=http://www.virtualr.net/ferrari-virtual-academy-2010-mini-review-previews|work=VirtualR.net|publisher=VirtualR.net|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the servers (needed even for single player gaming) were down for some time, with Ferrari ending its support for the game.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} As of February 2015, the simulation can be used, however it can no longer be purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrari Virtual Academy non è più disponibile|language=Italian|trans-title=Ferrari Virtual Academy can no longer be purchased|url=http://www.formulapassion.it/2015/02/ferrari-virtual-academy-non-e-piu-disponibile/|work=FormulaPassion.it|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game offers two modes: Free Practice in which driving aids such as traction control, assisted braking, visible driving line and automatic transmission are permitted and the player can decide how much fuel should be in the car; and Hot Lap mode in which no driving aids are allowed, the fuel amount is fixed and reset each lap. Times set in Hot Lap mode are entered into an online leaderboard.&lt;ref name=FVAreview/&gt;

'''''Gilligan's Planet''''' is an American [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning animated series]] produced by [[Filmation]] and [[MGM Television|MGM/UA Television]] which aired during the [[1982-83 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|1982-1983 season]] on [[CBS]]. It was the second animated [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (the first being ''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'').

''Gilligan's Planet'' was the last cartoon series that Filmation produced for Saturday mornings; afterwards, they transitioned from Saturday Mornings to producing cartoons exclusively for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. It was also the first Filmation series to feature the [[Lou Scheimer]] "signature" credit (as opposed to the rotating Lou Scheimer/[[Norm Prescott]] "wheel" credit which had been used since 1969). In addition, it was one of the last 1980s Saturday morning cartoons to be fitted with an adult [[laugh track]], as the popularity of the practice had subsided.

''Gilligan's Planet'' featured all of the original actors but one; [[Tina Louise]], who has consistently refused to participate in any ''Gilligan's Island''-related material since the series ended, again declined to reprise her role as [[Ginger Grant]]. [[Dawn Wells]], who had been unavailable during the production of ''The New Adventures of Gilligan'', returned to the franchise, voicing both her own character ([[Mary Ann Summers]]) and Ginger.

==Premise==
''Gilligan's Planet'' is based on the premise that [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|the Professor]] had managed to build an operational interplanetary [[Starship|spaceship]] to get the castaways of the original series off the island. (At least, the series thus disregards two of the three television movies made after the series ended, which had integrated the cast back into society.) True to the castaways' perpetual bad luck, they rocketed off into space and crash-landed on an unknown [[planet]] that supported human life. In many ways, the planet was like the island, but with a strangely colored and cratered surface with more land to get around. The rocket was severely damaged in the crash; thus, the castaways were still stranded and the Professor resumed his attempts to repair their only way home.

Overall, ''Gilligan's Planet'' represented the source material of the original live-action series with "space" and "alien" themes. Encounters with "headhunters" and other shipwrecked people became encounters with alien creatures. A new character named Bumper was added, who appeared as a reptilian alien pet/sidekick for Gilligan and company.

==Cast==
* [[Bob Denver]] - Willy Gilligan
* [[Alan Hale Jr.]] - Skipper Jonas Grumby
* [[Jim Backus]] - Thurston Howell III
* [[Natalie Schafer]] - Eunice Wentworth "Lovey" Howell
* [[Russell Johnson]] - Professor Roy Hinkley
* [[Dawn Wells]] - Mary Ann Summers, Ginger Grant

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14040">'''Guerrilla filmmaking''' refers to a form of [[independent film]]making characterized by low budgets, [[skeleton crew]]s, and simple props using whatever is available. Often scenes are shot quickly in [[filming location|real locations]] without any warning, and without obtaining [[filming permit]]s.

Guerrilla filmmaking is usually done by independent filmmakers because they don't have the budget or time to obtain  permits, rent out locations, or build expensive sets. Larger and more "mainstream" film studios tend to avoid guerrilla filmmaking tactics because of the risk of being sued, fined or having their reputation damaged due to negative [[public relations|PR]] publicity.

According to Yukon Film Commission Manager Mark Hill, "Guerrilla filmmaking is driven by passion with whatever means at hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.yk.ca/news/2000/Jan-00/00-017.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115104533/http://www.gov.yk.ca/news/2000/Jan-00/00-017.html |archivedate=15 January 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' characterized [[Ed Wood]]  as a guerrilla filmmaker.  As depicted in the biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', Wood stole a fake octopus for one of the scenes in his low budget films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/23/movies/film-festival-review-ode-to-a-director-who-dared-to-be-dreadful.html|title=FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful|last=Maslin|first=Janet|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1994-09-23|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129235544/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/23/movies/film-festival-review-ode-to-a-director-who-dared-to-be-dreadful.html|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'', directed by [[Melvin Van Peebles]], as "a textbook on guerrilla filmmaking" in his review of ''[[Baadasssss!]]'', a [[biopic]] about the making of ''Sweet Sweetback''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baadasssss-2004|title=Baadasssss!|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|work=RogerEbert.com|date=2004-06-11|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221094017/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baadasssss-2004|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ben Sisario of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Van Peebles "a hero of guerrilla filmmaking" who has suffered for his uncompromising vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/theater/24vanpeebles.html|title=He’s Got It Bad, or ‘Baad,’ for His Art|last=Sisario|first=Ben|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-01-20|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505152148/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/theater/24vanpeebles.html|archivedate=5 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Queer Cinema]] director [[Gregg Araki]] shot his first two films, ''[[Three Bewildered People in the Night]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Long Weekend (O' Despair)]]'' (1989) using a spring-wound [[Bolex]] camera and scrap film stock, on a budget of $5,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film|last=Levy|first=Emanuel|authorlink=Emanual Levy|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|page=467|isbn=0-8147-5124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Rodriguez]] shot the action film ''[[El Mariachi]]'' in Spanish. ''El Mariachi'', which was shot for around $7,000 with money partially raised by volunteering in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1992. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the [[United States]]. Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book ''[[Rebel Without a Crew]]''.  The book and film would inspire other filmmakers to pick up cameras and make no-budget movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1993/abc_no_budget.php|title=THE ABC'S OF NO-BUDGET FILMMAKING|last=Broderick|first=Peter|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|issue=Winter 1993|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008033822/http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1993/abc_no_budget.php|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Troma Entertainment]] is a [[film production]] and [[film distribution|distribution]] company founded by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and [[Michael Herz (producer)|Michael Herz]] in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, many of which have developed [[cult film|cult followings]]. Kaufman has been outspoken about their use of [[guerrilla marketing]] and tolerance of piracy, and he has written the books ''[[All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger]]'' and ''[[Make Your Own Damn Movie!]]'', which outline his philosophy of quick and inexpensive independent film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/08/cult-film-maker-let-digital-pirates-have-fun-with-your-stuff/|title=Steal this movie: cult film maker lets digital pirates share his content|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029094546/http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/08/cult-film-maker-let-digital-pirates-have-fun-with-your-stuff/|archivedate=29 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', directed by first time director [[Oren Peli]], was shot for approximately $10,000.  [[Michael Cieply]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the production and release as "guerrilla style".  After being well received at film festivals, Paramount put the film on a tour where fans could request a screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/business/media/21paranormal.html|title=Thriller on Tour Lets Fans Decide on the Next Stop|last=Cieply|first=Michael|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2009-09-20|accessdate=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Escape From Tomorrow (film)|Escape From Tomorrow]]'', made for $650,000, was "shot in a guerrilla-style manner at [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Disneyland]] without the permission of the parks," according to Jason Guerrasio of [[Indiewire]].  The film was originally expected to not be released due to fears of a lawsuit from Disney, but it was released on [[video on demand]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/how-the-director-of-escape-from-tomorrow-made-a-crazy-guerilla-movie-in-disney-land-and-got-away-with-it|title=How the Director of 'Escape From Tomorrow' Made a Crazy Guerrilla Movie In Disney World – And Got Away With It|last=Guerrasio|first=Jason|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=2013-10-09|accessdate=2014-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110215046/http://www.indiewire.com/article/how-the-director-of-escape-from-tomorrow-made-a-crazy-guerilla-movie-in-disney-land-and-got-away-with-it|archivedate=10 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Clark: A gonzomentary|Clark: A Gonzomentary]]' was a 2012 [[gonzo journalism]]-styled mockumentary about an amateur filmmaker documenting a [[Philadelphia]]n eccentric artist and his creative process. The guerrilla-style techniques implemented were used as part of the story itself, to represent the amateur production within the story.  It was shot with a budget of less than $3,000 with a [[Canon XL2]] and a [[Panasonic AG-DVX100]]. The director opted out of using a [[steadicam]] purposefully to achieve more shakiness. It was awarded Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy or mockumentary by The 2013 [[LA Web Series Festival]] and deemed "a gonzomentary truly realized" by Mark Bell of ''[[Film Threat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/59573/|title=Reviews|author=|date=|website=filmthreat.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102150454/http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/59573/|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Midnight Rider (film)|Midnight Rider]]", a biopic of [[Gregg Allman]], attempted to use guerilla filmmaking methods to illegally film a sequence on a railroad bridge in active use. A train coming shattered a metal bed placed on the tracks, killing camera operator Sarah Jones. Director [[Randall Miller]] was sentenced to two years imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter while producer Jay Sedrish received a suspended sentence of ten years' probation. Both were prohibited from working in any directorial or safety-related role for a decade.

''[[Super Demetrios]]'' (2011), the first [[Greek cinema|Greek]] [[Superhero film|superhero]] film, made on a budget of €2,000, won the audience award at the 52nd [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] with the highest number of votes in the history of the festival and became an instant cult classic,&lt;ref name="Flix"&gt;{{cite web

The advent of digital cameras and home computer editing systems such as [[Final Cut Pro]], [[Avid Technology|Avid Media Composer]] and [[Adobe Premiere Pro|Premiere Pro]] are a contributing factor to the increase in guerrilla filmmaking. Digital editing is a cheap and easy form of editing that allows the filmmaker to edit anywhere and at a low budget.

Many guerrilla filmmakers are now using professional quality digital cameras because of their cheap cost, and the ability to set up shots quickly.

'''''Intrigue''''' is a 1947 American [[film noir]] [[crime film]] directed by [[Edwin L. Marin]] starring [[George Raft]], [[June Havoc]] and [[Helena Carter]]. It was the first of two films Raft made for his own production company, Star Films, with producer Sam Bischoff.&lt;ref name="raft"/&gt; 
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Plot==
In post-war China, [[court-martial]]ed pilot Brad Dunham (George Raft) now flies smuggled goods into the country. He attempts to force his immediate superior, Ramon Perez ([[Marvin Miller]]), to pay him more, but Perez resists, so Brad steals the cargo back.

The boss of the black-market operation is Tamara Baranoff (June Havoc), who agrees to Brad's demand of a 50% cut of the operation and fires Ramon as a show of good faith. Meanwhile, an American newspaper reporter, Marc Andrews ([[Tom Tully]]), a friend of Brad's, shows up in Shanghai to investigate black-market crime.

Brad meets a social worker, Linda Arnold (Helena Carter]), and their friendship makes Tamara jealous. She insists that Brad do something about the prying reporter and steer clear of that other woman. Tamara's criminal rival tips off Marc that his pal Brad is involved with the crime ring.

Marc is knifed by Tamara's rival just as he is delivering a copy of his story exposing the black market. His dying wish is that Brad deliver the story for him, telling Brad that it was Tamara whose testimony led to Brad's unjust court-martial.

Brad distributes her black-market goods to needy citizens. Ramon turns up to ambush Brad, but his gun goes off, killing Tamara instead, and Ramon is placed under arrest. Brad and Linda contemplate a new life together.

==Production==
The film was based on a story by George Slavin. Film rights were bought by Sam Bischoff, who had formed a company with [[George Raft]]. It was the second of a four picture deal Bischoff had with [[United Artists]] after ''[[Pitfall (1948 film)|Pitfall]]''. The other pictures in the deal were to star Raft.&lt;ref&gt;By THOMAS F BRADY Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES. (1947, Feb 13). BISCHOFF ACQUIRES PICTURE FOR RAFT.

The plot was originally meant to involve smuggling blood plasma, but this was changed to whisky and cigarettes at the request of Chinese-American organizations. Raft regretted this change.&lt;ref name="raft"&gt;Aaker 2013, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography took place from April 28 to mid-June 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79329/Intrigue/original-print-info.html "Original print information: 'Intrigue' (1947)."] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: November 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming started 28 April 1947. It was [[June Havoc]]'s first film since 1944.&lt;ref&gt;By THOMAS F BRADY Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES. (1947, Apr 19). U-I WILL DO FILM OF KANTOR NOVEL.

Raft was hospitalised with illness during the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/variety166-1947-05#page/n80/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In his review of ''Intrigue'' for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Thomas M. Pryor considered the film a "conventional exercise in screen melodramatics " and George Raft's role as "... all so much wasted effort on his part for no one could possibly inject any semblance of verisimilitude into the hopeless botch of incident ''[sic]'' which Barry Trivers and George Slavin set to paper under the impression that they were writing a screen play."&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas M. (T.M.P.) [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B01E7D9153CE23BBC4C51DFB2668383659EDE "Movie review: 'Intrigue' (1947); Black market activities in Shanghai."] ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio adaptation==
On May 10, 1948, George Raft and June Havoc reprised their film roles in a 60-minute radio adaptation of the film for a "Lux Radio Theater" broadcast.

Senior Editor '''Jiang Heping''' ({{zh|s=江和平|p=Jiāng Hépíng}}) is a prominent executive at [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), the state broadcaster of the [[People's Republic of China]]. He is responsible for sport coverage in his roles as Executive Director of the CCTV Sports Programming Centre and Controller of [[CCTV-5]], its national sports channel,&lt;ref&gt;It is common in Chinese state-owned organizations for power to be shared between a nominal head, such as Mr Jiang, and the relevant Party official. However, his official biography states that he is "in charge of work" (主持工作), which may indicate that he is ''[[de facto]]'' as well as ''[[de jure]]'' director.&lt;/ref&gt; and will play a key role in the broadcasting of the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].

==Career==
Senior Editor Jiang was born on January 7, 1963, in [[Anhui]] province.&lt;ref name="cctv2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gbh.cctv.com/20060815/104920.shtml|script-title=zh:江和平副主任|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=CCTV|date=15 August 2006|language=Chinese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang studied English language and international journalism at [[Shanghai International Studies University]].

CCTV permanent staff are almost always Party members, and in 1987 graduates were assigned posts by the State.&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to work at CCTV's International News Division, rising to become deputy editor and editor from 1990 to 1996. He introduced new programming, including the division's first live news bulletins. In February 1996 he was appointed deputy director of the News Department, and was permitted to take an MA in Journalism at the &lt;!-- Note the following is a historical reference --&gt;[[University of Wales, Cardiff]] from September 1996 to September 1997, funded by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]].&lt;ref name="cctv3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/sports/special/C14457/20050819/102420.shtml|script-title=zh:江和平简介 |accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=CCTV|date=19 August 2005|language=Chinese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to become deputy director of the Foreign Language News Department in 1998, and was promoted to director in May 2000. In this role, he oversaw the launch of [[CCTV-9]], . In April 2003, he became deputy head of CCTV's Overseas Service and Controller of CCTV-9. He oversaw a relaunch of this channel, the launch of a new French/Spanish channel ([[CCTV News (English)|CCTV-E&amp;F]]) and increased availability of CCTV services in North America (''Great Wall TV'').

As part of restructuring, Khaleej Times laid off up to 30 staff in late 2016. Shishir Kapadia was elevated as Senior Vice-President - Finance &amp; Operations in late 2017. Executive Editor Vicky Kapur took charge of the Editorial operations in mid-February 2018.

The media house launched an Events and Conferences division in 2017 in a strategic decision to diversify its operations from being a pure-play news platform to branching out into the lucrative B2B and B2C conference segment, leveraging its 40-year brand equity.

In July 2018, ''Khaleej Times'' introduced a free news subscription service on [https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/khaleej-times-news-alerts-on-whatsapp-heres-how-to-subscribe WhatsApp] , sending regular news updates every day to its subscribers.

==Additional publications==
''Young Times'', which ''Khaleej Times'' stopped publishing in 2008, was aimed at children and was a hugely popular magazine among the target age-group. The publishing house relaunched [http://youngtimes.com/ Young Times] on January 10, 2018, after a break of over 9 years. The magazine targets 9-14 year-old school kids. 

''KT Buzzon'' is a separate tabloid of 28 to 32 pages published daily along with the ''Khaleej Times'' main paper. It carries local advertisements about cars, real estate, recruitment, educational services and matrimonial announcements.

''WKND Magazine'', is published on Fridays along with the broadsheet, discusses a range of topics that are of interest to men, women and children. Stories are balanced between topics and themes of local interest and international relevance.

''Khaleej Times Online'' is the global face of the newspaper on the internet. The online version offers additional stories and exclusives not found in the print version.

''Khaleej Times Spotlight'' also publishes special supplements, including on the national days of countries including UAE, Pakistan and India.

'''Laughing Horse''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] promotion company and venue operator.

The company was established in the UK in 1998,&lt;ref name=LHComedy/&gt; and now operates venues in [[Aldershot]], [[Brighton]], [[Cirencester]], [[Hitchin]], [[London]] ([[Brixton]], [[Covent Garden]], [[Lancaster Gate]], [[Paddington]]), [[Manchester]], [[St Neots]], [[Thetford]] and [[Wyboston]].

At Edinburgh, they have run the [[Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] since 2004.&lt;ref name=List/&gt; At these shows, audiences do not have to buy tickets. They simply pay what they choose as a donation at the end of the show.

Since 2001, they have run the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year competition, which has been won by several famous British comedians at early stages of their career. For that reason, it has been called "a big deal to British newcomers".&lt;ref name=Skinny/&gt; [[Greg Davies]] won the competition on his fourth ever gig, and [[Russell Kane]] won it within the first six months of his career. Others to have won or made the final include [[Rhod Gilbert]], [[Nina Conti]], [[Jack Whitehall]] and [[Carl Donnelly]].&lt;ref name=LHNewAct/&gt;&lt;ref name=LHPastWins/&gt; The company also run comedy training courses.

'''Leaverite''' is a [[slang]] term used by [[geology|geologists]], [[mineralogy|mineralogists]], [[archaeology|archaeologists]], and amateur rock collectors to identify a specimen in the field that may look interesting but is actually not.&lt;ref name="Mindat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/glossary/leaverite |title=Definition of leaverite |work=mindat.org |accessdate=2016-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks identified as such are generally left where they were found, as there is no reason to attempt to remove them. The term ''leaverite'' derives from the phrase "''leave 'er right'' there".&lt;ref Name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite book

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise has spawned multiple films and television/streaming series. The franchise originated with a film [[trilogy]], later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies. The [[Star Wars Trilogy|original trilogy]] was released between 1977 and 1983, the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] between 1999 and 2005, and a [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] began in 2015. Theatrical {{nowrap|spin-off}} films, television specials and TV series are set between the main films. There have been a few animated ''Star Wars'' series, and the first live-action series will be released in 2019.

==Theatrical films==
The ''Star Wars'' film series centers around a "trilogy of trilogies" (also referred to as the "Skywalker saga"&lt;ref name=IXcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Episode IX Cast Announced|website=[[StarWars.com]]|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-ix-cast-announced|date=July 27, 2018 |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "''Star Wars'' saga"). They were released out of sequence: the original (Episodes ''IV–VI'', 1977–83), prequel (Episodes ''I–III'', 1999–2005), and sequel (Episodes ''VII–IX'', 2015–19) trilogy. The first two trilogies were released on three year intervals, the sequel trilogy films two years apart. Each trilogy centers on a generation of the [[The Force|Force]]-sensitive [[Skywalker family]]. The prequels focus on [[Anakin Skywalker]], the original trilogy on his son [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]], and the sequels on Luke's nephew [[Kylo Ren]].

Several spin-off films have been released theatrically. An animated film, ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008), was released as a pilot to a [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|TV series of the same name]]. An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a849876/george-lucas-solo-a-star-wars-story-han-solo-movie-disney-lucasfilm/|title=Lucas had been developing a Han Solo movie for ages|website=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Louise|last=McCreesh|date=February 13, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; described by Disney [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] [[Jay Rasulo]] as "[[origin story|origin stories]]".&lt;ref name="Graser"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graser|first=Marc|title=''Star Wars'': The 'Sky's the Limit' for Disney's Spinoff Opportunities|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/star-wars-skies-the-limit-for-disney-when-it-comes-to-opportunities-1200609291/|accessdate=September 13, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first entry, ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before ''Episode IV''.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=Star Wars: Rogue One and mystery standalone movie take center stage|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/19/star-wars-rogue-one-and-mystery-stand-alone-movie-take-center-stage|accessdate=April 19, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/22/rogue-one-lucasfilm-new-star-wars-movies|title=As Rogue One looms, Lucasfilm develops secret plans for new Star Wars movies|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring [[Chewbacca]] and [[Lando Calrissian]].

Two spin-off film series are planned, an untitled trilogy by [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|''Episode VIII'']]'s director [[Rian Johnson]] has been announced, with an additional film series by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]] also in development.

The episodic films begin with an [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]], accompanied by the [[Star Wars (Main Title)|main ''Star Wars'' theme]] by [[John Williams]], who composes the scores for each film. Some of the films have had [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|retroactive changes]] made after their initial releases, most notably the original trilogy.

Immediately after directing ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), Lucas wrote a two-page synopsis for the [[space opera]] he had been planning, which [[20th Century Fox]] invested in.{{Sfn|Rinzler|2007|p=8}} Lucas expanded his treatment into an overview called ''The Star Wars'',{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=50}} and by 1974, he had written the screenplay's first draft.&lt;ref name=starkiller&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628065925/http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2006|title=Starkiller |publisher=Jedi Bendu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas negotiated to retain the sequel rights,&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite web|title=An Architect Of Hollywood's Greatest Deal Recalls How George Lucas Won Sequel Rights|url=http://deadline.com/2015/12/star-wars-franchise-george-lucas-historic-rights-deal-tom-pollock-1201669419/|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and casted ''American Graffiti'' actor Harrison Ford as [[Han Solo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/harrison-ford-carpenter-george-lucas/|title=George Lucas Hires His Carpenter Harrison Ford to Star in Sci-Fi Film|date=March 31, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' was released on May 25, 1977, followed by ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' on May 21, 1980, and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' on May 25, 1983.

The [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]] opens with a Rebel spaceship being intercepted by the Empire above the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. Aboard, the deadliest Imperial agent [[Darth Vader]] and his [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] capture [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]], a secret member of the rebellion. Before her capture, Leia makes sure the droid [[R2-D2]] will escape with stolen Imperial blueprints and a holographic message for the Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who has been living in exile on Tatooine. Along with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}}, R2-D2 falls under the ownership of Luke Skywalker, a farmboy who has been raised by his aunt and uncle. Luke helps the droids locate Obi-Wan, now a solitary old hermit known as Ben Kenobi. He reveals himself as a friend of Luke's absent father, Anakin Skywalker, who was Obi-Wan's Jedi apprentice until being murdered by Vader. He tells Luke he must also become a Jedi. After discovering his family's homestead has been destroyed by the Empire, they hire the smuggler [[Han Solo]], his [[Wookiee]] {{nowrap|co-pilot}} [[Chewbacca]] and their space freighter, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. They discover that Leia's homeworld of Alderaan has been destroyed, and are soon captured by the planet-destroying [[Death Star]]. While Obi-Wan disables its [[tractor beam]], Luke and Han rescue the captive Princess Leia. Finally, they deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance with the hope of exploiting a weakness.&lt;ref name="star wars 4"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2006|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rough draft, titled ''The Star Wars'', introduced "[[the Force]]" and the young hero Luke Starkiller.  Annikin {{sic}} appeared as Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. The third draft replaced (a deceased) Annikin with Ben Kenobi.&lt;ref name=starkiller/&gt; Some months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to two sequels. Lucas hired  [[Alan Dean Foster]], who was ghostwriting the [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|novelization of the first film]], to write them — with the main creative restriction that they could be filmed on a low budget.{{Sfn |Rinzler| 2007| p = 107}} By 1976, a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled ''The Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars''. During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and shortened the title to ''The Star Wars'', and finally just ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name=starkiller/&gt; At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to warrant full-scale sequels. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes to become a self-contained story ending with the destruction of the Empire in the Death Star.  The intention was that if the film was successful, Lucas could adapt Foster's novels into low-budget sequels.{{Sfn | Kaminski | 2007 | p = 38}} By that point, Lucas had developed a tentative backstory to aid in developing the saga.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p= 134}}
''Star Wars'' exceeded all expectations. The success of the film and its merchandise sales led Lucas to make ''Star Wars'' the basis of an elaborate [[film serial]],{{Sfn |Kaminski| 2007| p=142}} and use the profits to finance his filmmaking center, [[Skywalker Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baxter | first = John| title= Mythmaker| year = 1999 | page = 173 | isbn=978-0-380-97833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the first sequel, the original film was subtitled ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' for a rerelease in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inafarawaygalaxy.com/2015/12/when-did-star-wars-become-known-as-new.html|title=When did Star Wars become known as A New Hope? - In A Far Away Galaxy|author=James Ryan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/was-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-originally-released-under-another-title|title=Why was "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" originally released under another title - ScreenPrism|author=ScreenPrism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lucas"&gt;{{Cite video| people=Lucas, George|date=2004|title=DVD commentary for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set three years after the destruction of the Death Star, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' begins with the Empire forcing the Rebel Alliance to evacuate its secret base on [[Hoth]]. Instructed by Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke travels to the swamp world of [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]]. Luke's Jedi training is interrupted by Vader, who lures him into a trap by capturing Han and Leia at [[Bespin|Cloud City]], governed by Han's old friend [[Lando Calrissian|Lando]].

Owing to financial concerns, Alan Dean Foster's sequel novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' (1978), restricted the story to Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|title=The First Star Wars sequel: Inside the writing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye|first=John|last=Wenz|date=January 1, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fry|first=Jason|title=Alan Dean Foster: Author of the ''Mind's Eye''|journal=[[Star Wars Insider]]|issue=50 |date=July–August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the success of the original film, Lucas knew a sequel would be granted a reasonable budget, and hired [[Leigh Brackett]] to write it from scratch. She finished a draft by early 1978, but died of cancer before Lucas was able discuss changes he wanted made to it.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=144}} His disappointment with the first draft may have made him consider new directions.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=161}} Lucas penned the next draft, the first screenplay to feature episodic numbering for a ''Star Wars'' story.{{Sfn |Bouzereau|1997|p=135}} Lucas found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggle writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more&lt;ref name="Bouzereau 1997 123"&gt;{{harvnb |Bouzereau|1997|p= 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 1978. The plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=120–21}} After writing these drafts, Lucas fleshed out the backstory between Anakin, Obi-Wan, and the Emperor.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 164–65}}

With this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies,&lt;ref name=PrevueLucas&gt;Steranko, "George Lucas", ''Prevue'' #42, September–October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; designating the first sequel ''Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' in the next draft.&lt;ref name="Bouzereau 1997 123"/&gt; [[Lawrence Kasdan]], who had just completed writing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', was hired to write the next drafts, and given additional input from director [[Irvin Kershner]]. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer [[Gary Kurtz]] saw the film as a more serious and adult story, and developed the sequel from the light adventure roots of the first film.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=178}}

=====''Episode VI: Return of the Jedi''=====
Set less than one year after Vader's revelation, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' sees Luke joining Leia and Lando in a rescue attempt to save Han from the gangster [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, only to find Yoda on his deathbed.&lt;ref name="Mackey-Kallis2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Mackey-Kallis|title=The Hero and the Perennial Journey Home in American Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRArN-NMk0wC&amp;pg=PA221|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0013-3|pages=221–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last words, Yoda confirms the truth about Luke's father, and that Luke must confront Vader again in order to complete his training.

Kurtz wanted a bittersweet and nuanced ending they had outlined that saw Han dead, the Rebel forces in pieces, Leia struggling as a queen, and Luke walking off alone (like in a [[Spaghetti Western]])—while Lucas wanted a happier ending, partly to encourage toy sales. This led to tension between the two, resulting in Kurtz leaving the production.&lt;ref name="LostEnding"&gt;Geoff Boucher (August 12, 2010).

====Prequel trilogy====
{{main|Star Wars prequel trilogy}}
Loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|website=TheForce.net|date=May 26, 1999|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create [[computer-generated imagery]], inspired him to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|pp=294–95}}

The prequel trilogy consists of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'', released on May 19, 1999; ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', released on May 16, 2002; and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', released on May 19, 2005.&lt;ref name="release dates"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415144223/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archivedate=April 15, 2008|title=Episode III Release Dates Announced|publisher=StarWars.com|date=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot focuses on the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]], as well as the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side.

Set 32 years before the original film, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' begins with two Jedi who, acting as negotiators of the Republic, discover that the corrupt [[Trade Federation]] has formed a blockade around the planet [[Naboo]]. Sith Lord Darth Sidious has secretly caused the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, encounter a native of Naboo who helps them find the Queen of Naboo. With Queen [[Padmé Amidala]], they escape the blockade, but not without their starship being damaged. Landing on Tatooine for repairs, they meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon helps liberate the boy by betting with his master in a podrace, believing him to be the "[[Messiah|Chosen One]]" prophesied by the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. Sidious dispatches his Sith apprentice, [[Darth Maul]], to attack the Queen's Jedi protectors. Arriving on [[Coruscant]] so the Queen can plead Naboo's crisis before the Republic Senate, Anakin is brought before the Jedi Council, where Yoda senses that he possesses too much fear.&lt;ref name="star wars 1"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2001|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|pp=299–300}} This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''. Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Star Wars Insider|title=Star Wars Insider|issue=45|page=19|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warwick Davis &amp; Anthony Daniels 2.jpg|thumb|168px|right|[[Warwick Davis]] and [[Anthony Daniels]] have appeared in films across all three trilogies as well as in anthology films.]]
Ten years after the Battle of Naboo, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' opens with an assassination attempt upon former Queen Padmé Amidala, who is serving as the Senator of Naboo. Obi-Wan and his apprentice Anakin are assigned to protect her; Obi-Wan tracks the killer, while Anakin and Padmé retreat to Naboo. They soon fall in love with each other, albeit secretly due to the Jedi Order's rule against attachment. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the entire galaxy into the "[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone War]]" between the Republic army led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by [[Count Dooku]] (the former master of Obi-Wan's deceased master Qui-Gon, and Palpatine's new Sith apprentice).&lt;ref name="star wars 2"&gt;{{Cite video|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]|publisher= [[20th Century Fox]]| date = 2002 | medium = DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft of ''Episode II'' was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired [[Jonathan Hales]], a writer from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', to polish it.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=371}} Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film "Jar Jar's Great Adventure".{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=374}} In writing ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a [[cloning|clone]] from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''A New Hope''.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}}{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=158}} He later came up with the concept of an army of clone [[Shock troops|shock trooper]]s from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=162}}

=====''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''=====
''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' begins three years into the Clone Wars, with Anakin and Obi-Wan leading a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku and the droid commander [[General Grievous]]. Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of his secret wife Padmé dying in childbirth. Palpatine, who had been secretly engineering the Clone Wars to destroy the Jedi Order, convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and is renamed Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone army to fire on their Jedi generals, and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi, culminating in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Mustafar|Mustafar]].&lt;ref name="star wars 3"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on ''Episode III'' began before ''Episode II'' was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars,{{Sfn |Rinzler|2005|pp=13–15}} and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through [[The Force#Prequel films and midi-chlorians|the Force]].{{Sfn|Rinzler|2005|p=42}} Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot,{{Sfn|Rinzler|2005|p=36}} having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2007|pp=380–84}} After principal photography was completed in 2003, Lucas made more changes, rewriting Anakin's arc. He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic. The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage, and filming new and revised scenes during pick-ups in 2004.&lt;ref name="star wars 3 documentary"&gt;{{Cite video | title =Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith documentary "Within a Minute"|medium=DVD documentary|date= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel trilogy focuses on the journey of the orphaned scavenger Rey following in the footsteps of the Jedi with the guidance of Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and his pupil [[Kylo Ren]] (Han Solo and Leia's son). ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' was released on December 18, 2015, ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' on December 15, 2017, and ''Episode IX'' is due to be released on December 20, 2019.

=====''Episode VII: The Force Awakens''=====

[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]] is set 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star, by which time Luke Skywalker has gone missing. The remnants of the Empire have become the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], who seek to destroy Luke and the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. They are opposed by the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], led by princess-turned-general Leia Organa. On the planet of [[Jakku]], Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] obtains a map to Luke's location, but is captured by stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren. Poe's droid [[BB-8]] escapes with the map, and encounters a scavenger girl, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. Kylo tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. A defecting stormtrooper frees Poe, who dubs him "[[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]]", and both escape in a [[TIE fighter]]. Poe is seemingly killed in a crash-landing upon Jakku. Finn finds Rey and BB-8, as the First Order pursues them; they escape together in the impounded ''Millennium Falcon''. The ''Falcon'' is recaptured by Han Solo and Chewbacca, working as smugglers again. They agree to help deliver the map inside BB-8 to the Resistance.

[[File:SDCC 2015 - Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill &amp; Harrison Ford (19060574883).jpg|left|thumb|Fisher, Hamill, and Ford reprised their characters in supporting roles in the sequel trilogy.]]
After a battle scene which overlaps with the denouement of the previous film, ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' follows Rey's attempt to convince Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. She also seeks answers about her past and the conflict between Luke and his nephew Kylo Ren. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey starts using the Force to communicate with Ren. Meanwhile, Leia leads Poe, Finn, [[Rose Tico]], BB-8, and the rest of the Resistance as they are pursued by the First Order, led by Snoke with Kylo as his second in command. After hearing Ren's perspective, Rey disagrees with Luke and leaves him in an attempt to redeem Kylo and achieve peace. In doing this, Rey unwittingly helps Kylo kill Snoke. However, Ren's intentions are to replace Snoke as Supreme Leader, believing that destroying the Jedi and the Resistance is the only way to achieve peace. Rey must choose between Kylo's offer to rule the galaxy with him, or helping the outnumbered Resistance survive on Crait.

===Standalone films===
As Lucas was outlining his trilogy of trilogies, he also imagined making "a couple of odd movies ... [that] don't have anything to do with the ''Star Wars'' saga."&lt;ref&gt; [[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]] "George Lucas", ''Prevue'' #42, September–October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the [[Ewok]] spin-off films ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' (1984) and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' (1985), which were screened internationally after being produced for television. Although based on story ideas from Lucas, they do not bear ''Star Wars'' in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films.

After the conclusion of his then six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series.

''[[Rogue One]]'' is set directly before ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by [[Mads Mikkelsen]]) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]]. Galen secretly sends a deflecting Imperial pilot to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend [[Saw Gerrera]]. Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to use her ties to help the Rebel Alliance retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.

The idea for the movie came from [[John Knoll]], the [[chief creative officer]] of [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofvfx.com/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-john-knoll-overall-vfx-supervisor-chief-creative-officer-industrial-light-magic/|title=ROGUE ONE - A STAR WARS STORY: John Knoll - Overall VFX Supervisor &amp; Chief Creative Officer - Industrial Light &amp; Magic - The Art of VFXThe Art of VFX|website=www.artofvfx.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]] as the director of an anthology film, with [[Gary Whitta]] writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Star Wars' Spinoff Hires 'Godzilla' Director Gareth Edwards (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-spinoff-hires-godzilla-706636|accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's title was revealed to be ''Rogue One'', with [[Chris Weitz]] rewriting the script, and [[Felicity Jones]] in the starring role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/rogue-one-will-be-first-star-wars-stand-alone-film|title=ROGUE ONE WILL BE FIRST STAR WARS STAND-ALONE FILM|last=Collura|first=Scott|publisher=IGN|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Mendelsohn]] and [[Diego Luna]] also play new characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/ben-mendelsohn-star-wars-rogue-one-1201398835/|title=Ben Mendelsohn Orbiting 'Star Wars' Spin Off 'Rogue One'?|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Fleming |first=Mike, Jr|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[James Earl Jones]] returning to voice [[Darth Vader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/12/09/what-we-know-about-the-new-characters-in-rogue-one/|title=What we know about the new characters in 'Rogue One'|last=Oleksinski|first=Johnny|date=December 9, 2016|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards stated, "It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/19/8451743/star-wars-rogue-one-plot-description|title = Star Wars: Rogue One will be about the Rebel Alliance stealing plans for the Death Star|date = April 19, 2015|accessdate = April 19, 2015|website = The Verge|publisher = |last = Bishop|first = Bryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated ''Star Wars'' TV series, namely ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;''' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by [[Forest Whitaker]].

=====''Solo: A Star Wars Story''=====

''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo before his appearance in the original trilogy. After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of [[Corellia]] goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend [[Qi'ra]]. Han "Solo" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound [[Wookiee]] friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Beckett. After angering gangster Dryden Vos, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire [[Lando Calrissian]], the captain and owner of the ''Millennium Falcon''. A [[plot twist|twist ending]] reveals Vos' employer, acknowledging one of the major story arcs of ''The Clone Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/solos-biggest-surprise-and-the-star-wars-the-clone-wars-connection|title=Solo's biggest surprise and the Star Wars: The Clone Wars connection|last=Silliman|first=Brian|date=May 25, 2018|publisher=SyFy Wire|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired ''Star Wars'' original trilogy veteran [[Lawrence Kasdan]] to write a film about a young Han Solo.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The film stars [[Alden Ehrenreich]] as a young [[Han Solo]], [[Joonas Suotamo]] as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in ''The Force Awakens'' and ''The Last Jedi''), [[Donald Glover]] as Lando Calrissian, [[Emilia Clarke]] as Qi'ra, and [[Woody Harrelson]] as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] to direct, but they were fired during [[principal photography]], and replaced by [[Ron Howard]].

Critics noted the film was intentionally left open for sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/44763-solo-star-wars-franchise-sequels-spoilers|title='Solo: A Star Wars Story' Sequels Seem Really Likely, According to Critics|publisher=Inverse.com|last=Britt|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alden Ehrenreich confirmed his contractual obligation to play the character for two additional films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a19991800/solo-a-star-wars-story-han-solo-movie-sequels-alden-ehrenreich/|title=Alden Ehrenreich Will Return as Han Solo After 'Solo'|date=April 24, 2018|publisher=Esquire|last=Miller|first=Matt|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emilia Clarke also signed on for the possible return of her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/star-wars/news/a857361/solo-a-star-wars-story-sequel-emilia-clarke/|title=Could Solo: A Star Wars Story be getting a sequel?

===Planned spin-off series===

In November 2017, Lucasfilm announced that [[Rian Johnson]], the writer/director of ''The Last Jedi'', would be working on a new trilogy. The films will reportedly differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters. Johnson is confirmed to write and direct the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/rian-johnson-writer-director-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi-to-create-all-new-star-wars-trilogy|title=Rian Johnson, Writer-Director of ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'', to Create All-New ''Star Wars'' Trilogy|website=StarWars.com|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, it was announced that ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' creators [[David Benioff]] and {{nowrap|[[D. B. Weiss]]}} would write and produce a series of ''Star Wars'' films that are not Skywalker-focused, similar to (but separate from) Rian Johnson's upcoming installments in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/game-of-thrones-creators-david-benioff-and-d-b-weiss-to-write-and-produce-a-new-series-of-star-wars-films|title=''Game of Thrones'' Creators David Benioff &amp; D.B. Weiss To Write And Produce A New Series Of ''Star Wars'' Films|date=February 6, 2018|publisher=''StarWars.com''|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical information===
The first six films of the ''Star Wars'' series were shot in an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1, while the Disney-made films are shot in 2.40:1. The original and sequel trilogies were shot with [[anamorphic]] lenses. ''Episodes IV'', ''V'', and ''VII'' were shot in [[Panavision]], while ''Episode VI'' was shot in Joe Dunton Camera (JDC) scope. ''Episode I'' was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on [[Arri]]flex cameras, and ''Episodes II'' and ''III'' were shot with Sony's [[CineAlta]] high-definition digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008 |url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/anamorphic/aspectratios/widescreenorama.html |title=Widescreen-O-Rama |publisher=The Digital Bits |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324132025/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/anamorphic/aspectratios/widescreenorama.html |archivedate=March 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music and sound effects====
Lucas hired [[Ben Burtt]] to oversee the sound effects on the original 1977 film. Burtt's accomplishment was such that the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] presented him with a Special Achievement Award because it had no award at the time for the work he had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Sergi | first = Gianluca|title=Tales of the Silent Blast: Star Wars and Sound|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=March 1998|volume=26|issue=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm developed the [[THX]] sound reproduction standard for ''Return of the Jedi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.digihometheatre.com/surround-sound/thx.html|title=Quality Home Theater Systems Products |publisher=Digital Home Theater |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321035758/http://www.digihometheatre.com/surround-sound/thx.html |archivedate = March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Williams]] composed the [[Music of Star Wars|scores for all eight films]]. Lucas's design for ''Star Wars'' involved a grand musical sound, with [[leitmotif]]s for different characters and important concepts. Williams's [[Star Wars (Main Title)|''Star Wars'' title theme]] has become one of the most famous and well-known musical compositions in modern music history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 27, 2008 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Trilogy-John-Williams/dp/B0002YCVLU|title=Star Wars Trilogy|publisher= Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stunts====
Lucas hired 'the Dean of Special Effects' [[John Stears]], who created R2-D2, Luke Skywalker's [[Landspeeder]], the Jedi Knights' [[lightsabers]], and the Death Star.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/04/nyregion/john-stears-64-dies-film-effects-wizard.html "John Stears, 64, Dies; Film-Effects Wizard"].

Anderson trained actor [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'', where he shares his experiences as the fight choreographer developing the lightsaber techniques for the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0961079/ | title = Reclaiming the Blade | year = 2009 | publisher = IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and internet==
Three live-action ''Star Wars'' spin-off films were created for television in the late 1970s and mid-1980s. The later two featured the Ewoks, which were also the focus of one of two animated series released in the mid-1980s. Further animated series began to be released in 2003, the first two of which focused on the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. After Disney's acquisition of LucasFilm, only the later ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' was kept in the canon of continuity of the episodic ''Star Wars'' films. Two additional half-hour animated series were ordered, one of which ties into the original trilogy, the other the sequel trilogy. Two live-action ''Star Wars'' series are currently in development for [[Disney+]].

====''Holiday Special''====
A two-hour ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special|Holiday Special]]'' focusing on [[Chewbacca]]'s family was produced for [[CBS]] in 1978. Along with the stars of the original film, celebrity guest stars appear in plot-related skits and musical numbers. Lucas loathed the special and forbade it to be reaired or released on home video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/12/25/the_star_wars_holiday_special_george_lucas_wants_to_smash_every_copy_of_with_a_sledgehammer_partner/ |title=The ''Star Wars'' holiday special George Lucas wants to smash every copy of with a sledgehammer|last=Warren|first=Robert|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=December 25, 2014|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 11-minute animated sequence features the first appearance of bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], and is considered the highlight of the special.

====''Ewoks'' films====
The [[Ewoks]] from ''Return of the Jedi'' were featured in two [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] television films, ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure|The Ewok Adventure]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''. Both aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively.

After the series finale aired in April 2012, [[Hulu]] announced it would begin offering the series under the name ''Little Mosque'' that summer.&lt;ref name=hulu&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Mosque|url=http://www.hulu.com/little-mosque|work=[[Hulu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series made its U.S. syndication debut on [[Pivot (TV channel)|Pivot]] in August 2013.

==Plot==
The series focuses on the [[Muslim]] community in the fictional prairie town of Mercy, [[Saskatchewan]] (population 14,000). The primary institutions of the community are the local mosque, presided over by [[imam]] Amaar Rashid and located in the rented parish hall of the town's [[Anglican]] church, and Fatima's Café, a downtown diner run by Fatima Dinssa. The community patriarchs are Yasir Hamoudi, a construction contractor who originally fronted the money to establish the mosque under the pretense that he was renting office space for his business, and Baber Siddiqui, a college economics professor who served as the mosque's temporary imam until Amaar was hired.

The town of Mercy is governed by Mayor Ann Popowicz. Sarah Hamoudi, Yasir's wife, works as a public relations officer in Popowicz's office. However, after Yasir had to leave Mercy and go to [[Lebanon]] in season 4 episode 10, Sarah managed his contracting company.

The title is a play on the name of the classic American book and TV drama series, ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]''. The two series are not related aside from the modified version of the title logo which was used for early seasons.

==Characters==
* '''Amaar Rashid''' ([[Zaib Shaikh]])&amp;nbsp;– Formerly a big shot lawyer from Toronto, he finds a new calling as a cleric and answers an ad to become an [[Imam]] at Mercy's [[Mosque]]. He does this despite the dismay of his family.  He tends to support [[liberal movements within Islam]], sometimes putting him in conflict with the more conservative Muslims in the community. Amaar tends to be [[sarcastic]], which he blames on his work as a lawyer. His wealthy parents ([[Hrant Alianak]] and Veena Sood) are not religious at all, and continue to pressure Amaar to return to his much more lucrative law career. He tends to say "I am the imam!" to prove his point or to show that despite his age, he has authority. He usually uses this when other characters (particularly Rayyan and Baber) are fighting and won't listen to reason. Amaar has also been known to be petty and hold a grudge but is generally a good man and a good man of faith. Amaar married Rayyan at the end of Season 5.  They have returned from their honeymoon to Mercy after Sarah and Yasir divorced.  In season 6, Amaar does not start out as the Imam despite pressure from some congregation members to do so.
* '''Yasir Hamoudi''' ([[Carlo Rota]])&amp;nbsp;– A contractor who runs his business out of an office at the mosque, he is a practical man who seeks compromise. He is committed to Islam but is also an opportunist and not, as his daughter might put it, "a good Muslim." For instance, one of the main reasons he helps out with the mosque is because he does not want to lose his free office space, but he lost that privilege when the church's bishop learned of the arrangement and ordered Rev. Magee to pay appropriate rent to the Church organization for it which was passed on to Yasir. Yasir is a card-carrying member of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], although more for the networking opportunities than out of any particular interest in being politically active. His role was reduced in seasons four and five, due to Rota's other acting commitments; within the show, his absence was explained as a temporary return to [[Lebanon]] to care for his ailing mother. Yasir is said to have left to stay in Lebanon, in the process separating from his wife, Sarah, after a 31-year-long marriage.
* '''Sarah Hamoudi''' ([[Sheila McCarthy]])&amp;nbsp;– A former [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], Sarah converted to Islam when she married Yasir. Like her husband, she struggles with Muslim customs and regulations and is often shown up by their more pious daughter, Rayyan. She wears the [[hijab]] when attending services at the mosque, but not day-to-day.  After her divorce from Yasir, she returned to her original name Sarah Cunningham at the insistence of Ann Popowicz.  Ann wanted Sarah to have "Danger" as her new middle name but it ended up being Dangler.  After Sarah's divorce, Baber and Rev. Thorne begin competing for her soul or which religion she may become part of.  Sarah was revealed to also lack a wild side and her memories of a wild past were actually her living through her friend Ann Popowicz.  Sarah does try to let herself go wild when she kisses a stranger named Lou and gets into a bar fight with his girlfriend Svetlana. She later goes through a spiritual crisis, leaving Islam to return to the Anglican church but eventually finds she does indeed want to be Muslim and so renews her [[shahadah]].
* '''Rayyan Hamoudi''' ([[Sitara Hewitt]])&amp;nbsp;– Yasir and Sarah's daughter, a doctor. She follows [[Islamic feminism]], keeps the [[sartorial hijab]], and takes her religion very seriously. Her [[Western medicine|Western medical treatments]] are met with disapproval by Fatima, who uses traditional Nigerian remedies. She is occasionally foiled by her own ambition; in one episode, she insists on being named as the mosque's representative to the local Interfaith Council as her price for letting go of an argument with Amaar, only to discover at her first meeting that the council is really little more than an interfaith bake sale committee. Rayyan has long had feelings for Amaar and they are currently married.  Rayyan pushed her mother to join a divorce group but later on has discovered her own insecurities regarding her marriage.  Her fear is that her parents' divorce may lead to problems between her and Amaar.  In this fear, she gives up her habits of drinking milk out of the carton and forcing Amaar to place the dishes a certain way in the dishwaster.
* '''Baber Siddiqui''' ([[Manoj Sood]])&amp;nbsp;– A divorced college economics professor and the most [[conservative]] member of the Muslim community in Mercy, he acted as the imam prior to Amaar's arrival in the pilot episode; when Amaar briefly quits his job in Season 3, Baber again takes over as imam, and proves to be one of the reasons the community is so determined to get Amaar back. His conservatism often conflicts with the wishes of his teenage daughter Layla, although he loves her dearly (in fact the main reason he has custody of her is that when his ex-wife came to visit him after he moved to Mercy she saw that the only thing he had bothered to unpack was his daughter's picture on the wall). He wears a [[Taqiyah (cap)|taqiyah]] and a [[shalwar kameez]] and constantly rants and raves and complains about everything, to the point that most of his acquaintances consider him obnoxious. He once falsely claimed that he was on the American [[no-fly list]] to cover up his own fear of flying, resulting in Rayyan and Amaar taking him to the American consulate in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] three separate times to help him clear his name. He calls most non-Muslims "[[imbecile]]s" and "[[infidel]]s", although it is rather obvious that he is not any sort of dangerous [[religious fanaticism|fanatic]] but just a harmless crank. In the episode ''"The Letter"'', Baber takes an interest in a female motivational speaker (played by [[Andrea Martin]]) who is stranded in Mercy, who in turn becomes interested in him. Everything goes well until Baber utters some [[anti-Semitic]] remarks.  The motivational speaker takes offense, and reveals to Baber that she is [[Jewish]]. Baber comes to Amaar for guidance. Amaar reminds him that anti-Semitism is not tolerated in the Muslim faith.  Baber also falls for Thorne's ploy of taking over as Imam which led to Amaar being removed as Imam.  His bringing in the overzealous Rahaloon resulted in the mosque being removed from the church.  Later Amaar made amends with Baber when he was reinstated as Imam.  Baber performed Amaar and Rayyan's wedding and they left for their honeymoon.  Upon their return it is revealed that Baber is the current Imam and is good friends with Reverend Thorne.
* '''Fatima Dinssa''' ([[Arlene Duncan]])&amp;nbsp;– A conservative Nigerian immigrant and the widowed owner of a cafe/diner. She is spirited and enjoys engaging in verbal sparring matches, frequently with Fred Tupper, the local bigot and radio "shock jock" who has a crush on her. She hates the Mercy Diner, her competition. She has a son, Jamal ([[Demetrius Joyette]]), who hates being forced to play [[oware|ayo]] by his mother. She officially becomes a Canadian citizen during the show's run. Her culinary expertise is recognized by all the residents of Mercy, Muslim and non-Muslim alike. More often than not, this is used to underline just how much good food can create a bridge over cultural barriers.
* '''Rev. Duncan Magee''' ([[Derek McGrath]])&amp;nbsp;– The priest of the Anglican Church which also houses the mosque, he is a good friend to Amaar and the two clerics often turn to each other for advice. He is [[Liberalism|liberal]], once offering to perform a [[gay marriage]] at the church, and is willing to stand up to the church hierarchy when he believes that it is acting inconsistently with the true message of [[Christianity]]. He often laments the sad state of his own church and congregation. His character unfortunately departs the show after season three, to be replaced by the ambitious, younger and distinctly less accommodating '''Rev. William Thorne'''. In seasons 1-3, it is gradually revealed that he has a number of hobbies (including curling, running and painting), all taken very seriously. His presence on the show illustrates the commonalities between Islamic and Anglican faiths and the similar problems the priests of each faith must face.
* '''Mayor Ann Popowicz''' ([[Debra McGrath]])&amp;nbsp;– Mayor of Mercy, she supports the Muslim community in return for their votes. She is primarily concerned with maximizing the perks of her office and minimizing the amount of work that she actually has to do. She has a bit of a wild streak, having been known to date members of the [[Hells Angels]] and has more skeletons in her closet than the local cemetery. She is witty, blunt and a bit of a lush, but leans greatly upon Sarah, her PR person, when she missteps.
* '''Fred Tupper''' ([[Neil Crone]])&amp;nbsp;– The local loudmouth and the host of a talk show on the local radio station, he often [[Islamic terrorism|equates Muslims to terrorists]] who want to take over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward position of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments have more to do with habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.
* '''Layla Siddiqui''' ([[Aliza Vellani]])&amp;nbsp;– Baber's daughter and a portrait of an average teenage Muslim girl struggling to find the right balance between her desire to be a good Muslim and her desire for the lifestyle of a regular Canadian teenager who's into music, clothes and boys. She can be rebellious and sarcastic, especially at her father's foibles (she refers to their home as "Baberistan"), but is also very perceptive and insightful.
* '''Junaid Jaffer''', also known as J.J. ([[Stephen Lobo]])&amp;nbsp;– Son of Yasir's friend Karim and fiancé of Rayyan through seasons 2-3. Former geeky childhood playmate turned urbane, handsome and wealthy engineer he can be indecisive and eventually jilts Rayyan at the altar.
* '''Joe Peterson''' ([[Boyd Banks]])&amp;nbsp;– A local farmer and a perpetually trouble-making sidekick of Fred Tupper. Basically a stereotypical [[hoser]], he mostly trades cheap insults with Fred and occasionally causes mayhem by going for a joyride on his tractor.  He is mainly a comic relief character, appearing in almost every episode, without a driving role in the plot. Despite this, he is used challenge the viewers' assumptions since he is revealed to be surprisingly well read. In fact, to their mutual surprise, he and Baber have found themselves agreeing on things more often than they expect, developing a friendship only occasionally hampered by cultural differences. He even finds common ground with Sarah, having read and loved the novel she chose for book club.
* '''Nate Shore''' (Jeff White) &amp;nbsp;– Editor and reporter for the local newspaper. He has a very Zen attitude to his job as the main news source of a tiny, tiny town. He is a good friend of Amaar, despite Amaar's occasional exasperation at his freewheeling personality.
* '''Reverend William Thorne''' ([[Brandon Firla]]) — Rev. Magee's replacement, feels it is his religious duty to compete with Amaar for the souls of the residents of Mercy. At first, he uses Amaar's forgiving nature to build his congregation and eventually kicks the mosque out, but brings them back because the Archdeacon likes having a mosque in the church to show cultural diversity. It is revealed he feels a great shame over being adopted and dislikes his older brother. Thorne eventually takes Amaar's help in becoming a better person and begins trying to convince Amaar to be his friend. He is jealous of Rev. Magee when he returns to be Amaar's best man because Amaar clearly prefers the old reverend. Thorne shows some weakness when it is revealed that he has a crush on Rose, the town librarian, but is too shy to ask her out. With the help of Rayyan and Amaar, the two begin dating.

==Production==
Although the show is set in Saskatchewan, the actual production is split between Saskatchewan and Ontario.  Episodes 1 and 2 were filmed in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], but the rest of season one was filmed in the [[Toronto]] area. [[Indian Head, Saskatchewan|Indian Head]], where a set has been built for the exterior of the mosque, doubles for the show's exteriors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/arts_life/story.html?id=d6187121-e53a-471b-b857-2016c4de698e Little Mosque' now calls Indian Head home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114181101/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/arts_life/story.html?id=d6187121-e53a-471b-b857-2016c4de698e |date=January 14, 2010 }}.

The Novia Cafe, the front of which is used in the show as a stand-in for Fatima's, was located in Regina. It closed in the early summer of 2011.

Actors Zaib Shaikh&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; and Aliza Vellani are Muslims. Sitara Hewitt (Rayyan) is also of partial Pakistani Muslim descent, but was raised Christian as both of her parents are Anglican Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egothemag.com/?p=311 EGO Magazine: Sitara Hewitt] [[EGO Magazine]]. October 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   Manoj Sood (Baber) is a [[Hindu]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]].

Zarqa Nawaz based much of the show on her personal experiences. Many of the characters are partially inspired by her family and friends. The episode "The Barrier" is based on a true happening at Nawaz's mosque when incoming conservative Muslims pressured the imam to put up a barrier separating men and women. The pilot episode also contained a satire of [[Maher Arar]]'s 2002 detainment.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6882876 Zarqa Nawaz on 'Little Mosque'] (Interview, MP3, Flash). ''Fresh Air''; [[NPR]]. January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "The Archdeacon Cometh", the archdeacon mentions having to "shut down a church in [[Dog River, Saskatchewan|Dog River]]", referencing Canadian sitcom ''[[Corner Gas]]'' on rival network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]. Carlo Rota and Sheila McCarthy, in character as Yasir and Sarah, also later appeared in a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with Brent ([[Brent Butt]]) and Hank ([[Fred Ewanuick]]) from ''Corner Gas'' on the sketch comedy series ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', debating the location of Mercy and Dog River (both fictional towns) in relation to each other after Yasir and Sarah bought the gas station and fired Brent.

Guest actors who have appeared on the show include [[Colin Mochrie]], [[Dan Redican]], [[Samantha Bee]], [[Dave Foley]], [[Maria Vacratsis]], [[Sam Kalilieh]], [[Peter Wildman]], [[Sugith Varughese]], [[Hrant Alianak]], Veena Sood, [[Kathryn Winslow]], [[Jayne Eastwood]], [[Patrick McKenna]] and [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]], as well as hockey player [[Darcy Tucker]], curler [[Glenn Howard]], and sportscaster [[Ron MacLean]].

[[Faisal Kutty]], a Toronto-based lawyer, academic and writer served as the first Islamic culture and practice content consultant for the show. He was responsible to provide advice and feedback on accuracy in terms of the portrayal of Islamic norms and practices. He also provided input to producers and writers.

==Themes==
While the show does derive some of its humour from exploring the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of [[Conservatism|conservative]] Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal interpretations of Islam]] (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is the simple fact of being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not to be a political platform. She has also stated that she views comedy as one of the most valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.

This is represented by the show's promotional tagline, "Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States because he says he was wrongly placed on a [[no-fly list]] (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who can see her is [[gay]], whether Muslims can [[curling|curl]], whether to [[Bargaining|haggle]] with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's head scarf is enough to mitigate a bad hair day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=cbd753f6-38e8-4ff7-85bc-83f7bc17b609 "Season finale on ''Mosque''"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411234243/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=cbd753f6-38e8-4ff7-85bc-83f7bc17b609 |date=April 11, 2008 }}, [[CanWest News Service]], March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also sidesteps issues of [[stereotyping]] by having characters in both the Muslim and non-Muslim communities who cross the entire spectrum of political opinion. Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't care what anybody's religious beliefs are as long as they vote for her on election day.

Hewitt's character of Rayyan Hamoudi, in particular, has been singled out in the media as a strong and unique role model for young Muslim women—both for her ability to reconcile a commitment to her Muslim faith with a modern, [[feminist]]-inspired Western lifestyle and career,&lt;ref&gt;[http://winnipegsun.com/Entertainment/Television/2008/03/05/pf-4909976.html "The rights stuff: Sitara Hewitt resurrects women's-lib issues as ''Little Mosque''{{'}}s Dr. Rayyan Hamoudi"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[canoe.ca]], March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and as a fashion icon who dresses in clothes that are religiously appropriate yet stylish, professional and contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hijabchique.blogspot.com/ Hijab Chique], a Muslim fashion blog which frequently uses Rayyan's wardrobe as inspiration.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Little Mosque DVD.jpg|thumb|250px|The cover art for the first season DVD.]]
The series logo used for the cover art of the DVD releases does not use the mosque imagery of the televised version, thus rendering it similar to that used by ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' except for the use of the word "Mosque" instead of "House".

==Reception==
Unusual for a Canadian television series, ''Little Mosque'' received extensive advance publicity in international media, with stories appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/arts/television/07mosq.html?ex=1323147600&amp;en=d22f5b36a36e920d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss/  | publisher=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=2007-01-07 | title=Sitcom's Precarious Premise: Being Muslim Over Here | first=Neil | last=McFarquhar | date=2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Washington Times]]'' and the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', as well as on [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0612/12/gb.01.html |  publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=2007-01-07 | title= Glenn Beck (interview with series creator Zarqa Nawaz) | date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6591623 NPR : CBC to Tell the Story of ''Little Mosque on the Prairie'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6244199.stm BBC website: "Muslim sitcom debuts in Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered on January 9, 2007, at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. The pilot then reaired on January 15 in the show's regular timeslot, and the series subsequently aired Mondays at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (all times half an hour later [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|in Newfoundland]]).

It was, in fact, the largest audience the CBC had achieved in a decade for an entertainment program. By comparison, ''[[Corner Gas]]'', one of the highest-rated Canadian TV shows, attracts just under one and a half million viewers for a typical episode. The second episode, airing against the second night of the much-anticipated season premiere of ''[[American Idol]]'' in most markets, had 1.2 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/media/070118/X011808AU.html CBC's 'Little Mosque' viewership drops off from hyped debut, but still respectable], Canadian Press via CBC.ca, January 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a sharp drop but still a high rating for a Canadian sitcom, and very high for [[CBC Television]], which has had trouble garnering large audiences for its scripted programming in recent years.

At the end of the show's season on March 7, 2007, the show attracted 1.1 million viewers, or an average of 1.2 million for the season. CBC Television renewed the show for a second season consisting of 20 episodes, which began airing on October 3, 2007, and continued to attract an average of one million viewers per episode.

CBC renewed the show for a third season on March 7, 2008. Season three premiered on CBC Television October 1, 2008.

===Critical reception===
Canadian writer and producer [[Ken Finkleman]] (best known for his CBC series ''[[The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)|The Newsroom]]'') criticized the show's sunny outlook. "There’s deep confusion and racism about the place of Islam in the Western world and it’s the thing that’s broiling up under everything in the world, and the show presents this world where everything is happy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=EyeWeekly |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/interview/article/111341 |author=Finkleman, Ken |title=Review: ''Little Mosque'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710214457/http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/interview/article/111341 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: "'Mosque' was conceived in the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005 Danish Muhammad cartoon crisis]] by producer Mary Darling, her husband, Clark Donnelly, and writer [[Zarqa Nawaz]] when they met at the [[Banff Television Festival]]. The basic premise was: What would it look like if a Muslim born and raised in Canada became an imam?"&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

In regards to the program's initially not being shown in the United States, the ''Los Angeles Times'' said: "The genius of 'Mosque' is that the characters resonate with viewers all over the world. The show is broadcast in 83 countries, including the [[United Arab Emirates]] and Turkey; the format was sold to [[20th Century Fox]] in 2008 for a U.S. remake but nothing came of it. Nawaz's explanation: 'We didn't have [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], and we have a public broadcaster. 9/11 affected the [[Americans|American]] [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] in a major way, and you have to be sensitive to that.'"&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Cultural Exchange: The world cottons to 'Little Mosque on the Prairie'.

'''Martin Crosbie''' (7 April 1911 – 10 February 1982) was an Irish [[tenor]] and older brother to [[Paddy Crosbie]] of ''The School Around the Corner''. Martin, who was affectionately known as "The Miller's daughter", a song he made his own, started in show business in his early 1930s.

==Life==
The eldest in a family of four, he was christened John Martin but was known as Mossy to his family and friends. His mother and father came from Wexford town. His father, Martin, was a foreman-fitter and turner on the Permanent way, that is the tracks section, of the old Dublin United Tramways. Before coming to Dublin, his father had earned quite a reputation in his native town, both as a singer and comedian. He won the Wexford Feis gold medal in 1904 in the tenor competition. Martin's paternal grandmother was reputed to have had a three-octave voice, and sang in Bride Street Church (Church of the Assumption), Wexford. Before his singing career began, he worked as a fitter/mechanic in CIE's Summerhill depot.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Press'', 11 February 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One night in the late 1930's himself and the legendary Billy Morton went to a show in the Olympia. In the bar during the interval Billy and other friends talked him into singing a song. One song led to another and soon there were more people in the bar than in the audience. The manager came in and said if he could keep an audience away from the show he should be able to keep them in their seats the following week. That's how he joined Lorcan Bourke Productions. Martin caused a bit of stir the next Monday night when he cycled to the Olympia, walked through the stage door, hung up his bicycle clips, and went straight out on stage to sing. I didn't know anything then about using dressing-rooms and make-up he had laughed."&lt;ref&gt;Interview Sunday Paper 1981 journalist William Rocke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His CIE supervisor recognised a genuine talent and gave him a couple of months leave of absence, and pretty soon Martin was a star of variety at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Royal]] and the [[Capitol Theatre (Dublin)|Capitol]] where the "Miller's Daughter" legend was born in 1942.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

It was when he was playing in [[Belfast]] with Harry Bailey that he met [[Thelma Ramsey]], who would become his wife. When he came back to the Royal in Dublin, Thelma was the accompanist. They toured with some of showbiz's big names, including famous comic [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]]. They missed out on playing the London Palladium with Max as he was allowed to bring only one other act. A halfpenny was tossed and they lost. "Imagine losing the Palladium with a halfpenny… wouldn't have minded had it been half-a-crown!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Press'', February 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular in the Clontarf Castle Cabaret from 1964, he continued to perform six nights a week even when his health started to fail him in the early 1980s. In 1979, he received the Variety Artists' Trust Society award for his contribution to Irish show-business.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Press'', 11 February 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; He made numerous Television appearances, some of which still survive on R.T.E. and Ulster Television etc. He was a member of Equity and appeared in small parts in most of the Films made in Ireland at that time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3368">The '''Palestinian terminology guide''' is the book '''''Terminology in Media, Culture and Politics''''', an instructional book released by the [[Palestinian Authority]] Ministry of Information advising terminology to be used when describing the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. The guide aims to replace "the Israeli and American dissemination of poisoned terms" with [[neologism|new phrases]] and [[euphemism]]s.

The book's introduction states that this collection of terms can be an "important addition to our ongoing struggle, since the beginning of the previous century, to chase away the occupation and the establishment of our independent Palestinian state."&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/06/19/say-this-not-that-palestinian-guide-suggests-martyrdom-seeking-operator-not-suicide-bomber/ |title=Say this, not that: Palestinian guide suggests ‘martyrdom-seeking operator,’ not ‘suicide bomber’ |publisher=The Daily Caller |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&amp;doc_id=6855 |title=Official PA terminology guide: Instead of "terror" say "resistance" |publisher=Palestinian Media Watch |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advised replacement terms==
According to a translation performed by [[Palestinian Media Watch]], the manual states that one should replace the term "Israel",  which lends legitimacy to its existence and instead use terms like "Israeli colonialism" or "the Israeli colonialist occupation." The manual also advises other substitutions; "resistance" replaces the term "terror" and "legitimate resistance" replaces "Palestinian violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2012/June/PA-Publishes-Official-Terminology-Guide/ |title=P.A.

The [[Palestinian Media Watch]] stated that the book demonstrated the Palestinian Authority’s denial of Israel’s right to exist and criticised the glorification of the murder of Israeli and Jewish civilians as "resistance".&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=274501 |title='Israel' removed from PA guide to proper terms |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMW" /&gt;

'''Peter Chermayeff LLC'''  is a [[Massachusetts]]-based architectural firm which specializes in aquarium architecture and exhibit design, from conceptual planning to the details of final realization.

==History==
The two principals, Peter Chermayeff, and Bobby C. Poole have collaborated on the design of public aquariums since 1975. Their long collaboration, with focus on the design of public aquariums, began in 1975 when Bobby Poole joined [[Cambridge Seven Associates]], where Peter Chermayeff was a founding principal together with Paul Dietrich, Terry Rankine, Louis Bakanowsky, Alden Christie, [[Ivan Chermayeff]], and [[Tom Geismar]]. The first project for the seven founding principals was the [[New England Aquarium]], of which Peter Chermayeff was the principal in charge. It opened in 1969.

The first thirty six years of design work at [[Cambridge Seven Associates]], in much of which Peter Chermayeff played a leading role, included the modernization of the [[Boston Transportation]] system, the [[MBTA]], now known as the T, the United States Pavilion and Exhibition at [[Expo '67]], the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], the [[San Antonio Museum of Art]], [[Charles Square]], a hotel, retail, housing and office complex in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], “Where’s Boston?”, a mixed media celebration and portrait of Boston for the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. Bicentennial]], the [[Osaka Aquarium]], the [[Tennessee Aquarium]] in Chattanooga, the [[Aquarium of Genoa]]. These and other projects led to [[Cambridge Seven Associates|C7A]] receiving the Architecture Firm of the Year award in 1993 from the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]].

Bobby Poole joined [[Cambridge Seven Associates|C7A]] in 1976 to work with Peter Chermayeff on the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]]. Poole became the Aquarium’s Project Architect. He led the preparation of final design documents, the on-site overview of construction and installation, and became a principal in 1986. He further developed his interest in aquariums working with Peter Chermayeff on the [[Osaka Aquarium]], the [[Tennessee Aquarium]], the [[Aquarium of Genoa]], the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], and the [[Alaska SeaLife Center]] in [[Seward, Alaska]]. They also collaborated on unbuilt aquariums and rainforest pavilions proposed by Chermayeff while at [[Cambridge Seven Associates|C7A]] for [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]], for [[Hamburg]], [[Bremerhaven]] and [[Oberhausen]] in [[Germany]], and for Tsuruhama, Osaka, in Japan.

Peter Chermayeff and Bobby Poole continued their close collaboration until 2005 with Peter Sollogub under the firm name Chermayeff, Sollogub and Poole, Inc., until 2009 under the firm name Chermayeff &amp; Poole, Inc., and since that year as Peter Chermayeff LLC. Recent completed projects have included the expansion of the [[National Aquarium (Baltimore)|National Aquarium]] in [[Baltimore]], and the expansion of the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, both of which opened in 2005. Expansion of the Museo Nivola in [[Orani, Sardinia]], a second component of a museum dedicated to the sculptor [[Costantino Nivola]], was completed in 2005. The remodeling and expansion of the [[Virginia Aquarium]] at [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], was completed in 2009. Recent unbuilt projects have included a proposed Aquarium and Environmental Center for [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], the New Songdo Ecotarium in [[Incheon]], near [[Seoul|Seoul, South Korea]], and the proposed remodeling and expansion of [[Nausicaä Centre National de la Mer|Nausicaa Centre Nationale de la Mer]] in [[Boulogne Sur Mer|Boulogne Sur Mer, France]]. A current proposed Aquarium is the core attraction within the proposed Parco del Mare in [[Trieste|Trieste, Italy]].

{{Infobox company |name= Samuel French, Inc.|type=private|foundation = 1830| location = [[New York City]] |  homepage  = [http://www.samuelfrench.com Main site]
}}
'''Samuel French, Inc.''' is an American company, founded by [[Samuel French]] and [[Thomas Hailes Lacy]], who formed a partnership to combine their existing interests in [[London]] and [[New York City]]. It publishes [[Play (theatre)|plays]], represents [[author]]s, and sells scripts from their Los Angeles, UK, and online bookstores.

The firm has offices in New York City; London; and [[Hollywood, California]].

The company's London subsidiary, [[Samuel French Ltd.]], publishes [[stage play]]s for the UK market, mostly acting editions, serves as licensing agent for performance rights, and runs a theatrical bookshop on its premises at [[Fitzrovia]] in central London, England.

==History==
[[File:His Majesty Bunker Bean, a comedy in four acts and five scenes (1922) (14584292880).jpg|thumb|Samuel French, Inc. library edition of ''[[His Majesty, Bunker Bean]].'']]

Samuel French was born in Massachusetts shortly after the turn of the 19th century and began publishing ''French’s American Drama'' in the mid 1800s in New York. It soon became the most widely distributed catalogue of dramatic prose in the US. French soon acquired a London dramatic publishing company founded by Thomas Hailes Lacey, and continued to expand his business on both sides of the Atlantic - Samuel French managing the London business while his son, Thomas Henry, took control of the New York operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Entertainment Industry: A Reference Handbook| first=Michael John| last=Haupert| url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DG36ylheWgQC&amp;pg=PA226| page=226| publisher=ABC-CLIO| date=August 17, 2012| isbn= 978-1598845945| accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, Samuel French began publishing contemporary American dramas, and helped the amateur theatre movement by making more plays available to “Little Theatres” – a rewarding concept that had never before been done in the industry. By the turn of the century, amateur interest in acting had increased enormously. As the quality and quantity of available plays improved, so the number of amateur groups increased. The seeds of the Little Theatre movement were sown. By the time of the [[World War I]], such groups along with the High School societies were the firm’s best customers. Although father and son had long since died, the New York and London entities continued under the capable hands of their managing partners.  

From the mid 1940s to the early 1990s, the company witnessed much growth in its catalogue and business. During this time, the Stock companies, including the League of Regional Theatres were flourishing; so too were the Little Theatres, and the development of the Dinner Theatre, which was proving increasingly popular. Since the mid 1990s, the Samuel French catalogue has grown substantially with a focus on emerging playwrights carefully balanced by additional acquisitions of the most prominent American and British playwrights such as Neil Simon, Tom Stoppard, Edward Albee, August Wilson and David Mamet to name but a few.

==Key executives==

*Bruce Lazarus, Executive Director

==Breaking Character==
Samuel French publishes an online magazine entitled ''Breaking Character.'' On the site, staff members and guest authors contribute to writing various articles related to the world of theatre. Some topics include new publications, title spotlights, musical moments, staff picks, and playwright profiles. The magazine also allows for interaction with the public.

==Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival==

Samuel French’s annual Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival (commonly referred to as OOB) takes place every summer in New York City. Thousands of playwrights from around the world submit their short plays for consideration, but only 30 are chosen to participate.&lt;ref name="bw2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival Announces Six Winning Plays|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/off-off-broadway/article/2016-Off-Off-Broadway-Short-Play-Festival-Announces-Six-Winning-Plays-20160815#|website=Broadway World|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival takes place over a week, with 4-8 plays being presented per night.&lt;ref name="Mnt2017"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Sentenac| first1=Hannah| title=NYC Theatre Festival to Feature Miami Playwright, Director, and Actors| url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/nyc-theatre-festival-to-feature-miami-playwright-director-and-actors-7801091| work=[[Miami New Times]]| accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finalists are narrowed down and eventually six are chosen as the winners. Winners are presented with publication and licensing rights and have their show published in a collection of winners from that year. The festival has resulted in the publishing of nearly 200 plays since its inception in 1975 and has launched the careers of many playwrights including [[Sheila Callaghan]], [[Theresa Rebeck]] and [[Saviana Stanescu]]. As of 2017 the festival is in its 42nd year.&lt;ref name="Oob2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=40 Years of Short Plays| url=http://www.oobfestival.com/?page_id=15280| website=OOB Festival| year=2007| accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spiel des Jahres''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpiːl dəs ˈjaːʁəs|lang}}, ''Game of the Year'') is an award for [[board game|board]] and [[card game]]s, created in 1978 with the stated purpose of rewarding excellence in game design, and promoting top-quality games in the German market.&lt;ref name="werneck1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award is one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of [[Germany]].  A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500–3000 copies to around 10,000; and the winner can usually expect to sell 300,000 to 500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Tepper cited in {{cite book|author=Stewart Woods|title=Eurogames: The Design, Culture and Play of Modern European Board Games|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9065-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award criteria==
The award is given by a jury of German-speaking [[board game]] critics (from Germany, Austria, Switzerland),&lt;ref name="werneck1" /&gt; who review games released in [[Germany]] in the preceding twelve months. The games considered for the award are [[German-style board games|family-style]] games. [[Wargaming|War games]], [[role-playing games]], collectible [[card games]], and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award.  Since 1989, there has been a separate award for [[children's games]].

On occasion, the jury has awarded a special prize for more complex games, such as [[Agricola (board game)|Agricola]] in 2008 or [[World Without End (board game)|World Without End]] in 2010.  Prior to 2011, this award was an exceptional award, not necessarily awarded annually.  In 2011, however, this practice was formalized when the jury created a new category for more complex games entitled "Kennerspiel des Jahres" (roughly "[[Connoisseur]]-[[Enthusiast]] Game of the Year"). Along with the nominations, the jury also gives a list of recommended games, and occasionally gives out special prizes for games which will not be considered for the main award.

The criteria on which a game is evaluated are,:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=123&amp;changelang=4|title=Spiel des Jahres e.V. -|author=|date=|website=www.spiel-des-jahres.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tai''' (born November 4, 1968) is an [[Asian elephant]] best known for playing Bo Tat in the film ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'' (1995), Vera in ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' (1996) and Rosie in ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011). Tai is owned by ''Have Trunk Will Travel, Inc.'', a privately funded organization that generates income through elephant rides, shows and events, as well as film and commercial appearances.

==Career==
Tai's first film appearance was a minor role in ''[[The Jungle Book (1994 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1994), where she scares off some [[poachers]]. Tai followed this up playing the major role of Bo Tat in ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref name=dumbo/&gt;&lt;ref name=abuse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/water-elephants-elephant-was-abused-186634 |title='Water for Elephants' Elephant Was Abused in 2005, Says Animal Rights Group |date=May 9, 2011 |work=hollywoodreporter.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Humane Association]] rated the treatment of animals in the film as acceptable.&lt;ref name=dumbo/&gt; The scene in which Tai is sedated she is actually just obeying her trainers instructions to lie down. The sounds of her snoring in the film is not actually coming from Tai, but was dubbed in during [[post-production]]. All scenes that show Tai in danger were carefully staged, and the boat in which she travels in the film was pre-tested to make sure it would support her 8,000 pound (3600 kg) weight. To ensure she remained healthy, all of Tai's food, drinking water, and even  her bathing water, was shipped from the U.S. to [[Thailand]], where filming was taking place.&lt;ref name=dumbo/&gt;

Tai played the major role of Vera in the 1996 comedy ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' alongside [[Bill Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961101/REVIEWS/611010303/1023 |title=Larger Than Life |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |date=November 1, 1996 |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05EEDC1139F932A35752C1A960958260 |title=Larger Than Life (1996) |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |date=November 1, 1996 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/larger.html |title=Larger Than Life |last1=Berardinelli |first1=James |year=1996 |work=reelviews.net |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a minor role in ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]''  in 1997, where she can be seen being ridden by [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Leslie Mann]], and again with Brendan Fraser in Tweety Bird's jungle in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' in 2002.

Tai's performance in ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' in 2011 was praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137097 |title=Water For Elephants |last1=Errigo |first1=Angie |date= |work=[[Empire (film magazine)]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time Tai, [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] had all worked on the same film, as all three had been filmed in ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 2004, though Pattinson's part was edited out of the final cut.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/photos/five-film-facts-water-for-elephants-slideshow-3377/five-film-facts-water-elephants-titlecard-58634.html |title=Five Film Facts: 'Water for Elephants' |date= |work=[[Yahoo!

One of Tai's paintings as well as an autographed poster for ''Water for Elephants'' was auctioned off on [[eBay]] to raise awareness of [[elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus]].&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; The money Tai raised from the auction was given to the [http://www.elephantconservation.org International Elephant Foundation] (IEF) which distributed it to the appropriate labs and research facilities actively working to find a cure for EEHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elephantconservation.org/2012-elephant-conservation-and-research-funding-support/ |title=2012 Elephant Conservation and Research Funding Support |date= |work=elephantconservation.org |publisher= |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2008 Tai, along with Kitty, another elephant owned by ''Have Trunk Will Travel'', appeared in [[Britney Spears]] music video ''[[Circus (song)|Circus]]''. Animal rights organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) issued a press release condemning Spears for using "cruelly trained lions and elephants". ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded, saying, "A representative [from the [[American Humane Association]]] was on the set of the Britney Spears 'Circus' video with our elephants, Tai and Kitty, to ensure their safety and welfare [...] Britney, the director, producers and the entire crew were respectful of the elephants' needs and comfort and a pleasure to work with."&lt;ref name=mtvpeta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1600992/20081209/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Circus' Video Taken To Task By PETA, But Trainers Insist Animals Were Treated Well|date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2013|last=Montgomery|first=James|work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Tai appeared in the [[Banksy]] film ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'' as part of his 2006 ''Barely Legal'' art show for which she was painted pink and gold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5344676.stm |title='Guerrilla artist' Banksy hits LA |last1=Bowes |first1=Peter |date=September 14, 2006 |work=[[BBC]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with non-toxic paint. PETA called the display animal cruelty.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

===Water for Elephants===
In the film ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' the elephant Rosie, who Tai portrays, is severely abused. A spokesperson from the AHA assured people that all scenes of abuse in the film were the work of special effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and that the moaning and crying sounds that Tai is seen making on film were audio tracks, and were not actually made by Tai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42721808/ns/today-entertainment/t/was-elephants-pachyderm-treated-humanely-set/#.UOo5WaUZ4dI |title=Was 'Elephant's' pachyderm treated humanely on set? |date=April 22, 2011 |work=[[MSNBC]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy erupted, however, regarding concerns Tai was mistreated prior to filming.&lt;ref name=abuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=daily/&gt; A video released by the [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1384426/Water-Elephants-star-electrocuted-beaten-hooks-Shocking-new-video-shows-mistreatment.html |title=Given electric shocks and beaten with hooks: Shocking new video shows mistreatment of Water For Elephants star Tai |date=May 10, 2011 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ad-international.org/animals_in_entertainment/go.php?id=2119&amp;ssi=7 |title=Movie Star Electric Shocked |date=May 7, 2011 |work=[[Animal Defenders International|ADI]] |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded to the video stating, "The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants. If there was truly any abuse going on why wait six minutes, much less six years?" and added "None of the footage being shown was taken during Tai's training for Water for Elephants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/10/water-for-elephants-abuse-claims |title=Elephant trainers accused of abusing animal star of Water for Elephants |last1=Griffiths |first1=Ian J |date=May 10, 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zookeeper===
When the 2011 film ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'' was released, PETA protested against alleged animal cruelty in the film's production.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/09/zookeeper-premiere-picket-peta_n_893996.html |title='Zookeeper' Premiere Picketed By PETA, Critiqued By Film Critics |date=July 10, 2011 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=denied&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/07/07/zookeeper-peta-protests/ |title=PETA protests at 'Zookeeper' premiere.

'''The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society''' (ACMS) is a British comedy night, where comedians are invited to perform sets that might not work at more mainstream comedy nights. It was founded by [[John-Luke Roberts (comedian)|John-Luke Roberts]] and [[Thom Tuck]] at the New Red Lion Theatre&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120110052848/http://www.redliontheatres.co.uk/alternative-comedy-memorial-society.htm New Red Lion] &lt;/ref&gt; in [[Islington]], London, though since Summer 2012 it has usually been held at the [[Soho Theatre]]. It has been running since March 2011, usually on Monday evenings.

==The show==
{{unreferencedsection|date=January 2017}}
The show is curated and hosted by [[John-Luke Roberts]] and [[Thom Tuck]]. There are a group of regular comedians, referred to as "The Board", including [[William Andrews (comedian)|William Andrews]], Steve Pretty, [[Tom Bell (comedian)|Tom Bell]], [[Bridget Christie]], [[Alexis Dubus]], [[Nadia Kamil]], [[Josie Long]], [[Sara Pascoe]], [[Isy Suttie]] and [[Ben Target]].{{cn|date=January 2017}} The ACMS has developed a number of in-jokes, such as a list of permitted heckles and a repeated call and response with the audience.

In December 2012, the "AXMS panto" debuted. This was loosely structured around a performance of [[Aladdin]], and played with many [[pantomime]] conventions.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

{{outdated section|date=January 2017}}
The show has been filmed as a series of Comedy Blaps for Channel 4.{{cn|date=January 2017}}{{when|date=January 2017}} Due for release in late 2013 the series is produced by [[Adrian Sturges]] and directed by [[Chris Shepherd]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}

{{nihongo|'''''Tokyo Afterschool Summoners'''''|東京放課後サモナーズ|Tōkyō Hōkago Samonāzu|Romusha lead=yes}}, known colloquially by the [[blend word]] {{nihongo|'''''Housamo'''''|放サモ}}, is a [[role-playing video game]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. It is developed by {{ill|Lifewonders, LLC){{!}}Lifewonders|ja|四畳半的生活}}, a [[mobile gaming]] company operated by the [[dōjin circle]] {{ill|Yojouhan-teki Seikatsu){{!}}Yojouhan-teki Seikatsu|ja|四畳半的生活}}.&lt;ref name="Circle" /&gt; It is noted as one of the first commercially-produced [[LGBT]] video games created in Japan,&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; and one of the first commercially-produced LGBT games to extensively utilize [[gay manga]] ("bara") artwork.&lt;ref name="Buzzap" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Tokyo Afterschool Summoners'' is a [[free-to-play]] card-based [[role-playing video game]] with [[turn-based]] battles. Each character card has a weapon type, as well as a elemental attribute that determines its strengths and weaknesses against other cards in [[rock–paper–scissors]]-style match-ups. Cards gain levels and abilities by accruing experience through battles; once a card reaches its level cap, special items must be used to uncap the card so it can gain more experience. The game utilizes an affinity system wherein [[Game_balance#Buff|buffs]] are applied when the cards of characters who have a relationship ("love", "like", "dislike", and "rival") are used in battle together. Cards are obtained through quests, or through the game's [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
The game was released on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for [[iOS]] on December 2nd, 2016, and on [[Google Play]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on December 16th, 2016. Partial support for the game in [[English language|English]], [[Traditional Chinese]], and [[Simplified Chinese]] was added in March 2018.&lt;ref name="2ndYear" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The protagonist awakens in a version of [[Tokyo]] where "transients" – supernatural beings from fantasy and mythology – live among humans. In this world, both humans and transients utilize mysterious artifacts to fight in duels; duelists organize into [[guild]]s, which fight for control of the 23 [[special wards of Tokyo]]. The player controls the protagonist as they form a guild of their own, gather companions, and attempt to uncover how they have arrived in this world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7972">'''Transnational cinema''' is a developing concept within [[film studies]] that encompasses a range of theories relating to the effects of [[globalization]] upon the cultural and economic aspects of film. It incorporates the debates and influences of [[postnationalism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[consumerism]] and [[Third cinema]],&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Dennison, S. &amp; Lim, S.H. (2006). Situating World Cinema as a Theoretical Problem. In Dennison, S &amp; Lim, S. H. (eds). 'Remapping World Cinema: Identity, Culture and Politics in Film'. (pp.1-15) London &amp; New York: Wallflower Press.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst many other topics.

Transnational cinema debates consider the development and subsequent effect of films, cinemas and directors which span national boundaries.

==Key debates==

A key argument of transnational cinema is the necessity for a redefinition, or even refutation, of the concept of a [[national cinema]]. National identity has been posited as an 'imaginary community' that in reality is formed of many separate and fragmented communities defined more by [[social class]], [[economic class]], sexuality, gender, [[generation]], religion, [[ethnicity]], political belief and fashion, than [[nationality]].&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Higson, A. (2006). The Limiting Imagination of National Cinema. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.15-26). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly transnational practices in film funding, production and distribution combined with the 'imagined community' thus provide the basis for an argued shift towards a greater use of transnational, rather than national, perspectives within [[film studies]].&lt;ref name="five"/&gt; Global communication through the internet has also resulted in changes within culture and has further resulted in film transcending perceived national boundaries.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Shefrin, E. (2006). Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Participatory Fandom: Mapping New Congruencies Between the Internet and Media Entertainment Culture. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.73-80). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The concept of transnational cinema is important because it will be able to change how films from different cultures are approached. Mostly the approach is Eurocentric and the field of studying cinema is full of biases. It is mainly about how western culture views eastern culture.

Defining transnational cinema must be done carefully. It should challenge and criticize [[Orientalism]] that is rooted in film studies. It should be also differentiated from world cinema, which marks cinemas from countries that are not Anglo-phone as "others" and bind them in one category without realizing that they each have unique culture and identity.

"In the study of films, a critical transnationalism does not ghettoize transnational film-making in interstitial and marginal spaces but rather interrogates how these film-making activities negotiate with the national on all levels – from cultural policy to financial sources, from the multiculturalism of difference to how it reconfigures the nation’s image of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Higbee, W. and Lim, S. H. (2010), ‘Concepts of transnational cinema: towards
a critical transnationalism in film studies’, Transnational Cinemas 1: 1,
pp. 7–21, doi: 10.1386/trac.1.1.7/1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing definition==

The broad scope of topics relating to Transnational cinema have raised some criticisms over its exact definition, as Mette Hjort notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(...) to date the discourse of cinematic transnationalism has been characterized less by competing theories and approaches than by a tendency to use the term ‘transnational’ as a largely self-evident qualifier requiring only minimal conceptual clarification.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Hjort, M. (Forthcoming, 2009). On the Plurality of Cinematic Transnationalism. In Newman, K &amp; Durovicova, N . (eds.) 'World Cinemas, Transnational Perspectives'. London: Routledge/American Film Institute Reader.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequently, Hjort, John Hess and Patricia R. Zimmermann,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Hess, J. &amp; Zimmermann, P. (2006). Transnational Documentaries: An Introduction. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.97-108). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others, have attempted to clearly define the utilisation and implementation of Transnational cinema theories. To assist the ongoing discussions, ''Transnational Cinemas'', the first Academic Journal dedicated to the ongoing debates, has been announced by Intellect for publication in 2010.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/hispanists/transnational-cinemas.pdf call for submissions on Durham University Hispanists Society page]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Treasures From American Film Archives''''' series of [[DVD]]s is produced by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] (NFPF), a nonprofit organization created by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1997. The NFPF publishes these DVD sets, with accompanying booklets and extensive commentary, to promote public access to the films preserved by the American archival community.

The NFPF’s inaugural DVD set — ''Treasures from American Film Archives'', issued in 2000 — was the first video anthology sampling the range of films preserved by American cultural institutions.  Featuring home movies, avant-garde films, documentaries, government films, cartoons, newsreels, political ads, and silent-era narratives saved by 18 archives from Alaska to West Virginia, the set presented 50 historically significant works that had never been available before on video. By providing these examples on video, the set helped popularize the idea of the [[orphan film]].  When the first edition went out of print in 2005, it was reissued as the ''Encore'' edition. 
 
Since 2000, the NFPF has issued five other box sets, each with a specific theme. ''More Treasures from American Archives, 1894-1931'' showcases the creative range of American motion pictures in their first four decades through examples preserved by the nation's leading silent-film archives. It was the first NFPF set to feature audio commentary.  ''Treasures III: Social Issues in American Film, 1900-1934'' looks at socially inflected films during the formative years cinema, when virtually no issue was too controversial for the big screen. ''Treasures IV: American Avant-Garde Film, 1947-1986'' is the first multi-artist survey of the [[Experimental film|avant-garde film]] movement in the years following World War II.  ''Treasures 5: The West, 1898-1938'' explores how the West was imagined and documented in early cinema. ''Lost and Found: American Treasures From the New Zealand Film Archive'' presents a sampling of repatriated American films previously existing only in foreign archives.

To date, six sets of DVDs present 227 films on 17 discs for a total run time of 3,059 minutes (51 hours). All NFPF-produced sets are [[dvd region code|region-free]] and playable around the world. These sets are:
*'''''Treasures from American Film Archives: 50 Preserved Films''''' (2000), 50 films on 4 discs.
*'''''More Treasures from American Film Archives, 1894-1931''''' (2004), 50 films on 3 discs.
*'''''Treasures III: Social Issues in American Film, 1900-1934''''' (2007), 48 films on 4 discs.
*'''''Treasures IV: American Avant-Garde Film, 1947-1986''''' (2008), 26 films on 2 discs.
*'''''Treasures 5: The West, 1898-1938''''' (2011), 40 films on 3 discs.
*'''''Lost and Found: American Treasures From the New Zealand Film Archive''''' (2013), 13 films on 1 disc.

Another box set was announced in 2011, intended for release in 2014: ''Treasures 6: Next Wave Avant-Garde'', with the following titles: ''[[Report (film)|Report]]'' by [[Bruce Conner]], ''Radio Adios'' by Henry Hills, ''Hi-Fi Cadets'' by [[Lewis Klahr]], ''A Visit to Indiana'' by Curt McDowell and Ted Davis, ''Plumb Line'' by [[Carolee Schneemann]] and ''11 thru 12'' by [[Andrea Callard]].
