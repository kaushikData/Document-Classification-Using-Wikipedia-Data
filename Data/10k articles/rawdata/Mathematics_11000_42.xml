The '''100 prisoners problem''' is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[problem]] in [[probability theory]] and [[combinatorics]]. In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive. The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and cannot communicate with other prisoners. At first glance, the situation appears hopeless, but a clever strategy offers the prisoners a realistic chance of survival. Danish computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen first proposed the problem in 2003.

== Problem ==

The 100 prisoners problem has different renditions in the literature. The following version is by [[Philippe Flajolet]] and [[Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|Robert Sedgewick]]:&lt;ref name="flajolet"&gt;{{citation|author=Philippe Flajolet, Robert Sedgewick|title=Analytic Combinatorics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy—but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?''

If every prisoner selects 50 drawers at [[Randomness|random]], the [[probability]] that a single prisoner finds his number is 50%. Therefore, the probability that all prisoners find their numbers is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the single probabilities, which is &lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000000008}}, a vanishingly small number. The situation appears hopeless.

== Solution ==

=== Strategy ===

Surprisingly, there is a strategy that provides a survival probability of more than 30%. The key to success is that the prisoners do not have to decide beforehand which drawers to open. Each prisoner can use the [[information]] gained from the contents of every drawer he already opened to help decide which one to open next. Another important observation is that this way the success of one prisoner is not [[Stochastic independence|independent]] of the success of the other prisoners, because they all depend on the way the numbers are distributed.&lt;ref name="curtin" /&gt;

To describe the strategy, not only the prisoners, but also the drawers are numbered from 1 to 100, for example row by row starting with the top left drawer. The strategy is now as follows:&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{citation|author=Richard P. Stanley|title=Algebraic Combinatorics: Walks, Trees, Tableaux, and More|publisher=Springer|year=2013|pages=187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Each prisoner first opens the drawer with his own number.
# If this drawer contains his number he is done and was successful.
# Otherwise, the drawer contains the number of another prisoner and he next opens the drawer with this number.
# The prisoner repeats steps 2 and 3 until he finds his own number or has opened 50 drawers.

By starting with his own number, the prisoner guarantees he is on a sequence of boxes eventually containing his number. The only question is whether this sequence is longer than 50 boxes.

=== Examples ===

The reason this is a promising strategy is illustrated with the following example using 8 prisoners and drawers, whereby each prisoner may open 4 drawers. The prison director has distributed the prisoners' numbers into the drawers in the following fashion:
:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! number of drawer
| &amp;nbsp;1 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 2 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp;
|-
! number of prisoner
| 7 || 4 || 6 || 8 || 1 || 3 || 5 || 2
|}

The prisoners now act as follows:
* Prisoner 1 first opens drawer 1 and finds number 7. Then he opens drawer 7 and finds number 5. Then he opens drawer 5, where he finds his own number and is successful.
* Prisoner 2 opens drawers 2, 4, and 8 in this order. In the last drawer he finds his own number 2.
* Prisoner 3 opens drawers 3 and 6, where he finds his own number.
* Prisoner 4 opens drawers 4, 8, and 2, where he finds his own number. Note that this is the same cycle encountered by prisoner 2, but he isn't aware of it.
* Prisoners 5 to 8 will also each find their numbers in a similar fashion.

In this case, all prisoners find their numbers. This is, however, not always the case. For example, the small change to the numbers of swapping drawers 5 and 8 would cause prisoner 1 to fail after opening 1, 7, 5, and 2 (and not finding his own number):
:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! number of drawer
| &amp;nbsp; 1 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 2 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp;
|-
! number of prisoner
| 7 || 4 || 6 || 8 || 2 || 3 || 5 || 1
|}

And in the following arrangement, prisoner 1 opens drawers 1, 3, 7, and 4, at which point he has to stop unsuccessfully:
:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! number of drawer
| &amp;nbsp; 1 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 2 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp;
|-
! number of prisoner
| 3 || 1 || 7 || 5 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 2
|}

Indeed, all prisoners except 6 (who succeeds directly) fail.

=== Permutation representation ===
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Permutation cycles qtl1.svg|image2=Permutation cycles qtl2.svg|width=110|footer=Graph representations of the permutations (1&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;5)(2&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;8)(3&amp;nbsp;6) and (1&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;2)(6)}}

The prison director's assignment of prisoner numbers to drawers can mathematically be described as a [[permutation]] of the numbers 1 to 100. Such a permutation is a [[bijection|one-to-one mapping]] of the set of natural numbers from 1 to 100 to itself. A sequence of numbers which after repeated application of the permutation returns to the first number is called a [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] of the permutation. Every permutation can be decomposed into [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] cycles, that is, cycles which have no common elements. The permutation of the first example above can be written in [[cycle notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;(1 ~ 7 ~ 5) (2 ~ 4 ~ 8) (3 ~ 6)&lt;/math&gt;

and thus consists of two cycles of length 3 and one cycle of length 2. The permutation of the second example is accordingly

:&lt;math&gt;(1 ~ 3 ~ 7 ~ 4 ~ 5 ~ 8 ~ 2) (6)&lt;/math&gt;

and consists of a cycle of length 7 and a cycle of length 1. The cycle notation is not unique since a cycle of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; can be written in &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; different ways depending on the starting number of the cycle. During the opening the drawers in the above strategy, each prisoner follows a single cycle which always ends with his own number. In the case of eight prisoners, this cycle-following strategy is successful if and only if the length of the longest cycle of the permutation is at most 4. If a permutation contains a cycle of length 5 or more, all prisoners whose numbers lie in such a cycle do not reach their own number after four steps.

=== Probability of success ===
[[File:Permutation longest cycle length pmf qtl2.svg|thumb|Probability distribution of the length of the longest cycle of a random permutation of the numbers 1 to 100. The green area corresponds to the survival probability of the prisoners]]

In the initial problem, the 100 prisoners are successful if the longest cycle of the permutation has a length of at most 50. Their survival probability is therefore equal to the probability that a [[random permutation]] of the numbers 1 to 100 contains no cycle of length greater than 50. This probability is determined in the following.

A permutation of the numbers 1 to 100 can contain at most one cycle of length &lt;math&gt;l &gt; 50&lt;/math&gt;. There are exactly &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{100}{l}&lt;/math&gt; ways to select the numbers of such a cycle (see [[combination]]). Within this cycle, these numbers can be arranged in &lt;math&gt;(l-1)!&lt;/math&gt; ways since there are &lt;math&gt;l - 1&lt;/math&gt; permutations to represent distinct cycles of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; because of cyclic symmetry. The remaining numbers can be arranged in &lt;math&gt;(100-l)!&lt;/math&gt; ways. Therefore, the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to 100 with a cycle of length &lt;math&gt;l &gt; 50&lt;/math&gt; is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{100}{l} \cdot (l-1)! \cdot (100-l)! = \frac{100!}{l}.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability, that a ([[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]]) random permutation contains no cycle of length greater than 50 is calculated with the formula for [[Event (probability theory)|single events]] and the formula for [[complementary event]]s thus given by

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{1}{100!} \left( \frac{100!}{51} + \ldots + \frac{100!}{100} \right) = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{51} + \ldots + \frac{1}{100} \right) = 1 - ( H_{100} - H_{50} ) \approx 0.31183,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[harmonic number]]. Therefore, using the cycle-following strategy the prisoners survive in a surprising 31% of cases.&lt;ref name="stanley" /&gt;

=== Asymptotics ===
[[File:Integral Test.svg|thumb|The harmonic numbers are approximately given by the area under the hyperbola and can therefore be approximated by a logarithm]]

If &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; instead of 100 prisoners are considered, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; an arbitrary natural number, the prisoners' survival probability with the cycle-following strategy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;1 - ( H_{2n} - H_n ) = 1 - (H_{2n} - \ln 2n) + (H_n - \ln n) - \ln 2.&lt;/math&gt;

With the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} (H_n - \ln n) = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

holds, which results in an asymptotic survival probability of

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} ( 1 - H_{2n} + H_n ) = 1 - \gamma + \gamma - \ln 2 = 1 - \ln 2 \approx 0.30685.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the sequence of probabilities is [[monotonically decreasing]], the prisoners survive with the cycle-following strategy in more than 30% of cases independently of the number of prisoners.&lt;ref name="stanley" /&gt;

=== Optimality ===

In 2006, Eugene Curtin and Max Warshauer gave a proof for the optimality of the cycle-following strategy. The proof is based on an equivalence to a related problem in which all prisoners are allowed to be present in the room and observe the opening of the drawers. Mathematically, this equivalence is based on [[Permutation#Foata's transition lemma (or the fundamental bijection)|Foata's transition lemma]], a one-to-one correspondence of the (canonical) cycle notation and the one-line notation of permutations. In the second problem, the survival probability is independent of the chosen strategy and equal to the survival probability in the original problem with the cycle-following strategy. Since an arbitrary strategy for the original problem can also be applied to the second problem, but cannot attain a higher survival probability there, the cycle-following strategy has to be optimal.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{citation|author=Eugene Curtin, Max Warshauer|title=The locker puzzle|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=28|year=2006|pages=28–31|doi=10.1007/BF02986999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The 100 prisoners problem was first considered in 2003 by Danish computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen who published it with Anna Gál in the [[conference proceedings|proceedings]] of the ''30. International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming'' (ICALP).&lt;ref name="miltersen"&gt;{{citation|author=Anna Gál, Peter Bro Miltersen|contribution=The cell probe complexity of succinct data structures|title=Proceedings 30th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP)|year=2003|pages=332–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their version, player A (the prison director) randomly colors strips of paper with the names of the players of team B (the prisoners) in red or blue and puts each strip into a different box. Some of the boxes may be empty (see [[#Empty boxes|below]]). Every player of team B must guess his color correctly after opening half of the boxes for their team to win.&lt;ref name="miltersen"/&gt; Initially, Milterson assumed that the winning probability quickly tends to zero with increasing number of players. Sven Skyum, a colleague of Miltersen at [[Aarhus University]], however brought his attention to the cycle-following strategy for the a case of this problem when there is no empty boxes. To find this strategy was left open as an exercise in the publication. The paper was honored with the best paper award.&lt;ref name="curtin" /&gt;

In spring 2004, the problem appeared in Joe Buhler and [[Elwyn Berlekamp]]'s puzzle column of the quarterly ''The Emissary'' of the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]]. Thereby, the authors replaced boxes by [[Read-only memory|ROM]]s and colored strips of paper by [[Sign (mathematics)|signed]] numbers. The authors noted that the winning probability can be increased also in the case where the team members don't find their own numbers. If the given answer is the product of all the signs found and if the length of the longest cycle is half the (even) number of players plus one, then the team members in this cycle either all guess wrong or all guess right. Even if this extension of the strategy offers a visible improvement for a small number of players, it becomes negligible when the number of players becomes large.&lt;ref name="buhler"&gt;{{citation|author=Joe Buhler, Elwyn Berlekamp|title=Puzzles Column|journal=The Emissary|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/news/emissary-newsletter|publisher=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|volume=Spring 2004|year=2004|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the problem entered the mathematical literature, where it was shaped in further different ways, for example with cards on a table&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Richard E. Blahut|title=Cryptography and Secure Communication|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wallets in lockers (''locker puzzle'').&lt;ref name="curtin" /&gt; In the form of a prisoner problem it was posed in 2006 by Christoph Pöppe in the journal ''[[Spektrum der Wissenschaft]]'' and by [[Peter Winkler]] in the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="pöppe"&gt;{{citation|author=Christoph Pöppe|title=Mathematische Unterhaltungen: Freiheit für die Kombinatoriker|journal=Spektrum der Wissenschaft|volume=6/2006|year=2006|pages=106–108|language=german|url=http://www.spektrum.de/alias/mathematische-unterhaltungen/freiheit-fuer-die-kombinatoriker/848868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="winkler"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Winkler|title=Names in Boxes Puzzle|journal=College Mathematics Journal|volume=37|number=4|year=2006|pages=260,285,289}}&lt;/ref&gt; With slight alterations this form was adopted by Philippe Flajolet, Robert Sedgewick and [[Richard P. Stanley]] in their textbooks on combinatorics.&lt;ref name="flajolet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanley" /&gt;

== Variants ==

=== Empty boxes ===

At first, Gál and Miltersen considered in their paper the case that the number of boxes is twice the number of team members while half of the boxes are empty. This is a more difficult problem since empty boxes lead nowhere and thus the cycle-following strategy cannot be applied. It is an open problem if in this case the winning probability tends to zero with growing number of team members.&lt;ref name="miltersen" /&gt;

In 2005, Navin Goyal and [[Michael Saks (mathematician)|Michael Saks]] developed a strategy for team B based on the cycle-following strategy for a more general problem in which the fraction of empty boxes as well as the fraction of boxes each team member is allowed to open are variable. The winning probability still tends to zero in this case, but slower than suggested by Gál and Miltersen. If the number of team members and the fraction of boxes which are opened is fixed, the winning probability stays strictly larger than zero when more empty boxes are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Navin Goyal, Michael Saks|title=A parallel search game|journal=Random Structures &amp; Algorithms|volume=27|number=2|pages=227–234|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Avis]] and [[Anne Broadbent]] considered in 2009 a [[Quantum complexity theory|quantum theoretical]] variant in which team B wins with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[David Avis]], [[Anne Broadbent]]|contribution=The quantum locker puzzle|title=Third International Conference on Quantum, Nano and Micro Technologies ICQNM '09|pages=63–66|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The malicious director ===

In case the prison director does not have to distribute the numbers into the drawers randomly, he can foil the prisoners' strategy if he knows the numbering of the drawers. To this end, he just has to ensure that his assignment of prisoners' numbers to drawers constitutes a permutation with a cycle of length larger than 50. The prisoners in turn can counter this by choosing their own numbering of the drawers randomly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Philippe Flajolet, Robert Sedgewick|title=Analytic Combinatorics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One prisoner may make one change ===
In the case that one prisoner may enter the room first, '''inspect all boxes''', and then switch the content of two boxes, all prisoners will survive with probability 1. This is so since any cycle of length larger than 50 can be broken, so that it can be guaranteed that there is a cycle of length at most 50.

=== Monty Hall problem ===

In 2009, Adam S. Landsberg proposed the following simpler variant of the 100 prisoners problem which is based on the well-known [[Monty Hall problem]]:&lt;ref name="landsberg" /&gt;

:''Behind three closed doors a car, the car keys and a goat are randomly distributed. There are two players: the first player has to find the car, the second player the keys to the car. Only if both players are successful they may drive the car home. The first player enters the room and may consecutively open two of the three doors. If he is successful, the doors are closed again and the second player enters the room. The second player may also open two of the three doors, but he cannot communicate with the first player in any form. What is the winning probability if both players act optimally?''

If the players select their doors randomly, the winning probability is only {{sfrac|4|9}} (about 44%). The optimal strategy is, however, as follows:

* Player 1 first opens door 1. If the car is behind the door, he is successful. If the keys were behind the door, he next opens door 2; if instead the goat was behind the door, he next opens door 3.
* Player 2 first opens door 2. If the keys are behind the door, he is successful. If the goat was behind the door, he next opens door 3; whereas if the car was behind the door, he next opens door 1.

In the six possible distributions of car, keys and goat behind the three doors, the players open the following doors (in the green cases, the player was successful):

:{| class="wikitable"
| || Car − Keys − Goat || Car − Goat − Keys || Keys − Car − Goat || Keys − Goat − Car || Goat − Car − Keys || Goat − Keys − Car
|-
| Player 1
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 1: Car
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 1: Car
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 1: Keys &lt;br /&gt; Door 2: Car
| style="background:#FFCBCB;" | Door 1: Keys &lt;br /&gt; Door 2: Goat
| style="background:#FFCBCB;" | Door 1: Goat &lt;br /&gt; Door 3: Keys
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 1: Goat &lt;br /&gt; Door 3: Car
|-
|-
| Player 2
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 2: Keys
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 2: Goat &lt;br /&gt; Door 3: Keys
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 2: Car &lt;br /&gt; Door 1: Keys
| style="background:#FFCBCB;" | (Door 2: Goat) &lt;br /&gt; (Door 3: Car)
| style="background:#FFCBCB;" | (Door 2: Car) &lt;br /&gt; (Door 1: Goat)
| style="background:#B9FFC5;" | Door 2: Keys
|}

The success of the strategy is based on building a correlation between the successes and failures of the two players. Here, the winning probability is {{sfrac|2|3}}, which is optimal since the first player cannot have a higher winning probability than that.&lt;ref name="landsberg"&gt;{{citation|author=Adam S. Landsberg|title=The Return of Monty Hall|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=31|number=2|year=2009|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-008-9016-8|doi=10.1007/s00283-008-9016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further variant, three prizes are hidden behind the three doors and three players have to independently find their assigned prizes with two tries. In this case the winning probability is also {{sfrac|2|3}} when the optimal strategy is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Eric Grundwald|title=Re: The Locker Puzzle|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=32|number=2|year=2010|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-009-9107-1|doi=10.1007/s00283-009-9107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anisotropic energy''' is energy that is directionally specific. The word [[anisotropy]] means "directionally dependent", hence the definition. The most common form of anisotropic energy is [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]], which is commonly studied in [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnets]]. In ferrimagnets, there are islands or domains of atoms that are all coordinated in a certain direction; this spontaneous positioning is often called the "easy" direction, indicating that this is the lowest energy state for these atoms. In order to study magnetocrystalline anisotropy, energy (usually in the form of an [[electric current]]) is applied to the domain, which causes the crystals to deflect from the "easy" to "hard" positions. The energy required to do this is defined as the anisotropic energy. The easy and hard alignments and their relative energies are due to the interaction between spin magnetic moment of each atom and the [[Crystal structure#Lattice systems|crystal lattice]] of the compound being studied. One of the many projects currently researching this phenomenon is directed by Stefan Krause and Roland Wiesendanger of the [[University of Hamburg]]. Using spin-polarized [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]s they are observing the effect upon the macrospin states of domains by passing a spin-polarized current through the atoms, and observing their alignment and how long they maintain their [[Spin (physics)|spin state]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3047">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bell series''' is a [[formal power series]] used to study properties of arithmetical functions. Bell series were introduced and developed by [[Eric Temple Bell]].

Given an [[arithmetic function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Prime number|prime]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, define the formal power series &lt;math&gt;f_p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, called the Bell series of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  as:

:&lt;math&gt;f_p(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty f(p^n)x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Two [[multiplicative function]]s can be shown to be identical if all of their Bell series are equal; this is sometimes called the ''uniqueness theorem'': given multiplicative functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;f=g&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]]:
:&lt;math&gt;f_p(x)=g_p(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Two series may be multiplied (sometimes called the ''multiplication theorem''): For any two [[arithmetic function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;h=f*g&lt;/math&gt; be their [[Dirichlet convolution]].  Then for every prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, one has: 

:&lt;math&gt;h_p(x)=f_p(x) g_p(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this makes it trivial to find the Bell series of a [[Dirichlet convolution|Dirichlet inverse]].

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[completely multiplicative]], then formally: 
:&lt;math&gt;f_p(x)=\frac{1}{1-f(p)x}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

The following is a table of the Bell series of well-known arithmetic functions.

* The [[Möbius function]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\mu_p(x)=1-x.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Mobius function]] squared has &lt;math&gt;\mu_p^2(x) = 1+x.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Euler's phi function|Euler's totient]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\varphi_p(x)=\frac{1-x}{1-px}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The multiplicative identity of the [[Dirichlet convolution]] &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\delta_p(x)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Liouville function]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\lambda_p(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The power function Id&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has &lt;math&gt;(\textrm{Id}_k)_p(x)=\frac{1}{1-p^kx}.&lt;/math&gt;  Here, Id&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the completely multiplicative function  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}_k(n)=n^k&lt;/math&gt;. 
* The [[divisor function]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_k)_p(x)=\frac{1}{1-(1+p^k) x+p^kx^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[unit function]] satisfies &lt;math&gt;1_p(x) = (1-x)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., is the [[geometric series]].
* If &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 2^{\omega(n)} = \sum_{d|n} \mu^2(d)&lt;/math&gt; is the power of the [[prime omega function]], then &lt;math&gt;f_p(x) = \frac{1+x}{1-x}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Suppose that ''f'' is multiplicative and ''g'' is any [[arithmetic function]] satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(p^{n+1}) = f(p) f(p^n) - g(p) f(p^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; for all primes ''p'' and &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f_p(x) = \left(1-f(p)x + g(p)x^2\right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; 
* If &lt;math&gt;\mu_k(n) = \sum_{d^k|n} \mu_{k-1}\left(\frac{n}{d^k}\right) \mu_{k-1}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Mobius function of order k]], then &lt;math&gt;(\mu_k)_p(x) = \frac{1-2x^k+x^{k+1}}{1-x}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1356">In [[algebraic K-theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Bloch's formula''', introduced by [[Spencer Bloch]] for &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt;, states that the [[Chow group]] of a smooth variety ''X'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is isomorphic to the cohomology of ''X'' with coefficients in the K-theory of the structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;; that is,
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CH}^q(X) = \operatorname{H}^q(X, K_q(\mathcal{O}_X))&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side is the sheaf cohomology; &lt;math&gt;K_q(\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt; is the sheaf associated to the presheaf &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto K_q(U)&lt;/math&gt;, ''U'' Zariski open subsets of ''X''. The general case is due to Quillen.&lt;ref&gt;For a sketch of the proof, besides the original paper, see http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~ericmf/lectures/zurich/zlec5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For ''q'' = 1, one recovers &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pic}(X) = H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)&lt;/math&gt;. (see also [[Picard group]].)

The formula for the [[ring of mixed characteristic|mixed characteristic]] is still open.

'''Cat's cradle''' is one of the oldest games in recorded human history, and involves creating various [[string figure]]s, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. The true origin of the name is debated, though the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/87650.html|title='Cat's Cradle' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of string, the specific figures, their order, and the names of the figures vary. Independent versions of this game have been found in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures throughout the world, including in Africa, Eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, Australia, the Americas, and the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cats-cradle_us_5a3bcd4ae4b0df0de8b062f5|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Zgheib|first=Yara|date=2017-12-21|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://si-siris.blogspot.com/2010/05/cats-cradle.html|title=Cat's Cradle|last=Archives|first=National Anthropological|date=2010-05-13|website=Smithsonian Collections Blog|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
[[File:Eishosai Choki - Cat's Cradle.jpg|thumb|''The lovers, Okiku and Yosuke, play cat’s cradle'', by [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (1804)]]

The game consists of two or more players making a sequence of string figures, each altering the figure made by the previous player. The game begins with one player making the eponymous figure ''Cat's Cradle'' (above). After each figure, the next player manipulates that figure and removes the string figure from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop to create another figure, for example, ''Diamonds''. ''Diamonds'' might then lead to ''Candles'', for example, and then ''Manger''—an inverted ''Cat's Cradle''—and so on. Most of the core figures allow a choice between two or more subsequent figures: for example, ''Fish in a Dish'' can become ''Cat's Eye'' or ''Manger''. The game ends when a player makes a mistake or creates a dead-end figure, such as ''Two Crowns'', which cannot be turned into anything else.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camilla Gryski|Gryski, Camilla]] (1984). ''Cat's Cradle, Owl's Eyes: A Book of String Games''. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0688039413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also may be played solo, as is done in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Gryski, Camilla (1985). ''Many Stars &amp; More String Games'', pp. 66–72. Tom Sankey, illustrator. {{ISBN|0-688-05792-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mma two young women seated by a kotatsu playing cats cradle 55802.jpg|thumb|"Two Young Women Seated by a [[Kotatsu]] Playing Cat's Cradle", [[Suzuki Harunobu]], ca. 1765]]

The origin of the name "cat's cradle" is debated but the first known reference is in ''The light of nature pursued'' by [[Abraham Tucker]] in 1768.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"An ingenious play they call cat's cradle; one ties the two ends of a packthread together, and then winds it about his fingers, another with both hands takes it off perhaps in the shape of a gridiron, the first takes it from him again in another form, and so on alternately changing the packthread into a multitude of figures whose names I forget, it being so many years since I played at it myself."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The name may have come from a corruption of cratch-cradle, or [[manger]] [[bassinet|cradle]]{{#tag:ref|"Nares, under Cratche, an archaic word for manger, deems it to be the origin of the name of this game, which, however, he calls ''scratch-cradle''.

Different [[culture]]s have different names for the game, and often different names for the individual figures. The [[French language|French]] word for manger is ''crèche'', and cattle feed racks are still known as ''cratches''. In [[Russia]] the whole game is called simply, ''the game of string'', and the ''diamonds'' pattern is called ''carpet'', with other pattern names such as ''field'', ''fish'', and ''sawhorse'' for the other figures—a ''cat'' isn't mentioned.&lt;ref name="B&amp;P"&gt;Buchanan, Andrea J. and Peskowitz, Miriam (2007).

The ''Communications Machine'', or "CM", is a mechanical device used by the [[United States Navy]] for the most of the 1920s.  It used a sliding alphabet system. It was developed by [[Agnes Meyer Driscoll]] and William Gresham. In 1937 the United States Congress recognized the achievement of these two by awarding them both $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madame X: Agnes Meyer Driscoll and U.S. Naval Cryptology, 1919 - 1940 |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |publisher=NSA |accessdate=15 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015635/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5912">In [[mathematics]], the '''Cousin problems''' are two questions in [[several complex variables]], concerning the existence of [[meromorphic function]]s that are specified in terms of local data. They were introduced in special cases by [[Pierre Cousin (mathematician)|Pierre Cousin]] in 1895. They are now posed, and solved, for any [[complex manifold]] ''M'', in terms of conditions on ''M''.

For both problems, an [[open cover]] of ''M'' by sets ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given, along with a meromorphic function ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' on each ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==First Cousin problem==
The '''first Cousin problem''' or '''additive Cousin problem''' assumes that each difference

:&lt;math&gt;f_i-f_j&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[holomorphic function]], where it is defined. It asks for a meromorphic function ''f'' on ''M'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f-f_i&lt;/math&gt;

is ''holomorphic'' on ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''; in other words, that ''f'' shares the [[mathematical singularity|singular]] behaviour of the given local function. The given condition on the &lt;math&gt;f_i-f_j&lt;/math&gt; is evidently ''necessary'' for this; so the problem amounts to asking if it is sufficient. The case of one variable is the [[Mittag-Leffler theorem]] on prescribing poles, when ''M'' is an open subset of the [[complex plane]]. [[Riemann surface]] theory shows that some restriction on ''M'' will be required. The problem can always be solved on a [[Stein manifold]].

The first Cousin problem may be understood in terms of [[sheaf cohomology]] as follows. Let '''K''' be the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of meromorphic functions and '''O''' the sheaf of holomorphic functions on ''M''. A global section &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of '''K''' passes to a global section &lt;math&gt;\phi(f)&lt;/math&gt; of the quotient sheaf '''K'''/'''O'''. The converse question is the first Cousin problem: given a global section of '''K'''/'''O''', is there a global section of '''K''' from which it arises? The problem is thus to characterize the image of the map

:&lt;math&gt;H^0(M,\mathbf{K}) \xrightarrow{\phi} H^0(M,\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{O}).&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[long exact sequence in homology|long exact cohomology sequence]],

:&lt;math&gt;H^0(M,\mathbf{K}) \xrightarrow{\phi} H^0(M,\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{O})\to H^1(M,\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;

is exact, and so the first Cousin problem is always solvable provided that the first cohomology group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'','''O''') vanishes.  In particular, by [[Cartan's theorems A and B|Cartan's theorem B]], the Cousin problem is always solvable if ''M'' is a Stein manifold.

==Second Cousin problem==
The '''second Cousin problem''' or '''multiplicative Cousin problem''' assumes that each ratio

:&lt;math&gt;f_i/f_j&lt;/math&gt;

is a non-vanishing holomorphic function, where it is defined. It asks for a meromorphic function ''f'' on ''M'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f/f_i&lt;/math&gt;

is holomorphic and non-vanishing. The second Cousin problem is a multi-dimensional generalization of the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem|Weierstrass theorem]] on the existence of a holomorphic function of one variable with prescribed zeros.

The attack on this problem by means of taking [[logarithm]]s, to reduce it to the additive problem, meets an obstruction in the form of the first [[Chern class]] (see also [[exponential sheaf sequence]]). In terms of sheaf theory, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}^*&lt;/math&gt; be the sheaf of holomorphic functions that vanish nowhere, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}^*&lt;/math&gt; the sheaf of meromorphic functions that are not identically zero. These are both then sheaves of [[abelian group]]s, and the quotient sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}^*/\mathbf{O}^*&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. The multiplicative Cousin problem then seeks to identify the image of quotient map &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H^0(M,\mathbf{K}^*)\xrightarrow{\phi} H^0(M,\mathbf{K}^*/\mathbf{O}^*).&lt;/math&gt;

The long exact sheaf cohomology sequence associated to the quotient is

:&lt;math&gt;H^0(M,\mathbf{K}^*)\xrightarrow{\phi} H^0(M,\mathbf{K}^*/\mathbf{O}^*)\to H^1(M,\mathbf{O}^*)&lt;/math&gt;

so the second Cousin problem is solvable in all cases provided that &lt;math&gt;H^1(M,\mathbf{O}^*)=0.&lt;/math&gt; The quotient sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}^*/\mathbf{O}^*&lt;/math&gt; is the sheaf of germs of [[Cartier divisor]]s on ''M''. The question of whether every global section is generated by a meromorphic function is thus equivalent to determining whether every [[line bundle]] on ''M'' is [[trivial bundle|trivial]].

The cohomology group &lt;math&gt;H^1(M,\mathbf{O}^*),&lt;/math&gt; for the multiplicative structure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}^*&lt;/math&gt; can be compared with the cohomology group &lt;math&gt;H^1(M,\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; with its additive structure by taking a logarithm. That is, there is an exact sequence of sheaves

:&lt;math&gt;0\to 2\pi i\Z\to \mathbf{O} \xrightarrow{\exp} \mathbf{O}^* \to  0&lt;/math&gt;

where the leftmost sheaf is the locally constant sheaf with fiber &lt;math&gt;2\pi i\Z&lt;/math&gt;.  The obstruction to defining a logarithm at the level of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;H^2(M,\Z)&lt;/math&gt;, from the long exact cohomology sequence

:&lt;math&gt;H^1(M,\mathbf{O})\to H^1(M,\mathbf{O}^*)\to 2\pi i H^2(M,\Z) \to H^2(M, \mathbf{O}).&lt;/math&gt;

When ''M'' is a Stein manifold, the middle arrow is an isomorphism because &lt;math&gt;H^q(M,\mathbf{O}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that a necessary and sufficient condition in that case for the second Cousin problem to be always solvable is that &lt;math&gt;H^2(M,\Z)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Dirac adjoint''' defines the [[dual vector space|dual]] operation of a [[Dirac spinor]].  The Dirac adjoint is motivated by the need to form well-behaved, measurable quantities out of Dirac spinors.  Since the usual [[Hermitian adjoint]] lacks the [[Lorentz symmetry]] of the system, the Dirac adjoint must be used instead.

Possibly to avoid confusion with the usual [[Hermitian adjoint]], some textbooks do not provide a name for the Dirac adjoint but simply call it "&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;-bar".

== Definition ==

Let &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt; be a [[Dirac spinor]].  Then its Dirac adjoint is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \equiv \psi^\dagger \gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[Hermitian adjoint]] of the spinor &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the time-like [[gamma matrices|gamma matrix]].

== Spinors under Lorentz transformations ==

The [[Lorentz group]] of [[special relativity]] is not [[compact space|compact]], therefore [[Representations of the Lorentz group|representation]]s of [[Lorentz transformation]]s in the Dirac spinor space are not [[unitary operator|unitary]].  That is, in general,

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\dagger \ne \lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt; is the corresponding Lorentz transformation that maps spinors:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \mapsto \lambda \psi&lt;/math&gt;.

The Hermitian adjoint of spinors transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\psi^\dagger \mapsto \psi^\dagger \lambda^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, using only the Hermitian adjoint, one finds that {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} is not a [[Lorentz scalar]] and {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} is not even [[self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]].

Using the definition, one finds that the Dirac adjoint of spinors transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \mapsto \left(\lambda \psi\right)^\dagger \gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the identity {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the transformation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \mapsto \bar\psi \lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,

which possesses the required Lorentz symmetry for {{nowrap|{{overline|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{nowrap|{{overline|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}}  &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}}.

== Usage ==

Using the Dirac adjoint, the [[probability current|probability four-current]] &lt;var&gt;'''J'''&lt;/var&gt; for a spin-1/2 particle field can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = c \bar\psi \gamma^\mu \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; is the speed of light and the components of &lt;var&gt;'''J'''&lt;/var&gt; represent the probability density &lt;var&gt;ρ&lt;/var&gt; and the probability 3-current &lt;var&gt;'''j'''&lt;/var&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol J = (c \rho, \boldsymbol j)&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}} and using the relation for [[gamma matrices]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\gamma^0\right)^2 = I&lt;/math&gt;,

the probability density becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \psi^\dagger \psi&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4923">In [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], '''elimination theory''' is the classical name for algorithmic approaches to eliminating some variables between [[polynomial]]s of several variables, in order to solve [[systems of polynomial equations]].

The classical elimination theory culminated with the work of [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|Macaulay]] on [[multivariate resultant]]s, and its description in chapter ''Elimination theory'' of the first editions (1930) of [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden's]] ''[[Moderne Algebra]]''. After that, elimination theory was ignored by most algebraic geometers for almost thirty years, until the introduction of new methods for solving polynomial equations, such as [[Gröbner bases]], which were needed for [[computer algebra]].

==History and connection to modern theories==
The field of elimination theory was motivated by the need of methods for solving [[systems of polynomial equations]].

One of the first results was [[Bézout's theorem]], which bounds the number of solutions (in the case of two polynomials in two variables at Bézout time).

Except for Bézout's theorem, the general approach was to ''eliminate'' variables for reducing the problem to a single equation in one variable.

The case of linear equations was completely solved by [[Gaussian elimination]], where the older method of [[Cramer's rule]] does not proceeds by elimination, and works only when the number of equations equals the number of variables. During 19th century, this has been extended to linear [[Diophantine equation]]s and [[abelian group]] with [[Hermite normal form]] and [[Smith normal form]].

Before 20th century, different types of ''eliminants'' were introduced, including ''[[resultant]]s'', and various kinds of ''[[discriminant]]s''. In general, these eliminants are also [[invariant theory|invariant]], and are also fundamental in [[invariant theory]].

All these concepts are effective, in the sense that their definition include a method of computation. Around 1890, [[David Hilbert]] introduced non-effective methods, and this was seen as a revolution, which led most algebraic-geometers of the first half of 20th century to try to "eliminate elimination". Nevertheless [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], may be considered to belong to elimination theory, as it asserts that a system of polynomial equations does not has any solution if and only one may eliminate all unknowns for getting 1.

Elimination theory culminated with the work of [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]], and, finally,  [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|F.S. Macaulay]], who introduced [[multivariate resultant]]s and [[Resultant#U-resultant|U-resultants]], providing complete elimination methods for systems of polynomial equations, which have been described in chapter ''Elimination theory'' of the first editions (1930) of [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden's]] ''[[Moderne Algebra]]''.

After that, elimination theory has been considered as old fashioned, removed from next editions of ''Moderne Algebra'', and generally ignored, until the introduction of [[computer]]s, and more specifically of [[computer algebra]], which set the problem of designing elimination algorithms that are sufficiently efficient for being implemented. The main methods for this renewing of elimination theory are [[Gröbner bases]] and [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], which were introduced around 1970.

==Connection to logic==
There is also a logical facet to elimination theory, as seen in the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In the worst case, it is presumably hard to eliminate variables computationally. ''[[Quantifier elimination]]'' is a term used in [[mathematical logic]] to explain that, in some theories, every formula is equivalent to a formula without quantifier. This is the case of the theory of [[polynomial]]s over an [[algebraically closed field]], where elimination theory may be viewed as the theory of the methods to make quantifier elimination algorithmically effective. [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem|Quantifier elimination over the reals]] is another example, which is fundamental in [[algebraic geometry#Computational algebraic geometry|computational algebraic geometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''Fierz identity''' is an identity that allows one to rewrite ''[[Bilinear form|bilinear]]s of the product'' of two [[spinor]]s as a [[linear combination]] of ''products of the bilinears'' of the individual spinors. It is named after Swiss physicist [[Markus Fierz]].

There is a version of the Fierz identities for [[Dirac spinor]]s and there is another version for [[Weyl spinor]]s. And there are versions for other dimensions besides 3+1 dimensions.

Spinor bilinears can be thought of as elements of a [[Clifford Algebra]]. Then the Fierz identity is the concrete realization of the [[Clifford Algebra#Relation to the exterior algebra|relation to the exterior algebra]].
The identities for a generic scalar written as the contraction of two Dirac bilinears of the same type can be written with coefficients according to the following table.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Product
! S
! V 
! T 
! A 
! P 
|-
|  S × S =
|  1/4
|  1/4
|  -1/4
|  -1/4
|  1/4
|-
|  V × V =
|  1
|  -1/2
|  0
|  -1/2
|  -1
|-
|  T × T =
|  -3/2
|  0
|  -1/2
|  0
|  -3/2
|-
|  A × A =
|  -1
|  -1/2
|  0
|  -1/2
|  1
|-
|  P × P =
|  1/4
|  -1/4
|  -1/4
|  1/4
|  1/4
|-
|}

The signs in the table correspond to the case of commuting spinors, otherwise all coefficients change signs. For example, under the assumption of commuting bispinors, the V × V product can be expanded as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\bar\chi\gamma^\mu\psi\right)\left(\bar\psi\gamma_\mu \chi\right)=
\left(\bar\chi\chi\right)\left(\bar\psi\psi\right)-
\frac{1}{2}\left(\bar\chi\gamma^\mu\chi\right)\left(\bar\psi\gamma_\mu\psi\right)-
\frac{1}{2}\left(\bar\chi\gamma^\mu\gamma_5\chi\right)\left(\bar\psi\gamma_\mu\gamma_5\psi\right)
-\left(\bar\chi\gamma_5\chi\right)\left(\bar\psi\gamma_5\psi\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifications arise when the considered spinors are chiral or [[Majorana spinor]]s as some term in the expansion can be vanishing.

A '''generalized circle''', also referred to as a "cline" or "circline", is a [[straight line]] or a [[circle]]. The concept is mainly used in [[inversive geometry]], because straight lines and circles have very similar properties in that geometry and are best treated together.

Inversive plane geometry is formulated on the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] extended by one [[point at infinity]]. A straight line is then thought of as one of the circles that passes through the [[Asymptote|asymptotic]] point at infinity. 
The fundamental transformations in inversive geometry, the ''inversions'', have the property that they map generalized circles to generalized circles. [[Möbius transformation]]s, which are compositions of inversions, inherit that property. These transformations do not necessarily map lines to lines and circles to circles: they can mix the two. 

Inversions come in two kinds: inversions at circles and reflections at lines. Since the two have very similar properties, we combine them and talk about inversions at generalized circles.

Given any three distinct points in the extended plane, there exists precisely one generalized circle that passes through the three points.
 
The extended plane can be identified with the [[sphere]] using a [[stereographic projection]]. The point at infinity then becomes an ordinary point on the sphere, and all generalized circles become circles on the sphere.

==Equation in the extended complex plane==
The extended plane of inversive geometry can be identified with the [[extended complex plane]], so that equations of complex numbers can be used to describe lines, circles and inversions.

A [[circle]] Γ is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Point (geometry)|points]] ''z''  in a plane that lie at [[radius]] ''r''  from a center point ''γ''. 

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\gamma, r) = \{ z : \text{the distance between } z \text{ and } \gamma \text{ is } r \} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[complex plane]], we can treat ''γ'' as a complex number and circle Γ as a set of complex numbers.

Using the property that a complex number multiplied by its [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] gives us the square of the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|modulus]] of the number, and that its modulus is its [[Euclidean distance]] from the origin, we can express the equation for Γ as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{\left | z-\gamma \right |} = r &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\left | z-\gamma \right |} ^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(z-\gamma)\overline{(z-\gamma)} = r^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z \bar z - z \bar \gamma - \bar z \gamma + \gamma \bar \gamma = r^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z \bar z - z \bar \gamma - \bar z \gamma + \gamma \bar \gamma - r^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

We can multiply this by a real [[Coefficient|constant]] ''A'' to get an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
A z \bar z + B z + C \bar z + D = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''D'' are [[real number|real]], and ''B'' and ''C'' are [[complex conjugate]]s. Reversing the steps, we see that in order for this to be a circle, the radius squared must be equal to ''BC''/''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''D''/''A'' &gt; 0. So the above equation defines a generalized circle whenever ''AD &lt; BC''. Note that when ''A'' is zero, this equation defines a straight line.

==The transformation ''w'' = 1/''z''==
It is now easy to see that the transformation ''w'' =&amp;nbsp;1/''z'' maps generalized circles to generalized circles:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A z \bar z + B z + C \bar z + D &amp; = 0 \\[6pt]
A \frac{1}{w} \frac{1}{\bar w} + B \frac{1}{w} + C \frac{1}{\bar w} + D &amp; = 0 \\[6pt]
A  + B \bar w + C w + D w \bar w &amp; = 0 \\[6pt]
D \bar w w + C w + B \bar w + A &amp; = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the lines through the origin (''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) are mapped to the lines through the origin, the lines not passing through the origin (''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; ''D''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) to circles passing through  the origin, circles passing through the origin (''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0; ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) to the lines not passing through the origin, and circles not passing through the origin (''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0; ''D''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) to circles not passing through the origin.

==Representation by Hermitian matrices==
The data defining the equation of a generalized circle 
:&lt;math&gt;
A z \bar z + B z + C \bar z + D = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
can be usefully put into the form of an [[invertible matrix|invertible]] [[hermitian matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathfrak C = \begin{pmatrix}A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D \end{pmatrix} = \mathfrak C ^\dagger.
&lt;/math&gt;

Two such invertible hermitian matrices specify the same generalized circle if and only if they differ by a real multiple.

To transform a generalized circle described by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Möbius transformation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt;, take the inverse &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak G &lt;/math&gt; of the transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt; and do
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak C \mapsto {\mathfrak G}^\text{T} {\mathfrak C} \bar{\mathfrak G}.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Metric space]]: A [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' :&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''[[real number|R]]''' satisfying the following axioms for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''M'':
:# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
:# ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0
:# if &amp;nbsp; ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; then &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''identity of indiscernibles'')
:# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''symmetry'')
:# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (''[[triangle inequality]]'')

:The function ''d'' is a '''metric''' on ''M'', and ''d''(''x'', ''y'') is the '''distance''' between ''x'' and ''y''. The collection of all open balls of ''M'' is a base for a topology on ''M''; this is the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''. Every metric space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metric space is first-countable.

;[[Metrizable]]'''/'''Metrisable: A space is [[metrizable]] if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. Every metrizable space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metrizable space is first-countable.

;Monolith: Every non-empty ultra-connected compact space ''X'' has a largest proper open subset; this subset is called a '''monolith'''.

== N ==

;[[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|Neighbourhood]]'''/'''Neighborhood: A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the point ''x''. More generally, a neighbourhood of a set ''S'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the set ''S''. A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is thus a neighbourhood of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set {''x''}. (Note that under this definition, the neighbourhood itself need not be open. Many authors require that neighbourhoods be open; be careful to note conventions.)

;Neighbourhood system for a point ''x'': A [[neighbourhood system]] at a point ''x'' in a space is the collection of all neighbourhoods of ''x''.

;[[Net (mathematics)|Net]]: A [[net (mathematics)|net]] in a space ''X'' is a map from a [[directed set]] ''A'' to ''X''. A net from ''A'' to ''X'' is usually denoted (''x''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;), where α is an [[index set|index variable]] ranging over ''A''. Every [[sequence]] is a net, taking ''A'' to be the directed set of [[natural number]]s with the usual ordering.

;[[Normal space|Normal]]: A space is [[normal space|normal]] if any two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt;  Every normal space admits a partition of unity.

;[[T4 space|Normal Hausdorff]]: A [[T4 space|normal Hausdorff]] space (or [[T4 space|'''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''' space]]) is a normal T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space. (A normal space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is consistent.) Every normal Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.

;[[Nowhere dense set|Nowhere dense]]: A [[nowhere dense set]] is a set whose closure has empty interior.

== O ==

; [[Open cover]]: An [[open cover]] is a cover consisting of open sets.&lt;ref name=ss163/&gt;

; Open ball: If (''M'', ''d'') is a metric space, an open ball is a set of the form ''B''(''x''; ''r'') := {''y'' in ''M'' : ''d''(''x'', ''y'') &lt; ''r''}, where ''x'' is in ''M'' and ''r'' is a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], the '''radius''' of the ball. An open ball of radius ''r'' is an '''open ''r''-ball'''. Every open ball is an open set in the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''.
; Open condition:  See '''open property'''.
; [[Open set]]: An [[open set]] is a member of the topology.
; [[Open map|Open function]]: A function from one space to another is [[open map|open]] if the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every open set is open.
; Open property:  A property of points in a [[topological space]] is said to be "open" if those points which possess it form an [[open set]].  Such conditions often take a common form, and that form can be said to be an ''open condition''; for example, in [[metric space]]s, one defines an open ball as above, and says that "strict inequality is an open condition".

;[[Partition of unity]]: A partition of unity of a space ''X'' is a set of continuous functions from ''X'' to [0, 1] such that any point has a neighbourhood where all but a [[finite set|finite]] number of the functions are identically zero, and the sum of all the functions on the entire space is identically 1.

;[[Path (topology)|Path]]: A [[Path (topology)|path]] in a space ''X'' is a continuous map ''f'' from the closed unit [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0, 1] into ''X''. The point ''f''(0) is the initial point of ''f''; the point ''f''(1) is the terminal point of ''f''.&lt;ref name=ss29&gt;Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1978) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Path-connected space|Path-connected]]: A space ''X'' is [[path-connected space|path-connected]] if, for every two points ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'', there is a path ''f'' from ''x'' to ''y'', i.e., a path with initial point ''f''(0) = ''x'' and terminal point ''f''(1) = ''y''. Every path-connected space is connected.&lt;ref name=ss29/&gt;

;Path-connected component: A path-connected component of a space is a maximal nonempty path-connected subspace. The set of path-connected components of a space is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of that space, which is [[partition of a set|finer]] than the partition into connected components.&lt;ref name=ss29/&gt; The set of path-connected components of a space ''X'' is denoted [[homotopy groups|π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')]].

;Point: A point is an element of a topological space. More generally, a point is an element of any set with an underlying topological structure; e.g. an element of a metric space or a topological group is also a "point".

;Point of closure: See '''[[Closure (topology)|Closure]]'''.

;[[Polish space|Polish]]: A space is Polish if it is separable and completely metrizable, i.e. if it is homeomorphic to a separable and complete metric space.

;[[Polyadic space|Polyadic]]: A space is polyadic if it is the continuous image of the power of a [[one-point compactification]] of a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space.

;P-point: A point of a topological space is a P-point if its filter of neighbourhoods is closed under countable intersections.

;Pre-compact: See '''[[Relatively compact]]'''.

;Prodiscrete topology: The prodiscrete topology on a product ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; is the product topology when each factor ''A'' is given the discrete topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ceccherini-Silberstein | first1=Tullio | last2=Coornaert | first2=Michel | title=Cellular automata and groups | zbl=1218.37004 | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn=978-3-642-14033-4 | year=2010 | page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Product topology]]: If {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a collection of spaces and ''X'' is the (set-theoretic) [[Cartesian product|product]] of {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the [[product topology]] on ''X'' is the coarsest topology for which all the projection maps are continuous.

;Proper function/mapping: A continuous function ''f'' from a space ''X'' to a space ''Y'' is proper if ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''C'') is a compact set in ''X'' for any compact subspace ''C'' of ''Y''.

;[[Proximity space]]: A proximity space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;'''δ''') is a set ''X'' equipped with a [[binary relation]] '''δ''' between subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following properties:

:For all subsets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' of ''X'',
:#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''B'' '''δ''' ''A''
:#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''A'' is non-empty
:#If ''A'' and ''B'' have non-empty intersection, then ''A'' '''δ''' ''B''
:#''A'' '''δ''' (''B''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''C'') [[iff]] (''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' or ''A'' '''δ''' ''C'')
:#If, for all subsets ''E'' of ''X'', we have (''A'' '''δ''' ''E'' or ''B'' '''δ''' ''E''), then we must have ''A'' '''δ''' (''X'' − ''B'')

;Pseudocompact: A space is pseudocompact if every [[real number|real-valued]] continuous function on the space is bounded.

;Pseudometric: See '''Pseudometric space'''.

;Pseudometric space: A pseudometric space (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' :&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''[[real number|R]]''' satisfying all the conditions of a metric space, except possibly the identity of indiscernibles. That is, points in a pseudometric space may be "infinitely close" without being identical.  The function ''d'' is a '''pseudometric''' on ''M''. Every metric is a pseudometric.

;Punctured neighbourhood'''/'''Punctured neighborhood: A punctured neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a neighbourhood of ''x'', minus {''x''}. For instance, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−1, 1) = {''y'' : −1 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1} is a neighbourhood of ''x'' = 0 in the [[real line]], so the set (−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1) = (−1, 1) − {0} is a punctured neighbourhood of 0.

== Q ==

;Quasicompact: See '''[[compact space|compact]]'''. Some authors define "compact" to include the [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] separation axiom, and they use the term '''quasicompact''' to mean what we call in this glossary simply "compact" (without the Hausdorff axiom). This convention is most commonly found in French, and branches of mathematics heavily influenced by the French.

;Quotient map: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are spaces, and if ''f'' is a [[surjection]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', then ''f'' is a quotient map (or '''identification map''') if, for every subset ''U'' of ''Y'', ''U'' is open in ''Y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is open in ''X''.  In other words, ''Y'' has the ''f''-strong topology.  Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map if and only if it is the transfinite composition of maps &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow X/Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is a subset. Note that this doesn't imply that ''f'' is an open function.

;[[Quotient space (topology)|Quotient space]]: If ''X'' is a space, ''Y'' is a set, and ''f'' :&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is any [[surjection|surjective]] function, then the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]] on ''Y'' induced by ''f'' is the finest topology for which ''f'' is continuous. The space ''X'' is a quotient space or '''identification space'''. By definition, ''f'' is a quotient map. The most common example of this is to consider an [[equivalence relation]] on ''X'', with ''Y'' the set of [[equivalence class]]es and ''f'' the natural projection map. This construction is dual to the construction of the subspace topology.

== R ==

; Refinement: A cover ''K'' is a [[refinement (topology)|refinement]] of a cover ''L'' if every member of ''K'' is a subset of some member of ''L''.
; [[Regular space|Regular]]: A space is [[regular space|regular]] if, whenever ''C'' is a closed set and ''x'' is a point not in ''C'', then ''C'' and ''x'' have [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] neighbourhoods.
; [[T3 space|Regular Hausdorff]]: A space is [[T3 space|regular Hausdorff]] (or '''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''') if it is a regular T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space.  (A regular space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is consistent.)
; {{visible anchor|Regular open}}: A subset of a space ''X'' is regular open if it equals the interior of its closure; dually, a regular closed set is equal to the closure of its interior.&lt;ref name="Steen &amp; Seebach 1978 p.6"&gt;Steen &amp; Seebach (1978) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a non-regular open set is the set  ''U'' = {{open-open|0,1}} ∪ {{open-open|1,2}} in '''R''' with its normal topology, since 1 is in the interior of the closure of ''U'', but not in ''U''. The regular open subsets of a space form a [[complete Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref name="Steen &amp; Seebach 1978 p.6"/&gt;
; [[Relatively compact]]: A subset ''Y'' of a space ''X'' is [[relatively compact]] in ''X'' if the closure of ''Y'' in ''X'' is compact.
; Residual: If ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then ''A'' is residual in ''X'' if the complement of ''A'' is meagre in ''X''. Also called '''comeagre''' or '''comeager'''.

;Second category: See '''Meagre'''.

;[[Second-countable space|Second-countable]]: A space is [[second-countable space|second-countable]] or '''perfectly separable''' if it has a [[countable]] base for its topology.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt; Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.

;[[Semilocally simply connected]]: A space ''X'' is [[semilocally simply connected]] if, for every point ''x'' in ''X'', there is a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that every loop at ''x'' in ''U'' is homotopic in ''X'' to the constant loop ''x''. Every simply connected space and every locally simply connected space is semilocally simply connected. (Compare with locally simply connected; here, the homotopy is allowed to live in ''X'', whereas in the definition of locally simply connected, the homotopy must live in ''U''.)

;[[semiregular space|Semiregular]]: A space is semiregular if the regular open sets form a base.

;[[Separable (topology)|Separable]]: A space is [[separable (topology)|separable]] if it has a [[countable]] dense subset.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss7/&gt;

;[[Separated sets|Separated]]: Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated sets|separated]] if each is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from the other's closure.

;Star: The star of a point in a given [[cover (topology)|cover]] of a [[topological space]] is the union of all the sets in the cover that contain the point. See '''[[star refinement]]'''.

;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-Strong topology:  Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; be a map of topological spaces.  We say that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-strong topology if, for every subset &lt;math&gt;U\subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

;Stronger topology: See '''[[Finer topology]]'''. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''weaker topology'''.

;[[Subbase]]: A collection of open sets is a [[subbase]] (or '''subbasis''') for a topology if every non-empty proper open set in the topology is a union of [[finite set|finite]] intersections of sets in the subbase. If ''B'' is ''any'' collection of subsets of a set ''X'', the topology on ''X'' generated by ''B'' is the smallest topology containing ''B''; this topology consists of the empty set, ''X'' and all unions of finite intersections of elements of ''B''.

;[[Subbase|Subbasis]]: See '''[[Subbase]]'''.

;Subcover: A cover ''K'' is a subcover (or '''subcovering''') of a cover ''L'' if every member of ''K'' is a member of ''L''.

;Subcovering: See '''Subcover'''.
;Submaximal space: A [[topological space]] is said to be '''submaximal''' if every subset of it is locally closed, that is, every subset is the intersection of an [[open set]] and a [[closed set]].

Here are some facts about submaximality as a property of topological spaces:

* Every [[door space]] is submaximal.
* Every submaximal space is ''weakly submaximal'' viz every finite set is locally closed.
* Every submaximal space is [[irresolvable space|irresolvable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Recent progress in general topology | volume=2 | series=Recent Progress in General Topology | author1=Miroslav Hušek | author2=J. van Mill | publisher=Elsevier | year=2002 | isbn=0-444-50980-1 | page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Subspace: If ''T'' is a topology on a space ''X'', and if ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then the [[subspace topology]] on ''A'' induced by ''T'' consists of all intersections of open sets in ''T'' with ''A''. This construction is dual to the construction of the quotient topology.

;[[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]: A space is [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (or '''Fréchet''' or '''accessible''') if for every pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in the space, there is an open set containing ''x'' but not ''y''. (Compare with T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; here, we are allowed to specify which point will be contained in the open set.) Equivalently, a space is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if all its [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s are closed. Every T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Algebraic topology]] is the study of topologically invariant [[abstract algebra]] constructions on topological spaces.

;[[Topological space]]: A [[topological space]] (''X'', ''T'') is a set ''X'' equipped with a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s:

:# The empty set and ''X'' are in ''T''.
:# The union of any collection of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''.
:# The intersection of any pair of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''.

:The collection ''T'' is a '''topology''' on ''X''.

;Topological sum: See '''Coproduct topology'''.

;Topologically complete: [[Completely metrizable space]]s (i. e. topological spaces homeomorphic to complete metric spaces) are often called ''topologically complete''; sometimes the term is also used for [[Čech-complete space]]s or [[completely uniformizable space]]s.

;Topology: See '''[[Topological space]]'''.

;Totally bounded: A metric space ''M'' is totally bounded if, for every ''r'' &gt; 0, there exist a [[finite set|finite]] cover of ''M'' by open balls of radius ''r''. A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.

;Totally disconnected: A space is totally disconnected if it has no connected subset with more than one point.

;[[Trivial topology]]: The [[trivial topology]] (or '''indiscrete topology''') on a set ''X'' consists of precisely the empty set and the entire space ''X''.

;[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]: A [[Tychonoff space]] (or '''completely regular Hausdorff''' space, '''completely T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' space, '''T&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt;''' space) is a completely regular T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space.

;[[Uniform isomorphism]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[uniform space]]s, a uniform isomorphism from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a bijective function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' such that ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; are [[uniformly continuous]]. The spaces are then said to be uniformly isomorphic and share the same [[uniform properties]].

;[[Uniformizable]]/Uniformisable: A space is uniformizable if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space.

;[[Uniform space]]: A [[uniform space]] is a set ''U'' equipped with a nonempty collection Φ of subsets of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s:

:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then ''U'' contains { (''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' in ''X'' }.
:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then { (''y'', ''x'') | (''x'', ''y'') in ''U'' } is also in Φ
:# if ''U'' is in Φ and ''V'' is a subset of ''X'' × ''X'' which contains ''U'', then ''V'' is in Φ
:# if ''U'' and ''V'' are in Φ, then ''U'' ∩ ''V'' is in Φ
:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then there exists ''V'' in Φ such that, whenever (''x'', ''y'') and (''y'', ''z'') are in ''V'', then (''x'', ''z'') is in ''U''.

:The elements of Φ are called '''entourages''', and Φ itself is called a '''uniform structure''' on ''U''.

;Uniform structure: See '''[[Uniform space]]'''.

; Weakly countably compact: A space is weakly countably compact (or '''limit point compact''') if every [[Infinity|infinite]] subset has a limit point.
; Weakly hereditary: A property of spaces is said to be weakly hereditary if whenever a space has that property, then so does every closed subspace of it. For example, compactness and the Lindelöf property are both weakly hereditary properties, although neither is hereditary.
; Weight: The [[weight of a space]] ''X'' is the smallest [[cardinal number]] κ such that ''X'' has a base of cardinal κ. (Note that such a cardinal number exists, because the entire topology forms a base, and because the class of cardinal numbers is [[well order|well-ordered]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8238">In [[mathematics]] a '''Hausdorff measure''' is a type of [[outer measure]], named for [[Felix Hausdorff]], that assigns a number in [0,∞] to each set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or, more generally, in any [[metric space]]. The zero-dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in the set (if the set is finite) or ∞ if the set is infinite. The one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a [[simple curve]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the length of the curve. Likewise, the two dimensional Hausdorff measure of a [[Lebesgue measure#Construction of the Lebesgue measure|measurable subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is proportional to the area of the set. Thus, the concept of the Hausdorff measure generalizes counting, length, and area. It also generalizes volume. In fact, there are ''d''-dimensional Hausdorff measures for any ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, which is not necessarily an integer. These measures are fundamental in [[geometric measure theory]]. They appear naturally in  [[harmonic analysis]] or [[potential theory]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. For any subset &lt;math&gt;U\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{diam}\;U&lt;/math&gt; denote its diameter, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{diam}\;U :=\sup\{\rho(x,y)|x,y\in U\}, \quad \mathrm{diam}\;\emptyset:=0&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' be any subset of ''&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'', and &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; a real number. Define

:&lt;math&gt;H^d_\delta(S)=\inf\Bigl\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (\operatorname{diam}\;U_i)^d: \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i\supseteq S,\,\operatorname{diam}\;U_i&lt;\delta\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The infimum is over all countable covers of ''&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' by sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_i\subset X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \operatorname{diam}\;U_i&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.)

Note that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H^d_\delta(S)&lt;/math&gt; is monotone decreasing in &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; since the larger &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is, the more collections of sets are permitted, making the infimum smaller. Thus, the limit &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lim_{\delta\to 0}H^d_\delta(S)&lt;/math&gt; exists but may be infinite.  Let

:&lt;math&gt; H^d(S):=\sup_{\delta&gt;0} H^d_\delta(S)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}H^d_\delta(S).&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that &lt;math&gt;H^d(S)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[outer measure]] (more precisely, it is a [[metric outer measure]]). By general theory, its restriction to the σ-field of [[Outer measure#Formal definitions|Carathéodory-measurable sets]] is a measure. It is called the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-'''dimensional Hausdorff measure''' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Due to the [[metric outer measure]] property, all [[Borel subset|Borel]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;H^d&lt;/math&gt; measurable.

In the above definition the sets in the covering are arbitrary.  However, they may be taken to be open or closed, and will yield the same measure, although the approximations &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H^d_\delta(S)&lt;/math&gt; may be different {{harv|Federer|1969|loc=§2.10.2}}.  If ''&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is a [[normed space]] the sets may be taken to be convex. However, the restriction of the covering families to balls gives a different, yet comparable, measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Yeh|first = J.|year = 2006|title = Real analysis: theory of measure and integration|page = 681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of Hausdorff measures==

Note that if ''d'' is a positive integer, the ''d'' dimensional Hausdorff measure of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; is a rescaling of usual ''d''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_d&lt;/math&gt; which is normalized so that the Lebesgue measure of the unit cube [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is 1. In fact, for any Borel set ''E'',
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_d(E) = 2^{-d} \alpha_d H^d(E)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where α&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the unit [[N-sphere|''d''-ball]]; it can be expressed using [[gamma function|Euler's gamma function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_d =\frac{\Gamma(\frac12)^d}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2}+1)} =\frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2}+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark'''.  Some authors adopt a definition of Hausdorff measure slightly different from the one chosen here, the difference being that it is normalized in such a way that Hausdorff ''d''-dimensional measure in the case of Euclidean space coincides exactly with Lebesgue measure.

==Relation with Hausdorff dimension==
One of several possible equivalent definitions of the [[Hausdorff dimension]] is

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{Haus}}(S)=\inf\{d\ge 0:H^d(S)=0\}=\sup\bigl(\{d\ge 0:H^d(S)=\infty\}\cup\{0\}\bigr),
&lt;/math&gt;

where we take

:&lt;math&gt;\inf\emptyset=\infty. \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
In [[geometric measure theory]] and related fields, the [[Minkowski content]] is often used to measure the size of a subset of a metric measure space.  For suitable domains in Euclidean space, the two notions of size coincide, up to overall normalizations depending on conventions.  More precisely, a subset of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[rectifiable set|''&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;''-rectifiable]] if it is the image of a [[bounded set]] in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; under a [[Lipschitz function]].  If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the ''&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;''-dimensional Minkowski content of a closed ''&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;''-rectifiable subset of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;2^{-m}\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt; times the ''&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;''-dimensional Hausdorff measure {{harv|Federer|1969|loc=Theorem 3.2.29}}.

In [[fractal geometry]], some fractals with Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; have zero or infinite &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For example, [[almost surely]] the image of planar [[Brownian motion]] has Hausdorff dimension 2 and its two-dimensional Hausdoff measure is zero. In order to “measure” the “size” of such sets, mathematicians have considered the following variation on the notion of the Hausdorff measure:
:In the definition of the measure &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{diam}\;U_i)^d&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with &lt;math&gt;\phi(U_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is any monotone increasing set function satisfying &lt;math&gt;\phi(\emptyset )=0&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the Hausdorff measure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with [[dimension function | gauge function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;-Hausdorff measure. A &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; may satisfy &lt;math&gt;H^d(S)=0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H^\phi(S)\in(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; with an appropriate &lt;math&gt;\phi.&lt;/math&gt; Examples of gauge functions include  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \phi(t)=t^2\,\log\log\frac 1t&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\phi(t) = t^2\log\frac{1}{t}\log\log\log\frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The former gives almost surely positive and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-finite measure to the Brownian path in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, and the latter when &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

A polynomial function ''P''(''s'') of a [[complex variable]] ''s'' is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:

:1. ''P''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is real.
 
:2. The roots of ''P''(''s'') have real parts which are zero or negative.

Hurwitz polynomials are important in [[control system|control systems theory]], because they represent the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equations]] of [[Stability theory|stable]] [[linear system]]s.  Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the [[Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion]].

== Examples ==

A simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The only real solution is &amp;minus;1, as it factors to

:&lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, all second-degree polynomials with positive coefficients are Hurwitz.
This follows directly from the [[quadratic formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
where, if the determinant ''b^2-4ac'' is less than zero, then the polynomial will have two complex-conjugate solutions with real part ''-b/2a'', which is negative for positive ''a'' and ''b''.
If it is equal to zero, there will be two coinciding real solutions at ''-b/2a''. Finally, if the determinant is greater than zero, there will be two real negative solutions,
because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{b^2-4ac}&lt;b &lt;/math&gt; for positive ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.

== Properties ==

For a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive (except for second-degree polynomials, which also doesn't imply sufficiency).  A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it passes the [[Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion]].  A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.

The properties of Hurwitz polynomials are:

# All the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] are in the left half plane or on its boundary, the imaginary axis.
# Any poles and zeros on the imaginary axis are simple (have a multiplicity of one).
# Any poles on the imaginary axis have real strictly positive residues, and similarly at any zeros on the imaginary axis, the function has a real strictly positive derivative.
# Over the right half plane, the minimum value of the real part of a PR function occurs on the imaginary axis (because the real part of an analytic function constitutes a harmonic function over the plane, and therefore satisfies the maximum principle).
# The polynomial should not have missing powers of s.

In [[mathematics]], the study of '''interchange of limiting operations''' is one of the major concerns of [[mathematical analysis]], in that two given limiting operations, say ''L'' and ''M'', cannot be ''assumed'' to give the same result when applied in either order. One of the historical sources for this theory is the study of [[trigonometric series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|id=t/t094240|title=Trigonometric series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

In symbols, the assumption

:''LM'' = ''ML'',

where the [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side]] means that ''M'' is applied first, then ''L'', and ''vice versa'' on the [[Sides of an equation|right-hand side]], is not a valid [[equation]] between [[Operator (mathematics)|mathematical operators]], under all circumstances and for all operands. An algebraist would say that the operations do not [[Commutativity|commute]]. The approach taken in analysis is somewhat different. Conclusions that assume limiting operations do 'commute' are called ''formal''. The analyst tries to delineate conditions under which such conclusions are valid; in other words [[Rigour|mathematical rigour]] is established by the specification of some set of sufficient conditions for the formal analysis to hold good. This approach justifies, for example, the notion of [[uniform convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=N. L. |last=Carothers |title=Real Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-49749-3 |page=150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is relatively rare for such sufficient conditions to be also necessary, so that a sharper piece of analysis may extend the domain of validity of formal results. 

Professionally speaking, therefore, analysts push the envelope of techniques, and expand the meaning of ''[[well-behaved]]'' for a given context. [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote that "The problem of deciding whether two given limit operations are commutative is one of the most important in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;In an Appendix ''A note on double limit operations'' to ''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An opinion apparently not in favour of the piece-wise approach, but of leaving analysis at the level of [[heuristic]], was that of [[Richard Courant]].

==Examples==

Examples abound, one of the simplest being that for a [[double sequence]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: it is not necessarily the case that the operations of taking the limits as ''m'' → ∞ and as ''n'' → ∞ can be freely interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony W. |last=Knapp |title=Basic Real Analysis |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2005 |isbn=0-8176-3250-6 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example take 

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m'' &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

in which taking the limit first with respect to ''n'' gives 0, and with respect to ''m'' gives ∞.

Many of the fundamental results of [[Calculus|infinitesimal calculus]] also fall into this category: the [[Symmetry of second derivatives|symmetry of partial derivatives]], [[differentiation under the integral sign]], and [[Fubini's theorem]] deal with the interchange of [[Derivative|differentiation]] and [[Integral|integration]] operators. One of the major reasons why the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] is used is that theorems exist, such as the [[dominated convergence theorem]], that give conditions under which integration and infinite summation can be interchanged.

==Biography==
After being part of the French Résistance in 1943 and 1944, J.-L. Lions entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1947.
He was a professor of mathematics at the Université of Nancy, the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, and the [[École polytechnique]].

In 1966 he sent an invitation to [[Gury Marchuk]], the soviet mathematician to visit Paris. This was hand delivered by [[General De Gaulle]] during his visit to [[Akademgorodok]] in June of that year.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impagliazzo|first1=John|last2=Proydakov|first2=Eduard|title=Perspectives on Soviet and Russian Computing: First IFIP WG 9.7 Conference, SoRuCom 2006, Petrozavodsk, Russia, July 3-7, 2006, Revised Selected Papers|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642228162|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-jSqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=Akademgorodok+Cybernetics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a5LlQUUY_n&amp;sig=gRzMno4tmnNsiPHKd1mY9cyi3lc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhlMySgsvZAhXiI8AKHdXICqgQ6AEIUDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Akademgorodok%20Cybernetics&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the prestigious [[Collège de France]] as well as the French Academy of Sciences in 1973.
In 1979, he was appointed director of the Institut National de la Recherche en Informatique et Automatique ([[INRIA]]), where he taught and promoted the use of numerical simulations using finite elements integration. Throughout his career, Lions insisted on the use of mathematics in industry, with a particular involvement in the French space program, as well as in domains such as energy and the environment.
This eventually led him to be appointed director of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales ([[CNES]]) from 1984 to 1992.

Lions was elected President of the [[International Mathematical Union]] in 1991 and also received the [[Japan Prize]] and the [[Harvey Prize]] that same year.&lt;ref name="isces"/&gt; In 1992, the [[University of Houston]] awarded him an honorary doctoral degree.  He was elected president of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1996 and was also a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] (ForMemRS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ciarlet | first1 = P.

He has left a considerable body of work, among this more than 400 scientific articles, 20 volumes of mathematics that were translated into English and Russian, and major contributions to several collective works, including the 4000 pages of the monumental ''Mathematical analysis and numerical methods for science and technology'' (in collaboration with Robert Dautray), as well as the ''Handbook of numerical analysis'' in 7 volumes (with [[Philippe G. Ciarlet]]).

His son [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] is also a well-known mathematician who was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ae-info.org/ae/User/Lions_Pierre-Louis|title=Academy of Europe: Lions Pierre-Louis|last=Hoffmann|first=Ilire Hasani, Robert|website=www.ae-info.org|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact both Father and Son have also both received recognition in the form of Honorary Doctorates from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1986 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14543">In [[theoretical computer science]], in particular in [[formal language theory]], '''Kleene's algorithm''' transforms a given [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) into a [[regular expression]]. 
Together with other conversion algorithms, it establishes the equivalence of several description formats for [[regular language]]s.

==Algorithm description==
According to Gross and Yellen (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Handbook of Graph Theory| year=2004| volume=| publisher=CRC Press| editor=Jonathan L. Gross and Jay Yellen| series=Discrete Mathematics and it Applications| isbn=1-58488-090-2}} Here: sect.2.1, remark R13 on p.65&lt;/ref&gt; the algorithm can be traced back to [[Kleene]] (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kleene, Stephen C.| title=Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automate| journal=Automata Studies, Annals of Math. Studies| year=1956| volume=34| publisher=Princeton Univ. Press| url=http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf}} Here: sect.9, p.37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

This description follows Hopcroft and Ullman (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John E. Hopcroft, Jeffrey D. Ullman| title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}} Here: Theorem 2.4, p.33-34&lt;/ref&gt;
Given a [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|deterministic finite automaton]] ''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''), with ''Q'' = { ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } its set of [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|states]], the algorithm computes 
:the sets ''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} of all strings that take ''M'' from state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; without going through any state numbered higher than ''k''. 
Here, "going through a state" means entering ''and'' leaving it, so both ''i'' and ''j'' may be higher than ''k'', but no intermediate state may.
Each set ''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} is represented by a regular expression; the algorithm computes them step by step for ''k'' = -1, 0, ..., ''n''. Since there is no state numbered higher than ''n'', the regular expression ''R''{{su|p=''n''|b=''0j''}} represents the set of all strings that take ''M'' from its [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|start state]] ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''F'' = { ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; } is the set of [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|accept states]], the [[regular expression#Formal definition|regular expression]] ''R''{{su|p=''n''|b=''01''}} | ... | ''R''{{su|p=''n''|b=''0f''}} represents the language [[deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition|accepted]] by ''M''.

The initial regular expressions, for ''k'' = -1, are computed as
:''R''{{su|p=−1|b=''ij''}} = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; | ... | ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if ''i''≠''j'', where δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''R''{{su|p=−1|b=''ij''}} = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; | ... | ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; | ε, if ''i''=''j'', where δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;

After that, in each step the expressions ''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} are computed from the previous ones by
:''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} = ''R''{{su|p=''k''-1|b=''ik''}} (''R''{{su|p=''k''-1|b=''kk''}})&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''R''{{su|p=''k''-1|b=''kj''}} | ''R''{{su|p=''k''-1|b=''ij''}}

By induction on ''k'', it can be shown that the length&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, the number of regular-expression symbols, "''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;", "ε", "|", "&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;", "·"; not counting parantheses.&lt;/ref&gt; of each expression ''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} is at most {{sfrac|4&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(6''s''+7) - 4|3}} symbols, where ''s'' denotes the number of characters in Σ.
Therefore, the length of the regular expression representing the language accepted by ''M'' is at most {{sfrac|4&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(6''s''+7)''f'' - ''f'' - 3|3}} symbols, where ''f'' denotes the number of final states.

==Example==
[[File:Deterministicfiniteautomaton.svg|thumb|Example DFA given to Kleene's algorithm]]

The automaton shown in the picture can be described as ''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') with
* the set of states ''Q'' = { ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; },
* the input alphabet Σ = { ''a'', ''b'' },
* the transition function δ with δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''a'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp; δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''b'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp; δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp; δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp; δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''a'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and δ(''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''b'')=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
* the start state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and
* set of accept states ''F'' = { ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }.

Kleene's algorithm computes the initial regular expressions as

| ''R''{{su|p=−1|b=00}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
| | = ''a'' | ε

| |  = ''a'' | ''b'' 
|-
| ''R''{{su|p=−1|b=22}} 
| |  = ε
|}

After that, the ''R''{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} are computed from the ''R''{{su|p=''k''-1|b=''ij''}} step by step for ''k'' = 0, 1, 2.
[[Kleene algebra]] equalities are used to simplify the regular expressions as much as possible.

Since ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the start state and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the only accept state, the regular expression ''R''{{su|p=2|b=01}} denotes the set of all strings accepted by the automaton.

'''KnownSafe''', Inc. was a [[cryptographic]] services company founded in April 2000 by [[Bruce Perens]], [[Len Sassaman]], and [[Rodney Thayer]]. The company aimed to provide novel cryptographic assurance capabilities to consumers based on privacy-preserving PKI techniques, but failed to secure necessary funding following the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3568">In [[number theory]], more specifically in [[p-adic analysis|''p''-adic analysis]], '''Krasner's lemma''' is a basic result relating the [[topological space|topology]] of a [[complete field|complete]] [[non-archimedean field]] to its [[algebraic extension]]s.

==Statement==
Let ''K'' be a complete non-archimedean field and let {{overline|''K''}} be a [[separable closure]] of ''K''. Given an element α in {{overline|''K''}}, denote its [[Galois conjugate]]s by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Krasner's lemma states:&lt;ref&gt;Lemma 8.1.6 of {{harvnb|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008) p.78&lt;/ref&gt;
:if an element ''β'' of {{overline|''K''}} is such that
::&lt;math&gt;\left|\alpha-\beta\right|&lt;\left|\alpha-\alpha_i\right|\text{ for }i=2,\dots,n &lt;/math&gt;
:then ''K''(''α'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''K''(''β'').

==Applications==
*Krasner's lemma can be used to show that [[Completion (ring theory)|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;-adic completion]] and separable closure of [[global field]]s commute.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 8.1.5 of {{harvnb|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words,  given &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; a [[algebraic number field#Places|prime]] of a global field ''L'', the separable closure of the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;-adic completion of ''L'' equals the &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;-adic completion of the separable closure of ''L'' (where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt; is a prime of {{overline|''L''}} above &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;).
*Another application is to proving that '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;mdash; the completion of the algebraic closure of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;mdash; is [[algebraically closed]].&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 10.3.2 of {{harvnb|Neukirch|Schmidt|Wingberg|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008) p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization==
Krasner's lemma has the following generalization.&lt;ref&gt;Brink (2006), Theorem 6&lt;/ref&gt;
Consider a monic polynomial 
::&lt;math&gt;f^*=\prod_{k=1}^n(X-\alpha_k^*)&lt;/math&gt; 
of degree ''n'' &gt; 1
with coefficients in a [[Henselian field]] (''K'', ''v'') and roots in the
algebraic closure {{overline|''K''}}. Let ''I'' and ''J'' be two disjoint,
non-empty sets with union {1,...,''n''}. Moreover, consider a
polynomial 
::&lt;math&gt;g=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;
with coefficients and roots in {{overline|''K''}}. Assume
::&lt;math&gt;\forall i\in I\forall j\in J: v(\alpha_i-\alpha_i^*)&gt;v(\alpha_i^*-\alpha_j^*).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the coefficients of the polynomials
::&lt;math&gt;g^*:=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\alpha_i^*),\ h^*:=\prod_{j\in J}(X-\alpha_j^*)&lt;/math&gt;
are contained in the field extension of ''K'' generated by the
coefficients of ''g''. (The original Krasner's lemma corresponds to the situation where ''g'' has degree 1.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1152">In mathematics and theoretical computer science the '''Lawson topology''', named after J. D. Lawson, is a topology on [[partially ordered set]]s used in the study of [[domain theory]]. The '''lower topology''' on a [[poset]] ''P'' is generated by the subbasis consisting of all complements of principal [[filter (mathematics)|filters]] on ''P''. The Lawson topology on ''P'' is the smallest common refinement of the lower topology and the [[Scott topology]] on&amp;nbsp;''P''.

== Properties ==

* If ''P'' is a complete upper [[semilattice]], the Lawson topology on ''P'' is always a complete ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topology.

The '''Leonardo numbers''' are a sequence of numbers given by the recurrence:
:&lt;math&gt; 
  L(n) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1                       &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
    1                       &amp; \mbox{if } n = 1 \\
    L(n - 1) + L(n - 2) + 1 &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 1 \\
  \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Edsger W. Dijkstra]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD07xx/EWD797.html EWD797]&lt;/ref&gt; used them as an integral part of his [[smoothsort]] [[algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|796a|Smoothsort – an alternative to sorting in situ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and also analyzed them in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD07xx/EWD796a.html EWD796a]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values==
The first few Leonardo numbers are
:&lt;math&gt;1,\;1,\;3,\;5,\;9,\;15,\;25,\;41,\;67,\;109,\;177,\;287,\;465,\;753,\;1219,\;1973,\;3193,\;5167,\;8361, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A001595}}

==Relation to Fibonacci numbers==
The Leonardo numbers are related to the [[Fibonacci number]]s by the relation &lt;math&gt;L(n) = 2 F(n+1) - 1, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

From this relation it is straightforward to derive a [[closed-form expression]] for the Leonardo numbers, analogous to Binet's formula for the Fibonacci numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;L(n) = 2 \frac{\varphi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}}{\varphi - \psi}- 1 = \frac{2}{\sqrt 5} \left(\varphi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}\right) - 1 = 2F(n+1) - 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \left(1 + \sqrt 5\right)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi = \left(1 - \sqrt 5\right)/2&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the [[quadratic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In the mathematical field of [[order theory]], a '''continuum''' or '''linear continuum''' is a generalization of the [[real line]].
 
Formally, a linear continuum is a [[linearly ordered set]] ''S'' of more than one element that is [[Dense order|densely ordered]], i.e., between any two distinct elements there is another (and hence infinitely many others), and which "lacks gaps" in the sense that every non-empty subset with an upper bound has a [[least upper bound]]. More symbolically:
&lt;ol type=a&gt;&lt;!--Referred to in text below as "property a" and "property b"--&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ''S'' has the [[least-upper-bound property]], and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For each ''x'' in ''S'' and each ''y'' in ''S'' with ''x'' &lt; ''y'', there exists ''z'' in ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] has the least upper bound property, if every [[nonempty]] [[subset]] of the set that is bounded above has a [[least upper bound]]. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of [[topology]] where they can be used to verify whether an [[total order|ordered set]] given the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=31,153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the standard real line, a linear continuum may be bounded on either side: for example, any (real) [[closed interval]] is a linear continuum.

==Examples==
* The ordered set of [[real number]]s, '''R''', with its usual [[Total order|order]] is a linear continuum, and is the archetypal example. Property b) is trivial, and property a) is simply a reformulaton of the [[completeness axiom]].

Examples in addition to the real numbers:
*sets which are [[Order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]] to the set of real numbers, for example a real open interval, and the same with half-open gaps (note that these are not gaps in the above-mentioned sense)
*the [[affinely extended real number system]] and order-isomorphic sets, for example the [[unit interval]]
*the set of real numbers with only +∞ or only −∞ added, and order-isomorphic sets, for example a half-open interval
*the [[long line (topology)|long line]]
* The set ''I'' × ''I'' (where × denotes the [[Cartesian product]] and ''I'' = [0, 1]) in the [[lexicographic order]] is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial. To check property a), we define a map, π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''I'' × ''I'' → ''I'' by:

:''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'', ''y'') = ''x''

This map is known as the [[projection map]]. The projection map is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] (with respect to the product topology on ''I'' × ''I'') and is [[surjective]]. Let ''A'' be a nonempty subset of ''I'' × ''I'' which is bounded above. Consider ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). Since ''A'' is bounded above, ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') must also be bounded above. Since, ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a subset of ''I'', it must have a least [[upper bound]] (since ''I'' has the [[least upper bound property]]). Therefore, we may let ''b'' be the least upper bound of ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). If ''b'' belongs to ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b'' × ''I'' will intersect ''A'' at say ''b'' × ''c'' for some ''c'' ∈ ''I''. Notice that since ''b'' × ''I'' has the same [[order type]] of ''I'', the set (''b'' × ''I'') ∩ ''A'' will indeed have a least upper bound ''b'' × ''c''', which is the desired least upper bound for ''A''.

If ''b'' does not belong to ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b'' × 0 is the least upper bound of ''A'', for if ''d'' &lt; ''b'', and ''d'' × ''e'' is an upper bound of ''A'', then ''d'' would be a smaller upper bound of ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') than ''b'', contradicting the unique property of ''b''.

==Non-examples==
* The set of [[rational number]]s is not a linear continuum. Even though property b) is satisfied, property a) is not. Consider the subset:

::''A'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' &lt; {{radic|2}} }

: of the set of rational numbers. Even though this set is bounded above by any rational number greater than {{radic|2}} (for instance 3), it has no [[least upper bound]] in the rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=G.H.|title=A Course of Pure Mathematics, 10th ed.|year=1952|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-09227-2|pages=11–15, 24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Specifically, for any rational upper bound ''r'' &gt; {{radic|2}}, ''r''/2 + 1/''r''  is a closer rational upper bound; details at {{section link|Methods of computing square roots|Babylonian method}}.)

* The set of non-negative [[integer]]s with its usual order is not a linear continuum. Property a) is satisfied (let ''A'' be a subset of the set of non-negative integers that is bounded above. Then ''A'' is [[Finite set|finite]] so that it has a maximum. This maximum is the desired least upper bound of ''A''). On the other hand, property b) is not. Indeed, 5 is a non-negative integer and so is 6, but there exists no non-negative integer that lies strictly between them.
* The [[total order|ordered set]] ''A'' of nonzero real numbers:

::''A'' = (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, +∞)

: is not a linear continuum. Property b) is trivially satisfied. However, if ''B'' is the set of negative real numbers:

::''B'' = (−∞, 0)

: then ''B'' is a subset of ''A'' which is bounded above (by any element of ''A'' greater than 0; for instance 1), but has no least upper bound in ''B''. Notice that 0 is not a bound for ''B'' since 0 is not an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A''.

* Let Z&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; denote the set of negative integers and let A = (0,5) ∪ (5,+∞). Let:

::S = Z&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ A

: Then S satisfies neither property a) nor property b). The proof is similar to the previous examples.

==Topological properties==
Even though linear continua are important in the study of [[total order|ordered sets]], they do have applications in the mathematical field of [[topology]]. In fact, we will prove that an [[total order|ordered set]] in the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] if and only if it is a linear continuum (notice the 'if and only if' part). We will prove one implication, and leave the other one as an exercise. (Munkres explains the second part of the proof &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Theorem'''

Let ''X'' be an ordered set in the [[order topology]]. If ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''X'' is a linear continuum.

''Proof:''

Suppose, x is in X and y is in X where x &lt; y. If there exists no z in X such that x &lt; z &lt; y, consider the sets:

A = (−∞, y)

B = (x, +∞)

These sets are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] (If a is in A, a &lt; y so that if a is in B, a &gt; x and a &lt; y which is impossible by hypothesis), [[nonempty]] (x is in A and y is in B) and open (in the [[order topology]]) and their union is X. This contradicts the connectedness of X.

Now we prove the least upper bound property. If C is a subset of X that is bounded above and has no least upper bound, let D be the union of all [[order topology|open rays]] of the form (b, +∞) where b is an upper bound for C. Then D is [[open set|open]] (since it is the union of open sets), and [[Closed set|closed]] (if 'a' is not in D, then a &amp;lt; b for all upper bounds b of C so that we may choose q &amp;gt; a such that q is in C (if no such q exists, a is the least upper bound of C), then an [[order topology|open interval]] containing a, may be chosen that doesn't intersect D). Since D is nonempty (there is more than one upper bound of D for if there was exactly one upper bound s, s would be the least upper bound. Then if b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two upper bounds of D with b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will belong to D), D and its complement together form a [[separated sets|separation]] on X. This contradicts the [[connectedness]] of X.

===Applications of the theorem===
1. Since the [[total order|ordered set]]:

A = (−∞, 0) U (0,+∞)

is not a linear continuum, it is disconnected.

2. By applying the theorem just proved, the fact that R is [[Connected space|connected]] follows. In fact any interval (or ray) in R is also connected.

3. The set of [[integers]] is not a linear continuum and therefore cannot be connected.

4. In fact, if an ordered set in the order topology is a linear continuum, it must be connected. Since any interval in this set is also a linear continuum, it follows that this space is [[locally connected space|locally connected]] since it has a [[Basis (topology)|basis]] consisting entirely of connected sets.

5. For an example of a [[topological space]] that is a linear continuum, see [[long line (topology)|long line]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9120">In [[linear algebra]], the '''linear span''' (also called the '''linear hull''' or just '''span''') of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[vector space|vectors]] in a [[vector space]] is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all [[linear subspace]]s which each contain every vector in that set. The linear span of a set of vectors is therefore a vector space. Spans can be generalized to [[matroid]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|modules]].

For expressing that a vector space {{mvar|V}} is a span of a set {{mvar|S}}, one commonly uses the following phrases: {{mvar|S}} spans {{mvar|V}}; {{mvar|V}} is spanned by {{mvar|S}}; {{mvar|S}} is a '''spanning set''' of {{mvar|V}}; {{mvar|S}} is a generating set of {{mvar|V}}.

==Definition==

Given a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', the span of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' of vectors (not necessarily infinite) is defined to be the intersection ''W'' of all [[linear subspace|subspaces]] of ''V'' that contain ''S''. ''W'' is referred to as the subspace ''spanned by'' ''S'', or by the vectors in ''S''. Conversely, ''S'' is called a ''spanning set'' of ''W'', and we say that ''S'' ''spans'' ''W''.

Alternatively, the span of ''S'' may be defined as the set of all finite [[linear combination]]s of elements of ''S'', which follows from the above definition.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span}(S) =  \left \{ {\left.\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i v_i \right| k \in \mathbb{N}, v_i  \in S, \lambda _i  \in \mathbf{K}} \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, if ''S'' is a [[finite set|finite]] subset of ''V'', then the span of ''S'' is the set of all linear combinations of the elements of ''S''. In the case of infinite ''S'', infinite linear combinations (i.e. where a combination may involve an infinite sum, assuming such sums are defined somehow, e.g. if ''V'' is a [[Banach space]]) are excluded by the definition; a [[Linear combination#Generalizations|generalization]] that allows these is not equivalent.

== Examples ==
[[File:Basis for a plane.svg|thumb|280px|right|The cross-hatched plane is the linear span of '''u''' and '''v''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

The [[real number|real]] vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has {(-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)} as a spanning set. This particular spanning set is also a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. If (-1,0,0) were replaced by (1,0,0), it would also form the [[standard basis|canonical basis]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Another spanning set for the same space is given by {(1,2,3), (0,1,2), (−1,1/2,3), (1,1,1)}, but this set is not a basis, because it is [[Linear dependency|linearly dependent]].

The set {(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0)} is not a spanning set of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; instead its span is the space of all vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whose last component is zero. That space (the space of all vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whose last component is zero) is also spanned by the set {(1,0,0), (0,1,0)}, as (1,1,0) is a linear combination of (1,0,0) and (0,1,0). It does, however, span '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The empty set is a spanning set of {(0, 0, 0)} since the empty set is a subset of all possible vector spaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and {(0, 0, 0)} is the intersection of all of these vector spaces.

The set of functions ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''n'' is a non-negative integer spans the space of polynomials.

==Theorems==

'''Theorem 1:''' The subspace spanned by a non-empty subset ''S'' of a vector space ''V'' is the set of all linear combinations of vectors in ''S''.

This theorem is so well known that at times it is referred to as the definition of span of a set.

'''Theorem 2:''' Every spanning set ''S'' of a vector space ''V'' must contain at least as many elements as any [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] set of vectors from ''V''.

'''Theorem 3:''' Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space. Any set of vectors that spans ''V'' can be reduced to a basis for ''V'' by discarding vectors if necessary (i.e. if there are linearly dependent vectors in the set). If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, this is true without the assumption that ''V'' has finite dimension.

This also indicates that a basis is a minimal spanning set when ''V'' is finite-dimensional.

== Generalizations ==
Generalizing the definition of the span of points in space, a subset ''X'' of the ground set of a [[matroid]] is called a ''spanning set'' if the rank of ''X'' equals the rank of the entire ground set{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

The vector space definition can also be generalized to modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algebra-Third-AMS-Chelsea-Publishing/dp/0821816462|title=Algebra: Third Edition|last=Lane|first=Saunders Mac|last2=Birkhoff|first2=Garrett|date=1999-02-28|publisher=EDS Publications Ltd.|isbn=9780821816462|pages=168|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given an ''R''-module ''A'' and any collection of elements a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of A, then the sum of [[cyclic module]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;Ra_1 + \cdots + Ra_n = \left \{ \sum_{k=1}^n r_k a_k \Big  |   r_k \in R \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

consisting of all ''R''-linear combinations of the given elements a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the [[submodule]] of ''A'' spanned by a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,a&lt;sub&gt;n.&lt;/sub&gt; As with the case of vector spaces, the submodule of A spanned by any subset of A is the intersection of all the submodules containing that subset.

==Closed linear span (functional analysis)==

{{Split section|date=May 2016}}In [[functional analysis]], a closed linear span of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[vector space|vectors]] is the minimal closed set which contains the linear span of that set.

Suppose that ''X'' is a normed vector space and let ''E'' be any non-empty subset of ''X''. The '''closed linear span''' of ''E'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Span}}(E)&lt;/math&gt;, is the intersection of all the closed linear subspaces of ''X'' which contain ''E''.

One mathematical formulation of this is

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)=\{u\in X | \forall\epsilon&gt;0\,\exists x\in\operatorname{Sp}(E) : \|x-u\|&lt;\epsilon\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The closed linear span of the set of functions ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' on the interval [0, 1], where ''n'' is a non-negative integer, depends on the norm used. If the [[Lp space#Lp spaces|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] is used, then the closed linear span is the [[Hilbert space]] of [[square-integrable function]]s on the interval. But if the [[maximum norm]] is used, the closed linear span will be the space of continuous functions on the interval. In either case, the closed linear span contains functions that are not polynomials, and so are not in the linear span itself. However, the [[cardinality]] of the set of functions in the closed linear span is the [[cardinality of the continuum]], which is the same cardinality as for the set of polynomials.

===Notes===

The linear span of a set is dense in the closed linear span. Moreover, as stated in the lemma below, the closed linear span is indeed the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the linear span.

Closed linear spans are important when dealing with closed linear subspaces (which are themselves highly important, consider [[Riesz's lemma]]).

===A useful lemma===

Let ''X'' be a normed space and let ''E'' be any non-empty subset of ''X''. Then

(a) &lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)&lt;/math&gt; is a closed linear subspace of ''X'' which contains ''E'',

(b) &lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)=\overline{\operatorname{Sp}(E)}&lt;/math&gt;, viz. &lt;math&gt;\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the closure of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sp}(E)&lt;/math&gt;,

(c) &lt;math&gt;E^\perp=(\operatorname{Sp}(E))^\perp=(\overline{\operatorname{Sp}(E)})^\perp.&lt;/math&gt;

(So the usual way to find the closed linear span is to find the linear span first, and then the closure of that linear span.)

'''Logically possible''' refers to a proposition which can be the [[logical consequence]] of another, based on the axioms of a given system of logic.&lt;ref name=Vaidya322&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaidya|first1=Anand|title=The Epistemology of Modality|url=http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/archives/sum2014/entries/modality-epistemology/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=10 October 2015|ref=Vaidya}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logical possibility of a proposition will depend on the system of logic being considered, rather than on the violation of any single rule. Some systems of logic restrict inferences from  [[Paraconsistent logic|inconsistent propositions]] or even allow for [[Dialetheism|true contradictions]]. Other logical systems have [[Many-valued logic|more than two truth-values]] instead of a [[Principle_of_bivalence|binary]] of such values. However, when talking about logical possibility it is often assumed that the system in question is [[classical propositional logic]]. Similarly, the criterion for logical possibility is often based on whether or not a proposition is contradictory and as such is often thought of as the broadest type of possibility.

Logical possibility should be distinguished from other sorts of subjunctive possibilities. But the relationship between modalities (if there is any) is the subject of debate and may depend on how one views logic, as well as the relationship between logic and [[metaphysics]]. For example, many philosophers following [[Saul Kripke]] have held that [[A posteriori necessity|discovered identities]] such as "Hesperus =  Phosphorus" are metaphysically necessary because they pick out the [[Rigid designator|same object]] in all possible worlds where the terms have a referent. However, it is nonetheless ''logically'' possible for “Hesperus = Phosphorus” to be false, since denying it doesn't violate a logical rule such as consistency. Other philosophers are of the view that logical possibility is broader than metaphysical possibility, so that anything which is metaphysically possible is also logically possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">In [[mathematics]] the '''monomial basis''' of a [[polynomial ring]] is its basis (as [[vector space]] or [[free module]] over the field or ring of coefficients) that consists in the set of all [[monomials]]. The monomials form a basis because every [[polynomial]] may be uniquely written as a finite [[linear combination]] of monomials (this is an immediate consequence of the definition of a polynomial).

==One indeterminate==

The [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''K''[''x'']}} of the [[univariate polynomial]] over a field {{math|''K''}} is a {{math|''K''}}-vector space, which has 
:&lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2,x^3, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
as an (infinite) basis. More generally, if {{math|''K''}} is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], {{math|''K''[''x'']}} is a [[free module]], which has the same basis.

The polynomials of degree at most {{math|''d''}} form also a vector space (or a free module in the case of a ring of coefficients), which has 
:&lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

as a basis

The '''canonical form''' of a polynomial is its expression on this basis:

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots + a_d x^d,&lt;/math&gt;

or, using the shorter [[sigma notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i.&lt;/math&gt;

The monomial basis is naturally [[total order|totally ordered]], either by increasing degrees
:&lt;math&gt;1&lt;x&lt;x^2&lt;\cdots, &lt;/math&gt;
or by decreasing degrees
:&lt;math&gt;1&gt;x&gt;x^2&gt;\cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

==Several indeterminates==

In the case of several indeterminates &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n,&lt;/math&gt; a monomial is a product
:&lt;math&gt;x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\cdots x_n^{d_n},&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[non-negative integer]]s. Note that, as &lt;math&gt;x_i^0=1,&lt;/math&gt; an exponent equal to zero means that the corresponding indeterminate does not appear in the monomial; in particular
&lt;math&gt; 1=x_1^0x_2^0\cdots x_n^0&lt;/math&gt;
is a monomial.

Similar to the case of univariate polynomials, the polynomials in &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; form a vector space (if the coefficients belong to a field) or a free module (if the coefficients belong to a ring), which has the set of all monomials as a basis, called the '''monomial basis'''

The [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; form a subspace which has the monomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d =d_1+\cdots+d_n&lt;/math&gt; as a basis. The dimension of this subspace is the number of monomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, which is 
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{d+n-1}{d}= \frac{n(n+1)\cdots (n+d-1)}{d!},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\binom{d+n-1}{d}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[binomial coefficient]].

The polynomials of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; form also a subspace, which has the monomials of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; as a basis. The number of these monomials is the dimension of this subspace, equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{d+n}{d}= \binom{d+n}{n}=\frac{(d+1)\cdots(d+n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Despite the univariate case, there is no natural [[total order]] of the monomial basis. For problem which require to choose a total order, such [[Gröbner basis]] computation, one generally chooses an ''admissible'' [[monomial order]] that is a total order on the set of monomials such that
:&lt;math&gt; m&lt;n\Leftrightarrow mq&lt;nq&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;1\leq m&lt;/math&gt;
for every monomials &lt;math&gt;m,n,q.&lt;/math&gt;

A polynomial can always be converted into monomial form by calculating its [[Taylor expansion]] around 0. For example, a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;\Pi_4&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;1+x+3x^4&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a manifold with boundary, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a submanifold of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. A is said to be a neat submanifold of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if it meets the following two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lectures on Dynamical Systems, Structural Stability, and Their Applications|first=Kotik K.|last=Lee|publisher=World Scientific|year=1992|isbn=9789971509651|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saQC-ZqEYj8C&amp;pg=PA109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The negativity  of a subsystem &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in terms of a [[density matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; as:     
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\rho) \equiv \frac{||\rho^{\Gamma_A}||_1-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt; \rho^{\Gamma_A} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial transpose]] of &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; with respect to subsystem &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; ||X||_1 = \text{Tr}|X| = \text{Tr} \sqrt{X^\dagger X} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[trace norm]] or the sum of the singular values of the operator &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

An alternative and equivalent definition is the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\rho^{\Gamma_A}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}(\rho) = \sum_i \frac{|\lambda_{i}|-\lambda_{i}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are all of the eigenvalues.

===Properties===

* Is a [[convex function]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i}) \le \sum_{i}p_{i}\mathcal{N}(\rho_{i})&lt;/math&gt;
* Is an [[entanglement monotone]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(P(\rho_{i})) \le \mathcal{N}(\rho_{i})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary  [[LOCC]] operation over  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;

==Logarithmic negativity==
The '''logarithmic negativity''' is an entanglement measure which is easily computable and an upper bound to the [[distillable entanglement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. B. Plenio|title=The logarithmic negativity: A full entanglement monotone that is not convex|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2005|volume=95|series=090503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.090503|accessdate=|arxiv = quant-ph/0505071 |bibcode = 2005PhRvL..95i0503P|pmid=16197196|page=090503}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;E_N(\rho) \equiv \log_2 ||\rho^{\Gamma_A}||_1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_A&lt;/math&gt; is the partial transpose operation and &lt;math&gt;|| \cdot ||_1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[trace norm]].

It relates to the negativity as follows:&lt;ref name = "ref1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_N(\rho) := \log_2( 2 \mathcal{N} +1)&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===

The logarithmic negativity 
* can be zero even if the state is entangled (if the state is [[PPT criterion|PPT entangled]]).
* does not reduce to the [[Von Neumann entropy|entropy of entanglement]] on pure states like most other entanglement measures.
* is additive on tensor products: &lt;math&gt;E_N(\rho \otimes \sigma) = E_N(\rho) + E_N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;
* is not asymptotically continuous. That means that for a sequence of [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] Hilbert spaces &lt;math&gt;H_1, H_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; (typically with increasing dimension) we can have a sequence of quantum states &lt;math&gt;\rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; which converges to &lt;math&gt;\rho^{\otimes n_1}, \rho^{\otimes n_2}, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; (typically with increasing &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;) in the [[trace distance]], but the sequence &lt;math&gt;E_N(\rho_1)/n_1, E_N(\rho_2)/n_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; does not converge to &lt;math&gt;E_N(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.
* is an upper bound to the distillable entanglement

The realization that the structure of DNA is that of a double-helix elucidated the mechanism of [[base pair]]ing by which genetic information is stored and copied in living organisms and is widely considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Crick, Wilkins, and Watson each received one third of the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their contributions to the discovery.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nobel Prize - List of All Nobel Laureates |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Franklin, whose breakthrough X-ray diffraction data was used to formulate the DNA structure, died in 1958, and thus was ineligible to be nominated for a Nobel Prize.)

==Nucleic acid hybridization==

{{Main|Nucleic acid thermodynamics}}
Hybridization is the process of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[base pair]]s binding to form a [[double helix]]. Melting is the process by which the interactions between the strands of the double helix are broken, separating the two nucleic acid strands. These bonds are weak, easily separated by gentle heating, [[enzyme]]s, or mechanical force. Melting occurs preferentially at certain points in the nucleic acid.&lt;ref name="Breslauer1986"&gt;{{cite journal 
|vauthors=Breslauer KJ, Frank R, Blöcker H, Marky LA |year=1986
| title=Predicting DNA duplex stability from the base sequence 
| journal=PNAS |volume=83 |issue=11 |pages=3746–3750 |pmid=3459152 |doi=10.1073/pnas.83.11.3746 |pmc=323600
| bibcode=1986PNAS...83.3746B}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''T'' and ''A'' rich regions are more easily melted than ''C'' and ''G'' rich regions. Some base steps (pairs) are also susceptible to DNA melting, such as ''T A'' and ''T G''.&lt;ref name="Owczarzy2008"&gt;{{cite web 
| title=DNA melting temperature - How to calculate it? 
| url=http://www.owczarzy.net/tm.htm 
| first=Richard |last=Owczarzy |date=2008-08-28 |work=High-throughput DNA biophysics |publisher=owczarzy.net |accessdate=2008-10-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanical features are reflected by the use of sequences such as ''[[TATA box|TATA]]'' at the start of many genes to assist RNA polymerase in melting the DNA for transcription.

Strand separation by gentle heating, as used in [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), is simple, providing the molecules have fewer than about 10,000 base pairs (10 kilobase pairs, or 10 kbp). The intertwining of the DNA strands makes long segments difficult to separate. The cell avoids this problem by allowing its DNA-melting enzymes ([[helicase]]s) to work concurrently with [[topoisomerase]]s, which can chemically cleave the phosphate backbone of one of the strands so that it can swivel around the other. [[Helicase]]s unwind the strands to facilitate the advance of sequence-reading enzymes such as [[DNA polymerase]].

==Base pair geometry==

[[File:CCF10292011 00000.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Base pair geometries]]

The geometry of a base, or base pair step can be characterized by 6 coordinates: shift, slide, rise, tilt, roll, and twist. These values precisely define the location and orientation in space of every base or base pair in a nucleic acid molecule relative to its predecessor along the axis of the helix. Together, they characterize the helical structure of the molecule. In regions of DNA or RNA where the ''normal'' structure is disrupted, the change in these values can be used to describe such disruption.

For each base pair, considered relative to its predecessor, there are the following base pair geometries to consider:&lt;ref name="Dickerson1989"&gt;{{cite journal

*'''Propeller''': rotation of one base with respect to the other in the same base pair.
*'''Opening'''
*'''Shift''': displacement along an axis in the base-pair plane perpendicular to the first, directed from the minor to the major groove.
*'''Slide''': displacement along an axis in the plane of the base pair directed from one strand to the other.
*'''Rise''': displacement along the helix axis.
*'''Tilt''': rotation around the shift axis.
*'''Roll''': rotation around the slide axis.
*'''Twist''': rotation around the rise axis.
*'''x-displacement'''

*'''inclination'''
*'''tip'''
*'''pitch''': the number of base pairs per complete turn of the helix.

Rise and twist determine the handedness and pitch of the helix. The other coordinates, by contrast, can be zero. Slide and shift are typically small in B-DNA, but are substantial in A- and Z-DNA. Roll and tilt make successive base pairs less parallel, and are typically small.

Note that "tilt" has often been used differently in the scientific literature, referring to the deviation of the first, inter-strand base-pair axis from perpendicularity to the helix axis. This corresponds to slide between a succession of base pairs, and in helix-based coordinates is properly termed "inclination".

==Helix geometries==
At least three DNA conformations are believed to be found in nature, [[A-DNA]], B-DNA, and [[Z-DNA]]. The ''B'' form described by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] is believed to predominate in cells.&lt;ref name=Richmond2003&gt;{{cite journal

The double helix makes one complete turn about its axis every 10.4–10.5 base pairs in solution. This frequency of twist (termed the helical ''pitch'') depends largely on stacking forces that each base exerts on its neighbours in the chain. The [[absolute configuration]] of the bases determines the direction of the helical curve for a given conformation.

A-DNA and Z-DNA differ significantly in their geometry and dimensions to B-DNA, although still form helical structures. It was long thought that the A form only occurs in dehydrated samples of DNA in the laboratory, such as those used in [[crystallography|crystallographic]] experiments, and in hybrid pairings of DNA and [[RNA]] strands, but DNA dehydration does occur [[in vivo]], and [[A-DNA#Biological function|A-DNA is now known to have biological functions]]. Segments of DNA that cells have been [[methylation|methylated]] for regulatory purposes may adopt the Z geometry, in which the strands turn about the helical axis the opposite way to A-DNA and B-DNA. There is also evidence of protein-DNA complexes forming Z-DNA structures.

===Grooves===
[[File:DNA-ligand-by-Abalone.png|thumb|Major and minor grooves of DNA. Minor groove is a binding site for the dye [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst 33258]].]]

Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found by tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not directly opposite each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&amp;nbsp;Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&amp;nbsp;Å wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R |title=Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5784 |pages=755–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7432492 |doi=10.1038/287755a0|bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984" /&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Non-double helical forms===
Alternative [[Non-helical models of DNA structure|non-helical models]] were briefly considered in the late 1970s as a potential solution to problems in [[DNA replication]] in [[plasmid]]s and [[chromatin]]. However, the models were set aside in favor of the double-helical model due to subsequent experimental advances such as [[X-ray crystallography]] of DNA duplexes and later the [[nucleosome core particle]], and the discovery of [[topoisomerase]]s. Also, the non-double-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stokes|first=T.

This dealt a death blow to the idea that other forms of DNA, particularly double helical DNA, exist as anything other than local or transient structures.}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA#Sense and antisense|Single-stranded nucleic acids]] (ssDNA) do not adopt a helical formation, and are described by models such as the [[random coil]] or [[worm-like chain]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Bending==
DNA is a relatively rigid polymer, typically modelled as a [[worm-like chain]]. It has three significant degrees of freedom; bending, twisting, and compression, each of which cause certain limits on what is possible with DNA within a cell. Twisting-torsional stiffness is important for the circularisation of DNA and the orientation of DNA bound proteins relative to each other and bending-axial stiffness is important for DNA wrapping and circularisation and protein interactions. Compression-extension is relatively unimportant in the absence of high tension.

===Persistence length, axial stiffness===

DNA in solution does not take a rigid structure but is continually changing conformation due to thermal vibration and collisions with water molecules, which makes classical measures of rigidity impossible to apply. Hence, the bending stiffness of DNA is measured by the persistence length, defined as:
{{quote|The length of DNA over which the time-averaged orientation of the polymer becomes uncorrelated by a factor of ''e''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

This value may be directly measured using an [[atomic force microscope]] to directly image DNA molecules of various lengths. In an aqueous solution, the average persistence length is 46–50&amp;nbsp;nm or 140–150 base pairs (the diameter of DNA is 2&amp;nbsp;nm), although can vary significantly. This makes DNA a moderately stiff molecule.

The persistence length of a section of DNA is somewhat dependent on its sequence, and this can cause significant variation. The variation is largely due to base stacking energies and the residues which extend into the [[minor groove|minor]] and [[major groove]]s.

The entropic flexibility of DNA is remarkably consistent with standard [[polymer physics]] models, such as the ''Kratky-Porod'' [[worm-like chain]] model.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Consistent with the [[worm-like chain]] model is the observation that bending DNA is also described by [[Hooke's law]] at very small (sub-[[Newton (unit)|piconewton]]) forces. However, for DNA segments less than the persistence length, the bending force is approximately constant and behaviour deviates from the worm-like chain predictions.

This effect results in unusual ease in circularising small DNA molecules and a higher probability of finding highly bent sections of DNA.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Bending preference===
DNA molecules often have a preferred direction to bend, i.e., [[anisotropic]] bending. This is, again, due to the properties of the bases which make up the DNA sequence - a random sequence will have no preferred bend direction, i.e., isotropic bending.

Preferred DNA bend direction is determined by the stability of stacking each base on top of the next. If unstable base stacking steps are always found on one side of the DNA helix then the DNA will preferentially bend away from that direction. As bend angle increases then steric hindrances and ability to roll the residues relative to each other also play a role, especially in the minor groove. ''A'' and ''T'' residues will be preferentially be found in the minor grooves on the inside of bends. This effect is particularly seen in DNA-protein binding where tight DNA bending is induced, such as in [[nucleosome]] particles. See base step distortions above.

DNA molecules with exceptional bending preference can become intrinsically bent. This was first observed in [[trypanosoma]]tid [[kinetoplast]] DNA. Typical sequences which cause this contain stretches of 4-6 ''T'' and ''A'' residues separated by ''G'' and ''C'' rich sections which keep the A and T residues in phase with the minor groove on one side of the molecule. For example:

{| style="text-align:center;"
|   || ¦ ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || ¦ ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || ¦ ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || ¦ ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || ¦ ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || ¦

|}
The intrinsically bent structure is induced by the 'propeller twist' of base pairs relative to each other allowing unusual bifurcated Hydrogen-bonds between base steps. At higher temperatures this structure is denatured, and so the intrinsic bend, is lost.

All DNA which bends anisotropically has, on average, a longer persistence length and greater axial stiffness. This increased rigidity is required to prevent random bending which would make the molecule act isotropically.

===Circularization===
DNA circularization depends on both the axial (bending) stiffness and torsional (rotational) stiffness of the molecule. For a DNA molecule to successfully circularize it must be long enough to easily bend into the full circle and must have the correct number of bases so the ends are in the correct rotation to allow bonding to occur. The optimum length for circularization of DNA is around 400 base pairs (136&amp;nbsp;nm){{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, with an integral number of turns of the DNA helix, i.e., multiples of 10.4 base pairs. Having a non integral number of turns presents a significant energy barrier for circularization, for example a 10.4 x 30 = 312 base pair molecule will circularize hundreds of times faster than 10.4 x 30.5 ≈ 317 base pair molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2005.05.007 |volume=15 |title=DNA Dynamics: Bubble ‘n’ Flip for DNA Cyclisation? |journal=Current Biology |pages=R377–R379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stretching==

===Elastic stretching regime===

Longer stretches of DNA are entropically elastic under tension. When DNA is in solution, it undergoes continuous structural variations due to the energy available in the [[Thermal bath (thermodynamics)|thermal bath]] of the solvent. This is due to the thermal vibration of the molecule combined with continual collisions with water molecules. For [[Entropy|entropic]] reasons, more compact relaxed states are thermally accessible than stretched out states, and so DNA molecules are almost universally found in a tangled relaxed layouts. For this reason, one molecule of DNA will stretch under a force, straightening it out. Using [[optical tweezers]], the entropic stretching behavior of DNA has been studied and analyzed from a [[polymer physics]] perspective, and it has been found that DNA behaves largely like the ''Kratky-Porod'' [[worm-like chain]] model under physiologically accessible energy scales.

===Phase transitions under stretching===

Under sufficient tension and positive torque, DNA is thought to undergo a [[phase transition]] with the bases splaying outwards and the phosphates moving to the middle. This proposed structure for overstretched DNA has been called ''P-form DNA'', in honor of [[Linus Pauling]] who originally presented it as a possible structure of DNA.&lt;ref name="Allemand1998" /&gt;

Evidence from mechanical stretching of DNA in the absence of imposed torque points to a transition or transitions leading to further structures which are generally referred to as ''S-form DNA''.  These structures have not yet been definitively characterised due to the difficulty of carrying out atomic-resolution imaging in solution while under applied force although many computer simulation studies have been made  (for example &lt;ref name="Konrad1996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Konrad MW, Bolonick JW |title=Molecular dynamics simulation of DNA stretching is consistent with the tension observed for extension and strand separation and predicts a novel ladder structure. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |pages=10989-10994 |year=1996 |doi=10.1021/ja961751x}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  &lt;ref name="Roe2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roe DR, Chaka AM |title=Structural basis of pathway-dependent force profiles in stretched DNA. |journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B |volume=113 |pages=15364–15371 |year=2009 |doi=10.1021/jp906749j |pmid=19845321}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Proposed S-DNA structures include those which preserve base-pair stacking and hydrogen bonding (GC-rich), while releasing extension by tilting, as well as structures in which partial melting of the base-stack takes place, while base-base association is nonetheless overall preserved (AT-rich).  

Periodic fracture of the base-pair stack with a break occurring once per three bp (therefore one out of every three bp-bp steps) has been proposed as a regular structure which preserves planarity of the base-stacking and releases the appropriate amount of extension  &lt;ref name="Bosaeus2017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bosaeus N, Reymer A, Beke-Somfai T, Brown T, Takahashi M, Wittung-Stafshede P, Rocha S, Nordén B  |title=A stretched conformation of DNA with a biological role? |journal=Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics |volume=50  |year=2017 |doi=10.1017/S0033583517000099}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with the term "Σ-DNA" introduced as a mnemonic, with the three right-facing points of the Sigma character serving as a reminder of the three grouped base pairs.

==Supercoiling and topology==
{{Main|DNA supercoil}}
[[File:Circular DNA Supercoiling.png|thumb|right|Supercoiled structure of circular DNA molecules with low writhe. The helical aspect of the DNA duplex is omitted for clarity.]]

The B form of the DNA helix twists 360° per 10.4-10.5 bp in the absence of torsional strain. But many molecular biological processes can induce torsional strain. A DNA segment with excess or insufficient helical twisting is referred to, respectively, as positively or negatively ''[[supercoil]]ed''. DNA ''in vivo'' is typically negatively supercoiled, which facilitates the unwinding (melting) of the double-helix required for RNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within the cell most DNA is topologically restricted. DNA is typically found in closed loops (such as [[plasmid]]s in prokaryotes) which are topologically closed, or as very long molecules whose diffusion coefficients produce effectively topologically closed domains. Linear sections of DNA are also commonly bound to proteins or physical structures (such as membranes) to form closed topological loops.

[[Francis Crick]] was one of the first to propose the importance of linking numbers when considering DNA supercoils. In a paper published in 1976, Crick outlined the problem as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In considering supercoils formed by closed double-stranded molecules of DNA certain mathematical concepts, such as the linking number and the twist, are needed. The meaning of these for a closed ribbon is explained and also that of the writhing number of a closed curve. Some simple examples are given, some of which may be relevant to the structure of chromatin.&lt;ref name=Crick1976&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crick FH |title=Linking numbers and nucleosomes |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=73 |issue=8 |pages=2639–43 |year=1976 |pmid=1066673 |doi=10.1073/pnas.73.8.2639 |pmc=430703 |bibcode = 1976PNAS...73.2639C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Analysis of DNA topology uses three values:
*''L'' = linking number - the number of times one DNA strand wraps around the other. It is an integer for a closed loop and constant for a closed topological domain.
*''T'' = twist - total number of turns in the double stranded DNA helix. This will normally tend to approach the number of turns that a topologically open double stranded DNA helix makes free in solution: number of bases/10.5, assuming there are no [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] agents (e.g., [[ethidium bromide]]) or other elements modifying the stiffness of the DNA.
*''W'' = writhe - number of turns of the double stranded DNA helix around the superhelical axis
*''L'' = ''T'' + ''W'' and &amp;Delta;''L'' = &amp;Delta;''T'' + &amp;Delta;''W''
Any change of T in a closed topological domain must be balanced by a change in W, and vice versa. This results in higher order structure of DNA. A circular DNA molecule with a writhe of 0 will be circular. If the twist of this molecule is subsequently increased or decreased by supercoiling then the writhe will be appropriately altered, making the molecule undergo plectonemic or toroidal superhelical coiling.

When the ends of a piece of double stranded helical DNA are joined so that it forms a circle the strands are [[knot theory|topologically knotted]]. This means the single strands cannot be separated any process that does not involve breaking a strand (such as heating). The task of un-knotting topologically linked strands of DNA falls to enzymes termed [[topoisomerase]]s. These enzymes are dedicated to un-knotting circular DNA by cleaving one or both strands so that another double or single stranded segment can pass through. This un-knotting is required for the replication of circular DNA and various types of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] in linear DNA which have similar topological constraints.

===The linking number paradox===
For many years, the origin of residual supercoiling in eukaryotic genomes remained unclear. This topological puzzle was referred to by some as the "linking number paradox".&lt;ref name=Prunell1998&gt;{{cite journal

A '''porism''' is a mathematical [[proposition]] or [[corollary]].  In particular, the term '''porism''' has been used to refer to a direct result of a proof, analogous to how a corollary refers to a direct result of a [[theorem]].
In modern usage, a '''porism''' is a relation that holds for an infinite range of values but only if a certain condition is assumed, for example [[Steiner chain|Steiner's porism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=College geometry|first=Howard W.|last=Eves|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0867204753|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originates from three books of Euclid with porism, that have been lost.
Note that a proposition may not have been proven, so a porism may not be a theorem, or for that matter, it may not be true.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The treatise which has given rise to this subject is the ''Porisms'' of [[Euclid]], the author of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. As much as is known of this lost treatise is due to the ''Collection'' of [[Pappus of Alexandria]], who mentions it along with other geometrical treatises, and gives a number of [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s necessary for understanding it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}} Pappus states:
:The porisms of all classes are neither theorems nor problems, but occupy a position intermediate between the two, so that their enunciations can be stated either as theorems or problems, and consequently some geometers think that they are really theorems, and others that they are problems, being guided solely by the form of the enunciation. But it is clear from the definitions that the old geometers understood better the difference between the three classes. The older geometers regarded a theorem as directed to proving what is proposed, a problem as directed to constructing what is proposed, and finally a porism as directed to finding what is proposed (''{{lang|grc|εἰς πορισμὸν αὐτοῦ τοῦ προτεινομένου|}}'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

Pappus goes on to say that this last definition was changed by certain later geometers, who defined a porism on the ground of an accidental characteristic as
"{{lang|grc|τὸ λεῖπον ὑποθέσει τοπικοῦ θεωρήματος}}" (''to leîpon hypothései topikoû theōrḗmatos''), that which falls short of a locus-theorem by a (or in its) hypothesis. Proclus points out that the word ''porism'' was used in two senses. One sense is that of "corollary", as a result unsought, as it were, but seen to follow from a theorem. On the ''porism'' in the other sense he adds nothing to the definition of "the older geometers" except to say that the finding of the center of a circle and the finding of the greatest common measure are porisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ed. Friedlein, p.&amp;nbsp;301&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

==Pappus on Euclid's porism==
Pappus gave a complete enunciation of a porism derived from Euclid, and an extension of it to a more general case. This porism, expressed in modern language, asserts the following: Given four straight lines of which three turn about the points in which they meet the fourth, if two of the points of intersection of these lines lie each on a fixed straight line, the remaining point of intersection will also lie on another straight line. The general enunciation applies to any number of straight lines, say ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, of which ''n'' can turn about as many points fixed on the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)th.  These ''n'' straight lines cut, two and two, in 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) points, 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) being a triangular number whose side is ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. If, then, they are made to turn about the ''n'' fixed points so that any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 of their 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) points of intersection, chosen subject to a certain limitation, lie on ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 given fixed straight lines, then each of the remaining points of intersection, 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) in number, describes a straight line. Pappus gives also a complete enunciation of one porism of the first book of Euclid's treatise.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

This may be expressed thus: If about two fixed points P, Q we make turn two straight lines meeting on a given straight line L, and if one of them cut off a segment AM from a fixed straight line AX, given in position, we can determine another fixed straight line BY, and a point B fixed on it, such that the segment BM' made by the second moving line on this second fixed line measured from B has a given ratio X to the first segment AM. The rest of the enunciations given by Pappus are incomplete, and he merely says that he gives thirty-eight lemmas for the three books of porisms; and these include 171 theorems. The lemmas which Pappus gives in connexion with the porisms are interesting historically, because he gives:
#the fundamental theorem that the cross or an harmonic ratio of a pencil of four straight lines meeting in a point is constant for all transversals;
#the proof of the harmonic properties of a complete quadrilateral;
#the theorem that, if the six vertices of a hexagon lie three and three on two straight lines, the three points of concourse of opposite sides lie on a straight line.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

From the 17th to the 19th centuries this subject seems to have had great fascination for mathematicians, and many geometers have attempted to restore the lost porisms. Thus [[Albert Girard]] says in his ''Traité de trigonometrie'' (1626) that he hopes to publish a restoration. About the same time [[Pierre de Fermat]] wrote a short work under the title ''Porismatum euclidaeorum renovata doctrina et sub forma isagoges recentioribus geometeis exhibita'' (see ''Œuvres de Fermat'', i., Paris, 1891); but two at least of the five examples of porisms which he gives do not fall within the classes indicated by Pappus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

===Later analysis===
[[Robert Simson]] was the first to throw real light upon the subject. He first succeeded in explaining the only three propositions which Pappus indicates with any completeness. This explanation was published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' in 1723. Later he investigated the subject of porisms generally in a work entitled ''De porismatibus traclatus; quo doctrinam porisrnatum satis explicatam, et in posterum ab oblivion tutam fore sperat auctor'', and published after his death in a volume, ''Roberti Simson opera quaedam reliqua'' (Glasgow, 1776).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

Simson's treatise, ''De porismatibus'', begins with definitions of theorem, problem, datum, porism and locus. Respecting the porism Simson says that Pappus's definition is too general, and therefore he will substitute for it the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Porisma est propositio in qua proponitur demonstrare rem aliquam, vel plures datas esse, cui, vel quibus, ut et cuilibet ex rebus innumeris, non quidem datis, sed quae ad ea quae data sunt eandem habent rationem, convenire ostendendum est affectionem quandam communem in propositione descriptam. Porisma etiam in forma problematis enuntiari potest, si nimirum ex quibus data demonstranda sunt, invenienda proponantur."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A locus (says Simson) is a species of porism. Then follows a Latin translation of Pappus's note on the porisms, and the propositions which form the bulk of the treatise. These are Pappus's thirty-eight lemmas relating to the porisms, ten cases of the proposition concerning four straight lines, twenty-nine porisms, two problems in illustration and some preliminary lemmas.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

[[John Playfair]]'s memoir (''Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.'', 1794, vol. iii.), a sort of sequel to Simson's treatise, had for its special object the inquiry into the probable origin of porisms, that is, into the steps which led the ancient geometers to the discovery of them. Playfair remarked that the careful investigation of all possible particular cases of a proposition would show that (1) under certain conditions a problem becomes impossible; (2) under certain other conditions, indeterminate or capable of an infinite number of solutions. These cases could be enunciated separately, were in a manner intermediate between theorems and problems, and were called "porisms." Playfair accordingly defined a porism thus: "A proposition affirming the possibility of finding such conditions as will render a certain problem indeterminate or capable of innumerable solutions."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

Though this definition of a porism appears to be most favoured in England, Simson's view has been most generally accepted abroad, and had the support of [[Michel Chasles]]. However, in [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]]'s ''Journal de mathematiques pures et appliquées'' (vol. xx., July, 1855), [[P. Breton]] published ''Recherches nouvelles sur les porismes d'Euclide'', in which he gave a new translation of the text of Pappus, and sought to base thereon a view of the nature of a porism more closely conforming to the definitions in Pappus. This was followed in the same journal and in ''La Science'' by a controversy between Breton and [[A. J. H. Vincent]], who disputed the interpretation given by the former of the text of Pappus, and declared himself in favour of the idea of Schooten, put forward in his ''Mathematicae exercitationes'' (1657), in which he gives the name of "porism" to one section. According to [[Frans van Schooten]], if the various relations between straight lines in a figure are written down in the form of equations or proportions, then the combination of these equations in all possible ways, and of new equations thus derived from them leads to the discovery of innumerable new properties of the figure, and here we have "porisms."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

The discussions, however, between Breton and Vincent, in which [[C. Housel]] also joined, did not carry forward the work of restoring Euclid's Porisms, which was left for Chasles. His work (''Les Trois livres de porismes d'Euclide'', Paris, 1860) makes full use of all the material found in Pappus. But we may doubt its being a successful reproduction of Euclid's actual work. Thus, in view of the ancillary relation in which Pappus's lemmas generally stand to the works to which they refer, it seems incredible that the first seven out of thirty-eight lemmas should be really equivalent (as Chasles makes them) to Euclid's first seven Porisms. Again, Chasles seems to have been wrong in making the ten cases of the four-line Porism begin the book, instead of the intercept-Porism fully enunciated by Pappus, to which the "lemma to the first Porism" relates intelligibly, being a particular case of it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

An interesting hypothesis as to the Porisms was put forward by [[Hyeronimus Georg Zeuthen|H. G. Zeuthen]] (''Die Lehre von den Kegelschnitten im Altertum'', 1886, ch. viii.). Observing, e.g., that the intercept-Porism is still true if the two fixed points are points on a conic, and the straight lines drawn through them intersect on the conic instead of on a fixed straight line, Zeuthen conjectures that the Porisms were a by-product of a fully developed projective geometry of conics. It is a fact that Lemma 31 (though it makes no mention of a conic) corresponds exactly to [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]'s method of determining the foci of a central conic (Conics, iii. 4547 with 42). The three porisms stated by [[Diophantus]] in his ''Arithmetica'' are propositions in the theory of numbers which can all be enunciated in the form "we can find numbers satisfying such and such conditions"; they are sufficiently analogous therefore to the geometrical porism as defined in Pappus and [[Proclus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

'''QuantLib''' is an open-source software library which provides tools for software developers and practitioners interested in [[financial instrument]] valuation and related subjects. QuantLib is written in [[C++]].

==History==
The QuantLib project was started by a few [[quantitative analyst]]s who worked at RiskMap (currently [http://statpro.com StatPro Italia]).  The first e-mail announcing QuantLib to the world was sent on December 11, 2000, and signed by Ferdinando Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio and Marco Marchioro. RiskMap was founded by Dario Cintioli, Ferdinando Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio, Adolfo Benin, and Marco Marchioro. The people at RiskMap faced the problem, not for the first time in their life, to build a financial library from scratch. It was Ferdinando's idea to build an open source library that could be used by quants all over the world when starting to build a new quantitative library. Currently, the QuantLib project is headed by Luigi Ballabio and Ferdinando Ametrano.

==History==

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] made the first conjectures about biquadratic reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;Euler, ''Tractatus'', § 456&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] published two monographs on biquadratic reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the biquadratic character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the biquadratic reciprocity law for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He said&lt;ref name="Gauss_c"&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 67&lt;/ref&gt; that a third monograph would be forthcoming with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The first published proofs were by Eisenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Lois de reciprocite''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Einfacher Beweis ...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Application de l'algebre ...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Beitrage zur Theorie der elliptischen ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then a number of other proofs of the classical (Gaussian) version have been found,&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, pp. 199–202&lt;/ref&gt; as well as alternate statements. Lemmermeyer states that there has been an explosion of interest in the [[rational reciprocity law]]s since the 1970s.{{ref label|A|A|}}&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer"&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integers==
A '''quartic''' or '''biquadratic residue''' (mod ''p'') is any number congruent to the fourth power of an integer (mod ''p''). If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''a'' (mod ''p'') does not have an integer solution, ''a'' is a '''quartic''' or '''biquadratic nonresidue'''  (mod ''p'').&lt;ref name="Gauss"&gt;Gauss, BQ § 2&lt;/ref&gt;

As is often the case in number theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all moduli ''p'', ''q'', etc., are assumed to positive, odd primes.&lt;ref name="Gauss" /&gt;

===Gauss===
The first thing to notice when working within the ring '''Z''' of integers is that if the prime number ''q'' is &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 4) then a residue ''b'' is a [[quadratic residue]] (mod ''q'') if and only if it is a biquadratic residue (mod ''q'').  Indeed, the first supplement of [[quadratic reciprocity]] states that &amp;minus;1 is a quadratic nonresidue (mod ''q''), so that for any integer ''x'', one of ''x'' and &amp;minus;''x'' is a quadratic residue and the other one is a nonresidue. Thus, if ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''q'') is a quadratic residue, then if ''a'' &amp;equiv; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a residue, ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''q'') is a biquadratic residue, and if ''a'' is a nonresidue, &amp;minus;''a'' is a residue, &amp;minus;''a'' &amp;equiv; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and again, ''r'' &amp;equiv; (&amp;minus;''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''q'')  is a biquadratic residue.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ § 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the only interesting case is when the modulus ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4).

Gauss proved&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ §§ 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; that if ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) then the nonzero residue classes (mod ''p'') can be divided into four sets, each containing (''p''&amp;minus;1)/4 numbers. Let ''e'' be a quadratic nonresidue. The first set is the quartic residues; the second one is ''e'' times the numbers in the first set, the third is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times the numbers in the first set, and the fourth one is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; times the numbers in the first set. Another way to describe this division is to let ''g'' be a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] (mod ''p''); then the first set is all the numbers whose indices with respect to this root are &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 4), the second set is all those whose indices are &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ § 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the vocabulary of [[group theory]], the first set is a subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 4 (of the multiplicative group '''Z'''/p'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;), and the other three are its cosets.

The first set is the biquadratic residues, the third set is the quadratic residues that are not quartic residues, and the second and fourth sets are the quadratic nonresidues. Gauss proved that &amp;minus;1 is a biquadratic residue if ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8) and a quadratic, but not biquadratic, residue, when ''p'' &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 8).&lt;ref name="Gauss_a"&gt;Gauss, BQ § 10&lt;/ref&gt;

2 is a quadratic residue mod ''p'' if and only if  ''p'' &amp;equiv; ±1 (mod 8). Since ''p'' is also &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), this means ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8). Every such prime is the sum of a square and twice a square.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA Art. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss proved&lt;ref name="Gauss_a" /&gt;

'''Let ''q'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8) be a prime number. Then '''&lt;br&gt;
:'''2 is a biquadratic residue (mod ''q'') if and only if ''a'' &amp;equiv; ±1 (mod 8), and'''
:'''2 is a quadratic, but not a biquadratic, residue (mod ''q'') if and only if ''a'' &amp;equiv; ±3 (mod 8).'''

Every prime ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) is the sum of two squares.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, Art. 182&lt;/ref&gt; If ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' is odd and ''b'' is even, Gauss proved&lt;ref&gt;Gauss BQ  §§ 14–21&lt;/ref&gt; that

2 belongs to the first (respectively second, third, or fourth) class defined above if and only if ''b'' &amp;equiv; 0 (resp. 2, 4, or 6) (mod 8). The first case of this is one of Euler's conjectures:

:'''2 is a biquadratic residue of a prime ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) if and only if ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 64''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.'''

===Dirichlet===

For an odd prime number ''p'' and a quadratic residue ''a'' (mod ''p''), [[Euler's criterion]] states that &lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod{p},&lt;/math&gt; so if ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), &lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p-1}{4}}\equiv\pm 1 \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Define the '''rational quartic residue symbol''' for prime ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) and quadratic residue ''a'' (mod ''p'') as &lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{a}{p}\Bigg)_4= \pm 1 \equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{4}} \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt; It is easy to prove that ''a'' is a biquadratic residue (mod ''p'') if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{a}{p}\Bigg)_4=  1.&lt;/math&gt;

Dirichlet&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, ''Demonstration ...''&lt;/ref&gt; simplified Gauss's proof of the biquadratic character of 2 (his proof only requires quadratic reciprocity for the integers) and put the result in the following form:

Let ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) be prime, and let ''i'' &amp;equiv; ''b''/''a'' (mod ''p''). Then
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{2}{p}\Bigg)_4 \equiv i^\frac{a b}{2}\pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (Note that ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; &amp;minus;1 (mod ''p'').)

In fact,&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Prop. 5.4&lt;/ref&gt; let ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 2''f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8) be prime, and assume ''a'' is odd. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{2}{p}\Bigg)_4 =\left(-1\right)^\frac{b}{4} =\Bigg(\frac{2}{c}\Bigg) =\left(-1\right)^{n+\frac{d}{2}} =\Bigg(\frac{-2}{e}\Bigg), &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{x}{q})&lt;/math&gt; is the ordinary [[Legendre symbol]].

Going beyond the character of 2, let the prime ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''b'' is even, and let ''q'' be a prime such that &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{p}{q})=1.&lt;/math&gt;  Quadratic reciprocity says that &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{q^*}{p})=1,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;q^*=(-1)^\frac{q-1}{2}q.&lt;/math&gt; Let &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''p'' (mod ''q''). Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Prop. 5.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{q^*}{p}\Bigg)_4= \Bigg(\frac{\sigma(b+\sigma)}{q}\Bigg).&lt;/math&gt; This implies&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 5.6&lt;/ref&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{q^*}{p}\Bigg)_4= 1 \mbox{ if and only if }
\begin{cases}
  b\equiv 0 \pmod{q};  &amp; \mbox{ or } \\
  a\equiv 0 \pmod{q} \mbox{ and } \left(\frac{2}{q}\right)=1; &amp; \mbox{ or }  \\
  a \equiv \mu b,\;\; \mu^2+1 \equiv \lambda^2 \pmod{q}\mbox{, and }\left(\frac{\lambda(\lambda+1)}{q}\right)=1.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first few examples are:&lt;ref&gt;Lemmmermeyer, pp.159, 190&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(\frac{-3}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;b&amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\\
\left(\frac{5}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;b&amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{5}\\
\left(\frac{-7}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;\mbox{ if and only if } &amp;ab&amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{7}\\
\left(\frac{-11}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;  \mbox{ if and only if }&amp; b(b^2-3a^2)&amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{11}\\
\left(\frac{13}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }  &amp;b(b^2-3a^2)&amp;\equiv 0\pmod{13}\\
\left(\frac{17}{p}\right)_4= 1 &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }\;\;\;\;&amp;  ab(b^2-a^2)&amp;\equiv 0\pmod{17}.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Euler had conjectured the rules for 2, &amp;minus;3 and 5, but did not prove any of them.

Dirichlet&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, ''Untersuchungen ...''&lt;/ref&gt;  also proved that if ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) is prime and &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{17}{p})=1&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{17}{p}\Bigg)_4\Bigg(\frac{p}{17}\Bigg)_4=
\begin{cases}
  +1  \mbox{ if and only if }\;\;p=x^2+17y^2 \\
  -1  \mbox{ if and only if }2p=x^2+17y^2
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This has been extended from 17 to 17, 73, 97, and 193 by Brown and Lehmer.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 5.19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burde===

There are a number of equivalent ways of stating Burde's rational biquadratic reciprocity law.

They all assume that ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and  ''q'' = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are primes where ''b'' and ''d'' are even, and that &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{p}{q})=1. &lt;/math&gt;

Gosset's version is&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_4 \equiv\Bigg(\frac{a/b - c/d}{a/b+c/d}\Bigg)^\frac{q-1}{4}\pmod{q}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Letting ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; &amp;minus;1 (mod ''p'') and ''j''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; &amp;minus;1 (mod ''q''), Frölich's law is&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_4 \Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_4 =\Bigg(\frac{a+bj}{q}\Bigg)=\Bigg(\frac{c+di}{p}\Bigg).
&lt;/math&gt;

Burde stated his in the form:&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen pp.128–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0169.36902 | last=Burde | first=K. | title=Ein rationales biquadratisches Reziprozitätsgesetz | language=German | journal=J.

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_4 \Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_4 =\Bigg(\frac{ac-bd}{q}\Bigg).
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 5.13&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{ac+bd}{p}\Bigg)=\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{ac-bd}{p}\Bigg).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Miscellany===

Let ''p'' &amp;equiv; ''q'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) be primes and assume &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{p}{q})=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q g''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has non-trivial integer solutions, and&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 5.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_4 \Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_4 =\left(-1\right)^\frac{fg}{2}\left(\frac{-1}{e}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''p'' &amp;equiv; ''q'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) be primes and assume ''p'' = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 5.6, credited to Brown&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_4 \Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_4 =\left(\frac{2}{q}\right)^s.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''p'' = 1 + 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be prime, let ''a'' be any odd number that divides ''x'', and let &lt;math&gt;a^*=\left(-1\right)^\frac{a-1}{2}a.&lt;/math&gt; Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.5, credited to Sharifi&lt;/ref&gt; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a biquadratic residue (mod ''p'').

Let ''p'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  + 4''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  + 2''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8) be prime. Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.11, credited to E. Lehmer&lt;/ref&gt; all the divisors of ''c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  &amp;minus; ''p a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;   are biquadratic residues (mod ''p''). The same is true for all the divisors of  ''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  &amp;minus; ''p b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Gaussian integers==

===Background===

In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity Gauss displays some examples and makes conjectures that imply the theorems listed above for the biquadratic character of small primes. He makes some general remarks, and admits there is no obvious general rule at work. He goes on to say

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theorems on biquadratic residues gleam with the greatest simplicity and genuine beauty only when the field of arithmetic is extended to '''imaginary''' numbers, so that without restriction, the numbers of the form ''a'' + ''bi'' constitute the object of study ... we call such numbers '''integral complex numbers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 30, translation in Cox, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; [bold in the original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These numbers are now called the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[Gaussian integers]], denoted by '''Z'''[''i'']. Note that ''i'' is a fourth root of 1.

In a footnote he adds

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of cubic residues must be based in a similar way on a consideration of numbers of the form ''a'' + ''bh'' where ''h'' is an imaginary root of the equation ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 ... and similarly the theory of residues of higher powers leads to the introduction of other imaginary quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 30, translation in Cox, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The numbers built up from a cube root of unity are now called the ring of [[Eisenstein integers]]. The "other imaginary quantities" needed for the "theory of residues of higher powers" are the [[Ring of integers|rings of integers]] of the [[Cyclotomic field|cyclotomic number field]]s; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are the simplest examples of these.

===Facts and terminology===

Gauss develops the arithmetic theory of the "integral complex numbers" and shows that it is quite similar to the arithmetic of ordinary integers.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, §§ 30–55&lt;/ref&gt; This is where the terms unit, associate, norm, and primary were introduced into mathematics.

The '''units''' are the numbers that divide 1.&lt;ref name="Gauss_b"&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 31&lt;/ref&gt; They are 1, ''i'', &amp;minus;1, and &amp;minus;''i''.  They are similar to 1 and &amp;minus;1 in the ordinary integers, in that they divide every number. The units are the powers of ''i''.

Given a number &amp;lambda; = ''a'' + ''bi'', its '''conjugate''' is  ''a'' &amp;minus; ''bi'' and its '''associates''' are the four numbers&lt;ref name="Gauss_b" /&gt;

: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lambda; = +''a'' + ''bi''
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;lambda; = &amp;minus;''b'' + ''ai''
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;lambda; = &amp;minus;''a'' &amp;minus; ''bi''
: &amp;minus;''i''&amp;lambda; = +''b'' &amp;minus; ''ai''

If &amp;lambda; = ''a'' + ''bi'', the '''norm''' of &amp;lambda;, written N&amp;lambda;, is the number ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If &amp;lambda; and &amp;mu; are two Gaussian integers, N&amp;lambda;&amp;mu; = N&amp;lambda;  N&amp;mu;; in other words, the norm is multiplicative.&lt;ref name="Gauss_b" /&gt; The norm of zero is zero, the norm of any other number is a positive integer. &amp;epsilon; is a unit if and only if N&amp;epsilon; = 1.  The square root of the norm of &amp;lambda;, a nonnegative real number which may not be a Gaussian integer, is the absolute value of lambda.

Gauss proves that '''Z'''[''i''] is a [[unique factorization domain]] and shows that the primes fall into three classes:&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, §§ 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 is a special case: 2 = ''i''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 + ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is the only prime in '''Z''' divisible by the square of a prime in '''Z'''[''i'']. In algebraic number theory, 2 is said to ramify in '''Z'''[''i''].
* Positive primes in '''Z''' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 4) are also primes in '''Z'''[''i'']. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to remain inert in '''Z'''[''i''].
* Positive primes in '''Z''' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) are the product of two conjugate primes in '''Z'''[''i'']. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to split in '''Z'''[''i''].

Thus, inert primes are 3, 7, 11, 19, ... and a factorization of the split primes is
:&amp;nbsp;5 = (2 + ''i'') × (2 &amp;minus; ''i''),
:13 = (2 + 3''i'') × (2 &amp;minus; 3''i''),
:17 = (4 + ''i'') × (4 &amp;minus; ''i''),
:29 = (2 + 5''i'') × (2 &amp;minus; 5''i''), ...

The associates and conjugate of a prime are also primes.

Note that the norm of an inert prime ''q'' is N''q'' = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4); thus the norm of all primes other than 1 + ''i'' and its associates is &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4).

Gauss calls a number in '''Z'''[''i''] '''odd''' if its norm is an odd integer.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 35. He defines "halfeven" numbers as those divisible by 1 + ''i'' but not by 2, and "even" numbers as those divisible by 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus all primes except 1 + ''i'' and its associates  are odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd and the conjugate and associates of an odd number are odd.

In order to state the unique factorization theorem, it is necessary to have a way of distinguishing one of the associates of a number. Gauss defines&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 36&lt;/ref&gt; an odd number to be '''primary''' if it is &amp;equiv; 1 (mod (1 + ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). It is straightforward to show that every odd number has exactly one primary associate. An odd number &amp;lambda; = ''a'' + ''bi'' is primary if ''a'' + ''b'' &amp;equiv; ''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4); i.e., ''a'' &amp;equiv; 1 and ''b'' &amp;equiv; 0, or ''a'' &amp;equiv; 3 and ''b'' &amp;equiv; 2 (mod 4).&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, Ch. 9.7&lt;/ref&gt; The product of two primary numbers is primary and the conjugate of a primary number is also primary.

The unique factorization theorem&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 37&lt;/ref&gt; for '''Z'''[''i''] is: if &amp;lambda; ≠ 0, then
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = i^\mu(1+i)^\nu\pi_1^{\alpha_1}\pi_2^{\alpha_2}\pi_3^{\alpha_3} \dots&lt;/math&gt;
where 0 &amp;le; &amp;mu; &amp;le; 3, &amp;nu; &amp;ge; 0, the &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s are primary primes and the &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s &amp;ge; 1, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.

The notions of [[congruence relation|congruence]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, §§ 38–45&lt;/ref&gt; and [[greatest common divisor]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, §§ 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; are defined the same way in '''Z'''[''i''] as they are for the ordinary integers '''Z'''. Because the units divide all numbers, a congruence (mod &amp;lambda;) is also true modulo any associate of &amp;lambda;, and any associate of a GCD is also a GCD.

===Quartic residue character===

Gauss proves the analogue of [[Fermat's little theorem|Fermat's theorem]]: if &amp;alpha; is not divisible by an odd prime &amp;pi;, then&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 51&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{N \pi - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
Since N&amp;pi; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{\frac{N\pi - 1}{4}}&lt;/math&gt; makes sense, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{\frac{N\pi - 1}{4}}\equiv i^k \pmod{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; for a unique unit ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

This unit is called the '''quartic''' or '''biquadratic residue character''' of &amp;alpha; (mod &amp;pi;) and is denoted by&lt;ref&gt;Gauss defined the character as the exponent ''k'' rather than the unit ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;; also, he had no symbol for the character.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is no standard notation for higher residue characters in different domains (see Lemmermeyer, p. xiv); this article follows Lemmermeyer, chs. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right] = i^k  \equiv \alpha^{\frac{N\pi - 1}{4}} \pmod{\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

It has formal properties similar to those of the [[Legendre symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, Prop 9.8.3&lt;/ref&gt;

:The congruence &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x^4 \equiv \alpha \pmod{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is solvable in '''Z'''[''i''] if and only if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right] = 1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ, § 61&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\alpha\beta}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg]\Bigg[\frac{\beta}{\pi}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg]}=\Bigg[\frac{\overline{\alpha}}{\overline{\pi}}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where the bar denotes [[complex conjugation]].

:if &amp;pi; and &amp;theta; are associates, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\theta}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

:if &amp;alpha; &amp;equiv; &amp;beta; (mod &amp;pi;), &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{\beta}{\pi}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

The biquadratic character can be extended to odd composite numbers in the "denominator" in the same way the Legendre symbol is generalized into the [[Jacobi symbol]]. As in that case, if the "denominator" is composite, the symbol can equal one without the congruence being solvable:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}\right] = \left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi_1}\right]^{\alpha_1} \left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi_2}\right]^{\alpha_2} \dots&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
\lambda = \pi_1^{\alpha_1}\pi_2^{\alpha_2}\pi_3^{\alpha_3} \dots&lt;/math&gt;

:If ''a'' and ''b'' are ordinary integers, ''a'' ≠  0, |''b''| &gt; 1, gcd(''a'', ''b'') = 1, then&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, Prop. 9.8.3, Lemmermeyer, Prop 6.8&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{a}{b}\right] = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Statements of the theorem===

Gauss stated the law of biquadratic reciprocity in this form:&lt;ref name="Gauss_c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;proofs are in Lemmermeyer, chs. 6 and 8, Ireland &amp; Rosen, ch. 9.7–9.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &amp;pi; and &amp;theta; be distinct primary primes of '''Z'''[''i'']. Then

:if either &amp;pi; or &amp;theta; or both are &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), then &lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg] =\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right], &lt;/math&gt; but

:if both &amp;pi; and &amp;theta; are &amp;equiv; 3 + 2''i'' (mod 4), then &lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg] =-\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

Just as the quadratic reciprocity law for the Legendre symbol is also true for the Jacobi symbol, the requirement that the numbers be prime is not needed; it suffices that they be odd relatively prime nonunits.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Th. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most well-known statement is:

Let &amp;pi; and &amp;theta; be primary relatively prime nonunits. Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, ch. 6, Ireland &amp; Rosen ch. 9.7–9.10&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg]\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right]^{-1}=
(-1)^{\frac{N\pi - 1}{4}\frac{N\theta-1}{4}}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are supplementary theorems&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Th. 6.9; Ireland &amp; Rosen, Ex. 9.32–9.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauss proves the law for 1 + ''i'' in BQ, §§ 68–76&lt;/ref&gt; for the units and the half-even prime 1 + ''i''.

if &amp;pi; = ''a'' + ''bi'' is a primary prime, then
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{i}{\pi}\Bigg]=i^{-\frac{a-1}{2}},\;\;\; \Bigg[\frac{1+i}{\pi}\Bigg]=i^\frac{a-b-1-b^2}{4},&lt;/math&gt;

and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{-1}{\pi}\Bigg]=(-1)^{\frac{a-1}{2}},\;\;\;  \Bigg[\frac{2}{\pi}\Bigg]=i^{-\frac{b}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, if &amp;pi; = ''a'' + ''bi'' is a primary prime, and ''b'' ≠ 0 then&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, Ex. 9.30; Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.6, where Jacobi is credited&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg[\frac{\overline{\pi}}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{-2}{\pi}\Bigg](-1)^\frac{a^2-1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(if ''b'' = 0 the symbol is 0).

Jacobi defined &amp;pi; = ''a'' + ''bi'' to be primary if ''a'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4). With this normalization, the law takes the form&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Th. 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &amp;alpha; = ''a'' + ''bi'' and &amp;beta; = ''c'' + ''di'' where ''a'' &amp;equiv; ''c'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) and ''b'' and ''d'' are even be relatively prime nonunits. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=
(-1)^{\frac{bd}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;

The following version was found in Gauss's unpublished manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &amp;alpha; = ''a'' + 2''bi'' and &amp;beta; = ''c'' + 2''di'' where ''a'' and ''c'' are odd be relatively prime nonunits. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=
(-1)^{bd+\frac{a-1}{2}d+\frac{c-1}{2}b},\;\;\;\;
\left[\frac{1+i}{\alpha}\right]=i^{\frac{b(a-3b)}{2}-\frac{a^2-1}{8}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The law can be stated without using the concept of primary:

If &amp;lambda; is odd, let &amp;epsilon;(&amp;lambda;) be the unique unit congruent to &amp;lambda; (mod (1 + ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); i.e., &amp;epsilon;(&amp;lambda;) = ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; &amp;lambda; (mod 2 + 2''i''), where 0 &amp;le; ''k'' &amp;le; 3. Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.18 and p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; for odd and relatively prime &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta;, neither one a unit,

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=
(-1)^{\frac{N\alpha-1}{4}\frac{N\beta-1}{4}}\epsilon(\alpha)^\frac{N\beta-1}{4}\epsilon(\beta)^\frac{N\alpha-1}{4}

&lt;/math&gt;

For odd &amp;lambda;, let &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*=(-1)^\frac{N\lambda-1}{4}\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; Then if &amp;lambda; and &amp;mu; are relatively prime nonunits, Eisenstein proved&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Ch. 8.4, Ex. 8.19&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right]=\Bigg[\frac{\mu^*}{\lambda}\Bigg].&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- content well understood. --&gt;{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2014}}
In [[computer science]], a '''relational operator''' is a [[programming language]] construct or [[Operator (programming)|operator]] that tests or defines some kind of [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] between [[Binary function|two entities]]. These include numerical [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] (''e.g.'', &lt;!--can't use = within template--&gt;{{nowrap|5 &amp;#61; 5}}) and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] (''e.g.'', {{nowrap|4 ≥ 3}}).

In programming languages that include a distinct [[boolean data type]] in their [[type system]], like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], these operators usually evaluate to true or false, depending on if the conditional relationship between the two [[operand]]s holds or not. In languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], relational operators return the integers 0 or 1, where 0 stands for false and any non-zero value stands for true.

An [[expression (programming)|expression]] created using a relational operator forms what is termed a ''relational expression'' or a ''condition''. Relational operators can be seen as special cases of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].

==Equality==

===Usage===
Equality is being used in many programming-language constructs and data types. It is used to test if an element already exists in a [[set (computer science)|set]], or to access to a value through a key. It is used in [[switch statement]]s to dispatch the control flow to the correct branch, and during the unification process in logic programming.

One of the possible meaning of equality is that "if a equals to b, then we can use either a or b interchangeably in any context without noticing any difference". But this statement does not necessarily hold, particularly when taking into account mutability together with content equality.

===Sameness (object identity) vs. content equality ===
Sometimes, particularly in [[object-oriented programming]], the comparison raises questions of [[data type]]s and [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], [[equality (mathematics)|equality]], and [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]. It is often necessary to distinguish between:
* two different objects of the same type, ''e.g.'', two hands
* two objects being equal but distinct, ''e.g.'', two $10 banknotes
* two objects being equal but have different representation, ''e.g.'', a $1 bill and a $1 coin
* two different references to the same object, ''e.g.'', two nicknames for the same person

In many modern programming languages, objects and data structures are accessed through [[Reference (computer science)|references]]. In such languages, there becomes a need to test for two different types of equality:
* Physical equality: if two references (A and B) reference the same object. Interactions with the object through A are indistinguishable from the same interactions through B, and in particular changes to the object through A are reflected through B. Physical identity is not applicable when talking about values instead of objects.
* Semantic equality: if the objects referenced by two references, or if two values, are equivalent in some sense:
:* Structural equality (''i.e.'', their contents are the same). which may be either shallow (testing only immediate subparts), or deep (testing for equality of subparts recursively). A simple way to achieve this is through representational equality: checking that the values have the same representation.
:* Some other tailor-made equality, preserving the external behavior. For example, 1/2 and 2/4 are considered equal when seen as a rational number. A possible requirement would be that "A = B if and only if all operations on objects A and B will have the same result", in addition to [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]], [[symmetry]], and [[transitive relation|transitivity]].

The first type of equality usually implies the second (except for things like ''not a number'' ([[NaN]]) which are unequal to themselves), but the converse is not necessarily true. For example, two [[String (computer science)|string]] objects may be distinct objects (unequal in the first sense) but contain the same sequence of characters (equal in the second sense). See [[identity (object-oriented programming)|identity]] for more of this issue.

Real numbers, including many simple [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], cannot be represented exactly in [[floating-point arithmetic]], and it may be necessary to test for equality within a given tolerance. Such tolerance, however, can easily break desired properties such as transitivity, whereas reflexivity breaks too: the [[IEEE floating point]] standard requires that &lt;code&gt;Nan ≠ NaN&lt;/code&gt; holds.

Other programming elements such as computable functions, may either have no sense of equality, or an equality that is uncomputable. For these reasons, some languages define an explicit notion of "comparable", in the form of a base class, an interface, a trait or a protocol, which is used either explicitly, by declaration in source code, or implicitly, via the structure of the type involved.

===Comparing values of different types===
In [[JavaScript]], [[PHP]], [[VBScript]] and a few other [[Type system#DYNAMIC|dynamically typed]] languages, the standard equality operator evaluates to ''true'' if two values are equal, even if they have different types, making the number 4 compare equal to the text string "4", for instance. A typed equality operator is often available also, in such languages, returning true only for values with identical or equivalent types (in PHP 5, &lt;code&gt;4 === "4"&lt;/code&gt; is false although &lt;code&gt;4 == "4"&lt;/code&gt; is true).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.object-comparison.php |title=Comparing Objects |work=PHP Manual |publisher=PHP Group |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |author=[http://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php#contributors Contributors]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="php"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php |title=PHP: Comparison Operators - Manual|accessdate=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For languages where the number 0 may be interpreted as ''false'', this operator may simplify things such as checking for zero (as &lt;code&gt;x == 0&lt;/code&gt; would be true for x being either 0 or "0" using the type agnostic equality operator).

== Ordering ==
''Greater than'' and ''less than'' comparison of non-numeric data is performed according to a sort convention (such as, for text strings, [[lexicographical order]]) which may be built into the programming language and/or configurable by a programmer.

When it is desired to associate a numeric value with the result of a comparison between two data items, say ''a'' and ''b'', the usual convention is to assign &amp;minus;1 if a &lt; b, 0 if a = b and 1 if a &gt; b. For example, the C function &lt;code&gt;[[strcmp]]&lt;/code&gt; performs a [[three-way comparison]] and returns &amp;minus;1, 0, or 1 according to this convention, and [[qsort]] expects the comparison function to return values according to this convention. In [[sorting algorithm]]s, the efficiency of comparison code is critical since it is one of the major factors contributing to sorting performance.

Comparison of programmer-defined [[data type]]s (data types for which the programming language has no in-built understanding) may be carried out by custom-written or library functions (such as &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; mentioned above), or, in some languages, by ''[[Operator overloading|overloading]]'' a comparison operator – that is, assigning a programmer-defined meaning that depends on the data types being compared. Another alternative is using some convention such as memberwise comparison.

==Logical equivalence==
Though perhaps unobvious at first, like the [[Boolean logic|boolean]] [[logical operator]]s XOR, AND, OR, and NOT, relational operators can be designed to have [[logical equivalence]], such that they can all be defined in terms of one another. The following four conditional statements all have the same logical equivalence ''E'' (either all true or all false) for any given ''x'' and ''y'' values:
:&lt;math&gt;
E = \begin{cases}
x &lt; y \\
y &gt; x \\
x \ngeq y \\
y \nleq x
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This relies on the domain being [[well ordered]].

Other conventions are less common: [[Common Lisp]] and [[Macsyma]]/[[Maxima (software)|Maxima]] use Basic-like operators except for inequality, which is &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt; in Common Lisp and &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; in Macsyma/Maxima. Older [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisps]] used &lt;code&gt;equal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;greaterp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;lessp&lt;/code&gt;; and negated them using &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; for the remaining operators.

==Syntax==
Relational operators are also used in technical literature instead of words. Relational operators are usually written in [[infix notation]], if supported by the programming language, which means that they appear between their operands (the two expressions being related). For example, an expression in Python will print the message if the ''x'' is less than ''y'':
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
if x &lt; y:
    print("x is less than y in this example")
&lt;/source&gt;

Other programming languages, such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], use [[prefix notation]], as follows:
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(&gt;= X Y)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Operator chaining===
In mathematics, it is common practice to chain relational operators, such as in 3 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 20 (meaning 3 &lt; x ''and'' x &lt; y ''and'' y &lt; 20). The syntax is clear since these relational operators in mathematics are transitive.

However, many recent programming languages would see an expression like 3 &lt; x &lt; y as consisting of two left (or right-) associative operators, interpreting it as something like &lt;code&gt;(3 &lt; x) &lt; y&lt;/code&gt;. If we say that x=4, we then get &lt;code&gt;(3 &lt; 4) &lt; y&lt;/code&gt;, and evaluation will give &lt;code&gt;true &lt; y&lt;/code&gt; which generally does not make sense. However, it does compile in C/C++ and some other languages, yielding surprising result (as ''true'' would be represented by the number 1 here).

It is possible to give the expression &lt;code&gt;x &lt; y &lt; z&lt;/code&gt; its familiar mathematical meaning, and some programming languages such as Python and Perl 6 do that. Others, such as C# and Java, do not, partly because it would differ from the way most other infix operators work in C-like languages. The D programming language do not do that since it maintains some compatibility with C, and "Allowing C expressions but with subtly different semantics (albeit arguably in the right direction) would add more confusion than convenience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexandrescu |first=Andrei |date= |title=The D Programming Language |url= |location= |publisher=Addison Wesley |page=58 |isbn=978-0-321-63536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages, like [[Common Lisp]], use multiple argument predicates for this. In Lisp &lt;code&gt;(&lt;= 1 x 10)&lt;/code&gt; is true when x is between 1 and 10.

===Confusion with assignment operators===
{{See also|Assignment (computer science)#Assignment versus equality}}
Early FORTRAN (1956–57) was bounded by heavily restricted character sets where &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was the only relational operator available. There were no &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (and certainly no &lt;code&gt;≤&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;≥&lt;/code&gt;). This forced the designers to define symbols such as &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GE.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt; etc. and subsequently made it tempting to use the remaining &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; character for copying, despite the obvious incoherence with mathematical usage (&lt;code&gt;X=X+1&lt;/code&gt; should be impossible).

International Algebraic Language (IAL, [[ALGOL 58]]) and [[ALGOL]] (1958 and 1960) thus introduced &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment, leaving the standard &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; available for equality, a convention followed by [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]], [[ALGOL W]], [[ALGOL 68]], Basic Combined Programming Language ([[BCPL]]), [[Simula]], SET Language ([[SETL]]), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Modula-2]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Standard ML]], [[OCaml]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Object Pascal]] ([[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]]), [[Oberon]], [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], VHSIC Hardware Description Language ([[VHDL]]), and several other languages.

====B and C====
This uniform de facto standard among most programming languages was eventually changed, indirectly, by a minimalist compiled language named [[B (programming language)|B]]. Its sole intended application was as a vehicle for a first port of (a then very primitive) [[Unix]], but it also evolved into the very influential [[C (programming language)|C]] language.

B started off as a syntactically changed variant of the systems programming language [[BCPL]], a simplified (and typeless) version of [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]]. In what has been described as a "strip-down" process, the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operators of BCPL&lt;ref&gt;Used not only in ALGOL-like languages, but also in FORTRAN and BASIC&lt;/ref&gt; were replaced with &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; (which would later become &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;As some programmers were confused by the dual meanings (bitwise operator, and logical connective) of these new symbols (according to [[Dennis Ritchie]]). Only the bitwise meaning of &amp; and | were kept.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the same process, the ALGOL style &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; of BCPL was replaced by &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; in B. The reason for all this being unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[Dennis Ritchie]] has suggested that this may have had to do with "economy of typing" as updates of variables may be more frequent than comparisons in certain types of programs&lt;/ref&gt; As variable updates had no special syntax in B (such as &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; or similar) and were allowed in expressions, this non standard meaning of the equal sign meant that the traditional semantics of the equal sign now had to be associated with another symbol. [[Ken Thompson]] used the ad hoc &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; combination for this.

As a small type system was later introduced, B then became C. The popularity of this language along with its association with Unix, led to Java, C#, and many other languages following suit, syntactically, despite this needless conflict with the mathematical meaning of the equal sign.

====Languages====
Assignments in C have a [[value (programming)|value]] and since any non-zero scalar value is interpreted as ''true'' in [[Conditional (programming)|conditional expression]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A zero scalar value is interpreted as false while any non-zero scalar value is interpreted as true; this is typically used with integer types, similar to [[assembly language]] idioms.&lt;/ref&gt; the code &lt;code&gt;if (x = y)&lt;/code&gt; is legal, but has a very different meaning from &lt;code&gt;if (x == y)&lt;/code&gt;. The former code fragment means "assign ''y'' to ''x'', and if the new value of ''x'' is not zero, execute the following statement". The latter fragment means "[[if and only if]] ''x'' is equal to ''y'', execute the following statement".&lt;ref name="kandr"&gt;{{cite book |title=The C Programming Language |author=Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie |publisher=Prentice Hall |origyear=1978 |year=1988 |edition=Second}}, 19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  int x = 1;
  int y = 2;
  if (x = y) {
      /* This code will always execute if y is anything but 0*/
      printf("x is %d and y is %d\n", x, y);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Though [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have the same operators as C, this mistake usually causes a compile error in these languages instead, because the if-condition must be of type &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;, and there is no implicit way to convert from other types (''e.g.'', numbers) into &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;s. So unless the variable that is assigned to has type &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; (or wrapper type &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;), there will be a compile error.

In ALGOL-like languages such as Pascal, Delphi, and Ada (in the sense that they allow [[nested function definition]]s), and in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and many functional languages, among others, assignment operators cannot appear in an [[expression (programming)|expression]] (including &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; clauses), thus precluding this class of error. Some compilers, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), provide a warning when compiling code containing an assignment operator inside an if statement, though there are some legitimate uses of an assignment inside an if-condition. In such cases, the assignment must be wrapped in an extra pair of parentheses explicitly, to avoid the warning.

Similarly, some languages, such as [[BASIC]] use just the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; symbol for both assignment ''and'' equality, as they are syntactically separate (as with Pascal, Ada, Python, etc., assignment operators cannot appear in expressions).

Some programmers get in the habit of writing comparisons against a constant in the reverse of the usual order:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  if (2 == a) {   /* Mistaken use of = versus == would be a compile-time error */
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is used accidentally, the resulting code is invalid because 2 is not a variable. The compiler will generate an error message, on which the proper operator can be substituted. This coding style is termed left-hand comparison, or [[Yoda conditions]].

This table lists the different mechanisms to test for these two types of equality in various languages:

In [[combinatorics]], the '''rule of product''' or '''multiplication principle''' is a basic [[combinatorial principles|counting principle]] (a.k.a. the fundamental principle of counting).  Stated simply, it is the idea that if there are '''a''' ways of doing something and '''b''' ways of doing another thing, then there are '''a'''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;'''b''' ways of performing both actions.&lt;ref name=transition&gt;Johnston, William, and Alex McAllister. ''A transition to advanced mathematics''. Oxford Univ. Press, 2009. Section 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtamu.edu/academic/anns/mps/math/mathlab/col_algebra/col_alg_tut55_count.htm|title=College Algebra Tutorial 55: Fundamental Counting Principle|accessdate= December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
&amp; \underbrace{ \left\{A,B,C\right\} }
&amp; &amp; \underbrace{ \left\{ X,Y\right\} } \\
\mathrm{To}\ \mathrm{choose}\ \mathrm{one}\ \mathrm{of} &amp; \mathrm{these} &amp;
\mathrm{AND}\ \mathrm{one}\ \mathrm{of} &amp; \mathrm{these}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{is}\ \mathrm{to}\ \mathrm{choose}\ \mathrm{one}\ \mathrm{of} &amp; \mathrm{these}. \\
&amp; \overbrace{ \left\{ AX, AY, BX, BY, CX, CY \right\} }
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, the rule says: multiply 3 by 2, getting 6.

The sets {''A'', ''B'', ''C''} and {''X'', ''Y''} in this example are [[disjoint sets]], but that is not necessary.  The number of ways to choose a member of {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, and then to do so again, in effect choosing an [[ordered pair]] each of whose components is in {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, is 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.

As another example, when you decide to order pizza, you must first choose the type of crust: thin or deep dish (2 choices). Next, you choose one topping: cheese, pepperoni, or sausage (3&amp;nbsp;choices). 

Using the rule of product, you know that there are 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 possible combinations of ordering a pizza.

==Applications==
In [[set theory]], this multiplication principle is often taken to be the definition of the product of [[cardinal number]]s.&lt;ref name=transition /&gt;  We have

:&lt;math&gt;|S_{1}|\cdot|S_{2}|\cdots|S_{n}| = |S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \cdots \times S_{n}| &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \times &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cartesian product]] operator.  These sets need not be finite, nor is it necessary to have only finitely many factors in the product; see [[cardinal number]].

==Related concepts==
The [[rule of sum]] is another basic [[combinatorial principles|counting principle]].  Stated simply, it is the idea that if we have ''a'' ways of doing something and ''b'' ways of doing another thing and we can not do both at the same time, then there are ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' ways to choose one of the actions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Kenneth H., ed. ''Handbook of discrete and combinatorial mathematics.'' CRC pres, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[death]] or serious injury to people
* loss or severe damage to equipment/property
* environmental harm

A '''safety-related system''' (or sometimes '''safety-involved system''') comprises everything (hardware, software, and human aspects) needed to perform one or more safety functions, in which failure would cause a significant increase in the safety risk for the people and/or environment involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/faq-ed2/page5.htm | title=IEC 61508 – Functional Safety | chapter=FAQ – Edition 2.0: E) Key concepts | publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] | accessdate=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety-related systems are those that do not have full responsibility for controlling hazards such as loss of life, severe injury or severe [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]].  The malfunction of a safety-involved system would only be that hazardous in conjunction with the failure of other systems or [[human error]]. Some safety organizations provide guidance on safety-related systems, for example the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/topics/mancomppt1.pdf | title=Managing competence for safety-related systems | chapter=Part 1: Key guidance | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | location=UK | date=2007 | accessdate=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risks of this sort are usually managed with the methods and tools of [[safety engineering]]. A safety-critical system is designed to lose less than one life per billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;AC 25.1309-1A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen99"&gt;{{cite article| first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Bowen | authorlink=Jonathan Bowen | title=The Ethics of Safety-Critical Systems | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | volume=43 | number=4 | pages=91–97 | date=April 2000 | doi=10.1145/332051.332078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical design methods include [[Probabilistic Risk Assessment|probabilistic risk assessment]], a method that combines [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)]] with [[fault tree analysis|fault tree ana look]]

[[fault tree analysis|lysis]]. Safety-critical systems are increasingly [[computer system|computer]]-based.

==Reliability regimes==
Several reliability regimes for safety-critical systems exist: 

* '''Fail-operational systems''' continue to operate when their control systems fail. Examples of these include [[elevator]]s, the gas [[thermostat]]s in most home furnaces, and [[Passive nuclear safety|passively safe nuclear reactors]]. Fail-operational mode is sometimes unsafe. [[Nuclear weapon]]s launch-on-loss-of-communications was rejected as a control system for the U.S. nuclear forces because it is fail-operational: a loss of communications would cause launch, so this mode of operation was considered too risky.  This is contrasted with the [[Fail-deadly]] behavior of the  [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|Perimeter]] system built during the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-10/mf_deadhand|title=Inside the Apocalyptic Soviet Doomsday Machine|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fail-soft systems''' are able to continue operating on an interim basis with reduced efficiency in case of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fail-soft|title=Definition fail-soft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most spare tires are an example of this: They usually come with certain restrictions (e.g. a speed restriction) and lead to lower fuel economy. Another example is the "Safe Mode" found in most Windows operating systems.
* '''[[Fail-safe]] systems''' become safe when they cannot operate.  Many medical systems fall into this category. For example, an [[infusion pump]] can fail, and as long as it alerts the nurse and ceases pumping, it will not threaten the loss of life because its [[safety interval]] is long enough to permit a human response. In a similar vein, an industrial or domestic burner controller can fail, but must fail in a safe mode (i.e. turn combustion off when they detect faults). Famously, [[nuclear weapon]] systems that launch-on-command are fail-safe, because if the communications systems fail, launch cannot be commanded. [[Railway signaling]] is designed to be fail-safe.
* '''[[Fail-secure]] systems''' maintain maximum security when they cannot operate. For example, while fail-safe electronic doors unlock during power failures, fail-secure ones will lock, keeping an area secure.
* '''Fail-Passive systems''' continue to operate in the event of a system failure. An example includes an aircraft [[autopilot]]. In the event of a failure, the aircraft would remain in a controllable state and allow the pilot to take over and complete the journey and perform a safe landing.
* '''[[Fault-tolerant system]]s''' avoid service failure when faults are introduced to the system. An example may include control systems for ordinary [[nuclear reactor]]s. The normal method to tolerate faults is to have several computers continually test the parts of a system, and switch on hot spares for failing subsystems. As long as faulty subsystems are replaced or repaired at normal maintenance intervals, these systems are considered safe. The computers, power supplies and control terminals used by human beings must all be duplicated in these systems in some fashion.

==Software engineering for safety-critical systems==
[[Software engineering]] for safety-critical systems is particularly difficult. There are three aspects which can be applied to aid the engineering software for life-critical systems. First is process engineering and management. Secondly, selecting the appropriate tools and environment for the system. This allows the system developer to effectively test the system by emulation and observe its effectiveness. Thirdly, address any legal and regulatory requirements, such as FAA requirements for aviation. By setting a standard for which a system is required to be developed under, it forces the designers to stick to the requirements. The [[avionics]] industry has succeeded in producing [[DO-178B|standard methods for producing life-critical avionics software]]. Similar standards exist for automotive ([[ISO 26262]]), Medical ([[IEC 62304]]) and nuclear ([[IEC 61513]]) industries. The standard approach is to carefully code, inspect, document, test, verify and analyze the system.  Another approach is to certify a production system, a [[compiler]], and then generate the system's code from specifications. Another approach uses [[formal methods]] to generate [[mathematical proof|proofs]] that the code meets requirements.&lt;ref name="bs93"&gt;{{cite article| first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Bowen | first2=Victoria | last2=Stavridou | title=Safety-critical systems, formal methods and standards | publisher=IEE/BCS | journal=[[Software Engineering Journal]] | volume=8 | number=4 | pages=189–209 | date=July 1993 | doi=10.1049/sej.1993.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these approaches improve the [[software quality]] in safety-critical systems by testing or eliminating manual steps in the development process, because people make mistakes, and these mistakes are the most common cause of potential life-threatening errors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2728">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], the '''semi-membership problem''' for a set is the problem of deciding which of two possible elements is logically more likely to belong to that set; alternatively, given two elements of which at least one is in the set, to distinguish the member from the non-member.

The semi-membership problem may be significantly easier than the membership problem.  For example, consider the set ''S''(''x'') of finite-length binary strings representing the [[dyadic rational]]s less than some fixed real number ''x''.  The semi-membership problem for a pair of strings is solved by taking the string representing the smaller dyadic rational, since if exactly one of the strings is an element, it must be the smaller, irrespective of the value of ''x''.  However, the language ''S''(''x'') may not even be a  [[recursive language]], since there are uncountably many such ''x'', but only countably many recursive languages.

A function ''f'' on ordered pairs (''x'',''y'') is a ''selector'' for a set ''S'' if ''f''(''x'',''y'') is equal to either ''x'' or ''y'' and if ''f''(''x'',''y'') is in ''S'' whenever at least one of ''x'', ''y'' is in ''S''.  A set is '''semi-recursive''' if it has a [[Computable function|recursive]] selector, and is '''P-selective''' or '''semi-feasible''' if it is semi-recursive with a [[polynomial time]] selector.

Semi-feasible sets have [[Circuit complexity|small circuits]]; they are in the [[Low and high hierarchies|extended low hierarchy]]; and cannot be [[NP-complete]] unless [[P=NP]].

In [[set theory]] and its applications to [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]], '''set-builder notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by enumerating its elements or stating the properties that its members must satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosen| first=Kenneth| year=2007 | title=Discrete Mathematics and its Applications | edition=6th | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York, NY | isbn=978-0-07-288008-3| pages=111–112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining sets by properties is also known as '''set comprehension''', '''set abstraction''' or as defining a set's '''[[intension]]'''.

Set-builder notation is sometimes simply referred to as ''set notation'', although this phrase may be better reserved for [[set notation|the broader class of means of denoting sets]].

== Sets defined by enumeration ==

A [[set (mathematics)|set]] is an  unordered collection of ''elements''.  (An ''element'' may also be referred to as a ''member''.)  An element may be any mathematical entity.

A set can be described directly by enumerating all of its elements between curly brackets, as in the following two examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 7, 3, 15, 31\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set holding the four numbers 3, 7, 15, and 31.
* &lt;math&gt;\{a, c, b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set containing 'a','b', and 'c'.

This is sometimes called the "roster method" for specifying a set.&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Aufmann, Vernon C. Barker, and Joanne Lockwood, 2007, ''Intermediate Algebra with Applications'', Brooks Cole, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is desired to denote a set that contains elements from a regular sequence an [[ellipsis|ellipses]] notation may be employed, as shown in the next examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;\{\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}= \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers.

There is no order among the elements of a set (this explains and validates the equality of the last example), but with the ellipses notation we show an ordered sequence before (or after) the ellipsis as a convenient notational vehicle for explaining to a reader which elements are in a set.  The first few elements of the sequence are shown then the ellipses indicate that the simplest interpretation should be applied for continuing the sequence. Should no terminating value appear to the right of the ellipses then the sequence is considered to be unbounded.

In each preceding example, each set is described by enumerating its elements. Not all sets can be described in this way, or if they can, their enumeration may be too long or too complicated to be useful. Therefore, many sets are defined by a property that characterizes their elements. This characterization may be done informally using general prose, as in the following example.

* &lt;math&gt;\{&lt;/math&gt; addresses on Pine Street &lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all addresses on Pine Street.

However, the prose approach may lack accuracy or be ambiguous. Thus, set builder notation is often used with a predicate characterizing the elements of the set being defined, as described in the following section.

== Sets defined by a predicate ==
Set builder notation can be used to describe sets that are defined by a predicate, rather than explicitly enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Cullinan, 2012, ''A Transition to Mathematics with Proofs'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, pp.&amp;nbsp;44ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, set builder notation has three parts: a variable, a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] or [[vertical bar]] separator, and a logical [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]. Thus there is a variable on the left of the separator, and a rule on the right of it. These three parts are contained in curly brackets:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The vertical bar, which can also be written as a colon, is a separator that can be read as "'''such that'''", &lt;!--bold, because "such that" redirects here--&gt; "for which", or "with the property that".  The formula {{math|&amp;Phi;(''x'')}} is said to be the ''rule'' or the ''predicate''.   All values of ''x'' for which the predicate holds (is true) belong to the set being defined. All values of {{math|''x''}} for which the predicate does not hold do not belong to the set.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that satisfy the formula {{math|&amp;Phi;}}. It may be the [[empty set]], if no value of {{math|''x''}} satisfies the formula.

=== Specifying the domain ===

A [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] {{math|''E''}} can appear on the left of the vertical bar: 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in E  \mid  \Phi(x)\},&lt;/math&gt; 
or by adjoining it to the predicate:
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid x \in E \text{ and } \Phi(x)\}\quad\text{or}\quad\{ x \mid x \in E \land \Phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The &amp;isin; symbol here denotes [[set membership]], while the &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; symbol denotes the logical "and" operator, known as [[logical conjunction]]. This notation represents the set of all values of {{math|''x''}} that belong to some given set {{math|''E''}} for which the predicate is true. (see "[[#Set existence axiom|Set existence axiom]]" below)

In general, it is not a good idea to consider sets without defining a domain, as this would represent the subset of ''all possible things that may exist'' for which the predicate is true. This can easily lead to contradictions and paradoxes. For example, [[Russell's paradox]] shows that the expression &lt;math&gt;\{x ~|~ x\not\in x\},&lt;/math&gt; although seemingly well formed as a set builder expression, can not define a set without producing a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Andrew David | last1=Irvine | first2=Harry | last2=Deutsch | orig-year=1995 | date=9 October 2016 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ | title=Russell's Paradox | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the set ''E'' is clear from context, it may be not explicitly specified.  It is common in the literature for an author to state the domain ahead of time, and then not specify it in the set builder notation. For example, an author may say something such as, "Unless otherwise stated, variables are to be taken to be natural numbers."

=== Examples ===
The following examples illustrate particular sets defined by set builder notation via predicates. In each case, the domain is specified on the left side of the vertical bar, while the rule is specified on the right side. 
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}   \mid  x &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all strictly [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]]s, which can be written in interval notation as &lt;math&gt;(0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathbb{R}  \mid |x| = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set can also be defined as &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;; see [[#Equivalent predicates yield equal sets|equivalent predicates yield equal sets]] below.
* For each integer ''m'',  we can define &lt;math&gt;G_m = \{x  \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid  x \ge m \} = \{ m, m + 1, m + 2, \ldots\},&lt;/math&gt;. As an example, &lt;math&gt;G_3 = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \ge 3 \} = \{ 3, 4, 5, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_{-2} = \{ -2, -1, 0, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid 0 &lt; y &lt; f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;  is the set of pairs of real numbers such that ''y'' is greater than 0 and less than ''f''(''x''), for a given [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''.   Here the [[cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of ordered pairs of real numbers. 
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{n   \in \mathbb{N} \mid  (\exists k)  [k\in \mathbb{N}\land n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[even number|even]] [[natural number]]s. The &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; sign stands for "and", which is known as [[logical conjunction]].    The &amp;exist; sign stands for "there exists", which is known as [[existential quantification]].   So for example, &lt;math&gt; (\exists x) P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is read as  'there exists an ''x'' such that ''P''(''x'')".
&lt;!-- --&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;\{n \mid  (\exists k \in \mathbb{N} )  [n = 2k]  \} &lt;/math&gt; is a notational variant for the same set of even natural numbers. It is not necessary to specify that {{math|''n''}} is a natural number, as this is implied by the formula on the right.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\{a \in \mathbb{R} \mid (\exists p\in \mathbb{Z} )(\exists q\in \mathbb{Z} )[ q \not = 0 \land aq=p] \}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s; that is, real numbers that can be written as the ratio of two [[integer]]s.

== More complex expressions on the left side of the notation ==

An extension of set-builder notation replaces the single variable {{math|''x''}} with a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] that may include one or more variables, combined with functions acting on them. So instead of  &lt;math&gt;\{ x \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;, we may have &lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\},&lt;/math&gt; which should be read
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}=\{y\mid\exists (x_1, \ldots, x_n), y=\Psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\text{ and }\Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:
* &lt;math&gt;\{2 n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all natural numbers, is the set of all even natural numbers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{p/q  \mid p,q \in \mathbb Z, q \not = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers, is the set of all rational numbers ({{math|'''Q'''}}).
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of odd integers.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ (t, 2 t + 1) \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;  creates a set of pairs, where each pair puts an integer into correspondence with an odd integer.

When inverse functions can be explicitly stated, the expression on the left can be eliminated through simple substitution.  Consider the example set &lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in  \mathbb Z\}&lt;/math&gt;. Make the substitution &lt;math&gt;u = 2t + 1&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say &lt;math&gt; t = (u-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, then replace ''t'' in the set builder notation to find 
:&lt;math&gt;\{ 2 t + 1 \mid  t \in \mathbb Z\} = \{ u \mid  (u- 1)/2 \in  \mathbb Z\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Equivalent predicates yield equal sets ==

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Sets defined by set builder notation are equal if and only if their set builder rules, including the domain specifiers, are equivalent. That is 
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in A \mid P(x) \}=\{ x \in B \mid Q(x) \} &lt;/math&gt; 
if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt; (\forall t)[ (t \in A \land P(t)) \Leftrightarrow (t \in B \land Q(t))]&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, in order to prove the equality of two sets defined by set builder notation, it suffices to prove the equivalence of their predicates, including the domain qualifiers.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \mathbb{R}\mid  x^2 = 1 \} = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid |x| = 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
because the two rule predicates are logically equivalent:
:&lt;math&gt; (x \in \mathbb{R} \land x^2 = 1) \Leftrightarrow (x \in \mathbb{Q} \land |x| = 1).&lt;/math&gt;
This equivalence holds because, for any real number ''x'', we have &lt;math&gt;x^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''x'' is a rational number with &lt;math&gt;|x|=1&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, both sets are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Set existence axiom ==

In many formal set theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], set builder notation is not part of the formal syntax of the theory. Instead, there is a [[axiom of comprehension|set existence axiom scheme]], which states that if ''E'' is a set and Φ(x) is a formula in the language of set theory, then there is a set ''Y'' whose members are exactly the elements of ''E'' that satisfy Φ:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall E)(\exists Y)(\forall x)[x \in Y \Leftrightarrow x \in E \land \Phi(x)].&lt;/math&gt;
The set ''Y'' obtained from this axiom is exactly the set described in set builder notation as &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in E \mid \Phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Z notation ==
{{Main article|Z notation}}
In [[Z notation]], the set of all ''x'' in a universe of discourse ''A'' that satisfy the condition ''P''(''x'') is written
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In Z, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] of an element ''x'' in set ''A'' is written as &lt;math&gt;(x : A)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;(x \in A)&lt;/math&gt;. Versions of set builder notation are also available in Z which allow for terms more complicated than a single variable, using a bullet to indicate the form of members of the set. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\{x : A \mid P(x) \bullet F(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; 
denotes the set of all values ''F''(''x''), where ''x'' is in ''A'' and ''P''(''x'') holds.

== Parallels in programming languages ==
{{main article|List comprehension}}
A similar notation available in a number of [[programming languages]] (notably [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is the [[list comprehension]], which combines [[map (higher-order function)|map]] and [[filter (higher-order function)|filter]] operations over one or more [[list (computing)|lists]].

In Python, the set-builder's braces are replaced with square brackets, parentheses, or curly braces, giving list, [[generator (computer science)|generator]], and set objects, respectively. Python uses an English-based syntax. Haskell replaces the set-builder's braces with square brackets and uses symbols, including the standard set-builder vertical bar.

The same can be achieved in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] using Sequence Comprehensions, where the "for" keyword returns a list of the yielded variables using the "yield" keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Scala | url=http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/sequence-comprehensions.html | title=Sequence Comprehensions | accessdate=6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider these set-builder notation examples in some programming languages:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Example 1 !! Example 2
|-
! Set-builder
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{l\ |\ l \in L\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  || &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{(k, x)\ |\ k \in K \wedge x \in X \wedge P(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
| &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{l for l in L}&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="python"&gt;{(k, x) for k in K for x in X if P(x)}&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]
| &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[l | l &lt;- ls]&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;[(k, x) | k &lt;- ks, x &lt;- xs, p x]&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]
| &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (l &lt;- L) yield l&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="scala"&gt;for (k &lt;- K; x &lt;- X if P(x)) yield (k,x)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
! scope="row" | [[SQL]]
| &lt;source lang="sql"&gt;SELECT l FROM L_set&lt;/source&gt; || &lt;source lang="sql"&gt; SELECT k, x FROM K_set, X_set WHERE P(x)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The set builder notation and list comprehension notation are both instances of a more general notation known as ''monad comprehensions'', which permits map/filter-like operations over any [[monad (functional programming)|monad]] with a [[zero element]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8362">In [[differential topology]], the '''transversality theorem''', also known as the '''Thom transversality theorem''' after [[France|French]] mathematician [[René Thom]], is a major result that describes the transverse intersection properties of a smooth family of smooth maps. It says that [[transversality (mathematics)|transversality]] is a [[generic property]]: any smooth map &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, may be deformed by an arbitrary small amount into a map that is transverse to a given submanifold &lt;math&gt;Z \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;. Together with the [[Thom space|Pontryagin–Thom construction]], it is the technical heart of [[cobordism theory]], and the starting point for [[surgery theory]]. The finite-dimensional version of the transversality theorem is also a very useful tool for establishing the genericity of a property which is dependent on a finite number of real parameters and which is expressible using a system of nonlinear equations. This can be extended to an infinite-dimensional parametrization using the infinite-dimensional version of the transversality theorem.

== Finite-dimensional version ==

=== Previous definitions ===

Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map between smooth manifolds, and let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be a submanifold of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is transverse to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;f \pitchfork Z&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;x\in f^{-1}\left(Z\right)&lt;/math&gt; we have that 
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}\left( df_x \right) + T_{f\left(x\right)} Z = T_{f\left(x\right)} Y&lt;/math&gt;.

An important result about transversality states that if a smooth map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is transverse to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(Z\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a regular submanifold of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Manifold#Manifold_with_boundary|manifold with boundary]], then we can define the restriction of the map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to the boundary, as &lt;math&gt;\partial f\colon\partial X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;. The map &lt;math&gt;\partial f&lt;/math&gt; is smooth, and it allows us to state an extension of the previous result: if both &lt;math&gt;f \pitchfork Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f \pitchfork Z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(Z\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a regular submanifold of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with boundary, and 
: &lt;math&gt;\partial f^{-1}\left( Z \right) = f^{-1}\left( Z \right) \cap \partial X&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Parametric transversality theorem ===

Consider the map &lt;math&gt;F\colon X\times S \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;f_s\left(x\right) = F\left(x,s\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This generates a family of mappings &lt;math&gt;f_s\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;. We require that the family vary smoothly by assuming &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be a (smooth) manifold and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to be smooth.

The statement of the ''parametric transversality theorem'' is:

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F\colon X \times S \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map of manifolds, where only &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has boundary, and let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be any submanifold of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; without boundary. If both &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial F&lt;/math&gt; are transverse to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, then for almost every &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt;, both &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f_s&lt;/math&gt; are transverse to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== More general transversality theorems ===

The parametric transversality theorem above is sufficient for many elementary applications (see the book by Guillemin and Pollack).

There are more powerful statements (collectively known as ''transversality theorems'') that imply the parametric transversality theorem and are needed for more advanced applications.

Informally, the "transversality theorem" states that the set of mappings that are transverse to a given submanifold is a dense open (or, in some cases, only a dense &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt;) subset of the set of mappings. To make such a statement precise, it is necessary to define the space of mappings under consideration, and what is the topology in it. There are several possibilities; see the book by Hirsch.

What is usually understood by ''Thom's transversality theorem'' is a more powerful statement about [[Jet (mathematics)|jet]] transversality. See the books by Hirsch and by Golubitsky and Guillemin. The original reference is Thom, Bol. Soc. Mat. Mexicana (2) 1 (1956), pp.&amp;nbsp;59–71.

[[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]] proved in the 1970s an even more general result called the ''[[Jet_(mathematics)#Multijets|multijet]] transversality theorem''. See the book by Golubitsky and Guillemin.

== Infinite-dimensional version ==
The infinite-dimensional version of the transversality theorem takes into account that the manifolds may be modeled in Banach spaces. {{Citation needed|reason=I can't find this statement in references and doubt its veracity|date=July 2017}}

=== Formal statement ===

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F\colon X \times S \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; map of &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;-Banach manifolds. Assume that

i) &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty, metrizable &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;-Banach manifolds with chart spaces over a field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt;.

ii) The &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;-map &lt;math&gt;F:X \times S \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a regular value.

iii) For each parameter &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt;f_s\left(x\right) = F\left(x,s\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fredholm operator|Fredholm map]], where &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{ind}} Df_s\left(x\right)&lt;k&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x\in f_{s}^{-1}\left( \left\{y\right\} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

iv) The convergence &lt;math&gt;s_n \rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F\left(x_n, s_n \right) = y&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; implies the existence of a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_n \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

If Assumptions i-iv hold, then there exists an open, dense subset &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a regular value of &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; for each parameter &lt;math&gt;s\in S_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, fix an element &lt;math&gt;s\in S_0&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists a number &lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ind} Df_s\left( x \right) = n&lt;/math&gt; for all solutions &lt;math&gt;x\in X &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f_s\left(x \right) = y&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution set &lt;math&gt;f_s^{-1}\left( \left\{y \right\} \right)&lt;/math&gt; consists of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;-Banach manifold or the solution set is empty.

Note that if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ind} Df_s\left( x \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all the solutions of &lt;math&gt;f_s\left(x \right) = y&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an open dense subset &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that there are at most finitely many solutions for each fixed parameter &lt;math&gt;s\in S_0&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, all these solutions are regular.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1559">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''Trudinger's theorem''' or the '''Trudinger inequality''' (also sometimes called the '''Moser–Trudinger inequality''') is a result of [[functional analysis]] on [[Sobolev space]]s.

It provides an inequality between a certain [[Sobolev space]] norm and an [[Orlicz space]] norm of a function. The inequality is a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of Sobolev imbedding and can be stated as the following theorem:

[[Image:Urania.propitia.png|thumb|right|The title page of the ''Urania propitia'' by Maria Cunitz (1650)]]
'''''Urania Propitia''''' is a book of astronomical tables written by [[Maria Cunitz]] and published in 1650. As Maria Cunitz was the daughter of both a physician and mathematician, it was her ability to grasp complex mathematics quickly and transcribe her findings as a polyglot that allowed her to do what not many women had done before her.

== Introduction ==

'''''Urania Propitia''''' was a simplification of the [[Rudolphine Tables]] written by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1627. Kepler's dedication to Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] which was originally dedicated to [[Rudolf II]] was filled with complex and tedious logarithms. It was because of Kepler's ingenious yet tiresome use of logarithms that led Cunitz to simplify the Rudolphine Tables and make Kepler's work more accessible to the public.
The tables are mostly astrological, but the instructions are completely astronomical. Written in both German for "the fatherland" and Latin to make it more accessible, the instructions are more practical in German and technical in Latin. Beyond the instructions, Maria Cunitz's book is split into three parts.

=== Part 1: Tables for spherical astronomy ===

The first part is the mathematical starting point. These include "sexagesimal sines, solutions of small right triangles in minutes and seconds, and tables for spherical astronomy for degrees of the ecliptic of: declination, right ascension, oblique ascension for latitudes 0 degrees to 72 degrees at 2 degree intervals..."

=== Part 2: Tables of average motions ===

It is the second part that the heart of Maria Cunitz's simplification is brought forward. Using the geometry and spherical astronomy from part one, Cunitz brings the rotational motions of the planets and moons into light using various mathematical formulas. One of the formulas from the Rudolphine Tables,

:&lt;math&gt; M = E - e \cdot \sin E &lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'', ''M'' and ''E'' denote the orbital eccentricity, the mean anomaly and the eccentric anomaly. This equation is known as "[[Kepler's equation]]" which normally has no "geometrical or algebraic solution for ''E''." However, when ''M'' is given it becomes more possible to but find "''E'' from ''M'' to any degree of precision by iteration or interpolation." The major accomplishment Cunitz brought was the ability to compute &lt;math&gt;\upsilon&lt;/math&gt; (the true anomaly) from ''M'' without the necessity to use "''E'' as a coefficient of interpolation". Thus, Cunitz was able to simplify the Rudolphine Tables and determine the position of a planet in its orbit as a function of time.

=== Part 3: Tables for computation of eclipses ===

These tables were used for both the location of eclipses and the time of eclipses. This includes the use of the "golden astronomical number", the parallax of the moon and sun in a variety in longitude, latitude, altitude, etc..., and a catalog of other fixed stars in the universe.

== Cosmology ==

Cunitz's cosmology has variations of both [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. While the basic structure of her cosmology is like Tycho's with the sun and moon orbiting around the Earth while the rest of the planets orbit around the sun, the physics within the cosmos involves ellipticals and "aphelions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Jed|title=A Master of Science History|year=2012|publisher=California Institute of Technology Press|location=Pasadena, CA|pages=82–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical significance ==

Beyond the rewards that came from a simplification of the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', a scientific advance written by a woman in the seventeenth century was an accomplishment in itself. It was described by [[Noel Swerdlow]]  as "the earliest surviving scientific work by a woman on the highest technical level of its age." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Invention of Science | publisher=Harpers Collins | author=Wooten, David | year=2015 | pages=6 | isbn=9780061759529}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for male scientists before [[Maria Cunitz]] to attribute their discoveries to muses. For Urania Propitia'', [[Urania]] in [[Greek mythology]] was the muse of Astronomy and "Propitia" translates to favoring in Latin. This suggests that Maria Cunitz both saw Urania as her muse while also making strides for women as scientists because she could be so easily compared to the ancient Greek astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Feminine Icons: The Face of Early Modern Science|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1988|volume= 14|issue=4|page=676|jstor=1343667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">In mathematics, '''Viennot's geometric construction''' (named after Xavier Gérard Viennot) gives a diagrammatic interpretation of the [[Robinson–Schensted correspondence]] in terms of '''shadow lines'''.  It has a generalization to the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]], which is known as the '''matrix-ball construction'''.

==The construction==
Starting with a permutation &lt;math&gt; \sigma \in S_n &lt;/math&gt;, written in two-line notation, say:

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; \cdots &amp; n \\
\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \sigma_n
  \end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

one can apply the Robinson–Schensted correspondence to this permutation, yielding two [[Young tableau|standard Young tableaux]] of the same shape, ''P'' and ''Q''. ''P'' is obtained by performing a sequence of insertions, and ''Q'' is the recording tableau, indicating in which order the boxes were filled.

Viennot's construction starts by plotting the points &lt;math&gt; (i, \sigma_i) &lt;/math&gt; in the plane, and imagining there is a light that shines from the origin, casting shadows straight up and to the right. This allows consideration of the points which are not shadowed by any other point; the boundary of their shadows then forms the first shadow line. Removing these points and repeating the procedure, one obtains all the shadow lines for this permutation. Viennot's insight is then that these shadow lines read off the first rows of ''P'' and ''Q'' (in fact, even more than that; these shadow lines form a "timeline", indicating which elements formed the first rows of ''P'' and ''Q'' after the successive insertions). One can then repeat the construction, using as new points the previous unlabelled corners, which allows to read off the other rows of ''P'' and ''Q''.

==Animation==
For example consider the permutation

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\
3 &amp; 8 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then Viennot's construction goes as follows:

==Applications==

One can use Viennot's geometric construction to prove that if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the pair of tableaux ''P'',''Q'' under the Robinson–Schensted correspondence, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the switched pair ''Q'',''P''. Indeed, taking &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; reflects Viennot's construction in the &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, and this precisely switches the roles of ''P'' and ''Q''.
