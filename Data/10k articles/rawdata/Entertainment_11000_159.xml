'''''1:42.08''''' (alternatively known as ''1:42.08: A Man and His Car'' or ''1:42.08: To Qualify'') is [[George Lucas]]'s senior project at the [[University of Southern California]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=AV&gt;{{cite web|title=Short Film Collection Round-Up|author=Murray, Noel|date=September 19, 2007|url=https://film.avclub.com/short-film-collection-round-up-1798203019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for the lap time of the [[Lotus 23]] [[race car]] that was the subject of the film.

It is a non-story visual [[tone poem]] depicting the imagery of a car going at full speed, and featuring the car's [[engine]] as the primary sound element. Shot on 16mm color film with a 14-man student crew, it was filmed at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park|Willow Springs Raceway]], north of [[Los Angeles]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Marcus "The Cinema of George Lucas" Publisher:Harry N. Abrams(March 1, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lotus 23 was driven by [[Pete Brock]].

Lucas cited the influence of [[Jean-Claude Labrecque]]'s 1965 short documentary on a cycling competition, ''[[60 Cycles]]'', on ''1:42.08''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jim|title=George Lucas|date=2003|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=9780753507551|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G2lZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%221:42.08%22+%2260+Cycles%22&amp;dq=%221:42.08%22+%2260+Cycles%22|accessdate=30 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AWA Tower''' is an [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|heritage]]-listed&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt; office and communications complex in [[Sydney]], in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] built for [[Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited]]. The AWA Tower consists of a radio transmission tower atop a 15-storey building. It is located in the [[Sydney central business district]] at 45-47 [[York Street, Sydney|York Street]], close to Wynyard Park and [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]]. It was designed by Robertson, Marks and McCredie in association with DT Morrow and Gordon and built from 1937 to 1939 by William Hughes and Co. Pty Ltd. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-665&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045116|AWA Building and Tower|hr=00665|fn=S90/03172, HC 33344, 10/20677|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The AWA Tower was designed by architects Morrow and Gordon from 1937–1939 and became one of the most notable commercial buildings of Sydney. It brought geometric [[Art Deco]] design and modernism to the city skyline with polished trachyte facing at ground level intending to signal a progressive and go-ahead firm. The 1939 steel-framed brick building was designed by Robertson, Marks and McCredie. The tower was modelled on Berlin's [[Funkturm Berlin|Funkturm Tower]], built a few years earlier, and both took inspiration from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="DoS"&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/awa_tower AWA Tower] at [[Dictionary of Sydney]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The communications tower was an integral part of the structure and remained the tallest structure in Sydney (other than the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]) until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt; The tower is {{convert|46|m|ft|0}} high atop a {{convert|55|m|ft|sing=on}} high building. The tower was {{convert|48|m}}, and at the {{convert|97|m|ft|adj=on}} point of the building there was a viewing platform.

The building is decorated with appropriate symbols of communication, including a winged Pegasus, said to be chosen by Sir [[Ernest Fisk]], the pioneer of wireless technology and a founding director of AWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goot, Murray |title=Fisk, Sir Ernest Thomas, 1886–1965 |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=vol 8 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne |year=1981 |pages=508–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the tower wore the sign "Beam Wireless", a service providing radio contact to commercial shipping on the England–Australia route introduced in 1927.

Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited was the first to manufacture televisions in Australia, and in the 1960s large AWA neon logos were attached to the building to symbolise this fact. In later years, the company expanded into a wide range of electronic products, including gaming systems. In 2000, when the company folded, the building was sold to [[Conrad Jupiters|Jupiter's Casino Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabcorpinternational.biz/awa-gaming-history.htm  AWA Gaming History] at Tabcorp International]&lt;/ref&gt; It is covered by a conservation order, and remains known as the AWA building, although the big red AWA signs have been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nicholls, Sean |title=City Tower to lose historic logos |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 January 2003 |access-date= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower, which was demolished and rebuilt in 1994, remains illuminated at night, but the viewing platform has long been gone.

The tower (featuring the AWA logo) features in the science fiction film ''[[The Matrix]]''; when Neo and Trinity rescue Morpheus from the agents, the AWA Tower can be seen below as they make their escape by helicopter.

== Description ==
The building is comprised of 12 office floors, a ground floor and basement.  The frontage along York Street is {{convert|18.3|m}} and {{convert|21.3|m}} along York Lane.  The building is surmounted by a steel tower which gives the building an overall height of {{convert|111|m}} above street level.  The building is steel framed and faced in brick with polished [[trachyte]] facing at the ground floor.&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt;&lt;ref name=GAGT/&gt;

The building is vertically modelled to give a skyscraper appearance.  A Pegasus is depicted in relief sculpture on a plain brick [[parapet]] at the top of the building.  Pegasus, a winged horse,  was chosen by Sir Ernest Fisk as a suitable association with the work of Australia's great wireless undertaking.  The building retains the original Fisk system of double glazed windows.  The communications tower was designed as an integral part of the building and its supports are part of the structure of the building.&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt;

The York Street Entry Foyer and Lift Lobby is faced with Wombeyan Russet [[marble]] with simple Art Deco streamlined detail and the letter AWA over the entrance.  The former Vestibule (main ground floor) interior retains its silver ash timber panelling.  Above the panelling there is a series of symbolic plaster relief's executed by Otto Steen.  Three relief's comprise three "themes".  In each corner are figures representing the four ancient elements - earth, water, fire and air.  Over the entrance surrounding an AWA symbol are the signs of the zodiac.  A series of small relief's along the north and south walls represent various nations, symbolising the unification of the world throughout radio.&lt;ref name=GAGT&gt;Graham Alcock Giles Tribe&lt;/ref&gt; The former Entrance Lobby interior retains a map of the world incised into the polished trachyte wall above the auditorium doors.&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt;

Other significant interiors include the fifth floor Boardroom, ancillary offices and executive bathroom&lt;ref name=nswshr-665/&gt;

'''''Afghan Muscles''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of Denmark|Danish]] [[documentary film]] directed by Andreas Møl Dalsgaard about [[bodybuilding]] in [[Afghanistan]].

==Plot==
Following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|2001 United States-led invasion]] and the overthrow of the [[Taliban]] government, bodybuilding has enjoyed a renaissance in Afghanistan. The film follows the lives of two Afghan bodybuilding champions, Hamidullah Shirzai and Noorulhoda Shirzad, who are part of the national team training for the 2004 Mr. Asia competition in [[Bahrain]]. Although the men enjoy celebrity status in their country, their training is hampered by a lack of financial support, problems in gaining access to the [[bodybuilding supplement]]s and professional guidance that would improve their competitive performances, and the ongoing military conflict across Afghanistan. Hamid also has the added burden of being nagged by his father to settle down and marry and by the abrupt withdrawal of support by a gym owner who once encouraged his progress.  The Afghan national team arrives in Bahrain for the Mr. Asia event, but the more flamboyant competitors from other countries overshadow them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=11364 “Afghan Muscles,” Film Threat, December 7, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209042826/http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=11364 |date=December 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Afghan Muscles'' is the first feature-length film directed by Danish filmmaker Andreas Møl Dalsgaard (born 1980), who received a BA in social anthropology from the [[University of Aarhus]] and became a student director at the [[National Film School of Denmark]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfi.dk/english/Danish+films/Directors/DirectorFact.htm?DirID=16104 “Andreas Møl Dalsgaard,” Danish Film Institute]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220074637/http://www.dfi.dk/english/Danish%2Bfilms/Directors/DirectorFact.htm?DirID=16104 |date=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dalsgaard became interested in the subject during a 2003 visit to [[Kabul]], when he noticed large posters of scantily clad male bodybuilders around the Afghan capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioantler.com/afghan-muscles-review/ Afghan Muscles Review, BA, 11 November 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111124406/http://www.bioantler.com/afghan-muscles-review/ |date=November 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalsgaard spent three years following a group of bodybuilders for the film, which he later described as “a culture of young men seeking modernity in their very own way, trying to be successful and gain a name and fame in the cultural chaos of postwar Kabul.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralasien.dk/content/journal/TheDSCAJournal02_Oct2005.pdf “Afghan Muscles” (page 51), The DSCA Journal October 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628195807/http://www.centralasien.dk/content/journal/TheDSCAJournal02_Oct2005.pdf |date=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
During a presentation of ''Afghan Muscles'' at the 2007 [[AFI Fest]], Dalsgaard acknowledged that his film intentionally avoided highlighting any involvement by Afghan women in bodybuilding, either as athletes or audience members. "It's men looking at men," he stated. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/11/dispatch_from_l_12.html “DISPATCH FROM LOS ANGELES | Herzog, Docs and Truth at AFI Fest,” IndieWire, November 7, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204052257/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/11/dispatch_from_l_12.html |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Afghan Muscles'' shared the 2007 AFI Fest Grand Jury Prize for Documentary with ''Operation Filmmaker,'' directed by Nina Davenport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=features&amp;id=2825&amp;articleid=VR1117975774  “'Muscles,' Operation' take documentary nods.” Variety, November 11, 2007 (fee access required)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film also played in festivals in the U.S., [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120804083719/http://www.docreview.pl/2008/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=141&amp;Itemid=153&amp;lang=en “Afghan Muscles,” Planete Doc Review, May 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Afghan Muscles'' has been released in the U.S. on [[DVD]] by [[Cinema Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinemaguild.com/catalog/index.html?http%3A//cinemaguild.com/mm5/merchant.mvc%3FScreen%3DPROD%26Store_Code%3DTCGS%26Product_Code%3D2302 “Afghan Muscles,” Cinema Guild]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218001608/http://cinemaguild.com/catalog/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fcinemaguild.com%2Fmm5%2Fmerchant.mvc%3FScreen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TCGS&amp;Product_Code=2302 |date=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Akiba's Beat'''''|アキバズビート|lead=yes}} is an [[action role-playing video game]] for the [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 4]] [[video game consoles]]. It is the third entry in the ''Akiba'' series, after the Japan-only ''[[Akiba's Trip]]'' for [[PlayStation Portable]] and the worldwide release ''[[Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed]]'', though it is the first entry that plays as a [[JRPG]]. The game was released on December 15, 2016 in Japan, and in May 16, 2017 in North America and May 19 in Europe, published by [[Marvelous USA]] and PQube.

==Gameplay==
The game is considered a follow-up to the two ''[[Akiba's Trip]]'' games, but does not share any of its gameplay mechanics, instead focusing more on JRPG related features and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/06/09/akibas-beat-screens-revealed-for-ps4-and-vita/210820/|title=‘Akiba’s Beat’ Screens Revealed for PS4 and Vita - Hardcore Gamer|publisher=Hardcore Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game plays as an [[Action role-playing video game|action RPG]], with battles initiated once the player moves the [[playable character]] into an enemy character, sending involved characters into a separate battle screen.&lt;ref name="siliconcept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/06/01/akibas-beat-concept-trailer-shows-gameplay-characters-akihabara-streets/|title=Akiba’s Beat "Concept Trailer" Shows Gameplay, Characters, And Akihabara Streets|date=1 June 2016|publisher=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The game takes place in [[Akihabara]] and stars [[protagonist]] and [[NEET]] Asahi Tachibana, living a regular life after deciding to drop out of college.&lt;ref name="silicongp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/06/09/akibas-beat-shares-screens-details-key-characters-delusion-warped-akihabara/|title=Akiba’s Beat Shares Screens And Details On Key Characters And Its Delusion-Warped Akihabara|date=9 June 2016|publisher=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer student, Saki Hoshino, recently moved to the area and runs into Asahi.&lt;ref name="silicongp"/&gt; Other main characters in include [[Japanese idol]] Riyu Momose, the very young looking Yamato Hongo.&lt;ref name="silicongp"/&gt; The game involves the party getting stuck in a world of delusions, trapped in a repeating day long cycle on a Sunday.&lt;ref name="siliconcept"/&gt; The party also keeps coming across a strange, unidentifiable man in a pink sash, that always seems to be around when unexplainable incidents occur.&lt;ref name="silicongp"/&gt;

==Development==
The game was first announced on May 30, 2016, as developer Acquire's first [[action role-playing video game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/05/akibas-beat-announced-ps4-ps-vita|title=Akiba's Beat announced for PS4, PS Vita - Gematsu|date=30 May 2016|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; First information on the title, such as it being  a game for the [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 4]], were first revealed in an issue of ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/05/30/akibas-beat-announced-playstation-4-playstation-vita/|title=Akiba’s Beat Announced For PlayStation 4 And PlayStation Vita|date=30 May 2016|publisher=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was 75% complete as of the time of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/05/31/akibas-beat-details-key-characters-world-repeats-sunday-loop/|title=Akiba’s Beat Details Its Key Characters And World That Repeats On A Sunday Loop|date=31 May 2016|publisher=Siliconera}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2016, [[Marvelous USA|Xseed Games]] announced they would be releasing the game in English on both platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/06/akibas-beat-fateextella-story-seasons-trio-towns-coming-north-america|title=Akiba's Beat, Fate/Extella, and Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns coming to North America - Gematsu|date=7 June 2016|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game will be the second of three ''Akiba'' games to be translated to English; the original ''[[Akiba's Trip]]'' for [[PlayStation Portable]] was never translated or released in English, but the second game, ''[[Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed]]'', was translated and published by Xseed Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/05/30/akibas-beat-akiba-trip-sequel/|title=Akiba's Trip Sequel Akiba's Beat Announced (PS4, Vita)|date=30 May 2016|publisher=PlayStation Lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's story was announced to be more serious in theme than the prior two games in the series.&lt;ref name="gem1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/06/akibas-beat-first-details-screenshots|title=Akiba's Beat first details, screenshots - Gematsu|date=9 June 2016|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, similar to the prior games, it will still take place in a realistic recreation of [[Japan]]'s [[Akihabara]], coupled with surreal dungeon areas more akin to games such as ''[[Persona 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-xseed-is-localizing-another-akiba-s-game-366154.phtml|title=Looks like XSEED is localizing another Akiba's game|publisher=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key staff for the game include director Kohta Takano of ''[[Divine Gate]]'', character designs by UCMM, and a theme song titled "Again", sung by [[ClariS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/05/31/akibas-trip-follow-up-akibas-beat-announced-for-ps4-vita|title="Akiba's Trip" Follow-up "Akiba's Beat" Announced for PS4 &amp; Vita|publisher=Crunchyroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2016, PQube confirmed a European release.&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sal|last=Romano|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/10/akibas-beat-coming-europe-q1-2017 |title=Akiba’s Beat coming to Europe in Q1 2017|date=October 27, 2016 |website=Gematsu |accessdate=December 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon the [[PlayStation 4]] version's release, the game failed to chart in the weekly [[Media Create]] Top 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sal|last=Romano|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/12/media-create-sales-121216-121816|title=Media Create Sales: 12/12/16 – 12/18/16|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Famitsu]]'s Top 30, ''Akiba's Beat'' ranked as the 26th best selling of that tracking window with 5248 units sold, for a 20-40% [[sell-through]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sal|last=Romano|url=http://www.perfectly-nintendo.com/japan-media-create-sales-week-50-2016-dec-12-18/|title=[Japan] Media Create sales for Week 50, 2016 (Dec. 12 – 18) [Top 50]|publisher=Perfectly Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was roughly a tenth of what ''[[Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed]]'' sold in a similar period of time on [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 3]] back in 2013. The magazine's reviewer gave the PlayStation 4 version of the game a 27/40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sal|last=Romano|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/12/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1462|title=Famitsu Review Scores: Issue 1462|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The western release received mixed to negative reviews with Cory Arnold of [[Destructoid]] awarding the game 3.5 (out of 10) citing "If Akiba's Trip is the shirtless jock who kicks the door in with beers in hand, Akiba's Beat is the timid cocktail-drinker standing in the corner with one hand in his pocket. Technically functional, but spiritually dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cory|last=Arnold|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-akiba-s-beat-436266.phtml|title=Review: Akiba's Beat|publisher=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He integrated A&amp;M and Island into the Group, using this opportunity to regroup all labels into one distribution company and also add video. In addition to his marketing role, he took over the management of PolyGram's new operations in the U.S., and then reorganized PolyGram Records (U.S.) into a new large-scale venture: PolyGram Group Distribution, Inc., which oversaw the operations of the United States divisions of PolyGram including PolyGram Music Group, PolyGram Video, PolyMedia, PolyGram Special Markets, PolyGram Merchandising, Independent Label Sales, etc.  Overall, PGD, Inc. oversaw the distribution, marketing and sales of the audio and video products belonging to PolyGram in the United States. That year, PolyGram was floated on the Amsterdam and New York stock exchange at a valuation of 2B$.{{citation needed |date=February 2014}}

In 1991, Levy was promoted to worldwide President and CEO of PolyGram N.V. overseeing all global business/entertainment operations for PolyGram including: PolyGram Music Group and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. He spent the next seven years turning the primarily European music group into a worldwide entertainment force that sold one out of every five albums&lt;ref&gt;http://[www.wharton.upenn.edu/125anniversaryissue/levy.html "He topped charts with Polygram"], [[Wharton Alumni Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; and released movie hits such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Fargo.

==Later career==

===Music Business===
In 1992 Levy acquired [[Motown]] and [[Def Jam]] further diversifying PolyGram’s musical slate. He then spent the next few years consolidating the firm's music strategy: balanced multinational operations, investment in local content, consolidating the global marketing operations and prioritizing profit over market share.

By the mid 1990s PolyGram was the most profitable of all the music majors and the number one music company in the world.

===Film Business===
Beginning in 1992, after observing a gradual flattening in the music sales. Levy led the company’s expansion into the international movie business with the establishment of [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. PFE produced and distributed films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Trainspotting, Bean, Fargo and Dead Man Walking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sushivp.com/#!alain-levy/c1vtg.html "The People behind Sushi"], ""[[Sushi Venture Partners]]"".&lt;/ref&gt;
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment became the biggest European owned studio with sales in excess of 1B$ and distribution in 26 countries.

===Phillips Board and PolyGram Exit===
From 1992 to 1998 Levy also sat on the Board of Management of [[Philips|Phillips]], and  played a key part in developing world-class software and content while being one of the industry leaders in hardware. In 1996, Phillips CEO [[Jan Timmer]] left the company and was replaced by [[Cor Boonstraa]]. Over the next few years the strategy of the company shifted; in 1998 Phillips   left the software side to focus on hardware. PolyGram was then sold to Seagram for 11B$ and Levy left the company.

===Investments in digital 1999-2001===
After leaving PolyGram, Levy was senior advisor at McKinsey and made seed investments in a number of different media companies mainly in the Internet space.

===EMI Music 2001-2007===
From 2001 to 2007,   Levy was the Chairman and CEO of [[EMI Music]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1241185&amp;privcapId=51448798&amp;previousCapId=4474384&amp;previousTitle=SV%20Investment%20Partners "Company Overview of Banijay Entertainment SAS"], "[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first six months of his tenure Levy led the consolidation of [[EMI]] and [[Virgin Group]] into one company with distinct content streams and branding, resulting in overheads savings of £250 million on an annual basis. He then focused on changing the strategy  to the changing context of digital, shifting EMI from a content-driven to a consumer-focused company.

Over the next few years Levy invested over £100m in technology both inside the company and vis a vis the consumer. EMI was the first media company to digitize its content and to start discussions and negotiations with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] regarding its iTunes launch, while at the same time leading the debate over digital rights management.

During this time EMI adopted consumer segmentation, market research practices and investment measuring techniques in its marketing operations. It also built a powerful global marketing operation that supported the success of primarily English speaking artists globally. While undergoing this transformation, the company kept its focus on its artists and their music, breaking to worldwide recognition major acts such as Norah Jones, Coldplay and Keith Urban.

In 2006, Levy startled an audience at [[London Business School]] with the statement:
"The CD as it is right now is dead."&lt;ref&gt;Edgecliffe-Johnson, Andrew. [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3f468208-6620-11db-a4fc-0000779e2340.html#axzz2r23BtqaC "CD as we know it 'dead', says EMI chief"], ""[[Financial Times]]"", 28 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
In early 2007, EMI was sold to Terra Firma and Levy left the company.

===Banijay 2008-2009===
In 2008 and 2009 Levy was Senior Advisor to [[Banijay Entertainment|Banijay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1241185&amp;privcapId=51448798&amp;previousCapId=4474384&amp;previousTitle=SV%20Investment%20Partners "Company Overview of Banijay Entertainment SAS"], [[Bloomberg Businessweek]].&lt;/ref&gt; a new business enterprise acquiring independent TV production companies from around the world and links them in exchanging and adapting formats., backed by the Arnaud, Agnelli, and d’Agostini families.

===Algean Group 2013===
In September 2013 he was appointed Executive Chairman of [http://www.algeangroup.com Algean Group], a group of companies that operates in travel, property and marketing strategy consulting with a focus in new media and technology. Algean Group's member companies include; [http://www.omniapico.com Omni Apico], [http://www.seeztravel.com Seez Travel], [http://www.algeanproperty.com Algean Property], [http://www.oaprivateevents.com Private Events by Omni Apico], [https://www.quintessentially.com/greece-concierge-service.html Quintessentially Hellas]

The '''Australian Directors Guild''' ('''ADG''') is an industry [[guild]] representing the interests of film, television, commercials and digital media directors, including documentary makers and animators, throughout Australia. With its headquarters in Sydney, the ADG has branches in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.
Founded initially as the Australian Feature Film Director’s Association in September, 1981 and renamed the Australian Screen Directors Association four months later, the Guild became the Australian Directors Guild in 2007 in order to align itself more clearly to other international Directors Guilds which had for some years been strengthening their ties with each other and with their Australian counterpart.&lt;ref name="screendirector1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendirector.org/articles/2014/6/1/history-of-the-adg-part-1 |title=History of the ADG - Part 1 — Screen Director |publisher=Screendirector.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colbert |first=Mary |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2009/09/11/adg-awards-its-own |title=ADG awards its own &amp;#124; Movie News &amp;#124; SBS Movies |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HjmNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=adg+ASDA+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QQCAnJBoqX&amp;sig=u7zdb9ql9iGWBmz4g_jDr_StXXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HKi9VPbNFMTU8gWpgYHgCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adg%20ASDA%20name&amp;f=false |title=A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other ... - Richard W.

Work Commission.

==Overview==
The ADG is a craft association representing screen directors working in all genres. It seeks to promote excellence in screen direction through seminars, conferences, workshops and awards, to encourage communication and collaboration between directors and others in the industry, to provide professional support for its members, to represent the interests of directors in cultural and policy debates and decisions and to play a constructive role in matters affecting the Australian screen industry as a whole.

The ADG is governed by a board of directors, elected from and by the membership, and appoints a full-time executive director and a coordinator.

The ADG provides members with information, access, professional advice and advocacy relating to issues that affect directors&amp;nbsp;– such as contracts, fees, codes of practice, rights and disputes.  It maintains and provides connections with overseas Guilds through its affiliation with the International Association of English Speaking Directors Organisations (IAESDO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030919005466/en/World-Film-Television-Directors-Announce-Dublin-Declaration#.VL2qY8bC4lY|title=World Film and Television Directors Announce Dublin Declaration|date=19 September 2003|work=Businesswire.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guild organises a Directors Attachment Scheme in cooperation with [[Screen Australia]] whereby successful applicants are placed in productions in order to gain experience working in film or television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2013/mr_130315_ADG.aspx |title=Media Release: New Director’s Attachment Scheme launched with Kriv Stenders’ Kill Me Three Times |publisher=Screenaustralia.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703044331/http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2013/mr_130315_ADG.aspx |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1993, the ADG has held regular directors conferences and between 1988 and 2008, it printed a newsletter which later became the magazine, ''Screen Director''. Current issues of ''Screen Director'' are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendirector.org/|title=Screen Director|work=Screendirector.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the ADG began giving annual awards for directors. These have grown to include 17 categories with special awards recognising service and achievement.

Ozdox, a semi-autonomous documentary group affiliated with the ADG and working closely with Guild staff, fosters and promotes documentary culture, primarily through discussion screenings and seminars. Founded in 2003, Ozdox encourages documentary directors to become members of the ADG.

In 1995 the ADG formed the Australian Screen Directors Authorship Collecting Society (ASDACS)) to collect overseas royalties for distribution to Australian and New Zealand directors

As of 2014, the ADG had a membership of over 700, including full/retired members, associate members and student members. Full members must be refereed and their credentials approved by the ADG Board. Membership fees are determined according to annual wage levels and state location.

Guild Chapters in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia organize a range of local events and activities and liaise with their relevant State screen bodies.
The staff and operations of the Guild are financed through fees for membership, income from events, a small percent of overseas royalties collected through ASDACS, a voluntary levy from the budgets of members' productions and sponsorship from state and federal film bodies, [[Screenrights: The Audio Visual Copyright Society]] and Media Super.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediasuper.com.au/media/australian-directors-guild-awards|title=Australian Directors Guild Awards|work=Mediasuper.com.au|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1981&amp;nbsp;– 1991===
In early 1981, a meeting of film directors was held in response to plans to import an overseas director for [[Hoodwink (1981 film)|Hoodwink]], a feature film financed by Australian taxpayers through the New South Wales Film Corporation. The meeting held the view that the development of Australian directors was a key part of the rationale for government funding of films. Failing to gain support for their opposition from the relevant industry union, the Australian Theatrical &amp; Amusement Employees Association (AT&amp;AEA), the directors decided to set up the Australian Feature Film Directors Association. In around September 1981, 18 directors met at the AT&amp;AEA headquarters in the Sydney suburb of Glebe to sign the Articles of Association. Nine directors were the formal signatories: [[Gillian Armstrong]], [[James Ricketson]], [[Esben Storm]], [[Albie Thoms]], [[Henri Safran]], Keith Salvat, [[Tom Jeffrey]], [[Carl Schultz]] and [[Michael Pate]].

The organization soon attracted interest from directors other than feature film directors, especially from television directors, leading to the decision to change its name to the Australian Screen Directors Association (ASDA). New signatories to the ASDA Articles of Association on 15 January 1982 included [[Phillip Noyce]] and [[Stephen Wallace]] and a number of directors best known for their television work: [[John Power (director)|John Power]], Maurice Murphy, [[Peter Maxwell]], Ron Way and [[Ian Barry (director)|Ian Barry]].

In the years that followed, ASDA continued to concern itself with the importation of overseas directors, supporting directors of note and where Australian directors were also included in the projects. A range of cultural events, meetings and seminars were organized and, as membership grew, membership fees enabled the employment of a manager. Attempts at instituting a standard directors contract proved fruitless as the Screen Producers Association of Australia (SPAA) refused to negotiate, citing ASDA's lack of industrial registration as its reason. Nevertheless, in 1985 a disputes committee was formed and ASDA continued to represent directors in disputes with producers.

ASDA Board meetings were initially held in members' houses or at an industry watering hole, the 729 Club, until 1984 by which time income had increased sufficiently for the establishment of an office in the suburb of Glebe.  In 1985, with the admission of documentary directors, membership reached 100, but the influence of ASDA through its various activities reached many more directors as well as others interested/involved in film and television production. These cultural events also became a source of finance.

As the organization developed further, eventually including membership in other capital cities, the [[Australian Film Commission]] (AFC) began to give financial support to ASDA's cultural events and seminars. Correlatively, with the growth of membership and establishment of a financial base, ASDA was able to play a role in the politics of the industry. Lobbying on behalf of directors' viewpoints on a range of issues soon became one of the Association's primary activities.&lt;ref name="screendirector1"/&gt;

===1992&amp;nbsp;– 1999===
By 1992 ASDA membership was around 200 and, as activity within the organisation increased, this number soon doubled.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA Newsletter, September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the decade, members numbered almost 900, including both associate and student members.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wallace, ASDA Press Report 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, members participated directly in the Association through a range of committees including a documentary committee, an animators committee, a television directors committee, a women’s committee, events committee and policy committee, among others. President Stephen Wallace, in revitalising ASDA, recognised the members’ interest in the art/craft of directing and proposed the institution of a Directors Conference and Directors Discussion Screenings. Many such screenings were held over the following years, along with a range of seminars and meetings to discuss industry policy.

ASDA’s first National Directors Conference was held in June, 1993. Over the next years, these conferences coincided with ASDA’s AGM and became forums for policy debate as well as for exploration of directing issues. At the 1995 conference, ASDA presented the first [[Cecil Holmes (director)|Cecil Holmes]] Award in recognition of services to directing. The Award is now generally given in alternate years or with the identification of a deserving recipient.

During this period also, ASDA continued its participation in industry policy development with submissions to and meetings with relevant organisations, reviews and government departments. Work on a Standard TV directors contract was begun and a reconstituted Disputes Committee began life by dealing with a serious television dispute arising in some measure out of the lack of such a contract. Other disputes continued to be brought to the committee by directors working in many areas of the industry. In 1999, one of these disputes, with Channel 9 over wages for directors on the ''Far Scape'' series, brought the long-simmering issue of industrial representation to the fore. President Stephen Wallace vigorously rejected the view that ASDA should work through the industry union, the [[Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance]] (MEAA) but rather that it should itself seek industrial registration.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA Newsletter March April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

ASDA's efforts to develop standard directors' contracts continued and in 1999 Neil Haggquist, the business agent for the [[Directors Guild of Canada]] (DGC) was brought to Australia to help develop a contract which would be acceptable both to Australian and US companies. Also in this period a prolonged struggle to achieve [[Moral Rights]] for directors was initiated when both federal government film agencies, the [[Australian Film Commission]] and the [[Film Finance Corporation Australia]], as well as the [[Australian Writers Guild]] came out in opposition to the inclusion of directors as authors in mooted changes to the [[Copyright law of Australia]].

ASDA understood that the authorship of screen directors was not well-recognised and was under additional threat in a changing global and technological landscape.  As a consequence, many of its activities at this time were aimed at fostering a better understanding of the director's role. Thanks to these efforts, when Moral Rights legislation was introduced into the Copyright Act in 2000, directors were defined as makers of a film along with writers and producers. Importantly, with the subsequent passing of the 2006 Copyright Amendment Act, ASDA and the Australian Writers Guild, now working together, managed to achieve protection for their members from contractual pressures to waive their moral rights&amp;nbsp;– a waiver which is permitted and widely exercised in some other jurisdictions, notably in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A00752|author1=Seiter, William|author2=Ellen Seiter|title=''The Creative Artist’s Legal Guide: copyright, trademark, and contracts in film and digital media' production''|publisher=Yale University Press|date=2012|page=56|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ASDA President [[Stephen Wallace]], at the invitation of the late [[John Juliani]] the DGC ([[Directors Guild of Canada]]), met in Toronto with the DGA ([[Directors Guild of America]]) and BECTU (Britain's [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]]), thus beginning a process of achieving closer relationships with overseas guilds.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA Newsletters Aug/Sept 1994 and presidents Report 1998-99&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, ASDA regularly participated in the annual International Directors' Guild Forum, an event which it hosted in Sydney in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Presidents Report 1998-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in 1995, ASDA formed ASDACS (the Australian Directors Collecting Society) after having been approached by the [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] to distribute money collected on behalf of directors from the sale of video tapes in France. ASDACS subsequently formed further relationships with other European collecting societies and in recent years has distributed roughly half a million dollars annually to its 800 director members in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdacs.com.au/about-asdacs/ |title=asdacs |publisher=asdacs |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdacs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2011-Annual-Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Australian Screen Directors Authorship Collecting Society Ltd |publisher=Asdacs.com.au |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdacs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FY12-ASDACS-signed-accounts.pdf |format=PDF |title=Australian Screen Directors Authorship Collecting Society Ltd |publisher=Asdacs.com.au |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ASDA made further gains for directors in arguing for their inclusion as beneficiaries under the retransmission scheme proposed in the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act (2000). These efforts came to fruition in 2005 through the Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Act, providing for film directors to share in retransmission royalties along with producers in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.screenrights.org/news/2013/01/directors-and-retransmission-rights |title=Directors and Retransmission Rights |publisher=Screenrights |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006A00158 |title=Copyright Amendment Act 2006 |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000&amp;nbsp;– 2014===
By the end of the 1990s, political, social and technological changes were resulting in a diminution of member involvement in many organizations across Australia and ASDA was not immune to these changes. Most of the member committees of the earlier period had become inactive, members meetings became infrequent, and most of the work fell to active members of the Board—particularly successive Association presidents [[Donald Crombie]] and Ray Argall—and to the Executive Directors: Richard Harris (1998-2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/proceedings/33998081/showcase%7ctitle=SHOWCASE%7cwork=ebscohost.com|title=SHOWCASE|work=Ebscohost.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Macrae (2007-2009), In 2009-2011, the ADG also employed an industrial relations and policy manager, Needeya Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2011/09/12/article/Kingston-Anderson-appointed-Australian-Directors-Guild-general-manager/RPBLXEFCHZ.html |title=Kingston Anderson appointed Australian Directors Guild general manager |publisher=If.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of their time was claimed by industrial issues, international relations and the necessity of participation in a large number of policy debates and reviews of public sector institutions and regulations, with their attendant demands for consultations, participation in industry committees and detailed submissions.

In this period also, digital media became an increasingly significant area of concern as rapid transformations affected telecommunications, television and “film” which was increasingly moving away from celluloid formats.

Thanks to consistent participation in industry politics and promotion of directors’ viewpoints, by the time the Association changed its name to the Australian Directors Guild (ADG) in 2007, it had become a well-established and well-recognised player in a complex industry/cultural scene in which seemingly every possible craft and interest group was establishing its own organised representation. ADG President Ray Argall became involved in the work of the Australian Screen Council, an attempt, ultimately ill-fated, to bring the screen guilds together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/76-australian-screen-council.pdf |format=PDF |title=Submission by Australian Screen Council |publisher=Arts.gov.au |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403154202/http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/76-australian-screen-council.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2008/04/09/article/JMIITYYDYR.html |title=AWG quits Screen Council |publisher=If.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly and in line with the ADG's understanding of the increasing impact of globalisation on Australian screen, Argall officially represented Australia in the founding of the International Federation of Coalitions for Cultural Diversity in Seville in 2007. He is currently the Asia Pacific member of the Federation Board and coordinates the Australian Coalition for Cultural Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_20140214_DossierPresentationComplet_ENG-3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Coalition for cultural diversity |publisher=Cdc-ccd.org |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ficdc.org/Australie |title=Australie |publisher=FICDC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the first ADG Directors Awards were established. They are open to financial members in all categories and are the only Australian film directing awards judged solely by directors. This was the year in which the ADG was first included in the Directors Finder initiative by the Directors Guild of America. The DGA Finders Award spotlights the director of an undistributed independent film chosen from member countries within the International Association of English Speaking Directors Organizations (IAESDO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/The-Guild/Committees/Special/Independent/IDC-Brochure-main.aspx |title=The Guild / Committees - DGA Independent Filmmakers Brochure |publisher=Dga.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/20071010749/news/sydney/peter-garrett-to-attend-directors-guild-awards.html |title=Peter Garrett To Attend Directors Guild Awards |publisher=Australianstage.com.au |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finder’s Award was relaunched by the ADG in 2012, and in 2014 an Innovation Award was also established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screen.nsw.gov.au/screen-nsw-news/adg-announces-the-directors-guild-of-america-finders-award-2012/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150220001235/http://www.screen.nsw.gov.au/screen-nsw-news/adg-announces-the-directors-guild-of-america-finders-award-2012/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-20 |title=news &amp;#124; news &amp; updates |publisher=Screen.nsw.gov.au |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2014/11/23/article/Entries-open-for-ADG-Awards/QZJTTBOMKX.html |title=Entries open for ADG Awards |publisher=If.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period also that the ADG finalised rate cards for directors' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adg.org.au/other-resources.aspx |title=Australian Directors Guild |publisher=ADG.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714004034/http://www.adg.org.au/other-resources.aspx |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And while directors’ contracts had also been drafted, the ability to negotiate with producers for their implementation still remained a stumbling block. In 2014, following discussions with MEAA and SPAA, the ADG received unanimous support from its members for the constitutional changes necessary for registration as an industrial union.&lt;ref name="campaign-archive1.com"/&gt;

The ADG continues to maintain a focus on directors’ creative and craft issues through seminars and discussion screenings in capital cities, at its national conference, and in collaboration with a range of other industry organisations, educational institutions and film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agsc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/tender-trap-pdf.pdf |title=composersguild |publisher=Agsc.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703024446/http://www.agsc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/tender-trap-pdf.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screen.nsw.gov.au/industry-support/industry-development-fund/?&amp;page=approval_details&amp;fund_approval_id=2168 |title=industry support &amp;#124; funding &amp; incentives |publisher=Screen.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403113259/http://www.screen.nsw.gov.au/industry-support/industry-development-fund/?&amp;page=approval_details&amp;fund_approval_id=2168 |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) 2015 |url=http://miff.com.au/program/film/6535 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150220001327/http://miff.com.au/program/film/6535 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-20 |publisher=Miff.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
A '''bandwidth-sharing game''' is a type of [[resource allocation]] game designed to model the real-world allocation of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to many users in a network. The game is popular in [[game theory]] because the conclusions can be applied to real-life networks. The game is described as follows:

== The game ==
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; players
* each player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has utility &lt;math&gt;U_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; for amount &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of bandwidth
* user &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; pays &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; for amount &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of bandwidth and receives net utility of &lt;math&gt;U_i(x)-w_i&lt;/math&gt;
* the total amount of bandwidth available is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

We also use assumptions regarding &lt;math&gt;U_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;U_i(x)\ge0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;U_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is increasing and concave
* &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous

The game arises from trying to find a price &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; so that every player individually optimizes their own welfare. This implies every player must individually find &lt;math&gt;argmax_xU_i(x)-px&lt;/math&gt;. Solving for the [[maximum yields]] &lt;math&gt;U_i^'(x)=p&lt;/math&gt;.

== The problem ==
With this maximum condition, the game then becomes a matter of finding a price that satisfies an equilibrium. Such a price is called a [[market clearing price]].

== A possible solution ==

A popular idea to find the price is a method called fair sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=D.|last2=Tsitsiklis|first2=J. N.|last3=Zhong|first3=Y.|date=2014|title=Qualitative properties of α-fair policies in bandwidth-sharing networks|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1389278720|journal=The Annals of Applied Probability|language=EN|volume=24|issue=1|pages=76–113|doi=10.1214/12-AAP915|issn=1050-5164|via=|arxiv=1104.2340}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this game, every player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is asked for amount they are willing to pay for the given resource denoted by &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. The resource is then distributed in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; amounts by the formula &lt;math&gt;x_i=(\frac{w_i}{\sum_jw_j})*(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This method yields an effective price &lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\sum_jw_j}{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
This price can proven to be market clearing thus the distribution &lt;math&gt;x_1,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is optimal. The proof is as so:

== Proof ==
&lt;math&gt;argmax_{x_i}U_i(x_i)-w_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\implies argmax_{w_i}U_i(\frac{w_i}{\sum_jw_j}*B)-w_i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\implies U^'_i(\frac{w_i}{\sum_jw_j}*B)(\frac{1}{\sum_jw_j}*B-\frac{w_i}{(\sum_jw_j)^2}*B)-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\implies U^'_i(x_i)(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{p}*\frac{x_i}{B})-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\implies U^'_i(x_i)(1-\frac{x_i}{B})=p &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this result to the equilibrium condition above, we see that when &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_i}{B}&lt;/math&gt; is very small, the two conditions equal each other and thus, the fair sharing game is almost optimal.

==Server load balancing==
BigWorld Server supports dynamic load balancing, a feature that automatically and dynamically spreads user load across multiple cell apps on the same game server, allowing for large numbers of concurrent users to inhabit the same game space. In 1999, BigWorld ran a test, simulating 900 entities on the same server.&lt;ref name = "[1999] BigWorld Server 900 Entity Concurrency on Vimeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/24618014 |title=[1999] BigWorld Server 900 Entity Concurrency on Vimeo |publisher=BigWorld Pty Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, large scale tests were carried out at the IBM Deep Computing facility in Poughkeepsie, NY. BigWorld successfully demonstrated the linear scalability of its load balancing technology by dynamically balancing 100,000 entities across various cell apps on a single server.&lt;ref name="BigWorld and IBM: Large-scale testing for online games"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/success/cssdb.nsf/CS/MCAG-6HQMGM?OpenDocument&amp;Site=default&amp;cty=en_us |title=BigWorld and IBM: Large-scale testing for online games |publisher=IBM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125205452/http://www-01.ibm.com/software/success/cssdb.nsf/CS/MCAG-6HQMGM?OpenDocument&amp;Site=default&amp;cty=en_us |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Licenses==
BigWorld Technology is offered in the following licenses:

* BigWorld Technology: Commercial Edition
* ''BigWorld Technology: Indie Edition'' (Development, Support) Sales were stopped after the company was acquired.

In [[fiction]], '''canon''' is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the [[fictional universe]] of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of [[fan fiction]]. The alternative terms '''mythology''', '''timeline''', '''universe''' and '''continuity''' are often used, with the former being especially used to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of [[suspension of disbelief]] (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean "to be acknowledged by the creator(s)".

==Origin==
The use of the word "canon" originated in reference to a set of texts derives from [[Biblical canon]], the set of books regarded as [[scripture]], as contrasted with non-canonical [[Apocrypha]].{{sfn|McDonald|2007|p=38}} The term was first used by analogy in the context of fiction to refer to the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes stories and novels]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], as contrasted with numerous Holmes adventures added later by other writers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This usage was afterwards extended to the writings of various other authors.

The term "canon" nowadays refers to all works of fiction within a franchise's fictional universe which are considered "to have actually happened" within the fictional universe they belong to.

==Canonicity==
When there are multiple "official" works or original media, the question of what is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of ''Star Wars'' before the franchise was purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]] universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the ''Star Trek'' remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.{{sfn|Urbanski|2013|p=83}}

The official ''[[Star Trek]]'' website describes [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] as "the events that take place within the episodes and movies" (that is, the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', and the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], with ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' having long existed in a [[Star Trek: The Animated Series#Canon issues|nebulous gray area of canonicity]]).&lt;ref name="trek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html |title=FAQ: Article |date=10 July 2003 |work=startrek.com |publisher=CBS Studios |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events, characters and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the ''Star Trek'' canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that "canon is not something set in stone."&lt;ref name="trek" /&gt; One example of a non-canonical element that later became canonical in the Star Trek universe were the first names for [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] and [[Uhura]], introduced in novels, plus "Tiberius" becoming the official middle name of Enterprise captain [[James T. Kirk]]. The name was introduced in the ''Star Trek'' animated series, and was later added into the official biography of the character by its mention in the live-action film ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991).

The [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]] originally existed on several levels. The highest level was the original ''Star Wars'' films, and statements by [[George Lucas]]; tie-in fiction from the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] had a different level of canonicity.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet Leland Chee, the Star Wars Franchise Continuity Cop |first=Chris |last=Baker |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-09/ff_starwarscanon?currentPage=all |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a [[Lucasfilm]] employee.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon ''The Clone Wars'' was declared in the "Legends" continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. All subsequent material exists on the same level of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|title=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with [[Russell T Davies]] explaining that he does not think about the concept for the ''Doctor Who'' television series or its [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]].&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies RT, "The Writer's Tales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon as distinguishing between original works and later additions==
In literature, the term "canon" is used to distinguish between the original works of a writer who created certain characters and/or settings, and the later works of other writers who took up the same characters or setting. For example, the [[canon of Sherlock Holmes]] consists of the 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four [[novel]]s written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and featuring the detective [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993"&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X }} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|subsequent works]] by other authors who took up Sherlock Holmes are considered "non-canonical".

==Fanon==
&lt;!-- [[Fanon]] links to this section --&gt;
[[Fan fiction]] is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as "fanon", a [[portmanteau]] of ''fan'' and ''canon''.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parrish|2007|p=33}}: 'fanon.' Within an individual fandom, certain plotlines may be reinvented so many times and by so many people—or alternately may be written so persuasively by a few writers—that they take on the status of fan-produced canon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of the word fanon was by [[Emily Salzfass]] in [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated/x4ZMX4jeQG4/FeEBn8gPjYgJ a post about Star Trek] at [[alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated]] on April 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the jargon "headcanon" is used to describe a fan's personal interpretation of a fictional universe.

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9|pp=345–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

==Quantum computation with negative delay==
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;could solve NP problems in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Deutsch | url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | title= Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | year=1991 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | pages=3197–3217 | bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Aaronson]] later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve [[PSPACE]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2008|title=The Limits of Quantum Computers|pages=68–69|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/limitsqc-draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Aaronson |author2=John Watrous | url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf | title=Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume = 465 | year=2009 | issue = 2102 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0350 | pages=631–647 | bibcode=2009RSPSA.465..631A|arxiv = 0808.2669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991" /&gt; Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=RingbauerEtAl2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Ringbauer|author2=Matthew A.

'''Chicco''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkikːo}}) is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of children's clothing and toys with retail outlets worldwide. It is owned by [[Artsana]]. Chicco has been in business for 60 years and is now in more than 120 countries.

== History ==
Chicco was founded in 1958 by [[Cavaliere del Lavoro]] Pietro Catelli who wanted to celebrate the birth of his first son Enrico, affectionately known as “Chicco”. On his death in 2006, the company passed to his three children, Enrico, Michele and Francesca, who would open new branches in [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Poland]]. Since May 2013, the role of [[Managing Director]] has been held by Claudio De Conto.

== Products and research ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1837">In [[jazz]], a '''constant structure''' is a [[chord progression]] consisting of three or more [[chord (music)|chords]] of the same type or quality.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;Rawlins, Robert (2005). ''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', p.131. {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularized by pianists [[Bill Evans]] and [[Herbie Hancock]], the combination of [[diatonic function|functional]] and nonfunctional chords provides cohesiveness while producing a free and shifting [[tonic (music)|tonal center]].&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt;

[[File:Constant structure.png|thumb|center|400px|Constant structure example&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; {{audio|Constant structure.mid|Play}}.]]

For example, the progression F&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–D{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–G{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–C&lt;sup&gt;13sus4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; contains four [[major seventh chord]]s (and one [[thirteenth chord]]), none of which are [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] to the [[key (music)|key]] of F major except the first.

[[File:Vi-ii-V-I in C.png|thumb|right|vi–ii–V–I in C&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;William G Andrews and Molly Sclater (2000). ''Materials of Western Music Part 1'', p.227. {{ISBN|1-55122-034-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Vi-ii-V-I in C.mid|Play}}.]]

In contrast, the vi–ii–V–I or [[circle progression]] from classical theory contains four chords of two or three different qualities: major, minor, and possibly a [[dominant seventh chord]]; all of which, however, are diatonic to the key. Thus diversity is achieved within a stable and fixed tonal center.

'''''Dabiq''''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;دابق&lt;/big&gt;}}) was an [[online magazine]] used by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) for [[Radicalization#Islamic radicalization|Islamic radicalisation]]&lt;ref name="cnn-20141013"/&gt; and [[recruitment]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; It was first published in July 2014 in a number of different languages including English. ''Dabiq'' itself states the magazine is for the purposes of unitarianism, truth-seeking, migration, holy war and community (''[[tawhid]], [[Glossary of Islam#M|manhaj]], [[Hegira|hijrah]], [[jihad]]'' and ''[[jama'ah]]'' respectively).&lt;ref name="Clarion project"/&gt;

The [[Clarion Project]] produced a website on ''Dabiq'', which says it is published to recruit people to extremist [[jihadism]], and describes it as a "glossy propaganda magazine ... sophisticated, slick, beautifully produced". The project also hosts unaltered copies of the magazine over their website.&lt;ref name="Clarion project"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.clarionproject.org/news/islamic-state-isis-isil-propaganda-magazine-dabiq#|author= Clarion project|title=website|publisher=published by Clarion project|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harleen K. Gambhir of the [[Institute for the Study of War]] considered that while [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]'s magazine [[Inspire (magazine)|''Inspire'']] focuses on encouraging its readers to carry out lone-wolf attacks on the West, ''Dabiq'' was more concerned with establishing the religious legitimacy of ISIL and its self-proclaimed [[caliphate]], and encouraging Muslims to emigrate there.&lt;ref name="ISWDabiq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dabiq: The Strategic Messaging of the Islamic State|url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Dabiq%20Backgrounder_Harleen%20Final.pdf|publisher=[[Institute for the Study of War]]|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its October 2014 issue, an article outlined [[Islamic views on slavery|religious justifications for slavery]] and praised its revival.&lt;ref name="cnn-20141013"&gt;Salma Abdelaziz, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/12/world/meast/isis-justification-slavery/ "ISIS states its justification for the enslavement of women"], [[CNN]], October 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]], [http://www.newsweek.com/islamic-state-seeks-justify-enslaving-yazidi-women-and-girls-iraq-277100 "Islamic State Seeks to Justify Enslaving Yazidi Women and Girls in Iraq"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', 10-13-2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athena Yenko, [http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/569402/20141013/islamic-state-dabiq-magazine-isis-slavery.htm#.VD7r9EnD_Gg "Judgment Day Justifies Sex Slavery Of Women – ISIS Out With Its 4th Edition Of Dabiq Magazine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018222114/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/569402/20141013/islamic-state-dabiq-magazine-isis-slavery.htm |date=2014-10-18 }}, ''[[International Business Times]]-Australia'', October 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen McDuffee, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/isis-confirms-and-justifies-enslaving-yazidis-in-new-magazine-article/381394/ "ISIS Is Now Bragging About Enslaving Women and Children"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Oct 13 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Spencer, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11158797/Thousands-of-Yazidi-women-sold-as-sex-slaves-for-theological-reasons-says-Isil.html "Thousands of Yazidi women sold as sex slaves 'for theological reasons', says Isil"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 13 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, ISIL replaced Dabiq with another online magazine, ''[[Rumiyah (magazine)|Rumiyah]]'' (Arabic for ''Rome''), published in English and other languages. Analysts speculated this was due to ISIL being [[2016 Dabiq offensive|driven out of the town of Dabiq]] by the Turkish Military and Syrian Rebels in October 2016. The new title refers to an Islamic prophecy about the fall of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/12/after-the-islamic-state|author=Robin Wright|title=After the Islamic State|publisher=''The New Yorker''|date=2016-12-02|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/town-of-dabiq-falls-to-turkish-backed-forces.php|title=Town of Dabiq falls to Turkish-backed forces|publisher=''The long War Journal''|date=2016-10-17|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-islamic-state-children-iraq-syria-western-targets-a7485316.html |author=Kim Sengupta|title=Isis indoctrinating children to plan attacks on Big Ben, Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''Daily Grand''' is a Canadian [[lottery]] game coordinated by the [[Interprovincial Lottery Corporation]], as one of the country's three national lottery games, alongside [[Lotto 6/49]] and [[Lotto Max]]. Sales began on October 18, 2016, and the first draw was held on October 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="vsun-dg"/&gt; The game was not launched in Atlantic Canada until 2017.&lt;ref name="bclc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vsun-dg"/&gt;

Winning numbers are chosen from five of 49 main numbers, and a "Grand Number" from 1 to 7. The Grand Number can also be used to match numbers from the five main numbers. A single board costs $3, and the game's top prize is an [[annuity]] of $1,000 a day (with a $7,000,000 lump sum option). Draws are held bi-weekly on Monday and Thursday nights.&lt;ref name="bclc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Grand retailer information|url=https://lotto.bclc.com/content/dam/bclc/lotto/retailer-hub/documents/retail-network/retailer-documents/29257-daily-grand-launch-ris-rn-oct-3-nov-6-2016.pdf|publisher=BCLC|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lump sum option is available on the top two prizes, and is the only option if there are multiple winners. The annuity will last for the remainder of the winner's life, with a guaranteed period of 20 years (a beneficiary is chosen to receive the remainder of the 20-year minimum balance if the winner dies before the 20 years passes).&lt;ref name="bclc"/&gt;

== Promotion ==
As part of a promotional effort for Daily Grand, the [[British Columbia Lottery Corporation]] announced a contest in which entrants would be asked how they would use the grand prize. The winners were to receive $1,000 prizes, and have to film themselves using the money.&lt;ref name="vsun-dg"&gt;{{cite web|title=New B.C. lottery: Could you scrape by on $1,000 a day?|url=http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/new-b-c-lottery-could-you-scrape-by-on-1000-a-day|website=Vancouver Sun|publisher=Postmedia Network|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Djaoeh Dimata'''''{{efn|Various contemporary spellings also include ''Djaoeh di Mata'', ''Djauh Dimata'', and ''Djauh di Mata''.}} ({{IPA-id|dʒaˈu diˈmata|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Jauh Dimata'''''; Indonesian for ''Out of Sight'') is a 1948 film from what is now Indonesia{{efn|The film was released during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], in which time Indonesia had declared itself independent while the [[Dutch East Indies]] was still formally in existence.}} written and directed by [[Andjar Asmara]] for the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC). Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].

The first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].

==Plot==
[[File:Ratna Asmara, Ali Yugo, and Iscandar Sukarno in Djaoeh di Mata, Peran Pemuda dalam Kebangkitan Film Indonesia, p50.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film]]
A poor villager, Asrad ([[Ali Joego]]), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&amp;nbsp;– unknown to Asrad&amp;nbsp;– soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, "Djaoeh Dimata", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385–387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&amp;nbsp;– [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&amp;nbsp;– six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339–343}}

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}

SPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}} [[Max Tera]] served as assistant cinematographer on this [[black-and-white]] film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Max Tera}}

The film starred Ratna Asmara (wife of Andjar), Ali Yugo, Iskandar Sucarno, and Djauhari Effendi,{{efn|Sources do not indicate Effendi's role.}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Djaoeh Dimata}} all of whom had previous theatrical experience. Ratna and Ali, together with Andjar, had been members of the travelling troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]] in the early 1930s and entered the film industry together in 1940 with ''[[Kartinah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Yugo}}; {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iskandar and Djauhari, meanwhile, had been active in the theatre during the occupation; both made their feature film debuts with ''Djaoeh Dimata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djauhari Effendi}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Iskander Sucarno}}; {{harvnb|''Het Vrije Volk'' 1948, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Principal photography]] was conducted on sets constructed by artistic director Hajopan Bajo Angin in SFPC's studio in Jakarta. The company's equipment was of good quality, but conditions were detrimental to filming; a contemporary report notes that one [[take]], done inside the studio, was ruined by the sound of a passing car.{{sfn|''Limburgsch Dagblad'' 1948, In Batavia Wordt}} Filming, which took two{{sfn|''De Vrije Pers'' 1948, Indonesische films}} to three months,{{sfn|''Het Vrije Volk'' 1948, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}} was completed on 10 November 1948.{{sfn|''Het Dagblad'' 1948, Camera draait}} Production costs were almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]],{{efn|At the time, 130,000 gulden was officially the equivalent to US$ 50,000, with an exchange rate at 2.6 gulden to the dollar. Owing to the war, however, the black market price of dollars was 4 to 5 times as much {{harv|Mooney 1948, Holland}}.}} which was partially obtained from ethnic Chinese backers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|''Limburgsch Dagblad'' 1948, In Batavia Wordt}}; {{harvnb|''De Vrije Pers'' 1948, Indonesische films}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film included multiple songs, including [[Gesang Martohartono]]'s 1940 hit "[[Bengawan Solo (song)|Bengawan Solo]]".{{sfn|''De Vrije Pers'' 1949, (untitled)}}

==Release and reception==
''Djaoeh Dimata'' was released in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since ''Berdjoang''.{{sfn|Said|McGlynn|Heider|1991|p=3}} Despite this five-year gap, film critic [[Usmar Ismail]] writes that it did not stray from the formula which had been proven before the war,{{sfn|Ismail|1983|pp=54–56}} one which Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}} [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (''Tears Flow in Citarum''), which had similar themes, was released shortly after ''Djaoeh Dimata'' by the rival Tan &amp; Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=367}} Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled ''Anggrek Bulan'' (''Moon Orchid''), which was also directed by Andjar.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=385}}

Reviews of the film, which was rated for all ages,{{sfn|''De Vrije Pers'' 1949, (untitled)}} were mixed. One in the Jakarta-based ''Het Dagblad'' found the film to have many (unspecified) weak moments as well as strong ones. It particularly praised Ali's acting as a blind man, as well as Denninghoff-Stelling's camerawork.{{sfn|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}} Another reviewer, in the magazine ''Mestika'', described Ratna as an "unprecedented tragedienne"{{efn|Original: "''... een tragedienne zonder weerga''"}} capable of making viewers cry "unrestrained tears of emotion".{{efn|Original: "''... zijn tranen van ontroering, niet bedwingen kan.''"}}&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|''Het Nieuwsblad voor Sumatra'' 1949, Een 'Anak Medan'}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Djaoeh Dimata'' was released in [[Singapore]] in June 1949, a reviewer for ''[[The Straits Times]]'' praised the film's "fine photography and almost perfect sound".{{sfn|''The Straits Times'' 1949, Indies Film}}

Andjar directed two further films for South Pacific, ''Anggrek Bulan'' and ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (''Maiden from the Village''; 1949).{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with ''[[Sedap Malam]]'' (''Sweetness of the Night''), for [[Djamaluddin Malik]]'s company Persari.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}} Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Yugo}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djauhari Effendi}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Iskander Sucarno}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPFC made another six films before shutting down at the end of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in 1949.{{Efn|The Dutch had recognised Indonesia's independence after [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|several months of negotiations]]. In the aftermath, the Indonesian government acquired Regerings Film Bedrijf, SPFC's parent company. It was merged with Berita Film Indonesia to form Perusahaan Pilem Negara (State Film Company), later renamed [[Produksi Film Negara]] {{harv|JCG, Berita Film Indonesia}}.}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, South Pacific}} A [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]] copy of ''Djaoeh Dimata'' is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]] in Jakarta.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}

'''Fatty Fudge''' is a British comics character who is most associated with the British comics magazine ''[[The Beano]]''. He was originally a supporting character in ''[[Minnie the Minx]]'' by [[Leo Baxendale]], but eventually received his own spin-off comic.

==Character==
As his name suggests, Fatty Fudge is an obese boy with an addiction to unhealthy food, particularly confectionery. He is very greedy and would do anything for food, which Minnie often uses to her advantage. He is largely confined to supporting roles in the [[Minnie the Minx]] cartoon strip in which, alongside Minnie's other rival Soppy Susan, he is usually the butt of Minnie's pranks, although his services are occasionally engaged by Minnie for the furtherence of her schemes. His real name is '''Frederick James Fudge'''.

=== Family ===
He has a son named '''Frederick Fudge Jr.''' and he also appeared with him in [[The Beano]] comics, The [[Beano Video]], The [[Beano Videostars]] and the TV series "[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]".

In the Beano Video and the Beano Videostars, three of his clones were Red, Yellow and Blue. However the red version of Fatty Fudge appeared without the blue and yellow Fatty Fudges in "Pink Glove" from the Beano Video and "Jelly Babies" from the Beano Videostars.

==Spin-off==

From 1989–1991, however, Fatty had his own spin-off strip devoted entirely to the parodying of famous films. Examples of this include ''Ghost Burgers'', ''Toast Busters'' (both puns on ''[[Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters]]''), ''You only eat Rice'' (''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''), ''Sleeping Fatty'' (''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''), ''Frankfurterstein'' (''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''), ''Fishfinger'' (''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''), ''Live and Let Diet'' (''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''), ''The Incredible Bulk'' (''[[The Incredible Hulk]]''), ''2001: A Space Obesity'' (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), and ''20,000 Leeks Under the Sea'' (''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20.000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''). He also appeared in a parody of the British quiz show ''[[Bob's Full House]]'', called "Slob's Full Tum", where contestants had to eat as much as they could and whoever got a full tum in the quickest time was the winner.  The game show was hosted by "Slob Monkhouse", again a parody of the original host name [[Bob Monkhouse]].  These strips were all drawn by [[Jim Petrie]], the ''Minnie the Minx'' artist at that time.

The strip reappeared in Issue 3616, dated 17 December 2011, it was so former artist Jim Petrie could get a proper retirement. The comic asked for ideas for the strip on Beano.com. In the end, the winning idea was "The Tummy Returns", suggested by William Clyde, this appeared in the comic. Other suggestions that were considered good by Petrie included: "Iron (stomach) Man" (''[[Iron Man]]''), "A-lard-in" (''[[Aladdin]]''), "Harry Scoffer and the order on Phoenix Street" (''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''), all from Harry Rickard, "Currynation Street" (''[[Coronation Street]]'') and "The Fat in the Hat" (''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''), both by Oliver Forde.

L. James]]. After accepting entrepreneur CEO Christian Grey's proposal in ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'', Anastasia Steele must adjust not only to married life but to her new husband's wealthy lifestyle and controlling nature. The paperback edition was first published in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifty Shades Freed (Fifty Shades #3) |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536860-fifty-shades-freed |publisher=[[Goodreads]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==  
Anastasia 'Ana' Steele and Christian Grey return to [[Seattle]] after a long honeymoon. Christian is upset to find that Ana has kept her maiden name, Steele, at work. After some resistance, Ana relents and changes her name at work to Grey after realizing how important it is to Christian. As a belated wedding gift, Christian gives Seattle Independent Publishing to Ana, who plans to rename it Grey Publishing.

While Christian is on a business trip in New York, Anastasia goes out for a drink with longtime friend, Kate Kavanagh, doing so against Christian's wishes. Returning home, she finds that her former boss, Jack Hyde, who was fired for attempting to sexually assault Ana, has been apprehended by the security staff. Duct tape is found in his pocket and in his van there are tranquilizers and a ransom note—all indications that he intended to kidnap her. Jack is arrested. Angry with Ana for defying him, Christian cuts short his New York business trip and returns to Seattle. Furious that Ana reneged on her promise to have Kate over rather than go out, an upset Christian sulks while Ana sleeps. Eventually, the two argue and Ana berates him for being overly controlling and possessive. She demands more freedom and access to her friends. Christian finally relents after realizing how much Ana's friends mean to her and that Ana did the right thing by staying with Kate rather than at home. Soon after, Christian surprises her with a trip to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], with Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Kate's brother, Ethan. While there, Elliot proposes to Kate, and she accepts.

Ana's step-father, Ray, is in a medically-induced coma after a car accident. When he awakens a few days later, Ana and Christian arrange to move him to Seattle to recover. It is also Ana's birthday weekend, and Christian surprises her with all her family and friends at a dinner. He gives her a charm bracelet with the charms representing all their "firsts" including an ice cream cone to represent their "vanilla" relationship. Christian also gifts her with an  [[Audi R8]]. Soon after, Ana learns she is pregnant. Christian angrily accuses her of getting pregnant on purpose and leaves. He returns early the next morning drunk, claiming Ana will choose the baby - whom he believes to be a boy - over him. Ana says it could be a girl, though Christian refuses to accept that due to his sexist and chauvinistic nature. Ana becomes furious when she discovers a text message on Christian's phone from Elena Lincoln, the woman who seduced him when he was fifteen and introduced him to the [[BDSM]] lifestyle. The message indicates they met for a drink.

The next two mornings, Anastasia and Christian barely speak to each other: Christian is angry over the unplanned pregnancy; Anastasia is upset about his late-night encounter with Elena, though Christian insists their relationship is long-since over. When Christian is away on a business for a few days, Ana receives a call from Jack Hyde. He has kidnapped Mia Grey and demands $5 million in two hours. He warns Ana not to tell anyone or he will kill Mia.

Anastasia feigns illness and returns home to escape her bodyguard, Sawyer. She takes a gun and goes to the bank. While collecting the money, the suspicious bank manager calls Christian. who believes Ana is leaving him. To protect Mia's life, Ana lies to Christian, saying she is leaving him to raise the baby alone. Hyde instructs Ana to leave her phone but she tricks him by taking the bank manager's phone instead and dropping it in the trash. She leaves via the back entrance to a waiting car, shocked that Hyde's accomplice is Elizabeth Morgan, her co-worker. When handing over the money, Hyde tries to kill Ana out of vengeance for losing his job, causing Elizabeth to feel guilty for being involved. Angered by his behavior and his hurting Ana, she and Hyde argue. On the ground and bruised, Ana shoots Hyde in the leg. When Ana starts to black out she hears Christian calling her name.

Ana wakes three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though he is angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Ana returns home the next day. Christian learns from his private investigator, Welch, that he and Hyde had the same foster family. He tells Ana about how he met and was seduced by Elena. By introducing him to the world of BDSM, Elena helped Christian learn to take control of his life. If she had not intervened, he would still be plagued with horrible memories of his mother and would never have been able to control his life. Ana feels guilty for her behavior when he explains that he had been looking for his psychiatrist, Dr. Flynn, because he needed help. When he could not contact Flynn, Christian wound up at Elena's salon and they then had a drink at the bar. Although she made a pass at him, Elena realized that Christian loved Ana and finally agrees to leave on good terms. 

The next day, a furious Christian discovers that Elena's ex-husband, Eric Lincoln, has bailed Jack from jail out of spite for her affair with Christian. Christian tells Ana that after learning about the affair, Eric severely beat Elena and divorced her. Despite Christian's urging, Elena refused to press charges against Eric out of guilt. Christian retaliated by buying out Eric Lincoln's logging company to sell it off. It is also learned Elizabeth confessed to police that she was blackmailed by Hyde to be his accomplice. (However, her ultimate fate remains a mystery.)

Two years later, Ana and Christian have a son named Theodore Raymond Grey, nicknamed Teddy, and Ana is six months pregnant with their second child, a daughter whom they decide to name Phoebe. Elliot and Kate have married and have a two-month-old daughter named Ava. At the end, after having BDSM sex, Ana and Christian are getting ready to celebrate Teddy's second birthday with their family and friends.

'''George Formby''' (born '''James Lawler Booth'''; 4 October 1875&amp;nbsp;– 8 February 1921) was an English comedian and singer in musical theatre, known as one of the greatest [[music hall]] performers of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Dundee C: Obit" /&gt; His comedy played upon Lancashire stereotypes, and he was popular around Britain. His nickname, "The Wigan Nightingale", was coined because of the way he would use his [[Bronchitis|bronchial]] cough as a comedic device in his act.

Formby was born into poverty in the industrial north west of England; his mother was an alcoholic and part-time prostitute, and during much of his youth he was maltreated. To earn money he would sing for pennies on street corners, before he joined a singing duo in his teens. He began to develop his own act during the 1890s and built up a following in Lancashire. He also developed a series of stage characters, including that of "John Willie", which is described by the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards as "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad&amp;nbsp;... hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through."{{sfn|Richards|2004}} Formby also had a successful recording career and made the transition from music hall to [[revue]] in 1916.

His health had always been poor, but a stage accident in 1916 weakened Formby's lungs,  and he suffered increasingly for the next few years, reducing his ability to perform. [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|influenza]]—the latter contracted in the [[1918 flu pandemic|pandemic of 1918]]—weakened his constitution further, and he died of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] in 1921 at the age of 45. Formby's act, and one of his costumes and canes, inspired [[Charlie Chaplin]] in the formation of his character [[the Tramp]]. Formby's son also used parts of his father's act when starting his stage career and, once established, also changed his name to [[George Formby]]; Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943.

==Biography==

===Early years: 1875–90===
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|quote="Mine is not an isolated story of the stage. Which of the 'bhoys', I wonder, can say they never knew days of privation and distress? But which of them, I wonder, can tell a more pathetic story than I?"|source=Formby on his childhood&lt;ref name="Red Letter" /&gt;|width=250px|salign=right}}
George Formby was born James Lawler Booth in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Lancashire]], on 4 October 1875. He was the illegitimate and only child of Sarah Jane Booth (c. 1856–1912), a poor, illiterate cotton weaver. His father, Francis Lawler, a coal miner, was not named on the [[birth certificate]]; six months after the birth of their son, the couple married, both aged about 19.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=1}}{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=4}} Sarah worked as a prostitute; she was small, around {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall, and sang in pubs in exchange for alcoholic drinks. She was convicted 140 times for offences that included theft, prostitution, drunkenness and brawling.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=1}} The marriage was turbulent, and Formby was often neglected, mistreated and suffered [[malnutrition|malnourishment]]. Because Sarah was frequently absent from home, and often detained overnight at the local police station, Formby was  regularly forced to sleep outside. As a result he developed [[asthma]] and became susceptible to [[bronchitis]].{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=4}}{{sfn|Randall|Seaton|1974|p=21}}{{efn|Formby was not alone in developing a chest complaint: the mortality rate from bronchitis was 20% higher in the north west than the rest of the country.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|pp=10–11}}}} In his later years he recalled that his "childhood was the most miserable as ever fell to the lot of a human creature".{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=4}}

Formby left formal education at the age of eight or nine, and did not learn to read until well into his teenage years.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=4}}{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=3}}{{efn|Details—including dates—for Formby's activities are scant: his biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, write that "little is known about the period between 1884 and 1892"; many of the stories Formby related later in life are contradicted by extant records. One of Formby's claims was that he ran away from home when he was seven and worked in a steel foundry near [[Wigan]]. Official census records, however, show that in 1891 he was still living with his mother, his father having died the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office for National Statistics]], "1891 [[Census in the United Kingdom|UK Census]]", RG12; Piece: 3277; Folio 127; p. 13; GSU roll: 6098387.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=5–6}}}} To earn money for the household, he sang on street corners for [[Coins of the pound sterling|coppers]]; the family's poverty worsened when, in October 1890, Lawler died from [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] at the age of 33.&lt;ref name="Red Letter" /&gt;{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=7}} Formby secured a job at a cotton mill and spent two years as a [[loom]] builder. He supplemented his wages by singing in pubs, alehouses and free-and-easies,{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=2}}&lt;ref name="Variety: Loom" /&gt; the last being places where informal arrangements were made for patrons to provide their own entertainment.{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=324}} Around this time he joined up with another boy to form an act, "the Glenray Brothers" (also "the Glen Ray Brothers"), which was profitable enough to have a manager; the act continued until Formby's [[boy soprano]] voice broke, after which the pair separated.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=4–5}}

===Burgeoning stage career: 1890–1902===
[[File:伊丽莎白·福尔比，奈伊·霍伊1921所摄.png|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders image of a woman in her 30s|Formby's second wife Eliza Ann, {{nee}} Hoy (c. 1879–1981), whom he [[bigamous]]ly married{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=65–67}}]]

Formby began to develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several characters with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story is likely to be apocryphal.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=14}}{{efn|Those main sources are the biographies of Formby's son, [[George Formby|George]]: [[David Bret]], who published ''George Formby: A Troubled Genius'' in 1999;&lt;ref name="D Tel: Bret review" /&gt; and Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard who, in 2011, wrote ''It's Turned Out Nice Again!''.&lt;ref name="EDP: TONA" /&gt;}} The origin of the Formby name is more likely to have been a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the [[Argyle Theatre]] in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star [[George Robey]].{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=2}} Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=16}}

One of the earliest characters Formby developed was "John Willie". Baz Kershaw, the professor of theatre, described the character as Formby's "onstage alter ego",{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|pp=85–86}} while the cultural historian [[Jeffrey Richards]] describes Willie as "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad in baggy trousers, tight jacket, and bowler hat, slow-talking, hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through."{{sfn|Richards|2004}} His costume included ill-fitting clothes, large boots worn on the wrong feet, and a variety of hats; he would often carry a cane. In 1908 he lent one of his costumes to a young [[Charlie Chaplin]] when the latter was touring with [[Fred Karno]]'s troupe; Chaplin also incorporated Formby's cane twirl and duck-like walk into his act.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=32}}&lt;ref name="BBC profile" /&gt;

[[File:George Formby Snr – costume montage – vertical.jpg|thumb|alt=Six images of Formby in stage costume|Formby in examples of his costumes]]
In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old music hall performer, and they married in her home town of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in August. Little is known about Salter, although the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 census]] shows that she was still living with her parents. The marriage does not appear to have been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=67–68}}

In 1897 or 1898 Formby was signed to appear at the Lyceum Theatre, [[Blackburn]], supporting the magician [[Walford Bodie]]; a 40-week tour followed, with Formby earning 30 [[shilling]]s a week.{{sfn|Randall|Seaton|1974|p=16}} In 1898, while performing at the Wigan Empire as part of the tour, Formby met Eliza Hoy, the daughter of the Empire's cashier.{{efn|Sources disagree on Eliza's age. Bret states she was 21;{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=3}} Smart and Bothway Howard put her at 19.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=16}} The Formby memorial, including her grave, states that she "Died July 1981, Aged 102 Years".{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=244}} }} The couple married in August the following year at Wigan Registry Office, although this marriage was [[bigamous]] because of his union two years previously with Salter.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=4}}{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=65–67}} In the months after their marriage, Eliza persuaded Formby to join the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], which helped her parents overcome their initial distrust of him.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=4}} Formby and Eliza had thirteen children, of whom seven survived: four daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="Guard: Louv" /&gt; The cultural historian [[David Bret]] states that Formby was "possessed of staggering consumptive virility", as the comedian also had several children with other partners.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=4}} Eliza became an important figure in Formby's professional life, making his costumes and standing in the wings during his performances to help him. Eliza also continued working as a seamstress and would sell chips during lunchtimes to supplement the family's income.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=22 &amp; 30–31}}

===London, and a growing reputation: 1902–16===

In 1902 Formby performed for the first time in London, when he was booked by Ted Granville, the proprietor of the Royal Albert Music Hall in [[Canning Town]], to appear for £3 a week;{{efn|The £3 weekly salary in 1902 is approximately £284 in 2014.&lt;ref name="RPI convert" /&gt;}} Granville subsequently became Formby's London agent. Eliza Formby later recounted that Belle Elmore, the wife (and later victim) of the murderer [[Dr Crippen]], saw Formby perform, and was so impressed that she contacted Granville and told him to travel to [[Leeds]] to see the act.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=23–24}} Formby soon transferred to the [[London Pavilion]] music hall, where he was immediately successful, and became "an idol of the town", according to ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; His popularity increased when [[Marie Lloyd]], the influential music hall singer and actress, said that she would only watch two acts: his and [[Dan Leno]]'s.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=5}} Lloyd recommended Formby to the proprietor of the [[Tivoli Music Hall (London)|Tivoli Music Hall]], who gave the comedian a ten-week run.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=24}} Robey was also impressed, and in 1905 he recommended Formby as the lead in a [[pantomime]] in Newcastle at a salary of £35 a week.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=28}} He was able to command £325 a week by 1920.&lt;ref name="Skinner docu" /&gt;{{efn|Formby's weekly salary of £35 in 1906 is approximately £3,000 in 2014; the £325 weekly salary in 1920 is approximately £15,000.&lt;ref name="RPI convert" /&gt;}}

[[File:乔治·福尔比写的活页乐谱.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Cover of book, showing image of Formby in stage costume, and the words "We All Went Marching In"|Sheet music for "We All Went Marching In", 1913]]
After the Formbys had lost three daughters to early deaths, their first son, [[George Formby|George Hoy Booth]], was born in 1904.{{sfn|Richards|2004}}{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=18 &amp; 24}} Although the boy was born unable to see owing to an obstructive [[caul]], he gained his sight during a violent coughing fit or sneeze when he was a few months old.{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=5}} Over the course of 1904 Formby purchased the singing rights to 57 songs, more than his normal annual number of between 10 and 20; the average cost of his songs was around a [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]].{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=27}}{{efn|A guinea for a song equated to approximately £100 in 2014.&lt;ref name="RPI convert" /&gt;}} Two years later he made his first recordings, on [[phonograph cylinder]]s, for the Louis Sterling Cylinder Company, and in 1907 he signed a recording contract with [[Zonophone]]. He was one of the few performers who had no difficulties recording clearly with the primitive equipment, and he performed in a relaxed fashion for an invisible audience. He would sing his song and then talk to the listener using a variant of his normal stage patter.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=31}} Some of those songs, such as "Playing the Game out West" and "Since I Parted my Hair in the Middle" have been identified by Dave Russell, the social historian, as "clever depictions of a provincial innocent let lose {{sic}} in the capital".{{sfn|Russell|1997|p=132}}

For much of January and February 1908 Formby appeared in various London music halls for which he received £20 a week. The following year, and staying in the capital, he played three halls a night in exchange for £45 a week. One such venue was the Tivoli with Lloyd and [[Little Tich]] as the headline acts. When not performing in London, Formby continued to tour the provincial music halls.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=33}} In 1910 he again appeared at the Tivoli, and was reviewed in ''The Times'', in which the reporter opined that Formby "becomes more of an artist the longer he sings".&lt;ref name="Times—Jan 1910" /&gt; Later that year Formby recorded what would become his most famous song, "Standing at the Corner of the Street", which he also co-wrote.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=24 &amp; 37}} By 1913 his record sales were strong enough for him to negotiate a new recording contract worth £300 a year.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=43}}{{efn|£300 is approximately £25,000 in 2014.&lt;ref name="RPI convert" /&gt;}}

Formby's career received a further boost in July 1913 when he was one of seven acts to appear before [[George&amp;nbsp;V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in a [[Royal Command Performance]] at [[Knowsley Hall]], near Liverpool. ''The Times'' reported that Formby's "broad humour succeeded with unexpected ease, and their Majesties praised him very highly after the performance."&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; Formby was embarrassed by his performance. His usual act partly consisted of a running patter with the orchestra conductor, which he again did on this occasion; behind the conductor sat the royal party, and it looked to some that Formby was speaking disrespectfully to them. The king understood to whom Formby was talking, however, and afterwards presented him with a tiepin.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=45–46}} In October Formby appeared in his second Royal Command Performance of the year,   in a charity show organised by the French actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]]. He took part in two acts:   a performance of "Ten Little Nigger Boys All in a Row", alongside other music hall entertainers  including Robey, [[Mark Sheridan]], [[Cicely Courtneidge]] and [[George Graves (actor)|George Graves]], followed by a short solo piece.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=46–47}}&lt;ref name="Express—Oct 1913" /&gt;

[[File:George Formby with friends – April 1915.JPG|thumb|left|[[George Formby|Formby Jr]] (right) while employed as a jockey, aged 10, in 1915]]
In March 1914 Formby appeared in ''No Fool Like an Old Fool'', a 20-minute-long silent comedy film, which is thought to be [[Lost film|lost]]; it was his only film appearance, and little is known about the plot or his character.{{sfn|St. Pierre|2009|p=40}}{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=7}}{{efn|Although he was keen to undertake further film work a later project never transpired.&lt;ref name="Times: F Film" /&gt;}} When the First World War broke out in August that year, he tried to enlist, but was turned down on medical grounds; instead  he, like many music hall stars, was active in the recruiting campaign for the army and spoke at  rallies,{{sfn|Quigley|1916|p=100}}{{sfn|Randall|Seaton|1974|pp=28–29}} particularly on behalf of the [[Derby Scheme]].{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=47–48}}

Formby was always worried that his son George would watch him on stage, as he did not wish the boy to become a comic, saying "one fool in the family is enough".&lt;ref name="Guard: Jnr Obit" /&gt;{{sfn|Bret|1999|pp=6–7}} Nevertheless, although he had sent George away to train as a jockey, in 1915 he allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead part of a stable boy in ''[[By the Shortest of Heads]]'', a thriller directed by [[Bert Haldane]].{{efn|Formby Jr played a stable boy who outwits a gang of villains and wins a £10,000 prize when he comes first in a horse race.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=49}} The film is now considered [[lost film|lost]], with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=51}}}} After the filming, Formby sent his son to Ireland, to continue his jockey training, and also sent the five horses Formby had purchased that year, which joined others he had previously bought.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Bret|1999|p=8}}

===Worsening health, and death: 1916–21===
Formby was injured in June 1916 during rehearsals for the [[revue]] ''Razzle-Dazzle'', after a stage collapsed onto him at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. He suffered lung damage and was treated for a [[pulmonary haemorrhage]] at [[Guy's Hospital]] before recovering.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=53}} Although he was the lead in the show, the premiere took place without him; it was criticised by reviewers, and ''[[The Observer]]'' thought that "some of it seemed to have strayed in by mistake out of a second-rate provincial pantomime".&lt;ref name="Obs: Razzle 1" /&gt; Formby returned within a week and the reviews were more positive, with ''The Observer'' stating that it was "one of the successes of the season&amp;nbsp;... ''Razzle-Dazzle'' is now one of the liveliest revues in London, and the most spectacular".&lt;ref name="Obs: Razzle 2" /&gt;{{efn|In July Formby also appeared for a week at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]] during the run of ''Razzle-Dazzle'', after the impresario [[Alfred Butt]] refused to release him from a long-standing booking.&lt;ref name="Variety: July 16" /&gt;}} By August the production had   transferred to the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], Leicester Square.&lt;ref name="Obs: Razzle 3" /&gt;

[[File:George Formby snr, 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white headshot of Formby, looking to the camera|Formby, c. 1921]]
The damage to Formby's lungs from the accident was exacerbated by tuberculosis, and he began to miss an increasing number of his appearances.{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|pp=53–54}} In 1917 the [[Southport]] Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.&lt;ref name="Guard: Court action" /&gt;

Formby's health was further damaged in the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic of 1918]], during which he contracted the disease while appearing at the [[Hulme Hippodrome|Manchester Hippodrome]] and was unable to work for a month.&lt;ref name="Guard: Influenza" /&gt;{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=58}} He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919,&lt;ref name="Variety: 1919 break" /&gt; and collapsed on stage during a performance in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the 1920–21 pantomime season.&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding,{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=61}} and an [[oxygen tent]] was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=11}}

In early 1921 Formby was appearing at the Newcastle Empire in ''Jack and Jill'' when he collapsed after a show. He returned to his home near Warrington, where he died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 8 February, at the age of 45.&lt;ref name="Sunday Post" /&gt; He was buried in a family plot in the Catholic section of [[Warrington|Warrington Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Warrington Cemetery" /&gt; He left over £25,000 in his will,{{efn|£25,000 is approximately £965,000 in 2014.&lt;ref name="RPI convert" /&gt;{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=70}}}} listing Eliza as [[wikt:executrix|executrix]]. As their marriage had been bigamous, he described her as "my reputed wife Eliza Ann Booth, otherwise Eliza Ann Hoy".{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=67}}

The obituarist for ''The Manchester Guardian'' wrote that Formby was one of the "great [[wikt:droll|drolls]]" of the music hall whose humour "always seemed to take its rise in a sympathetic perception of human vanities and weaknesses".&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt; ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' considered him a great comedian, made all the greater by his continuing to perform through his illness,&lt;ref name="Dundee C: Obit" /&gt; while the drama critic [[J. T. Grein]], writing in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', thought that Formby, "along with [[Harry Lauder|[Harry] Lauder]], Robey and [[Albert Chevalier|[Albert] Chevalier]], formed the leading quartette {{sic}} of the profession".&lt;ref name="ILN obit" /&gt;

==Stage persona and technique==
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|quote="His art seemed absolutely guileless and childish, in the vein of the Hatter's madness, but there was method in it—that wonderful form of humour which the Londoner appreciates, but cannot imitate. It was racial of the Lancastrian soil".|source=[[J. T. Grein]], ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''&lt;ref name="ILN obit" /&gt;|width=250px|salign=right}}

Formby was the first comic to use a delayed entrance as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=14}} His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses",{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=22}} and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would say that he was "Coughin' well tonight!" He also created the phrase "It's not the cough that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!"&lt;ref name="BBC profile" /&gt;{{sfn|Krishnamurthy|2009|p=240}}{{sfn|Russell|2004|p=158}} One of Formby's nicknames, "The [[Wigan]] Nightingale" was coined because of the way he used his bronchial cough in his act.{{sfn|Macnab|2000|p=94}}

The "John Willie" character, like much of Formby's act, used pathos as one of the comedic drivers, "but it was not contrived and was never mawkish", according to Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, two of Formby Jr's biographers.{{sfn|Randall|Seaton|1974|p=23}} In his examination of British screen stars, Geoffrey Macnab agrees, and identifies that although Formby's jokes were about himself, "there was grit in the routines, a resolute denial of self-pity".{{sfn|Macnab|2000|p=94}} ''The Times'' examined the performer's style of humour, and considered it "often crude, and always simple, but it was always true humour, and, what is more, it was invariably clean."&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;

Much of Formby's humour was based in his north western roots, particularly Wigan, which he told people was where he was born, rather than Ashton.&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt; He would refer to taking his holidays at [[Wigan Pier]], which was a small wooden platform on the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] for loading coal, rather than a [[Pier#Pleasure pier|pleasure pier]].{{sfn|Gildart|2013|p=255}} ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' called him "Lancashire's accredited representative on the London variety stage&amp;nbsp;... clown-satirist of genius".&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt;

When he performed in London, Formby would change his act, introducing himself as "Good evening, I'm Formby fra' Wigan&amp;nbsp;... I've not been in England long"; he slightly modified his stage persona, and he played "the naïve boy trying to fit in with the sophisticated south".{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=24}} Smart and Boothroyd consider that "the contrast between his northern accent and metropolitan bravado was humorous, and the more urbane and sophisticated his audience the more George exaggerated his provincial gormlessness".{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=24}}

Six weeks after Formby's death, his son George first appeared on stage in a copy of his father's act; he initially appeared under the name George Hoy—using his mother's maiden name—but soon took his father's stage name.&lt;ref name="Skinner docu" /&gt;{{sfn|Bret|1999|pp=11 &amp; 14}} Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943, and the highest-paid entertainer in Britain.{{sfn|Richards|2004}}

Chaplin, who derived some of his stage persona from Formby's, sailed in 1908 with Karno's troupe to the United States, where he developed the character of the Tramp, the image of which became universally familiar by 1915.{{sfn|Robinson|1986|p=210}} [[George Orwell]] later used Formby's humorous concept of "Wigan Pier" in the title of his 1937 study of depression and unemployment in the area, ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]''.{{sfn|Richards|2010|p=191}}

Formby left over 190 recordings,{{sfn|Smart|Bothway Howard|2011|p=31}} and after his death ''The Times'' commented, "There cannot be many people who have not heard at some time in their lives either the words or the refrain of 'John Willie – Come On', 'One of the Boys', 'I was Standing on the Corner of the Street', or 'Playing the Game in the West{{' "}},&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; songs described by Fisher as "afizz with gaiety and champagne".{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=10}}

In October 1922 a large marble memorial was unveiled at the site of Formby's grave, in the presence of Formby Jr, Eliza and a large crowd.&lt;ref name="Mirror: Memorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pathe news" /&gt; The memorial later became the resting place for both the younger Formby and Eliza.&lt;ref name="Skinner docu" /&gt; In June 2012 a [[blue plaque]] was unveiled at Hodgson Street, Ashton, Formby's birthplace.&lt;ref name="MEN: Formby plaque" /&gt;

'''''Ikonz''''' is a national entertainment magazine published in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was a print magazine between 2006 and 2011.

==Background==
The publication was launched as a regional monthly glossy in December 2006 by AEM Worldwide. Its official national [[UK]] launch took place in February 2007.

''Ikonz'' caters for young [[British Asian]]s, focusing on the [[film]] and [[music industry]] in both [[Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]]. The magazine also carries mainstream British [[celebrity]] gossip, fashion and entertainment stories throughout.

==Content==
''Ikonz'' is primarily aimed at British Asian women, although not as directly as in other Asian magazines. Initially, the publication balanced editorial for both male and female audiences with distinct urban influences. Following a revamp in September 2007, a large portion of the magazine adopted a more female orientated theme with equal coverage afforded to mainstream content.

A series of high-profile mainstream interviews, including exclusives with [[Halle Berry]], [[Jessica Alba]], and [[Jennifer Lopez]], have encouraged the growth of the publication. These, along with Brit-Asian and urban interviews such as [[Boyz II Men]], [[Keisha White]], [[Richard Blackwood]], [[Jay Sean]] and [[50 Cent]], have allowed the publication to increase its appeal

However, the magazine's key south Asian content remains in the form of Bollywood interviews with A-list artists including [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Shilpa Shetty]], [[Aishwarya Rai]] and [[Bipasha Basu]]. In July 2007, it ran special coverage of the [[International Indian Film Academy|IIFA]] awards. Also featured heavily are British Bhangra artists.

''Ikonz'' is the only British Asian publication to have regular contributions from mainstream celebrities. In October 2007, actors [[Kevin Sacre]], [[Ricky Whittle]] and [[Sam Darbyshire]] from television soap [[Hollyoaks]] appeared in a special [[Halloween]] photo feature for the magazine, alongside presenters from the [[BBC Asian Network]]. The feature was reproduced by national publications including the [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] and [[More (magazine)]].

The magazine took the step to support glamour model [[Katie Price]] in November 2007, following the publication in [[Heat (magazine)]] of an offensive sticker mocking Price's son Harvey.

==Personnel==
The editor of ''Ikonz'' is [[Reena Combo]], with [[Adam Yosef]] as the sub editor.

The magazine's editorial team includes editorial assistants, contributors, international correspondents and freelance writers and photographers.

==New Media==
''Ikonz'' magazine is complemented by a website, an online video channel, a blog and online profiles including [[myspace]] and [[facebook]].
These mediums are edited by the Ikonz New Media Team and are an online interpretation of the magazine's style and 'personality'. In September 2007, the magazine launched a television advertising campaign.

In February 2011, ''Ikonz'' magazine was relaunched as an online-only format, rebranded as 'Ikonz World'.

==Charity==

In December 2007, ''Ikonz'' donated [[Christmas]] gifts to the [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]].

'''Karadi Tales''' are a series of popular audio books for children in [[India]]. The company produces original Indian multimedia content with focus on audio &amp; video CDs/VCDs &amp; DVDs, data drives in retail, internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaditales.com/FormCatalogsView.aspx |title=Audiobooks, Picture books and Videobooks from India |publisher=Karadi Tales |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcast markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.linkedin.com/companies/karadi-tales-company |title=Karadi Tales Company |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bollywoodhungama.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2009/04/29/12816/index.html |title=Gulzar, Vidya Balan launch Karadi Tales' audio book series |publisher=Bollywoodhungama.com |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Karadi (which is the word in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], etc. meaning bear) is a [[bear]] who is also a story teller bear who tells stories that he has experienced in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaditales.com/ |title=Audiobooks, Picture books and Videobooks from India |publisher=Karadi Tales |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the role or the voice of Karadi was acclaimed [[India]]n [[actor]] [[Naseeruddin Shah]].&lt;ref name="indiatravelogue.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatravelogue.com/book/book10.html |title=Bookshelf - Karadi Tales - The Art of Story-telling for Children |publisher=India Travelogue |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karadi Tales, Karadi is ''a bachelor bear of indeterminate age. Lives in the forests of India and loves to tell stories. Has a huge repertoire of tales, fables and myths from India and from all over the world. Not a trained musician, but can sing very well. A pure vegetarian, he loves honey. Good friends of Meera the monkey and Dhondu the donkey. Much loved by all forest animals and by children everywhere.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaditales.com/AboutUs.aspx?From=Behind_the_scenes|title=Karadi Tales: About Us (Behind The Scenes)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928162858/http://www.karaditales.com/AboutUs.aspx?From=Behind_the_scenes|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The popular stories are from Indian Classics such as the [[Panchatantra]] and the [[Jataka]] and also from the grand epics of India, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharat]]. Although the stories have strong Indian roots, they speak of morals and ideals that are universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianbooksandmore.com/?page=shop/browse&amp;category_id=5 |title=Karadi Tales |publisher=Indianbooksandmore.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==

===Karadi Tales Mythology===
Karadi brings to life a world of gods and demons, kings and queens, a universe of times past. Stories from Indian mythology are woven together and sung by Award winner and celebrated film and theatre personality [[Padmabhushan]] [[Girish Karnad]], who plays the role of [[Karadi]], the bear and sootradhar. The script, lyrics and direction is by Shobha Viswanath. [[Thota Tharani|Padmashri Thota Tharani]] adapts his unique style to communicate art to children, which exposes children to illustrations that are not childish, yet are appealing to the child. Like the art, the music steers away from the childish nursery rhyme format and incorporates Indian aesthetics. The acclaimed group, '3 Brothers &amp; A Violin' have created the songs and background scores that enhance the storytelling experience.

===Under the Banyan===
The Under the Banyan series features folktales from different parts of India. With illustrations and music representative of the region, these stories form a complete cultural experience of different parts of India. The initial four folktales in this series from [[Rajasthan]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Bihar]] were narrated by Usha Uthup. The mantle of sootradhar and storyteller has now been taken over by [[Nandita Das]].&lt;ref name="indiatravelogue.com"/&gt;

===Chitra Picture Books===
Chitra publishes original picture books from India and English-Hindi bilingual editions of popular foreign titles including [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]], [[Mixed Up Chameleon]], [[The Grouchy Ladybug]] and [[The Tiny Seed]] by [[Eric Carle]].

===Dreaming Fingers===
Handcrafted tactile picture books that combine bright colours with an array of tactile sensations. These books are accompanied by Braille letters for the visually impaired and children with special needs. This imprint is produced in association with [[Lemniscaat]] (Rotterdam, Netherlands).

===Charkha Audiobooks===
Charkha is Karadi Tales' audio book imprint for Young Adults &amp; Adults.

==Television==
In October 2009, Karadi Tales premiered on Television with their first animated series on the Disney Channel (India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni1112022/s|title=IMDB: Disney Channel launches Karadi Tales series}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a series of 26 episodes (two seasons) directed by [[Soumitra Ranade]]. Animated characters and backgrounds are uniquely stylised along the lines of the Indian mask-making tradition, which gives the series a distinct look and feel that is sophisticated and very Indian.

==Celebrities association==
[[Vidya Balan]] launched a Karadi Tales book in [[Mumbai]] titled ''Little Vinayak'', the first in the ''Will You Read With Me'' series of audio books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamsham.com/picture-gallery/3279/0/event/vidya-balan-at-karadi-tales-book-launch-gallery.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502101940/http://www.glamsham.com/picture-gallery/3279/0/event/vidya-balan-at-karadi-tales-book-launch-gallery.htm |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2t3vVFKuPs |title=Vidya Balan at Karadi Tales book launch |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Oscar-winning [[lyricist]] [[Gulzar]] was present at the occasion.&lt;ref name="bollywoodhungama.com"/&gt;

'''Laurence Maurice Parnes''' (3 September 1929 – 4 August 1989) was an English pop manager and [[impresario]]. He was the first major British [[rock music|rock]] manager, and his stable of singers included many of the most successful British rock singers of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Parnes' reputation has been damaged in recent years by testimony from many of the artists he managed in the late fifties and early sixties who were ruthlessly exploited, often worked to exhaustion on pay which was a tiny fraction of the profit he made from their talent. Shortly before his death, Parnes told an interviewer that his one regret was 'not to have looked after his bank balance better.' By this time [[Billy Fury]] had died in poverty having made Parnes a fortune.

==Early years==
Parnes was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref name="norman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation |first=Philip |last=Norman |authorlink=Philip Norman (author) |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-74325-378-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MRpqWHwLZNoC&amp;pg=PT196 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Willesden]], London. After leaving school he began work in a clothing store, and by the age of 18 ran a women's clothing shop in [[Romford]], Essex.  He then bought a share in a bar in Romilly Street, [[Soho]]. He agreed to invest in a touring play, ''The House of Shame'', which became both successful and notorious in 1954 after its publicist, John Kennedy, persuaded two actresses to stand outside the theatre dressed as prostitutes.

==Music management==
In 1956, with John Kennedy Parnes began to manage young [[rock and roll]] singer Tommy Hicks; he and John Kennedy approached his parents, after Steele, aged 19, had already signed another contract, which was under the legal age. Steele anglicised the name of his Swedish grandfather to become known as [[Tommy Steele]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tommysteeleinternationalfanclub.com/TOMMYSTEELEBIOGRAPHY.htm  Tommy Steele International Fan Club: biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530073332/http://www.tommysteeleinternationalfanclub.com/TOMMYSTEELEBIOGRAPHY.htm |date=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele achieved popular success, some of his songs being co-written by Parnes' friend [[Lionel Bart]], and Parnes succeeded in presenting Steele as an "all-round entertainer".&lt;ref name=blackcat&gt;[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/larry_parnes.htm  Steve Walker, ''Larry Parnes'', Black Cat Rockabilly]&lt;/ref&gt; Parnes claimed in a court action that he and Kennedy took 40 per cent of Steele's "gross takings", out of which they had to pay 10 per cent to booking agents as well as the costs of Steele's accommodation, advertising and publicity, travel and other aspects "needed to keep Tommy on the road to stardom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tommy Steele's managers bring libel action: "Carve-up" suggestion in magazine |work=The Guardian |date=8 July 1960 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the standard arrangement with Parnes' artists.&lt;ref name="observer1962p6" /&gt;
  
After Steele's success, Parnes looked to find other young men who he could groom to become pop stars. At Bart's suggestion, he next signed Reg Patterson (né Smith), whom he re-christened [[Marty Wilde]], and who also rose to pop stardom in the UK.  Parnes developed a network of contacts within the British recording industry and entertainment business, with leading British songwriters providing songs for his growing stable of talent, and many of his protégés achieving success in the [[UK singles chart|British pop charts]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  A flamboyant gay man,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Straight and narrow: how pop lost its gay edge |work=The Guardian |first=Alexis |last=Petridis |date=28 February 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/28/how-pop-lost-gay-edge |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parnes' approach was to select, and then groom, handsome young men who would be attractive to a teenage audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He also gave them new stage names, which were rumoured to reflect what he considered to be their sexual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The mystery of David Jacobs, the Liberace lawyer |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10094665/The-mystery-of-David-Jacobs-the-Liberace-lawyer.html |date=3 June 2013 |first=Mick |last=Brown |accessdate=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In an interview involving [[Marty Wilde]], Parnes explained the change of name: "Marty - that's a friendly name - and Wilde - that's the ''spirit''. The name must fit the personality. Very important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping it groovy with Marty Wilde |work=The Observer |date=8 November 1959 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Among those he managed with at least some degree of success were [[Billy Fury]] (originally Ron Wycherley), [[Vince Eager]] (Roy Taylor), [[Dickie Pride]] (Richard Knellar), [[Lance Fortune]] (Chris Morris), [[Duffy Power]] (Ray Howard), [[Johnny Gentle]] (John Askew), [[Terry Dene]] (Terence Williams), [[Nelson Keene]] (Malcolm Holland), and [[Georgie Fame]] (Clive Powell).  He also managed [[Tommy Bruce]], as well as [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]], who he unsuccessfully tried to persuade to change his name to Elmer Twitch.&lt;ref name=blackcat/&gt;

Music journalist Richie Unterberger has commented:{{quote|Parnes' performers were groomed as teen idols, rock music being a convenient way to eventually establish all-around entertainers who could also work in straight pop music, variety shows, and film. Image, more than content, was essential to the appeal of Parnes' protégés.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/larry-parnes-p1615827/biography Biography by Richie Unterberger at Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sometimes, Parnes employed his charges himself rather than being employed by them, and paid them a weekly wage.&lt;ref name=fury&gt;[http://www.billyfury.com/parnes/index.htm  Larry Parnes at Billy Fury official site, including late 1970s interview with Parnes]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report:{{quote|Vince Eager began to wonder why he had never received any record royalties. "You're not entitled to any," Larry Parnes told him. "But it says in my contract that I am," Eager protested. "It also says I have power of attorney over you, and I've decided you're not getting any," Parnes replied.&lt;ref name=blackcat/&gt;}}

The [[BBC TV]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' featured Parnes as a '[[beat music|beat]] [[wikt:svengali|svengali]]' and the press gave him the nickname "Mr [[£sd|Parnes, Shillings and Pence]]". He was bitingly satirised as the manipulative "Major Rafe Ralph" by [[Peter Sellers]], from a script by [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]], on the 1959 album ''Songs For Swingin' Sellers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So Little Time |url=http://www.epicure.me.uk/twit.html |website=H'edification for the H'iggerant… |publisher=Chris Hughes |accessdate=2016-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023063359/http://www.epicure.me.uk/twit.html |archivedate=23 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parnes also promoted concerts, including the 1960 tour by [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Eddie Cochran]] during which Cochran was killed in a road crash. Later the same year he hired the Silver Beetles, an early incarnation of the then-unknown [[Beatles]], to back one of his singers, Johnny Gentle, on a short tour of [[Scotland]]. Although Gentle tried to persuade him to manage the group, Parnes decided not to do so.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; Parnes developed the idea of the package tour, for which his stars toured the country together in a bus, playing one-night stands around the country.&lt;ref name=fury/&gt; In 1962, he hired [[the Tornados]] as backing group for Billy Fury, and also claimed to have given "their first breaks" to entertainers [[Jimmy Tarbuck]], [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Mike Yarwood]].&lt;ref name=fury/&gt;

==Theatre and other interests==
Parnes remained an influential impresario even after the rise of the Beatles and other groups had eclipsed those in his stable.&lt;ref name="norman" /&gt;{{efn|Parnes was a friend of Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] and in 1963 attempted to hire them to perform in a series of Sunday concerts on the pier at Great Yarmouth.&lt;ref name="norman" /&gt;}} However, his attitude and approach rapidly became old-fashioned. In 1967 he announced that he was going to devote himself to the theatre, and in 1968 put on ''Fortune and Men's Eyes'', a play about homosexuality in a Canadian prison, but it lost money. He bought a lease of the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in 1972, where during his tenure the first UK production of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' played.  During the 1970s he ran the business affairs of the Olympic [[ice skater]] [[John Curry]] and presented two stage productions with him at the Cambridge Theatre and at the London Palladium.  He also persuaded actress [[Joan Collins]] to perform her first West End play, ''The Last of Mrs Cheyney'', at his theatre in 1976.

Parnes was a [[horse racing]] [[fan (person)|fan]], and owned racehorses, including Cambridge Gold, named after his involvement in the Cambridge Theatre and John Curry.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  He had a [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] property in [[South Kensington]],&lt;ref name="observer1962p6"&gt;{{cite news |title=Parnes dreams of tycoonery |work=The Observer |date=2 December 1962 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and country mansions in [[Send, Surrey]], and [[Icklesham]], [[East Sussex]].

==Later years==
Parnes retired in 1981 and died from [[meningitis]] in London in 1989, aged 59. His obituary in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said:&lt;ref name=blackcat/&gt;{{quote|Parnes is said to have renamed some of his stars for their sexual potential, but though he undoubtedly adored the company of young men he was circumspect about mixing business with pleasure. The greatest loves of his life were two [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian dog]]s, Prince and Duke, whose cremated remains were prominently displayed in his South Kensington penthouse.}}

'''Loi Krathong'''{{efn|Alternative spellings include ''Loy Krathong'', ''Loy Kratong'', ''Loy Gratong'', etc.}} ({{lang-th|ลอยกระทง}}, {{IPA-th|lɔ̄ːj krā.tʰōŋ|pron}}) is a Siamese festival celebrated annually throughout the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] and in nearby countries with significant [[Southwestern Tai languages|southwestern Tai]] cultures ([[Laos]], [[Shan State|Shan]], [[Mon State|Mon]], [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]] and [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Xishuangbanna]]).  The name could be translated as "to float a basket," and comes from the tradition of making ''krathong'' or buoyant, decorated baskets, which are then floated on a river.

''Loi Krathong'' takes place on the evening of the full moon of the 12th month in the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar]], thus the exact date of the festival changes every year. In the Western calendar this usually falls in the month of November. In Chang Mai, the festival lasts three days, and in 2018, the dates will be 21-23 November.

In Thailand, the festival is known as "Loi Krathong" (ลอยกระทง). Outside Thailand, this festival is celebrated under different names, including India as the "[[Kartik Poornima]]" or "[[Tripurari Poornima]]", Myanmar as the "[[Tazaungdaing festival]]", Sri Lanka as "[[Poya|Il Full Moon Poya]]" and Cambodia as "[[Bon Om Touk]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bNAJiwpmEo0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Penguin Handbook of the World's Living Religions|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Penguin UK|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calenworld.com/religion/buddhist-calendar|title=Buddhist Calendar - Southeast Asian Calendars - Thai Calendar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/23/pictures-of-the-day-23-october-2016/the-tazaungdaing-festival-of-lights-celebrates-the-end-of-the-ra/|title=Pictures of the day: 23 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srilankaembassy.com.pl/en/sri-lanka/national-festivals/il-poya/|title=Il Poya|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/australia/magazine/one-hour-one-day-one-week/full-moon-festivals-8f5f4.shtml|title=Discover the full moon festival of Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.|date=1 February 2017|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201085505/http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/australia/magazine/one-hour-one-day-one-week/full-moon-festivals-8f5f4.shtml|archivedate=1 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

According to the ''[[Royal Institute Dictionary]]'' 1999, ''loi'' (ลอย) means "to float", while ''krathong'' (กระทง) has various meanings, one of which is "a small container made of leaves which can be floated on water during the ''Loi Krathong'' festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. 2542 |trans-title=Royal Institute Dictionary 1999 |language=Thai |publisher=Royal Institute of Thailand |date=2007 |accessdate=2014-06-06 |url=http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Krathong'' is traditionally a small leaf container which is made to hold a small portion of goods like a traditional Thai dish (such as "Hor Mok") or dessert. The traditional krathong used for floating at the festival are made from a slice of a banana tree trunk or a [[spider lily]] plant. Modern krathongs are more often made of [[bread]] or [[Styrofoam]]. A bread krathong will disintegrate after a few days and can be eaten by fish. Banana stalk krathong are also  biodegradable, but Styrofoam krathongs are sometimes banned, as they pollute the rivers and may take years to decompose. A krathong is decorated with elaborately-folded banana leaves, three incense sticks, and a candle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chadchaidee |first=Thanapol "Lamduan"|title=Essays on Thailand |publisher=Booksmango |date=2013 |pages=5-7 |chapter=Loy Krathong Festival |chapterurl= https://books.google.co.th/books?id=Zk4dAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small coin is sometimes included as an offering to the river spirits.

On the night of the full moon, Thais launch their krathong on a river, canal or a pond, making a wish as they do so. The festival may originate from an ancient rural ritual paying respect to the water spirits. The floats are thought to have been introduced to Chiang Mai in 1947 and have since been incorporated into local culture.&lt;ref name="BP-20181118" /&gt;

Government offices, corporations, and other organizations launch large decorated krathongs. There are competitions for the best of these large krathongs. A [[beauty contest]] is a regular feature and fireworks have become common in recent years.

Loi Krathong is often claimed to have begun in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] by a court lady named Nopphamat. However, it is now known that the Nopphamat tale comes from a poem written in the early Bangkok period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sconline.vru.ac.th/displayNews.php?id=65 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628134008/http://sconline.vru.ac.th/displayNews.php?id=65 |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]], writing in 1863, it was a [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] festival that was adapted by Thai Buddhists in Thailand to honor the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], Prince Siddhartha Gautama. The candle venerates the Buddha with light, while the krathong's floating symbolizes letting go of all one's hatred, anger, and defilements. People sometimes cut their fingernails or hair and place the clippings on the krathong as a symbol of letting go of past transgressions and negative thoughts. Many Thais use the krathong to thank the Goddess of Water, the Hindu Goddess Ganga, [[Ganga in Hinduism|Phra Mae Khongkha]] ({{lang-th|พระแม่คงคา}}).

The beauty contests that accompany the festival are known as "Nopphamat Queen Contests". According to legend, Nang Nopphamat ({{lang-th|นางนพมาศ}}; alternatively spelled as "Noppamas" or "Nopamas") was a consort of the 13th century [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai king]] [[Sri Indraditya]] (who is also known as Phra Ruang) and she had been the first to float a decorated raft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1951/JSS_038_2d_PhyaAnumanRajthon_LoiKratong.pdf Journal of the Siam Society, page 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is a new story which was invented during the first part of the 19th century. There is no evidence that a Nang Nopphamat ever existed. Instead, it is a matter of fact that a woman of this name was the leading character of a novel released at the end of the reign of [[King Rama III]], around 1850 CE. Her character was written as guidance for all women who wished to become civil servants.

[[Kelantan]] in [[Malaysia]] celebrates Loi Krathong similarly, especially in the [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] area. The ministry in charge of tourism in [[Malaysia]] recognises it as an attraction for tourists. Many people visit the celebration each year.

===Yi Peng===
[[File:Yi peng sky lantern festival San Sai Thailand.jpg|thumb|Thousands of ''khom loi'' in Mae Cho, [[Chiang Mai]]]]

Loi Krathong coincides with the [[Lanna]] (northern Thai) festival known as ''Yi Peng'' ({{lang-th|ยี่เป็ง}}). ''Yi'' means 'two' and ''peng'' means a 'full moon day'. ''Yi Peng'' refers to the full moon day in the second month according to the Lanna lunar calendar (the twelfth month of the Thai lunar calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = th:สาระน่ารู้เกี่ยวกับประเพณียี่เป็งล้านนา | trans-title = Info about Lanna's Yi Peng | language = Thai | publisher = Chiang Rai Provincial Culture Office | url = http://province.m-culture.go.th/chiangrai/yeepeng.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 2014-06-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410025014/http://province.m-culture.go.th/chiangrai/yeepeng.htm | archivedate = 2014-04-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is meant as a time to make [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] ({{lang-th|ทำบุญ}}; {{rtgs|''tham bun''}}).

Swarms of [[sky lantern]]s ({{lang-th|โคมลอย}}; {{rtgs|''khom loi''}}), literally: 'floating lanterns', are launched into the air.  Khom loi are made from a thin fabric, such as rice paper, stretched over a bamboo or wire frame, to which a candle or fuel cell is attached. When the fuel cell is lit, the resulting hot air is trapped inside the lantern and creates enough lift for the khom loi to float into the sky.

According to the ''Bangkok Post'', the association of lanterns with the November festivities is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back to the first decade of the 21st century, when introduced by local tourism authorities.&lt;ref name="BP-20181118"/&gt;

Because they are a hazard to passing aircraft and "...can cause damage to important places in the areas such as the Grand Palace [sic], temples and governmental offices,..." khom loi are increasingly subject to governmental restrictions. In Chiang Mai, authorities cancelled 78 flights in and out of [[Chiang Mai Airport]] on 3–4 November 2017. Another 79 flights were rescheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atthakor|first1=Ploenpote|title=Loy Krathong must be kept under control| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1352307/loy-krathong-must-be-kept-under-control|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite those measures, the remains of more than 100 lanterns were later found on airport premises.&lt;ref name="BP-20181118"&gt;{{cite news |title=No urban place for Loy Krathong |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1577774/no-urban-place-for-loy-krathong |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=18 November 2018 |format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangkok, the public are prohibited from using fireworks and sky lanterns entirely.

In 2018, up to 158 flights were cancelled or rescheduled at three airports, and in Bangkok 88 piers were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Up to 158 flights cancelled amid air safety fears |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1579930/up-to-158-flights-cancelled-amid-air-safety-fears?utm_source=enewsletter_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=news |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the festival, some people also decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with ''khom fai'' ({{lang-th|โคมไฟ}}), intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. ''Khom thue'' ({{lang-th|โคมถือ}}) are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, ''khom khwaen'' ({{lang-th|โคมแขวน}}) are the hanging lanterns, and ''khom pariwat'' ({{lang-th|โคมปริวรรต}}), which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. The most elaborate ''Yi Peng'' celebrations can be seen in [[Chiang Mai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/loy_krathong-lantern_festival_yee_peng.html|title=Lantern Festival of the Yee Peng Month|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228183415/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/loy_krathong-lantern_festival_yee_peng.html|archivedate=2013-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ancient capital of the former Lanna kingdom, where now both ''Loi Krathong'' and ''Yi Peng'' are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating in the sky. The tradition of ''Yi Peng'' was also adopted by certain parts of [[Laos]] during the 16th century.

==The aftermath==
In 2016, the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA) cleaned six tonnes of rubbish from the city's waterways on the day after Loi Krathong. The city governor  said that 661,935 floats were collected from waterways across Bangkok. Of these, 617,901 (93.7 percent) were made of decomposible natural materials, while 44,034 were non-biodegradable [[Styrofoam]] floats. There were 163,679 fewer krathong collected than in 2015. The city mobilized 210 workers and 45 boats to collect floats from the [[Chao Phraya River]] and canals.&lt;ref name=BP-20161116&gt;{{cite news|title=City cleans 6 tonnes of krathong waste|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1136417/city-cleans-6-tonnes-of-krathong-waste|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], 50 workers collected krathong from the moat in the town centre near the [[Thao Suranari|Thao Suranaree Monument]]. In [[Buriram]], more than 200 workers and volunteers in [[Mueang Buriram District|Mueang District]] cleared at least 20,000 krathong from the town's moat. There, Styrofoam krathong will be banned in 2017. In [[Lampang]], more than 100 students and teachers from the Institute of Physical Education helped municipal workers clean up the [[Wang River]] in [[Mueang Lampang District|Mueang District]].&lt;ref name=BP-20161116/&gt;

In 2018, after the festivities, Bangkok city workers cleared 841,327 krathongs, up from 3.6 percent in 2017, from the Chao Phraya River, local canals, and 30 public parks; 5.3 percent of them were made from styrofoam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Styrofoam krathong numbers sink |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1581314/styrofoam-krathong-numbers-sink?utm_source=enewsletter_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=news |accessdate=2018-11-24 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movieshack''' was an [[online DVD rental]] company in [[New Zealand]]. Based in [[Auckland]], it was launched on 28 June 2004 and introduced commercial online DVD rentals to New Zealand.  The company was founded (anecdotally, from a bedroom) by brothers James and Nick MacAvoy, who created the customised software systems and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DVDs by post new big thing | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=4085D026-39E2-11DA-8E1B-A5B353C55561 | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 3 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2007 story in [[New Zealand Herald|The Herald on Sunday]] estimated the New Zealand online DVD rental market at 15000 subscribers, with the implication that Movieshack was the smallest of the three major online DVD rental companies (the others being Fatso and DVD Unlimited).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DVD rental shake-up | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=183&amp;objectid=10420148 | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the company announced a merger with former competitors [[Fatso (New Zealand)|Fatso]] and [[DVD Unlimited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Media: DVD delivery market reaches limit | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10517301 | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screen Enterprises Limited was formed by merging the businesses of DVD Unlimited, Fatso and Movie Shack. According to the 2008 [[SKY Network Television]] annual report, the three firms were all struggling with the business model that has "yet to be accepted in New Zealand". [[SKY Network Television]] owns 51% of Screen Enterprises Limited and as such all subscribers are consolidated into SKY’s results.

Movieshack completed the switch-over of its services in November 2008, when it switched its members to the new service which now operates under the [[Fatso (online DVD rental service)|Fatso]] name.

'''''My Name Is Mina''''' is a 2010 children's novel by [[David Almond]]. It is a prequel to ''[[Skellig]]'' and is about Mina, a [[homeschooled]] girl who lives across the road from the house that Michael's family moves into at the beginning of ''Skellig''. The novel takes the form of a stream of consciousness journal.

==Reception==
''[[Booklist]]'', in a starred review of ''My Name Is Mina'', wrote "Almond is rather brave to have written a prequel to Skellig (1998), a book that was the essence of originality. So many things could have gone wrong. But he is too shrewd—and fine—a writer to let that happen"&lt;ref name=wccls/&gt;; and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' found it "A fascinating, if breathless ramble through the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-almond/my-name-mina/ |title=My Name Is Mina |date=24 August 2011 |website=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote "Almond portrays Mina as a girl with a great love of words and learning, and he plays joyfully with language. This might make for tricky going for some readers, but it is truly a wonderful book.";&lt;ref name=wccls/&gt; and ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates|VOYA]]'' called it "a lyrical, whimsical novel".&lt;ref name=wccls/&gt; A ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' reviewer wrote that it is "a wonderful book in its own right" and "joyous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sedgwick |first=Marcus |date=4 September 2010 |title=My Name Is Mina by David Almond |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/04/my-name-is-mina-david-almond |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nacni''' means ''female dancer'' in north Indian languages. In the east-central [[India]]n states of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the term '''nacnī''' (lit. "dancer" pronounced NUCH-nee) refers to female performers who sing and dance professionally in rural areas, accompanied by male ''[[ḍhulkī]]'' and ''[[nagarā]]'' drummers who move around the stage with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Carol M. |last=Babiracki |journal=[[Society for Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicology]] |title=Between Life History and Performance: Sundari Devi and the Art of Allusion |year=2008 |volume=52:1 |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Marcia J. |last=Citron |journal=Music and Letters |title=Women's Voices across Musical Worlds (review)  |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/music_and_letters/v086/86.3citron.html |year=2005 |volume=86 |pages=508–512 |doi=10.1093/ml/gci090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who perform as ''nacnīs'' are considered "kept women" and are usually paired in an informal "marriage" with a male manager and dancing partner, typically of a higher [[Indian caste system|caste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= |last=Feldman &amp; Gordon |year=2006 |title=The courtesan's arts: cross-cultural perspectives  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=nacn%C4%ABs#v=onepage&amp;q=nacn%C4%AB&amp;f=false |pages=118 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Carol M. |last=Babiracki |journal=[[Society for Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicology]] |title=Between Life History and Performance: Sundari Devi and the Art of Allusion |year=2008 |volume=52:1 |pages=3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this pairing, nacnīs are thought to embody the goddess [[Radha]] while the male dancing partner is a stand-in for [[Krishna]].

[[File:OTE Logo.png|frame|Over The Edge]]
'''Over the Edge''' ('''OTE''' for short) is a [[Zimbabwe]]an multi-racial Theatrical company. It is one of Zimbabwe's most prolific and successful independent theatre companies. They have won both local and international acclaim, as well as numerous awards.

They are best known for the imaginative re-inventions of Shakespeare and their original African works. They have had a long relationship with the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and have close links to [[Reps Theatre]].

==Early history==
[[File:OTE_at_the_Avondale_Summer_Arts_Festival_(1994).jpg|thumb|OTE at the Avondale Summer Arts Festival (1994)]]
Over the Edge first performed on 29 October 1994 at the [[Avondale Summer Arts Festival]] in [[Harare]]. The members had been friends for years, many having been in [[Reps Theatre#Repteens|Repteens]], and were invited to perform some street theatre. This rough and ready performance was the beginning of a long and successful relationship. The group was praised for its talent and enthusiasm but it was especially noted for its racial diversity. Although racial diversity had been standard practise in Zimbabwe Theatres and Theatrical companies since the 1960s, the majority of performers were inevitably white. Over the Edge, on the other hand, had more or less equal ratios of black, white and "coloured" members. For most of the company's existence Over the Edge had no formal artistic director, with all members contributing to the vision and growth of the group. Towards the end of their 10 year lifespan [[Wiina Msamati]].&lt;ref name="Wiina"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;was appointed artistic director for a short period. The group's final theatre piece as 'Over the Edge' was a production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' in 2004. 

The group performed numerous "re-imaginations" of [[Shakespeare]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Molière|Moliere]] and [[Joe Orten]]. These adaptations were often set in [[Zimbabwe]] (or in an imagined [[Southern Africa]]n country, similar to Zimbabwe) and had many [[satire|satirical]] references to Zimbabwe's political scene. The group also performed numerous original comic political satires, with the group's trademark extremism.

==Overseas Productions==
[[File:Over the Edge Twelfth Night.jpg|thumb|Publicity photograph of Over the Edge's performance of Twelfth Night for Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]The group won international acclaim when its productions of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''Eternal Peace Asylum'' were performed at the [[2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. The group got standing ovations, glowing reviews and packed houses. They won the "[[Spirit of The Fringe]]" award for ''Twelfth Night'' and Wiina Msamati was nominated for "Best Actor" in the [[Stage Awards for Acting Excellence]], run by the London newspaper ''[[The Stage]]''. The group went on to tour the United States in March 2001, playing at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Boston]] and many other venues. The productions of ''Twelfth Night'' and ''Eternal Peace Asylum'' were well received by the American audiences.

In October 2000, three members of the group performed at the [[Amsterdam International Improvisation Festival]]. Their improvised production of ''Long Form'' gained an instant [[standing ovation]]. Some time later, members of the group also represented Zimbabwe at the World Improv Championships in 2006, a cultural event attached to the FIFA World Cup in Germany that year. 

==''Born African''==
[[File:Born_African.jpg|thumb|Lucian (Wiina) Msamati in Born African]]
''Born African'' is, undeniably, Over the Edge's most successful production to date. Written by [https://kevinhanssen.com/ Kevin Hanssen], [[Lucian Msamati|Wiina (Lucian) Msamati]] and Craig Peter, with additional material by [http://www.adamneill.com/ Adam Neill]. It was directed by Zane E. Lucas.

The show has many characters, each actor playing multiple parts, but it centres around the lives of three people living in Zimbabwe: a white [[lawyer]], a coloured youth and a black [[servant (domestic)|servant]]. The production used minimal set and costume, with the donning of a single item of clothing being enough to change character. The three cast members all wore [[black face paint]], in order to bring the characters to the same level.

The show's main strength was its portrayal of ordinary people in Zimbabwe, a view that is rarely seen in other countries. The show also portrayed lesser well known issues, such as black on black violence, mixed-race relationships and colonial hangovers. The show's central focus, on the other hand, was what it actually meant to "Be [[African people|African]]". The show ends with the characters thinking of leaving Zimbabwe, but realising that they were "born African" and deciding to stay.

The play was first shown at the Harare International Festival of the Arts ([[HIFA]]), before it was reworked and shown at the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. It was critically acclaimed and the cast were nominated for "Best Ensemble" in The Stage Awards.

==Today==
[[File:Over The Edge 10th Anniversary.jpg|thumb|Over the Edge 10th Anniversary]] Over the Edge's last show was their 10 year anniversary in 2004, which was also a reunion of the group. Today the group's members are spread far and wide. [[Lucian Msamati]] (also known as Wiina) has been following a successful career in the UK. Craig Peter, and Zane E. Lucas went onto create a theatre development group called Theory X in Zimbabwe. Gavin Peter continues to teach, his passion, and is the Chairman of the Allied Arts Festival in Zimbabwe, a large performing arts festival for school students. [https://kevinhanssen.com/ Kevin Hanssen] lives and works as a performing artist and teacher in Southern Africa and abroad. [http://www.adamneill.com/ Adam Neill] continues with an acting career in Cape Town, South Africa. Karin Alexander lives and works in Cape Town and [[Chipo Chung]] continues to pursue a successful career as an actor and director in the UK and America.

'''''Partido da Imprensa Golpista''''' ('''''PiG''''', {{lang-en|[[Coup d'état|Pro-coup]] Press Party}}) is a term used by [[left-wing]] [[Brazil]]ian [[websurfer]]s since 2007 to characterize an alleged attitude of the Brazilian [[mass media]] towards President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during the [[Brazilian general elections, 2006|2006 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/news/view/_ed679_um_peso_e_varias_medidas|title=Um peso e várias medidas|author=Francisco Fernandes Ladeira|language=Portuguese|editor=[[Observatório da Imprensa]]|date=2012-01-31|accessdate=2012-01-31|quote=Opiniões alternativas ao status quo são, propositalmente, ignoradas.

== Definition ==
Paulo Henrique Amorim explains the expression whenever he uses it in his articles. According to him, "In no serious democracy in the world, [[Conservatism|conservative]], low-quality and even [[sensationalism|sensationalistic]] newspapers, and [[Rede Globo|one single television network]] matter as much as they do in Brazil. They have become a political party – the PiG, Pro-coup Press Party".&lt;ref&gt;Translated from: [http://www.paulohenriqueamorim.com.br/?p=25357 "Em nenhuma democracia séria do mundo, jornais conservadores, de baixa qualidade técnica e até sensacionalistas, e uma única rede de televisão têm a importância que têm no Brasil. Eles se transformaram num partido político – o PiG, Partido da Imprensa Golpista."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114145226/http://www.paulohenriqueamorim.com.br/?p=25357 |date=2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amorim said that some politicians have become part of the PiG. He said that "the political parties are no longer an instrument of the [[Coup d'état|coup]] but they have become the coup itself. Pretending [to do] objective journalism, they not only do the job of a press that omits information; but do the job of a press that lies, distorts and deceits. Former President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|FHC]] was among the first politicians who realized that the political strength he needed could be found in the PIG, and thus nowadays he enjoys the image of being a prominent world leader".&lt;ref name=UCB&gt;[http://www.opn.ucb.br/003/00301009.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=6406 UCB.

== Historical background ==
[[Paulo Henrique Amorim|Paulo Henrique]] said that the mainstream Brazilian press historically defends coup d'états whenever the Brazilian President is not elected from among members of the ruling elites. The PIG, according to Amorim, had its origin with [[Carlos Lacerda]], whom he says "helped to kill [[Getúlio Vargas]]". It continued its "struggle against democracy" throughout the governments of [[Juscelino Kubitscheck]] and [[João Goulart]], when finally "it openly defended and promoted the Brazilian military putsch of March 1964". According to him, the mass media also "hammered [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio]]'s governor [[Leonel Brizola|Brizola]] throughout his two terms in office, and now conspires against [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]]".&lt;ref name=UCB/&gt; Political scientist Wanderley Guilherme dos Santos, who predicted the overthrow of President João Goulart in 1964, said in an interview with ''[[CartaCapital]]'' in 2005 that the "mainstream media led Vargas to commit suicide based on nothing; it almost prevented Juscelino from taking office based on nothing; it led to [[Jânio Quadros|Jânio]] resignation, taking advantage of his craziness, based on nothing; it tried to prevent Goulart's inauguration based on nothing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagora.org.br/arquivo/FHC-apoiaria-Golpe-Branco/ Dias, Mauricio.

== Inconsistencies of the term creator==

In September 1998, on the eve of the dispute between [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] (Brazilian left candidate, from PT party) and [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|FHC]] (seen as the right candidate, but with center-left trend, from PSDB party), Amorim  led a crusade against Lula on [[TV Bandeirantes]]. In an ongoing battle, Amorim attacked Lula in all editions of the main news program of Bandeirantes.&lt;ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/brasil/fc14089808.htm Complaint against Lula paralyzes campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veja.abril.com.br"&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/reinaldo/geral/paulo-henrique-e-o-jornalista-mais-corajoso-do-brasil-para-atacar-a-reputacao-da-oposicao-de-qualquer-oposicao-como-sabe-lula-um-pouco-de-historia/ Paulo Henrique Amorim is the bravest journalist from Brazil to attack the reputation of the opposition]&lt;/ref&gt; Lula sued Paulo Henrique Amorim and TV Bandeirantes, who apologized to PT publicly. When the PT was in opposition, Amorim attacked Lula. However, after the PT went into government, Amorim became his staunch supporter.&lt;ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="veja.abril.com.br"/&gt;

About the resignation of the IG portal, the site has a page that informs simply discontinued the contract with the journalist:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Over time, contract costs and market conditions made it impossible to maintain it. Taking the decision , all termination conditions are met and the journalist properly indemnified . Employees of the blog "Conversa Afiada" blog, present at the headquarters of IG at the time it was dispatched the notice of termination, and the site removed from the network, were given the opportunity to take away the materials needed, but they did not. Paulo Henrique Amorim preferred to act under the force of a warrant of search and seizure to remove their belongings and copy the file from his site, what he could have done without judicial review. Discontinue collaboration is part of corporate life and the lives of journalists . Paulo Henrique has gone through companies such as Editora Abril, Jornal do Brasil, TV Globo, TV Bandeirantes, TV Cultura and TV UOL " - all supposedly part of the "party media coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.ig.com.br/editorial/210308.html The IG departure of Paulo Henrique Amorim]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, Amorim was ordered to pay compensation of R$30,000 to journalist Heraldo Pereira (Globo), having stated on his blog that Pereira was a "black with white soul," which was considered a manifestation of racism, at a session held in Justice Court of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/paulo-henrique-amorim-pagara-indenizacao-por-racismo-4052068 Paulo Henrique Amorim pay compensation for racism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2013/07/paulo-henrique-amorim-e-condenado-por-injuria-racial-contra-heraldo-pereira.html Paulo Henrique Amorim is convicted of libel against Heraldo Pereira]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the internet==
According to writer Fernando Soares Campos, "without the internet, Lula would have hardly been elected; if he had, he would not take office; if he had taken office, he would have been ousted with ease". He argues that "the PIG is strong, is [[Goliath]], but the internet is filled with [[David]]s". Campos says that the mere existence of the internet interferes with the monopoly of information by large media groups, and this interference hampers coups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=538JDB006|last=Campos|first=Fernando Soares|title=Sem a internet, Lula já teria caído|publisher=[[Observatório da Imprensa]]|issn=1519-7670|accessdate=2012-12-28|date=May 19, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527115259/http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=538JDB006|archivedate=May 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supposed members ==
According to Paulo Henrique Amorim, only three Brazilian families control the mainstream Brazilian media: the Marinhos ([[Roberto Marinho]], [[Organizações Globo]]), the Mesquitas (Julio de Mesquita, [[O Estado de S. Paulo|Grupo Estado]]) and the Frias ([[Octávio Frias]], [[Grupo Folha]]). According to Amorim, they dominate and condition news in Brazil, through their various newspapers, radio stations, news agencies and internet blogs. They have provoked what Amorim calls "a massacre" of the smaller Brazilian regional press, as a consequence of the control they exert on all of the mainstream information, in order to manipulate the Brazilian [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name=UCB/&gt;

Professor Sérgio Mattos, writing in 2005 on media control and censorship in Brazil and elsewhere, also cited the influence of these tycoons, adding, however, two other groups:

:{{quote|''The [[Organizações Globo|Marinho family]] has always been close to the political power, taking advantage of the privileged position that helped it to build and dominate the Brazilian communications industry. However, other families also maintain the concentration of media ownership in the country, such as the Civita, owners of the [[Grupo Abril|Abril Group]], the Sirotsky, of the [[RBS TV|RBS Group]], the Frias, of the Folha Group, among other regional groups in the ownership of multimedia networks.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattos|first=Sérgio|title=Mídia controlada: a história da censura no Brasil e no mundo|publisher=Paulus|year=2005|isbn=8534924074|pages=142|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Mattos's work precedes the creation of the term "PIG" and although talk about the manipulation of information by the media, is much more a warning about the dangers of state control (open or hidden) over the press, warning which was hailed as "very useful" in the book review done by the newspaper [[Folha de S. Paulo]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sergiomattos.com.br/liv_midiacontrolada.html#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922160136/http://www.sergiomattos.com.br/liv_midiacontrolada.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-22|title=Livro acende o necessário debate em torno da censura|author=Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva|publisher=Folha de S. Paulo|year=2006|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Federal Court|Supreme Court of Brazil]], [[Joaquim Barbosa]], in a speech in Costa Rica during [[World Press Freedom Day]], said that there is a lack of political and ideological diversity in the Brazilian press and identified a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] bias in that group:

:{{quote|''(...)I would point out to the weak political and ideological diversity in the press business. Brazil now has only three major national and broad sheets, all of them more or less leaned to the right in the field of ideas.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s.conjur.com.br/dl/discurso-barbosa-freedom-of-press.pdf|title=Draft Speech of Justice Joaquim Barbosa, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Brazil|format=pdf|date=2013-05-03|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Criticism ==

As one of the main drivers of the acronym "PiG", Paulo Henrique Amorim is accused by the conservative journalist [[Reinaldo Azevedo]] of promoting two eternal campaigns: one electoral, and another against the newspaper ''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]'' and its managing editor. Azevedo said that everything would be done under the auspices of the Brazilian Government, through the advertising budget of a state bank, the [[Caixa Econômica Federal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/reinaldo/geral/eles-e-eu/|title=Paulo Henrique Amorim works for PT|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|author=Reinaldo Azevedo|language=Portuguese|date=2010-05-26}} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to opponents of the term, the press denounces irregularities in public administration, like several well-known cases of corruption. J.R. Guzzo, "Veja"'s columnist, questioned the term "PiG", saying that when the press publishes complaints it is accused by the government of "destabilizing" Brazil. So, the use of the term would be an attempt to put the population against the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/220709/danos-menores-p-142.shtml|title=Gente do ramo|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|author=J.R. Guzzo|date=2009-07-22|quote=From hearing what they are saying in the government and its surroundings, for example, journalists are among the worst disasters that this country has to face at the moment, more or less at the same level occupied by the white elite of the South and other enemies of popular causes.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725111026/http://veja.abril.com.br/220709/danos-menores-p-142.shtml|archivedate=2009-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist Pedro Doria, the manifestation of an ideological polarity is intolerant and unable to explain a complex social reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.citebite.com/a2h1y2c0j5uul Ideological intolerance and the world as it is]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.citebite.com/m2f1v2k0w6hue|title=Not Corporatist|language=Portuguese|author=Pedro Doria|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergio Leo]] believes that the mainstream press is too complex to be labeled this way because it would encompass very different opinions and agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verbeat.org/blogs/sergioleo/2009/02/blogues-e-jornalismo-um-nao-pode-ser-outro-ou-nao.html|title=Blogs and journalism, one can not be another - or not|language=Portuguese|author=Sergio Leo|date=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the President of the ''Associação Nacional de Jornais – ANJ'' ("National Newspaper Association") Maria Judith Brito said the Brazilian press has assumed the role of a [[election agent|political agent]] in the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]]. Brito is an executive of the ''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]'' newspaper and was once a candidate for councilwoman for the Workers' Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osamigosdopresidentelula.blogspot.com/2010/09/dona-judith-brito-que-voce-nao-conhece.html|title=Os Amigos do Presidente Lula: A dona Judith Brito que você não conhece|editor=Osamigosdopresidentelula.blogspot.com|date=2005-11-17|accessdate=2011-03-10|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brito said that the media has taken on the role of the opposition to the Lula administration:

{{quote|''Press freedom is a greater good that should not be limited. In this general right, the counterpoint is always a question of media responsibility and, of course, the media are doing, in fact, the role of opposition in this country since the opposition is deeply weakened. And this role of opposition and investigation, no doubt, greatly bothers the government.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fndc.org.br/internas.php?p=noticias&amp;cont_key=508217|title=Entidades de imprensa e Fecomercio estudam ir à Justiça contra Plano Nacional de Direitos Humanos|language=Portuguese|author=Tatiana Farah|date=2010-03-18|accessdate=2010-03-30|work=[[O Globo]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706161052/http://www.fndc.org.br/internas.php?p=noticias&amp;cont_key=508217|archivedate=2011-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About Brito's speech, journalist Luciano Martins Costa of  [[Observatório da Imprensa]] said that:
{{quote|''The biggest risk to the press comes from the press itself, when the newspapers come together to act as a [[political party]].(...) When the press abandons its axis, we all lose. Especially the press.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=582JDB012|title=Imprensa versus governos|author=Luciano Martins Costa|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-30|language=Portuguese|editor=[[Observatório da Imprensa]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602092237/http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=582JDB012|archivedate=2010-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Playboy Club''' was initially a chain of nightclubs and resorts owned and operated by [[Playboy Enterprises]]. The first club opened at 116 E. Walton Street in downtown [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], on February 29, 1960. Each club generally featured a Living Room, a Playmate Bar, a Dining Room, and a Club Room.  Members and their guests were served food and drinks by [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]], some of whom were featured in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. The clubs offered name entertainers and comedians in the Club Rooms, and local musicians and the occasional [[close-up magic]]ian in the Living Rooms. Starting with the London and Jamaica club locations, the Playboy Club became international in scope. In 1991, the club chain became defunct. On October 6, 2006 a new club was opened in Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destination360.com/north-america/us/nevada/las-vegas/the-playboy-club|title=Playboy Club Las Vegas|author=|date=|work=destination360.com|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 new clubs were opened as well in Macao&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/video/playboy-bunnies-land-in-macau/F034A29A-4EF0-4C59-9C17-B8378F47EE52.html |title=Playboy Bunnies Land in Macau| work=The Wall Street Journal | date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cancun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/playboy-club-cancun-brings-exciting-nightlife-and-gaming-to-one-of-the-worlds-most-popular-travel-destinations-111204469.html|title=Playboy Club Cancun Brings Exciting Nightlife and Gaming to One of the World's Most Popular Travel Destinations|date=2 December 2010|location=Chicago|agency=PR Newswire|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time the Las Vegas club closed on June 4, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/destinations/lasvegas/story/2012-06-04/Playboy-Club-at-Las-Vegas-Palms-casino-closes/55383590/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Macao club closed in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.placesandfoods.com/2013/10/playboy-club-sands-macao-has-closed-down.html|title=Playboy Club Sands Macao has closed down|author=Wilson Ng|date=2 October 2013|work=Places and Foods|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hkclubbing.com/directory/nightclubs/playboy-club-sands-macao.htmland&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cancun club closed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g3newswire.com/mexico-mexican-ministry-closes-six-casinos-including-playboy-cancun/|title=Mexican Ministry closes six casinos including Playboy Cancun|author=Phil|date=30 April 2014|work=G3 Newswire|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150807-d4053746-r186946065-Playboy_Casino_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html|title=Cancun Casino - Review of Playboy Casino Cancun, Cancun, Mexico - TripAdvisor|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 the [[Commerce Casino]] in [[Los Angeles]] opened a Playboy themed lounge consisting of gaming tables and Playboy Bunny cocktail waitresses.&lt;ref name=comm-cas-playboy&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucky Rabbit Party Pit Playboy Poker Room|url=http://www.commercecasino.com/lucky-rabbit-party-pit/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724070530/http://www.commercecasino.com/lucky-rabbit-party-pit/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 July 2015|website=The Commerce Casino|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Brazilian playmates at Campus Party Brasil 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Playboy Bunny]] waitresses, Brazil, 2009]]
The first Playboy Club opened in Chicago in 1960, and later there were clubs in [[Miami]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Atlanta]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Detroit]], [[San Francisco]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Baltimore]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Denver]], [[Dallas]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[St. Petersburg, FL]], [[Lansing]], [[San Diego]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Lake Geneva, WI]], [[Omaha]] and [[St. Louis]]. There was also a Playboy Club in Canada, in Montreal. Playboy Clubs operated in Japan, under a franchise arrangement, in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Sapporo. There were Playboy Club resorts in Ocho Rios, [[Jamaica]], [[New Jersey|Great Gorge at McAfee, New Jersey]], and at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, as well as Club-Hotels such as the Playboy Plaza in Miami Beach, Florida and Playboy Towers in Chicago. The last American location before Playboy Club Las Vegas opened was [[Lansing, Michigan]], located in the Hilton Hotel, which closed in 1988. International Clubs existed until the 1991 closing of the [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] Club located in the Silahis International Hotel. In 2010 International Clubs were opened in Macao and Cancun but in time the Macao Club closed in 2013 and the Cancun Club closed in 2014. Manila was the only Club ever to be featured in ''[[Architectural Digest]]''. During the last three months of 1961, more than 132,000 people visited the Chicago club, making it the busiest night club in the world. Playboy Club membership became a status symbol. Only 21% of all key holders ever went to a club. At $25.00 per year per membership, Playboy grossed $25 million for every 1,000,000 members.

The Rabbit-headed metal Playboy key (supplanted by a metal key-card in 1966)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playboymuseum.com/img_8534/&lt;/ref&gt; was required for admission to a club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explayboybunnies.com/history/anniversary/anniversary1.html |title=Playboy Club 40th Anniversary Celebration |publisher=Explayboybunnies.com |date=1960-02-29 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were presented to the Door Bunny. Through most of the years, a strict dress code was enforced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1965, [[Hugh Hefner]] sent [[Victor Lownes]] to [[London]] to open Playboy's British casinos, following legalization of [[gambling in the United Kingdom]]. In 1981, the casino at 45 Park Lane (now a luxury hotel, 45 Park Lane) was the most profitable casino in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Luxury Hotels Mayfair, 45 Park Lane, Hotels Hyde Park London |url=http://www.45parklane.com |publisher=45parklane.com |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British casinos contributed $32 million to the corporation.  Later, Playboy also operated British casinos in Manchester and Portsmouth.  In 1981, Playboy opened a hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  However, the New Jersey gaming regulators denied Playboy a permanent gaming licence, and Playboy sold its interest in the unit to Elsinore Corporation, its partner in the venture, in 1984, at which time the hotel and casino were renamed The Atlantis.

The Playboy Club in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], had a ski slope and was one of the first to install a [[chair lift]]. Its "[[Playmate Bar]]" featured the Russ Long Trio and its showroom was managed by Carlo Cicirello.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The 32-piece house orchestra was headed by Chicago pianist, [[Sam Distefano]], who was also Playboy's Vice-President in charge of booking all the entertainment for all Playboy Clubs and Hotels worldwide for 25 years.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Lighter Side Trio entertained at all of the Playboy Clubs from 1972 to 1975, led by Joe DiPietro, with Douglas Brett and Charles Raimond.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

On October 6, 2006, Playboy opened a new Playboy Club in Las Vegas, Nevada. The new club at The Palms, with its prominent neon bunny head, had casinos, bars, and a restroom with pictures of [[Playboy Playmate|Playmates]] on the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15093574/ns/business-us_business/|title=Playboy Club Opens in Las Vegas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club closed in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playboy Club at Las Vegas' Palms Casino Closes|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/destinations/lasvegas/story/2012-06-04/Playboy-Club-at-Las-Vegas-Palms-casino-closes/55383590/1|accessdate=June 4, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian women were invited to Sydney to audition for the iconic Playboy Bunny role and for positions as singers and dancers at the Playboy Club. A minimum of five women were chosen to travel to Macao for a six-month contract as a Playboy Bunny.

'''Radiotelevisione svizzera di lingua italiana''' ('''RSI''', abbreviated as '''RTSI''' until 28 February 2009) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[public broadcasting]] organisation, part of [[SRG SSR]]. RSI handles production and broadcasting of [[radio]] and [[television]] programs in [[Italian language|Italian]] for [[Switzerland]] ([[Italian-speaking Switzerland]]). RSI's administrative headquarters are located in Via Canevascini in [[Lugano]]-[[Besso, Ticino|Besso]].

==History==
"Radio svizzera di lingua italiana" was established in 1925 as "Radio Monte Ceneri", originally named after [[Monte Ceneri transmitter|the mountain]] where the [[transmitter]] was placed. After several years of experimental broadcast, in 1933 the "Società svizzera di Radiodiffusione" (Swiss Radio Broadcasting Corporation) began regular transmissions in [[Ticino]] and [[Grigioni]]. The intentions of its founders were to promote cohesion in the [[Switzerland|confederation]] while promoting the value of the [[Swiss Italian]] culture. In the 1930s and 1940s, when most of Switzerland's neighboring states were under [[fascism]], Radio Monte Ceneri was the only [[Italian language]] radio free of [[censorship]], becoming the only reliable voice for the Italian population and a prominent outlet for Italian intellectuals: during these years it hosted people like [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Delio Tessa]].

The first television broadcasts started on 18 November [[1958 in television|1958]], at first produced in studios in [[Zurich]] and transmitted with [[Italian language|Italian]] subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caffe.ch/mycaffe/dettaglio.php?id=41449 Il caffè, Swiss weekly]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1961 in television|1961]], with the foundation of [[Televisione svizzera di lingua italiana]] (TSI), the studios were relocated in [[Paradiso, Switzerland|Paradiso]], near [[Lugano]]. This was eight years after the experimental debut of television in [[Zurich]] and [[Genève]]. The channel began broadcasting in colour in [[1968 in television|1968]].

During the 1970s, when [[Television in Italy|Italian television]] was still under the [[RAI]] monopoly, Swiss television in Italian was the only alternative to the public network for Italians living in [[Lombardy]] and [[Piedmont]]: the signal reached the city of [[Milan]]. Some important personalities of Italian television, such as Corrado, Mina, Enzo Tortora and the founder of the first commercial television in [[Italy]], [[Telebiella]], Peppo Sacchi worked with TSI.

RSI launched two new thematic radio stations, a cultural one, [[Rete Due]], in 1985 and another more youth-oriented, [[Rete Tre]], in 1989.

In [[1997 in television|1997]] a second channel was created, called [[TSI 2]]. The first TSI channel thus was renamed [[TSI 1]].

In December 2005, RSI began digital broadcasts using the [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] system on the Saint Gottard autoroute. On 26 July [[2006 in television|2006]] at 12:45, [[SRG SSR idée suisse]] interrupted [[analog transmission|analog]] broadcasting in [[Ticino]] making it the first all-digital [[canton of Switzerland]] This affected the Italians in northern Italy, as they were deprived of all the TSI channels, with the sole exception of those close to the frontier.

In [[dance]], '''release technique''' is any of various [[dance technique]]s that focus on [[breathing]], muscle relaxation, anatomical considerations, and the use of gravity and momentum to facilitate efficient movement. It can be found in [[modern dance|modern]] and [[postmodern dance]], and has been influenced by the work of modern dance pioneers, therapeutic movement techniques such as [[Feldenkrais]] and [[Alexander Technique]], and [[yoga]] and [[martial arts]].

==History==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries dancers began to question the rigidity and formality of classical ballet. [[Isadora Duncan]] in particular articulated the need for dance which she described as being connected to the earth, sensuality and the natural body. In pursuit of this goal, pioneers such as Margeret D'Oubler, [[Martha Graham]], [[Rudolf von Laban]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began to invent new dance techniques that involved radically different movement.

Elements of release technique began to emerge as these pioneers, and protégés such as [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Jose Limon]], [[Irmgard Bartenieff]], [[Erick Hawkins]] and [[Anna Halprin]], contributed further ideas and inventions. For example, D'Oubler envisioned dance based on scientific analysis of human anatomy and movement; Humphrey's technique focused on allowing gravity and momentum to affect the body; Hawkins advanced the idea that physiologically efficient movement is inherently beautiful. Some elements were the result of exploring other movement disciplines. For example, Hawkins invited proponents of [[Ideokinesis]] to teach his dance company, and others were influenced by [[F.M. Alexander]]'s concepts.

The phrase "release technique" emerged in the 1970s.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Modern dancer Joan Skinner created "[[Skinner releasing technique]]", which employed elements of Alexander Technique, and [[Mary Fulkerson]] created "Anatomical Release Techique" based on the work of [[Mabel Elsworth Todd]], [[Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen]] and others.

==Contemporary technique==

Today elements of release technique can be found in [[contact improvisation]], [[Tai Chi]], [[yoga]], and somatic practices such as the Feldenkrais method. In dance, it is usually taught as an integrated part of contemporary dance classes and, less frequently, in classes that focus on release technique.

'''''Son Altesse Sérénissime''''' (His [[Serene Highness]]) is a series of [[Spy fiction|espionage novel]]s created by French author [[Gérard de Villiers]], featuring Austrian prince '''Malko Linge''' as the lead character. Since 2006, the novels have been published as comic books, though aimed chiefly at adults given their contents of violence and sex. Villiers's books have been bestsellers, making him a very wealthy man.

The novel's title is a play on initials: ''Son Altesse Sérénissime'' (SAS) is the French version of "His Serene Highness" (HSH); and the British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) is the principal [[special forces]] unit of the [[British Army]].

In 2014, Vintage Books posthumously published English versions  of ''The Madmen of Benghazi'' and ''Chaos in Kabul,'' translated and adapted by William Rodarmor. The publisher released three other books in English through 2016.

== Plot ==
In order to finance the repairs of his castle in Liezen, Austria, main character Malko Linge works as a freelance agent for the [[CIA]] of the United States. The CIA sends him on dangerous missions all over the world. He has an excellent memory and speaks several languages fluently. He is very well-groomed, preferring to wear tailor-made alpaca suits. He carries an ultra-small gun.

== Recurring characters ==
The following supporting characters regularly appear in the S.A.S. espionage novels:
* ''Samantha Adler'' : A German brunette and arms dealer.
* ''Mandy Brown'' aka ''Mandy la salope'' (Mandy the bitch) : An American maneater.
* ''Frank Capistrano'' : Italian American who is a special advisor to the [[White House]].
* ''Elko Krisantem'' : Turkish servant of Malko Linge. He used to be a killer.
* ''Alexandra Vogel'' : Malko's fiancee.
* ''Milton Brabeck'' : A CIA agent who protects Malko on several missions. Partner of Chris Jones.

'''SBS Broadcasting Group''' (normally referred to as '''SBS''', which originally stood for '''S'''candinavian '''B'''roadcasting '''S'''ystems) was a multinational media group, operating commercial television, premium pay channels, radio stations and related print businesses in Northern, Western and Central and Eastern Europe.

SBS operated in Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, and Romania.

==History==
By July 1994, the time of the CC/ABC-Disney merger, [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC]] owned 23% of SBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FACT SHEET:  THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%2FFIRST+AND+FINAL+ADD+--+DISNEY,+CAPITAL+CITIES%2FABC+AGREE+TO+MERGE%2F-a017368916|work=Press Release|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBS was controlled by funds advised by two private equity firms, [[Permira]] and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]]. Telegraaf Media Groep N.V. (TMG) of the Netherlands was also a shareholder in SBS, with a 20% equity interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/SBS+Broadcasting+Acquires+Leading+Music+TV+Channel+in+Romania.-a0150857495|title=SBS Broadcasting Acquires Leading Music TV Channel in Romania.|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|via=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|date=September 4, 2006|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, SBS was bought by the equity firms [[Permira]] and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sbs-broadcasting-to-be-acquired-by-permira-and-kkr-in-transaction-valuing-the-company-at-approximately-euro-21-billion-25-billion-54963297.html|title=SBS Broadcasting to be Acquired By Permira and KKR in Transaction Valuing the Company at Approximately euro 2.1 Billion ($2.5 Billion)|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|date=August 22, 2005|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also bought the German broadcaster [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media]] in early 2007, and on 27 June 2007 it was announced that ProSiebenSat.1 Media acquired the [[SBS Broadcasting]] group for 3.3 billion euros from the joint owners. ProSiebenSat.1 Media became the second largest broadcaster of Europe with 48 TV stations. On 14 December 2012 [[Discovery Communications]] bought the Nordic portion of SBS for $1.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Szalai|first=Georg|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-completes-sbs-nordic-acquisition-435237|title=Discovery Communications Completes $1.7 Billion SBS Nordic Acquisition|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBS was founded by [[Harry E. Sloan]] who bought a stake in the Danish station Kanal 2 (Copenhagen) and Norwegian [[TVNorge]]. In 1991, Sloan bought the Swedish [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Nordic Channel]], which was soon renamed Kanal 5 and became the third largest commercial broadcaster in the country. The company was originally known as "TV1", but was renamed "Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems" in 1991. After expanding into Benelux and Eastern Europe, the name was changed again, this time to SBS.
In the end of 2011 ProSiebenSat.1 Group has sold its Bulgarian radio stations as well as the music channel the Voice TV to A.E. Best Success Services Bulgaria EOOD. The transaction was closed on November 10, 2011.

== Television ==
Television operations started in 1989 in [[Scandinavia]]. In March 2005 SBS acquired [[C More Entertainment]], a Nordic [[pay tv]] provider operating under the [[Canal+]] brand, which is now controlled by Sweden's largest broadcaster [[TV4 Group|TV4]]. C More provides premium sports and movie channels in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] under the ''Canal+'' and the now defunct ''C More'' brand.

'''''Saving Brinton''''' is a 2017 American documentary film about the efforts of Iowa resident Mike Zahs to preserve a large quantity of reels of film from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that he found in the basement of a farm house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nollen|first1=Diana|title='Saving Brinton' documentary captures intersection of 2 men from separate centuries|url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/life/entertainment/saving-brinton-documentary-captures-intersection-of-2-men-from-separate-centuries-20170902|accessdate=April 17, 2018|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Cedar Rapids ''Gazette'']]|date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at [[AFI Docs]] on June 17, 2017 and internationally at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]]. It has been hailed as “a cinephile’s delight” of [[The Hollywood Reporter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/saving-brinton-1060688|title='Saving Brinton': Film Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was directed by [[Tommy Haines]] and [[Andrew Sherburne]].

==Synopsis==
In a farmhouse basement on the Iowa countryside, eccentric collector Mike Zahs makes a remarkable discovery: the showreels of the man who brought moving pictures to America’s Heartland. Among the treasures: rare footage of President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]], the first moving images from Burma, a lost relic from magical effects godfather [[Georges Méliès|Georges Méliés]]. These are the films that introduced movies to the world. And they didn’t end up in [[Iowa]] by accident. The old nitrate reels are just some of the artifacts that belonged to [[William Franklin Brinton]]. From thousands of trinkets, handwritten journals, receipts, posters and catalogs emerges the story of an inventive farmboy who became America’s greatest barnstorming movieman. As Mike uncovers this hidden legacy, he begins a journey to restore the Brinton name that takes us to [[Library of Congress|The Library of Congress]], Paris and back for a big screen extravaganza in the same small-town movie theater where Frank first turned on a projector over a century ago. By uniting community through a pride in their living history, Mike embodies a welcome antidote to the breakneck pace of our [[Throw-away society|disposable society]]. "Saving Brinton" is a portrait of this unlikely Midwestern folk hero, at once a meditation on living simply and a celebration of dreaming big.

==Reception==
&lt;!--===Critical response===--&gt;
Wesley Morris, critic-at-large for [[The New York Times]], calls the film "celebratory. poignant" and that "the average documentary would gawk. This one reclassifies" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/movies/saving-brinton-review.html|title=Review: In ‘Saving Brinton,’ an Inveterate Accumulator Finds Treasure|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Hutchinson of [[The Guardian]] depicts the film as an "absorbing, heartwarming tale" and that "there’s genuine warmth to the documentary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/22/how-did-some-of-cinemas-greatest-films-end-up-in-an-iowa-shed|title='How did some of cinema's greatest films end up in an Iowa shed?|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Turan of the [[Los Angeles Times]] praises the film as "endearing, affectionate" and that "zealots are plentiful in the film history world, but ones as amiable as Zahs are as rare as the movies he doggedly preserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-saving-brinton-review-20180608-story.html|title=Film exhibition advocates are the stars in affectionate documentary 'Saving Brinton'|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[The Washington Post]]'s Ann Hornaday describes the film as "an audience favorite at [[AFI Docs]]" and as "a revelatory homage not just to film as a constantly evolving art form, but also as a fulcrum for community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-washington-post/20180525/283338997922248|title=Also Opening|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''''' (also known as '''''Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens''''')&lt;!--The inclusion of this is based on the result of an RfC. Please see the talk page for more.--&gt; is a 2015 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film produced, co-written and directed by [[J. J. Abrams]]. It is the first installment of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]] and the seventh installment of the main ''[[Star Wars]]'' film franchise, following ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). The film stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Daisy Ridley]], [[John Boyega]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Max von Sydow]],&lt;!-- Order is based on the poster's billing block.--&gt; and was produced by [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]] and Abrams's production company [[Bad Robot Productions]]. ''The Force Awakens'' is the first ''Star Wars'' film to not involve franchise creator [[George Lucas]]. Set 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', the film follows [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], and [[Poe Dameron]]'s search for [[Luke Skywalker]] and their fight alongside the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], led by [[Princess Leia|General Leia Organa]] and veterans of the [[Rebel Alliance]], against [[Kylo Ren]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], a successor to the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].

''The Force Awakens'' was announced after [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator [[Bryan Burk]], and Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]]. Abrams and [[Lawrence Kasdan]], co-writer of the [[original trilogy]] films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''Return of the Jedi'' (1983), rewrote an initial script by [[Michael Arndt]]. [[John Williams]], the composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the film's score. Lucas served as [[creative consultant]] during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]] and [[Iceland]], with [[principal photography]] also taking place in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and concluded in November 2014. It is the first [[Live action|live-action]] ''Star Wars'' film since ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005).

''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with extensive marketing campaigns. It premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on December 14, 2015 before its [[wide release]] in the United States on December 18. The film received positive reviews, with praise for its acting, screenplay, direction, musical score, visual effects, and action sequences, although it received some criticism for being derivative of the original trilogy. The film [[List of box office records set by Star Wars: The Force Awakens|broke various box office records]] and became, unadjusted for inflation, the [[Star Wars#Reception|highest-grossing installment in the franchise]], the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|highest-grossing film in North America]], the [[2015 in film|highest-grossing film of 2015]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of all time]], with a worldwide gross of over $2&amp;nbsp;billion and a net profit of over $780&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="'The Force Awakens' Is Now The Top-Grossing 'Star Wars' Film Ever"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Force Awakens' Is Now The Top-Grossing 'Star Wars' Film Ever|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2015/12/28/the-force-awakens-is-now-the-top-grossing-star-wars-film-ever|work=Forbes|first=Brittany|last=Hodak|date=December 28, 2015|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-star-wars-force-852274|title=Box Office: 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' Tops 'Avatar' to Become No. 1 Film of All Time in North America|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and four [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]] nominations, where it won the award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
Thirty years after the [[Galactic Civil War]], the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] has risen from the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and seeks to eliminate the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by [[General Leia Organa]], opposes them while Leia searches for her brother, [[Luke Skywalker]].

On the planet [[Jakku]], Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] receives a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka. [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] commanded by [[Kylo Ren]] destroy the village and capture Poe, while Kylo kills San Tekka. Poe's droid [[BB-8]] escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], near a junkyard settlement. Kylo tortures Poe using [[the Force]] and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, unwilling to kill for the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen [[TIE fighter]]; Poe names FN-2187 "[[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]]". As they turn back toward Jakku to retrieve BB-8, they are shot down by a First Order [[Star Destroyer]] and crash-land on the planet. Finn survives and assumes Poe died in the crash. He encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', which they steal from a junkyard.

The ''Falcon'' is captured by a larger ship piloted by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], looking to reclaim their former vessel. They are attacked by gangs seeking to settle debts with Han, and flee in the ''Falcon''. The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses star energy, [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] allows [[General Hux]] to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Kylo says Han means nothing to him.

The ''Falcon'' crew determines BB-8's map is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]] but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet [[Takodana]] and meets with cantina owner [[Maz Kanata]], who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn to a secluded vault and finds the [[lightsaber]] that once belonged to Luke and his father, [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]]. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.

Starkiller Base fires and destroys the Republic capital star system and a portion of its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance [[X-wing fighter]]s led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku. Leia arrives at Takodana with [[C-3PO]] and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a [[Jedi mind trick]] on a nearby guard.

At the Resistance base on [[D'Qar]], BB-8 finds [[R2-D2]], who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the ''Falcon'', Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy Starkiller Base.

The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the ''Falcon''. On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To. She finds Luke and presents him with the lightsaber.

* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]]:
:A rogue and a smuggler, formerly a key player in the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Ford said, "Han does not aspire to the position of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan]], nor do I aspire to be some New Age [[Alec Guinness]]. His development is consistent with the character, and there are emotional elements which have occasioned his growth… There's a lot of the rogue still left in Solo. Some things don't change…"&lt;ref name="CastFord1"/&gt;
* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]]:
: The last [[Jedi]], who has gone into hiding. Regarding Luke, Han, and Leia, Abrams stated: "They'd be as old and as mythic as the tale of [[King Arthur]]. They would be characters who [the new characters] may have heard of, but maybe not. They'd be characters who they might believe existed, or just sounded like a fairy tale…"&lt;ref name="CastHamill1"/&gt; Hamill was initially skeptical of Luke's reveal at the end of the film and called his limited screentime "a great surprise".&lt;ref name=CastHamill2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freer|first1=Ian|title=Star Wars: Mark Hamill on Being Luke Skywalker, 'Episode VIII'|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/star-wars-mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-london-episode-viii-1201815149/|accessdate=July 15, 2016|work=Variety|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams added that the film's ending was intended to be "this great long drumroll up to seeing this guy".&lt;ref name=CastHamill2/&gt;
* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[General Leia Organa]]:
:The former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], now General of the Resistance, and Luke's twin sister.&lt;ref name="CastFisher1"/&gt; After the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', she is described as "a little more battle weary, a little more broken hearted".&lt;ref name="CastFisher2"/&gt; Fisher described Leia as "Solitary. Under a lot of pressure. Committed as ever to her cause, but I would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed." Abrams said: "The stakes are pretty high in the story for her, so there's not much goofing around where Leia's concerned."&lt;ref name="CastFisher3"/&gt;
* [[Adam Driver]] as [[Kylo Ren]]:
:A dark warrior who is strong with the Force, the leader of the Knights of Ren, and a high-ranking member of the First Order. He is the son of Han and Leia and the grandson of the deceased [[Darth Vader]].&lt;ref name="CastDriver1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastDriver2"/&gt; Driver said the team tried "not to think of him as being bad, or evil, or a villain. Something that was more three-dimensional. He's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing what he thinks is right."&lt;ref name="CastDriver3"/&gt;
* [[Daisy Ridley]] as [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]:
:A highly Force-sensitive scavenger who was abandoned as a child on the desert planet Jakku and awaits her family's return.&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt; Ridley said: "She's completely self-sufficient and does everything for herself, until she meets [Finn] and an adventure begins."&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt; Cailey Fleming plays a young Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Favre|first=Cassandra|url=http://www.picayuneitem.com/2015/12/dreams-of-stardom-picayune-native-appears-in-blockbuster-film|title=Dreams of Stardom: Picayune native appears in blockbuster film|work=Picayune Item|date=December 23, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Boyega]] as [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]]:
:A reformed First Order [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]].&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastBoyega1"/&gt; Boyega said that he learned he obtained the part "over a nice breakfast in [[Mayfair]]" during which Abrams told him, "John, you're the new star of ''Star Wars''."&lt;ref name="CastBoyega2"/&gt; Boyega said: "When we find Finn, he's in incredible danger. And the way he reacts to this danger changes his life, and launches him into the ''Star Wars'' universe in a very unique way."&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt; He said in another interview: "He's been taught about [Luke], he knows about his history. For him it's like joining the army and then learning about one of the great enemies of your country."&lt;ref name="CastHamill1"/&gt;
* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Poe Dameron]]:
:A Resistance [[X-wing fighter]] pilot.&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastNyongo"/&gt; Isaac said: "He's the best freaking pilot in the galaxy… He's been sent on a mission by a certain princess, and he ends up coming up across [Finn], and their fates are forever intertwined."&lt;ref name="EW10Things"/&gt;
* [[Lupita Nyong'o]] as [[Maz Kanata]]:
:A wise and perceptive figure operating a somewhat shady cantina on the peaceful forest planet Takodana.&lt;ref name="CastNyongo"/&gt; Abrams said Kanata has "lived over a thousand years. She's had this watering hole … and it's like another bar that you'd find in a corner of the ''Star Wars'' universe."&lt;ref name="CastNyongo2"/&gt; According to Abrams, the character was based on his former high school English teacher, Rose Gilbert, who lectured at the [[Palisades Charter High School]] from 1961 to 2013. Abrams said the team "really wanted the story to feel authentic, despite being a wild fantasy. I mentioned Rose in an early story meeting as a sort of timeless, wise figure that I'd actually known in my life."&lt;ref name="CastNyongo3"/&gt;
* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Supreme Leader Snoke]]:
:The political leader of the First Order. He is Kylo Ren's master and is very powerful in the dark side of the Force.&lt;ref name="CastSerkis1"/&gt; Serkis described Snoke as "quite an enigmatic character, and strangely vulnerable at the same time as being quite powerful… He is large. He appears tall. And also just the facial design—you couldn't have gotten there with prosthetics… Without giving too much away at this point, he has a very distinctive, idiosyncratic bone and facial structure."&lt;ref name="CastSerkis2"/&gt;
* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as [[General Hux]]:
:The commander of the First Order's Starkiller Base.&lt;ref name="GleesonAndPegg"/&gt; Gleeson described him as "pretty ruthless. A strong disciplinarian would be a mild way of putting it… He's kind of opposite Kylo Ren. They have their own relationship, which is individual and unusual. One of them is strong in different ways than the other. They're both vying for power."&lt;ref name="CastGleeson1"/&gt;
* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]]:
:A humanoid [[droid (Star Wars)|protocol droid]] in Organa's service. Daniels said the actors were allowed to experiment with their performances, and that Abrams "made a field, a playpen where you were allowed to take your time and suggest things".&lt;ref name="CastDaniels1"/&gt;
* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]]:
:A [[Wookiee]] and Solo's longtime companion. Mayhew's double [[Joonas Suotamo]] portrays the character in several action scenes, and [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] performed stunts, as the 71-year-old Mayhew suffered from knee problems.&lt;ref name="CastMayhew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminoapps.com/page/star-wars/6271242/ian-whyte-aka-crusher-roodown-bollie-chewie|title=Ian Whyte aka Crusher Roodown/Bollie/Chewie|date=June 25, 2016|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from ''The Force Awakens'', such as Finn and Rey's last names and backgrounds.

In November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with [[CBS News]] reporter [[Charlie Rose]] in which he said Disney had not been "keen" to involve him and conceded: "If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/george-lucas-star-wars-7-new-trilogy-consulting-split|title=Star Wars: George Lucas and Disney Disagreed on New Films|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=November 20, 2015|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "They wanted to do a retro movie.

In February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.&lt;ref name="Parismatch"/&gt; The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that [[principal photography]] would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in [[Buckinghamshire]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26639322|title=Episode VII filming to begin in UK in May|publisher=BBC News|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in [[Iceland]] prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/22/star-wars-7-iceland-rumours-spark-rumours-of-return-to-hoth-4673234|title=Star Wars 7 Iceland rumours spark speculation of return to Hoth|last=Westbrook|first=Caroline|work=Metro|date=March 22, 2014|accessdate = March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,&lt;ref name="Appelo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-chief-reveals-star-wars-693950|title=Disney Chief Reveals 'Star Wars: VII' Casting Almost Complete, Says Film Is Already Shooting (Video)|last=Appelo|first=Tim|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; filming in secret in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|emirate of Abu Dhabi]] by a second-unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.twofour54.com/en/media-centre/press-releases/2014/2014-05-21-Abu-Dhabi-is-First-Location-for-Star-Wars-Episode-VII?offset=12&amp;month=&amp;year=&amp;unit=|title=Abu Dhabi is First Location for Star Wars: Episode VII|work=twofour54|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/disney-confirms-that-star-wars-episode-7-is-filming-in-abu-dhabi-desert|title=Disney confirms that Star Wars: Episode 7 is filming in Abu Dhabi desert|last=Newbould|first=Chris|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|location=Abu Dhabi|date=April 23, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65mm IMAX format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinefex.com/blog/film-renaissance|title=Film Renaissance|last=Fordham|first=Joe|work=[[Cinefex]] Blog|date=April 20, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on [[IMAX]] cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-7-imax-2|title='Star Wars Episode VII' Is Filming in IMAX|last=Lussier|first=Germain|publisher=slashfilm.com|date=July 8, 2014|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
[[File:1221olympicblvd.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, where Abrams supervised post-production of the film]]
Cinematographer Daniel Mindel said ''The Force Awakens'' would use real locations and [[Miniature effect|scale models]] over [[computer-generated imagery]] to make it aesthetically similar to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2013/08/22/star-wars-episode-vii-film|title=Star Wars Episode VII to Use Film, Be More Like Original Trilogy|first=Chris|last=Taylor|work=[[Mashable]]|date=August 22, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rian Johnson, director of ''The Last Jedi'', reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: "I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick."&lt;ref name="THRJohnson"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rian-johnson-says-next-star-726036|title = Rian Johnson Says Next 'Star Wars' Will Have Less CGI, More Practical Effects|last = McMillan|first = Graeme|work = The Hollywood Reporter|date = August 18, 2014|accessdate = August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams's intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref name="effects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2015/04/16/star-wars-celebration-why-star-wars-7-uses-practical-effects|title=Star Wars Celebration: Why Star Wars 7 Uses Practical Effects|work=IGN|last=Otero|first=Jose|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by [[Disney Research]],&lt;ref name="Fortune BB-8"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hackett|first1=Robert|title=Disney just developed the most adorable walking robot|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/26/disney-walking-robot/|accessdate=July 23, 2015|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by special effects artist [[Neal Scanlan]] and operated live on set with the actors.&lt;ref name="BB-8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/12/14/mark-hamill-says-star-wars-the-force-awakens-bb-8-is-a-prop-not-cgi|title=Mark Hamill Says Star Wars: The Force Awakens' BB-8 Is a Prop, Not CGI|first=Anthony|last=Couto|work=IGN|date=December 13, 2014|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/bb-8-effects|title=Watch Awesome 'The Force Awakens' Droid BB-8 Appear Live on Stage|first=Russ|last=Fischer|publisher=slashfilm|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate = April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's ''Star Wars'' films as a catalyst for the expansion.

There aren't many of them, but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way." He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/john-williams-star-wars-the-force-awakens|title=John Williams Says His New Star Wars Score Will Include the Original Themes|last=Handy|first=Bruce|work=Vanity Fair|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams said the recording process was "very luxurious", with 12 sessions scattered over a five-month period between June and November. The score was recorded by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]], a freelance orchestra, with sessions continuing on and off over that five-month period. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music, although nearly an hour of that was discarded, modified, or rerecorded as Abrams reedited the film. Williams's theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus. [[Gustavo Dudamel]] conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams's behest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grieving|first1=Tim|title='Star Wars' surprise: Gustavo Dudamel conducted parts of 'The Force Awakens' score|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-star-wars-music-conductor-gustavo-dudamel-20151214-story.html|accessdate=December 15, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.&lt;ref name="AFM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DougAdamsMusic/status/654073331235340288|title=They've been on and off….|publisher=Doug Adams Music [[Twitter]] account}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Walt Disney Records Announces Star Wars: The Force Awakens Original Motion Picture Soundtrack From Oscar-winning Composer John Williams|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-announces-star-wars-the-force-awakens-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-from-oscar-winning-composer-john-williams-300138106.html|accessdate=September 4, 2015|publisher=[[Walt Disney Records]]|via=PR Newswire|date=September 4, 2015|location=Burbank, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams's score is more than two hours long.&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;

[[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-force-awakens-cantina-844762 |title='Star Wars': J.J.

The film is the first live-action&lt;!-- i.e. not including ''The Clone Wars'' (CGI), distributed by WB --&gt; ''Star Wars'' film not to be released theatrically by [[20th Century Fox]]; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's [[Fox Fanfare|logo, or its signature fanfare]] composed by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molloy|first1=Tim|title='Star Wars VII' Will Have Major Change to Opening: No Fox Fanfare|url=http://www.thewrap.com/next-star-wars-will-major-change-opening-fox-fanfare|accessdate=January 3, 2016|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].

It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action." Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', saying "the promos… are notable for what they tease, not what they give away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/comic-con-star-wars-force-awakens-batman-superman|title=Comic-Con: Why the Force was with Star Wars and not Batman v Superman|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's also a faster burn, meaning it likely won't stay in theaters as long as ''Avatar'' did."&lt;ref name="McClintock"/&gt; Dergarabedian said, "As in all box-office trajectories, the higher the altitude, the tougher it becomes to rack up sales at the kind of breakneck pace as in the beginning of the run."&lt;ref name="McClintock"/&gt;

Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline.com argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, ''The Force Awakens'' did well overseas.&lt;ref name="Tartaglione"/&gt; ''Avatar'' did well internationally because of its novelty, the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters, and because of its extended time in overseas theaters.&lt;ref name="Eggertse"/&gt; While ''The Force Awakens'' had appeal with its special effects, analysts feel that it lacked the novelty factor; they also cite that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Films do not play in overseas theaters as long as they did back when ''Avatar'' was released.&lt;ref name="Eggertse"/&gt; Dergarabedian stated, "No matter what, [''The Force Awakens''] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones."&lt;ref name="McClintock"/&gt; Moreover, Mike Fleming of Deadline.com argued that the movie was the "most valuable movie" of the year, with "the net profit to Disney an astounding $923M, and the Cash on Cash Return twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.31".&lt;ref name="Deadline profit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/star-wars-the-force-awakens-movie-profit-2015-lucasfilm-disney-1201726142/|title=No. 1 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' – 2015 Most Valuable Movie Blockbuster Tournament|first=Mike|last=Fleming|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with journalist [[Charlie Rose]] that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a "divorce" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of ''The Force Awakens''.

The film is considered a throwback of the [[jiangshi fiction]]-genre films popularized in the 1980s by ''[[Mr. Vampire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesasia.com/global/vampire-controller-dvd-hong-kong-version/1001806621-0-0-0-en/info.html|title=YESASIA: Vampire Controller (DVD) (Hong Kong Version)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
According to legends, corpse handlers Mo ([[Wayne Lai]]) and Ma Siu-ling ([[Kingdom Yuen]]) were in charge of looking after a group of [[jiang shi|vampires]]. Among the vampires, Wong Ching (Jude Poyer) and Jenny (Emana Leung) were a pair of lovers whom were poisoned to death. The imperial government is still tracking the killer. Since the killer was worried that his crimes will be brought to light, he hires black magician Ha Lai-cheuk ([[Yuen Wah]]) to destroy the corpses. However, this case involves a secret letter written by the emperor, thus, Ha orders his followers, Mo and Ma to find the whereabouts of the letter.

Mo and Ma were never fond of one another. In order to get his job done, Ha secretly alienates them from one another and causes internal conflict between the two.

At this time, Mo's disciple, John Lui ([[Gallen Lo]]), and Ma's goddaughter, Tin-kei ([[Kathy Chow]]) meet and fall in love at first sight. On the way, John meets Japanese spy Kindaiichi ([[Joey Meng]]), whom is fascinating and charming. Kimdaiichihas a unique behavior but she also has a soft spot for John and dispute arises among the love triangle of John, Tin-kei and Kimdaiichi.

On the other hand, Mo and Ma vows to battle to the death despite the dissuasion of others. As a result, destruction was caused to both sides, being defeated and they both die. Seeing her godmother die, Tin-kei gives up the love of her life and leaves feeling dejected. John also leaves the group of vampires behind and leaves. Ha succeeds in his treacherous plan and gets the opportunity to execute his plan to destroy the corpses of Wong Ching and Jenny. Unexpected to Ha, Mo and Ma turn his scheme against him and disguised themselves as vampires for Ha to appear in his wizard form, and they begin a battle.

John, however, was mistakenly struck by Ha with [[Gu (poison)|gu]], but was rescued by Tin-kei. While recovering, John accidentally makes love with Kimdaiichi, whom have been attentively caring for him during the recovery period. At this time, Jenny also gives birth to a ghost child, which according to the Hunyun Scripture, will bring disaster to the world.

'''Viennese waltz''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Walzer}}) is a genre of [[ballroom dance]]. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the [[waltz]], including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz.

What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the [[Closed position|closed hold]] or "waltz" position.  The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar  (the international standard of 30 [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Measures per minute|measures per minute]]), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words {{lang|de|Walzer}}&lt;!--German capitalizes all nouns--&gt; (German), {{lang|da|vals}} (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and {{lang|fr|valse}} (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz.

The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating ''change steps'' to switch between the direction of rotation. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese waltz, couples do not pass but turn continuously left and right while traveling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.

As the waltz evolved, some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically "Viennese waltz" to distinguish them from the slower waltzes. In the modern ballroom dance, two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized:  [[Ballroom glossary#International Style|International Style]] and [[Ballroom glossary#American Style|American Style]].

Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and [[partner dance]] that is part of the [[Glossary of partner dance terms#International Standard|International Standard]] division of contemporary ballroom dance.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Viennese waltz, so called to distinguish it from the [[waltz]] and the [[French waltz]], is the oldest of the current ballroom dances. It emerged in the second half of the 18th century from the [[German dance]] and the [[Ländler]] in [[Austria]] and was both popular and subject to criticism. At that time, the waltz, as described in a magazine from 1799, was performed by dancers who held on to their long gowns to prevent them from dragging or being stepped on. The dancers would lift their dresses and hold them high like cloaks, and this would bring both their bodies under one cover. This action also required the dancers' bodies to be very close together, and this closeness attracted moral disparagement. In 1797, Wolf published a pamphlet against the dance entitled "Proof that Waltzing is the Main Source of Weakness of the Body and Mind of our Generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsinternational.org/waltz.htm|title=A Brief Outline Regarding the Origin of the Waltz in Relation to Piano Music|author=|date=|website=www.amsinternational.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even when faced with all this negativity, it became very popular in Vienna. Large dance halls like the Zum Sperl in 1807 and the Apollo in 1808 were opened to provide space for thousands of dancers. The dance reached and spread to England sometime before 1812. It was introduced as the German waltz and became a huge hit. It gained ground through the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the beginning of the 19th century and by the famous compositions by [[Josef Lanner]], [[Johann Strauss I]] and his son, [[Johann Strauss II]].

[[File:Waltz1816 72.jpg|thumb|250px|Early waltz steps, 1816&lt;br /&gt;from Thomas Wilson ''Treatise on Waltzing'']]

Initially, the waltz was significantly different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions make it clear that the couples danced with arm positions similar to that of the precursor dances, the [[Ländler]] and the [[Allemande]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson P.J.S. 1960. ''Social dances of the 19th century in England''. p44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Curt. 1937. ''World History of the Dance''. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Quirey, Belinda 1976. ''May I have the pleasure? The story of popular dancing''. p. 66; "The Century of Waltz".&lt;/ref&gt; The hold was at times semi-closed and at times side by side. Arms were intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. Another significant difference from the present technique was that the feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.

To understand why Quirey says "The advent of the {{sic|hide=y|reason=quoted material|Waltz}} in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners that has happened in our history"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; we need to realize that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances – communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a preset pattern (often chosen by a [[master of ceremony]]. Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the [[country dance]] and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). [[Lord Byron]] wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem "The Waltz", in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple "like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson P.J.S. 1960. ''Social dances of the 19th century in England''. p63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique and styles ==
The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either in a clockwise (natural) or anti-clockwise (reverse) direction interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions and are not normally danced at the annual balls in Vienna. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese waltz, couples do not pass, but turn continuously left and right while travelling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.

The competitive style of Viennese waltz has a reduced number of steps: [[Closed and Open Changes|change steps]], passing changes, hesitations, hovers, the contra check, and [[natural and reverse turns]].

=== International-style Viennese waltz ===
[[Ballroom glossary#International Style|International-style]] Viennese waltz is danced in [[closed position]]. The syllabus is limited to [[natural and reverse turns]], [[closed and open changes]], [[fleckerl]]s, contra check, [[Whisk (ballroom dance)|left whisk]], and [[Canter time|canter-time]] [[pivot turn]]s (canter pivots).

In [[World Dance Council]] competition, canter pivots are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |title=Competition Rules |access-date=2015-10-26 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150910165950/http://www.dancewdc.org/downloads/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20June%202015.pdf |work=DanceWDC.org |publisher=[[World Dance Council]] |archive-date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American-style Viennese waltz ===
[[Ballroom glossary#American Style|American-style]] Viennese waltz has much more freedom, both in dance positions and syllabus.

'''World Contact Day''' was first declared in March 1953 by an organization called the ''International Flying Saucer Bureau'' (IFSB), as a day on which all IFSB members would attempt to send a telepathic message into space.

The IFSB voted to hold such a day in 1953, theorising that if both [[telepathy]] and alien life were real, a large number of people focussing on an identical piece of text may be able to transmit the message through space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Flying Saucer Reader | author=David, Jay | year=1967 | pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFSB members focused on the following message during 1953:
{{quote|Calling occupants of interplanetary craft!  Calling occupants of interplanetary craft that have been observing our planet EARTH.  We of IFSB wish to make contact with you.  We are your friends, and would like you to make an appearance here on EARTH.  Your presence before us will be welcomed with the utmost friendship.  We will do all in our power to promote mutual understanding between your people and the people of EARTH.  Please come in peace and help us in our EARTHLY problems.  Give us some sign that you have received our message.  Be responsible for creating a miracle here on our planet to wake up the ignorant ones to reality.  Let us hear from you.  We are your friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Flying Saucers and the Three Men | author=Bender, Albert K. | year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The message is referenced in the song "[[Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft]]", recorded in 1976 by [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]] and later covered by [[The Carpenters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.klaatu.org/trackfacts/track_facts_12.html | work = The Official Klaatu Homepage | format = quote used by permission | title = Klaatu Track Facts | accessdate = 2007-04-18 | first = John | last = Woloschuk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the event's 60th anniversary in 2013, World Contact Day was extended to a whole week.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131227171506/http://worldcontactday.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
