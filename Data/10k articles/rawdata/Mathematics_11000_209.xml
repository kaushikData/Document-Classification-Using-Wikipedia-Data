In mathematics, the term '''''adjoint''''' applies in several situations. Several of these share a similar formalism: if ''A'' is adjoint to ''B'', then there is typically some formula of the type
:(''Ax'', ''y'') = (''x'', ''By'').

Specifically, '''adjoint''' or '''adjunction''' may mean:
*[[Transpose of a linear map|Adjoint of a linear map]], also called its transpose
*[[Hermitian adjoint]] (adjoint of a linear operator) in functional analysis
*[[Adjoint endomorphism]] of a Lie algebra
*[[Adjoint representation of a Lie group]]
*[[Adjoint functors]] in category theory
*[[Adjunction (category theory)]]
*[[Adjunction (field theory)]]
*[[Adjunction formula (algebraic geometry)]]
*[[Adjunction space]] in topology
*[[Conjugate transpose]] of a matrix in linear algebra
*[[Adjugate matrix]], related to its inverse
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*The upper and lower adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] in order theory
*For the adjoint of a differential operator with general polynomial coefficients see [[differential operator#Operator methods|differential operator]] 
*[[Kleisli adjunction]]
*[[Monoidal adjunction]]
*[[Quillen adjunction]]
*[[Axiom of adjunction]] in set theory

[[File:Affine space R3.png|thumb|While the lower (green) plane &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is a vector subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, this is not true for the upper (blue) plane &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;: For any two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in P_2&lt;/math&gt; we find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \notin P_2&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is an example of an affine space. The difference &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; of two of its elements lies in &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and constitutes a displacement vector.]]
[[File:Gilbert tessellation.svg|thumb|right|Line segments on a two-[[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensional]] affine space.]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''affine space''' is a geometric [[Structure (mathematics)|structure]] that generalizes some of the properties of [[Euclidean space]]s in such a way that these are independent of the concepts of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]] and ratio of lengths for parallel [[line segment]]s.

In an affine space, there is no distinguished point that serves as an origin. Hence, no vector has a fixed origin and no vector can be uniquely associated to a point. In an affine space, there are instead ''[[displacement vector]]s'', also called ''[[translation (geometry)|translation]]'' vectors or simply ''translations'', between two points of the space.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''translation'' is generally preferred to ''displacement vector'', which may be confusing, as [[displacement (mathematics)|displacements]] include also [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it makes sense to subtract two points of the space, giving a translation vector, but it does not make sense to add two points of the space. Likewise, it makes sense to add a displacement vector to a point of an affine space, resulting in a new point translated from the starting point by that vector.

Any [[vector space]] may be considered as an affine space, and this amounts to forgetting the special role played by the [[zero vector]]. In this case, the elements of the vector space may be viewed either as ''points'' of the affine space or as ''displacement vectors'' or ''translations''. When considered as a point, the zero vector is called the ''origin''. Adding a fixed vector to the elements of a [[linear subspace]] of a [[vector space]] produces an ''affine subspace''. One commonly says that this affine subspace has been obtained by translating (away from the origin) the linear subspace by the translation vector. In finite dimensions, such an ''affine subspace'' is the solution set of an [[System of linear equations#Homogeneous systems|inhomogeneous]] linear system. The displacement vectors for that affine space are the solutions of the corresponding ''homogeneous'' linear system, which is a linear subspace. Linear subspaces, in contrast, always contain the origin of the vector space.

The ''dimension'' of an affine space is defined as the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension of the vector space]] of its translations. An affine space of dimension one is an '''affine line'''. An affine space of dimension 2 is an [[affine plane]]. An affine subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}} in an affine space or a vector space of dimension ''n'' is an [[affine hyperplane]].

==Informal description==
The following [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] may be easier to understand than the usual formal definition: an affine space is what is left of a [[vector space]] after you've forgotten which point is the origin (or, in the words of the French mathematician [[Marcel Berger]], "An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding [[translation (geometry)|translations]] to the linear maps"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Imagine that Alice knows that a certain point is the actual origin, but Bob believes that another point — call it {{math|'''p'''}} — is the origin. Two vectors, {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, are to be added. Bob draws an arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''a'''}} and another arrow from point {{math|'''p'''}} to point {{math|'''b'''}}, and completes the parallelogram to find what Bob thinks is {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}}, but Alice knows that he has actually computed
: {{math|size=120%|'''p''' + ('''a''' − '''p''') + ('''b''' − '''p''')}}.

Similarly, [[Alice and Bob]] may evaluate any [[linear combination]] of {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, or of any finite set of vectors, and will generally get different answers. However, if the sum of the coefficients in a linear combination is 1, then Alice and Bob will arrive at the same answer.

If Alice travels to
: {{math|size=120%|λ'''a''' + (1 − λ)'''b'''}}

then Bob can similarly travel to
: {{math|size=120%|1='''p''' + λ('''a''' − '''p''') + (1 − λ)('''b''' − '''p''') = λ'''a''' + (1 − λ)'''b'''}}.

Under this condition, for all coefficients {{math|1=λ + (1 − λ) = 1}}, Alice and Bob describe the same point with the same linear combination, despite using different origins.

While only Alice knows the "linear structure", both Alice and Bob know the "affine structure"—i.e. the values of [[affine combination]]s, defined as linear combinations in which the sum of the coefficients is 1. A set with an affine structure is an affine space.

==Definition==
An ''affine space''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Berger, Marcel|chapter=Affine spaces|year=1984|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXRppKJwpaAC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Problems in Geometry|isbn=9780387909714}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a set {{math|''A''}} together with a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and a transitive and free [[group action|action]] of the [[additive group]] of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt; on the set {{math|''A''}}. The elements of the affine space {{math|''A''}} are called ''points'', and the elements of the associated vector space &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''vectors'', ''translations'', or sometimes ''[[free vector]]s''. Explicitly, the definition above means that the action is a mapping, generally denoted as an addition,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A \times \overrightarrow{A} &amp;\to A \\
 (a,v)\; &amp;\mapsto a + v,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

that has the following properties.&lt;ref name="Berger1987"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets | Berger | 1987 | p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Snapper|first1=Ernst|last2=Troyer|first2=Robert J. |title = Metric Affine Geometry| year=1989|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Tarrida, Agusti R.|chapter=Affine spaces|year=2011|pages=1–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZvxUBzraGAC&amp;pg=PA1|title=Affine Maps, Euclidean Motions and Quadrics|isbn=9780857297105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Right identity:
#: &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A,\; a+0 = a&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|0}} is the zero vector in &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt;
# Associativity:
#: &lt;math&gt;\forall v,w \in \overrightarrow{A}, \forall a \in A,\; (a + v) + w = a + (v + w)&lt;/math&gt; (here the last {{math|+}} is the addition in &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt;)
# Free and transitive action:
#: For every &lt;math&gt;a \in A,&lt;/math&gt; the mapping &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow A \to A \colon v \mapsto a+v&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]].

The first two properties are simply defining properties of a (right) group action. The third property characterizes free and transitive actions, the onto character coming from transitivity, and then the injective character follows from the action being free. There is a fourth property that follows from 1, 2, 3 above:
#&lt;li value="4"&gt;Existence of one-to-one [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s&lt;/li&gt;
#:For all &lt;math&gt;v \in \overrightarrow A,&lt;/math&gt; the mapping &lt;math&gt;A \to A \colon a \mapsto a + v&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection.

Property 3 is often used in the following equivalent form.
#&lt;li value="5"&gt;Subtraction:&lt;/li&gt;
#:For every {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|A}}, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;v\in\overrightarrow A,&lt;/math&gt; denoted {{math|''b'' – ''a''}}, such that &lt;math&gt;b=a+v.&lt;/math&gt;
Another way to express the definition is that an affine space is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the action of the additive group of a vector space. Homogeneous spaces are by definition endowed with a transitive group action, and for a principal homogeneous space such a transitive action is by definition free.

===Subtraction and Weyl's axioms===
The properties of the group action allows for the definition of subtraction for any given ordered pair {{math|(''b'', ''a'')}} of points in {{mvar|A}}, producing a vector of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}.&lt;/math&gt; This vector, denoted &lt;math&gt;b - a,&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{ab}&lt;/math&gt;) is by definition the unique vector in &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;a + (b - a) = b.&lt;/math&gt;

Existence follows from the transitivity of the action, and uniqueness follows because the action is free.

This subtraction has the two following properties, called [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]'s axioms:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets | Nomizu | Sasaki | 1994 | p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A,\; \forall v\in \overrightarrow{A},&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique point &lt;math&gt;b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b - a = v.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c \in A,\; (c - b)+ (b - a)  = c - a.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the second Weyl's axiom is commonly called the ''parallelogram rule''.

Affine spaces can be equivalently defined as a point set {{math|''A''}}, together with a vector space &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A},&lt;/math&gt; and a subtraction satisfying Weyl's axioms. In this case, the addition of a vector to a point is defined from the first Weyl's axioms.

== Affine subspaces and parallelism==
An ''affine subspace'' (also called, in some contexts, a ''linear variety'', a [[flat (geometry)|flat]], or, over the [[real number]]s, a ''linear manifold'')  {{math|''B''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}} is a subset of {{math|''A''}} such that, given a point &lt;math&gt;a \in B,&lt;/math&gt; the set of vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{B} = \{b - a \mid b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}.&lt;/math&gt; This property, which does not depend on the choice of {{math|''a''}}, implies that {{math|''B''}} is an affine space, which has &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{B}&lt;/math&gt; as associated vector space.

The affine subspaces of {{math|''A''}} are the subsets of {{math|''A''}} of the form
:&lt;math&gt;a + V = \{a + w: w \in V\},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a''}} is a point of {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''V''}} a linear subspace of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The linear subspace associated with an affine subspace is often called its ''{{visible anchor|direction}}'', and two subspaces that share the same direction are said to be ''parallel''.

This implies the following generalization of  [[Playfair's axiom]]: Given a direction {{math|''V''}}, for any point {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''A''}} there is one and only one affine subspace of direction {{math|''V''}}, which passes through {{math|''a''}}, namely the subspace {{math|''a'' + ''V''}}.

Every translation &lt;math&gt;A \to A: a \mapsto a + v&lt;/math&gt; maps any affine subspace to a parallel subspace.

The term ''parallel'' is also used for two affine subspaces such that the direction of one is included in the direction of the other.

==Affine map==

Given two affine spaces {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} whose associated vector spaces are &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{B},&lt;/math&gt; an ''affine map'' or ''affine homomorphism'' from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}} is a map
: &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;

such that
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overrightarrow{f}: \overrightarrow{A} &amp;\to \overrightarrow{B}\\
                                   b - a &amp;\mapsto f(b) - f(a)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is a well defined linear map. By &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; being well defined is meant that {{math|1=''b'' – ''a'' = ''d'' – ''c''}} implies  {{math|1=''f''(''b'') – ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''d'') – ''f''(''c'')}}.

This implies that, for a point &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \overrightarrow{A},&lt;/math&gt; one has
: &lt;math&gt;f(a + v) = f(a) + \overrightarrow{f}(v). &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, since for any given {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''v''}} for a unique {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''f''}} is completely defined by its value on a single point and the associated linear map &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{f}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Vector spaces as affine spaces==
Every vector space {{math|''V''}} may be considered as an affine space over itself. This means that every element of {{math|''V''}} may be considered either as a point or as a vector. This affine set is sometimes denoted {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} for emphasizing the double role of the elements of {{math|''V''}}. When considered as a point, the [[zero vector]] is commonly denoted {{math|''o''}} (or {{math|''O''}}, when upper-case letters are used for points) and called the ''origin''.

If {{math|''A''}} is another affine space over the same vector space (that is &lt;math&gt;V = \overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt;) the choice of any point {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} defines a unique affine isomorphism, which is the identity of {{math|''V''}} and maps {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''o''}}. In other words, the choice of an origin {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}} allows us to identify {{math|''A''}} and {{math|(''V'', ''V'')}} [[up to]] a [[canonical isomorphism]]. The counterpart of this property is that the affine space {{math|''A''}} may be identified with the vector space {{math|''V''}} in which "the place of the origin has been forgotten".

==Relation to Euclidean spaces==
===Definition of Euclidean spaces===
[[Euclidean spaces]] (including the one-dimensional line, two-dimensional plane, and three-dimensional space commonly studied in elementary geometry, as well as higher-dimensional analogues) are affine spaces.

Indeed, in most modern definitions, a Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space, such that the associated vector space is a real [[inner product space]] of finite dimension, that is a vector space over the reals with a [[positive-definite quadratic form]] {{math|''q''(''x'')}}. The inner product of two vectors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is the value of the [[symmetric bilinear form]]
:&lt;math&gt;x.y =\frac 12 (q(x+y)-q(x)-q(y)).&lt;/math&gt;
The usual [[Euclidean distance]] between two points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B)=\sqrt{q(B-A)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In older definition of Euclidean spaces through [[synthetic geometry]], vectors are defined as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of points under [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]] (the pairs {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}} and {{math|(''C'', ''D'')}} are ''equipollent'' if the points {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''D'', ''C''}} (in this order) form a [[parallelogram]]). It is straightforward to verify that the vectors form a vector space, the square of the [[Euclidean distance]] is a quadratic form on the space of vectors, and the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent.

===Affine properties===
In [[Euclidean geometry]], the common phrase "'''affine property'''" refers to a property that can be proved in affine spaces, that is, it can be proved without using the quadratic form and its associated inner product. In other words, an affine property is a property that does not involve lengths and angles. Typical examples are [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]], and the definition of a [[tangent]]. A non-example is the definition of a [[normal (geometry)|normal]].

Equivalently, an affine property is a property that is invariant under [[affine transformation]]s of the Euclidean space.

==Affine combinations and barycenter==

Let us consider, in an affine space, {{math|''n''}} points {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and  {{math|''n''}} elements &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; of the ground field. For clarity, we use &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{ab}&lt;/math&gt; to denote the vector {{math|''b'' – ''a''}}.

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 0, &lt;/math&gt; for any two points {{math|''o''}} and {{math|''o' ''}} one has
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \overrightarrow{oa_1} + \cdots + \lambda_n \overrightarrow{oa_n} = \lambda_1 \overrightarrow{o'a_1} + \cdots + \lambda_n \overrightarrow{o'a_n} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus this sum is independent of the choice of the origin, and the resulting vector is denoted
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 a_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n a_n .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, when &lt;math&gt;n = 2, \lambda_1 = 1, \lambda_2 = -1,&lt;/math&gt; one retrieves the definition of the subtraction of points.

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1, &lt;/math&gt; let us denote by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; the unique point such that
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \overrightarrow{oa_1} + \cdots + \lambda_n \overrightarrow{oa_n} = \overrightarrow{og} ,&lt;/math&gt;

for some choice of an origin &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;.

One can show that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is independent from the choice of the origin &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1, &lt;/math&gt;

one writes
: &lt;math&gt;g = \lambda_1 a_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n a_n. &lt;/math&gt;

The point &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[centroid|barycenter]]''' of the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; for the weights &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i.&lt;/math&gt; One says also that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is an '''[[affine combination]]''' of the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* When children find the answers to sums such as 4 + 3 or 4 &amp;minus; 2 by counting right or left on a [[number line]], they are treating the number line as a one-dimensional affine space.
* Any [[coset]] of a subspace {{mvar|V}} of a vector space is an affine space over that subspace.
* If {{mvar|T}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''b'''}} lies in its [[column space]], the set of solutions of the equation {{math|1=''T'' '''x''' = '''b'''}} is an affine space over the subspace of solutions of {{math|1=''T'' '''x''' = 0}}.
* The solutions of an inhomogeneous linear differential equation form an affine space over the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous linear equation.
* Generalizing all of the above, if {{math|''T'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a linear mapping and {{math|'''y'''}} lies in its image, the set of solutions {{math|'''x''' ∈ ''V''}} to the equation {{math|1=''T'' '''x''' = '''y'''}} is a coset of the kernel of {{mvar|T }}, and is therefore an affine space over {{math|Ker ''T'' }}.
* The space of (linear) complementary subspaces of a vector subspace ''V'' in a vector space ''W'' is an affine space, over Hom(''W''/''V'',''V''). That is, if &lt;math&gt;0 \to V \to W \to X \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces, then the space of all [[split exact sequence|splittings]] of the exact sequence naturally carries the structure of an affine space over Hom(''X'',''V'').

== Affine span and bases==
For any subset {{math|''X''}} of an affine space {{math|''A''}}, there is a smallest affine subspace that contains it, called the '''affine span''' of {{math|''X''}}. It is the intersection of all affine subspaces containing {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the intersection of the directions of the affine subspaces that contain {{math|''X''}}.

The affine span of {{math|''X''}} is the set of all (finite) affine combinations of points of {{math|''X''}}, and its direction is the [[linear span]] of the {{math|''x'' − ''y''}} for {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''X''}}. If one chooses a particular point {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the direction of the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is also the linear span of the {{math|''x'' – ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0}}&lt;/sub&gt; for {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}.

One says also that the affine span of {{math|''X''}} is '''generated''' by {{math|''X''}} and that {{math|''X''}} is a '''generating set''' of its affine span.

A set {{math|''X''}} of points of an affine space is said '''affinely independent''' or, simply, '''independent''', if the affine span of any [[strict subset]] of {{math|''X''}} is a strict subset of the affine span of {{math|''X''}}. An '''{{visible anchor|affine basis}}''', or '''barycentric frame''' (see {{slink||Barycentric coordinates}}, below) of an affine space is a generating set that is also independent (that is a minimal generating set).

Recall the ''dimension'' of an affine space is the dimension of its associated vector space. The bases of an affine space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}} are the independent subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements, or, equivalently, the generating subsets of {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. Equivalently, {{math|{''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}} is an affine basis of an affine space if and only if {{math|{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}} is a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space.

== Coordinates==
There are two strongly related kinds of [[coordinate system]]s that may be defined on affine spaces.

=== Barycentric coordinates ===
Let {{math|''A''}} be an affine space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} of dimension {{math|''n''}}, and &lt;math&gt;\{x_0, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be an affine basis of {{math|''A''}}. The properties of an affine basis imply that for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''A''}} there is a unique {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_n)&lt;/math&gt; of elements of {{math|''k''}} such that
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and
: &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda_0 x_0 + \cdots + \lambda_n x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''barycentric coordinates''' of {{math|''x''}} over the affine basis &lt;math&gt;\{x_0, \ldots, x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt; If the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are viewed as bodies that have weights  (or masses) &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i,&lt;/math&gt; the point {{math|''x''}} is thus the [[Centroid|barycenter]] of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and this explains the origin of the term ''barycentric coordinates''.

The barycentric coordinates define an affine isomorphism between the affine space {{math|''A''}} and the affine subspace of {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 + \cdots + \lambda_n = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For affine spaces of infinite dimension, the same definition applies, using only finite sums. This means that for each point, only a finite number of coordinates are non-zero.

=== Affine coordinates ===
An '''affine frame''' of an affine space consists of a point, called the ''origin'', and a [[linear basis]] of the associated vector space. More precisely, for an affine space {{math|''A''}} with associated vector space &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A},&lt;/math&gt; the origin {{math|''o''}} belongs to {{math|''A''}}, and the linear basis is a basis {{math|(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A}&lt;/math&gt; (for simplicity of the notation, we consider only the case of finite dimension, the general case is similar).

For each point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''A''}}, there is a unique sequence &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; of elements of the ground field such that
: &lt;math&gt;p = o + \lambda_1 v_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n v_n,&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{op} = \lambda_1 v_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n v_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''affine coordinates''' of {{math|''p''}} over the frame  {{math|(''o'', ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

'''Example:''' In [[Euclidean geometry]], [[Cartesian coordinates]] are affine coordinates relative to an '''orthonormal frame''', that is an affine frame {{math|(''o'', ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that {{math|(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is an [[orthonormal basis]].

===Relationship between barycentric and affine coordinates===
Barycentric coordinates and affine coordinates are strongly related, and may be considered as equivalent.

In fact, given a barycentric frame
: &lt;math&gt;(x_0, \ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

one deduces immediately the affine frame
: &lt;math&gt;(x_0, \overrightarrow{x_0 x_1}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{x_0 x_n}) = \left(x_0, x_1 - x_0, \ldots, x_n - x_0\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and, if
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

are the barycentric coordinates of a point over the barycentric frame, then the affine coordinates of the same point over the affine frame are
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if
: &lt;math&gt;\left(o, v_1, \ldots, v_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is an affine frame, then
: &lt;math&gt;\left(o, o + v_1, \ldots, o + v_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a barycentric frame. If
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

are the affine coordinates of a point over the affine frame, then its barycentric coordinates over the barycentric frame are
: &lt;math&gt;\left(1 - \lambda_1 - \cdots - \lambda_n, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, barycentric and affine coordinates are almost equivalent. In most applications, affine coordinates are preferred, as involving less coordinates that are independent. However, in the situations where the important points of the studied problem are affinity independent, barycentric coordinates may lead to simpler computation, as in the following example.

====Example of the triangle====
The vertices of a non-flat [[triangle]] form an affine basis of the [[Euclidean plane]]. The barycentric coordinates allows easy characterization of the elements of the triangle that do not involve angles or distance:

The vertices are the points of barycentric coordinates {{math|(1, 0, 0)}},  {{math|(0, 1, 0)}} and  {{math|(0, 0, 1)}}. The lines supporting the edges are the points that have a zero coordinate. The edges themselves are the points that have a zero coordinate and two nonnegative coordinates. The interior of the triangle are the points whose all coordinates are positive. The [[median (geometry)|medians]] are the points that have two equal coordinates, and the [[centroid]] is the point of coordinates {{math|({{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|1|3}})}}.

==Properties of affine homomorphisms==

===Matrix representation===
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}

===Image and fibers===
Let
:&lt;math&gt;f \colon E \to F&lt;/math&gt;

be an affine homomorphism, with
:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow {f} \colon \overrightarrow{E} \to \overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;

as associated linear map.

The '''image''' of {{math|''f''}} is the affine subspace {{math|''f''(E)}} of  {{mvar|F}}, which has &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{f} \left(\overrightarrow{E}\right)&lt;/math&gt; as associated vector space. As an affine space does not have a [[zero element]], an affine homomorphism does not have a [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. However, for any point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''f''(''E'')}}, the [[inverse image]] {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} of {{math|''x''}} is an affine subspace of {{math|''E''}}, of direction &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{f}^{-1} \left(\overrightarrow{F}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This affine subspace is called the '''fiber''' of {{math|''x''}}.

===Projection===
{{see also|Projection (mathematics)}}

An important example is the projection parallel to some direction onto an affine subspace. The importance of this example lies in the fact that [[Euclidean space]]s are affine spaces, and that this kind of projections is fundamental in [[Euclidean geometry]].

More precisely, given an affine space {{math|''E''}} with associated vector space &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{E}&lt;/math&gt;, let {{math|''F''}} be an affine subspace of direction &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|''D''}} be a [[complementary subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{E}&lt;/math&gt; (this means that every vector of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{E}&lt;/math&gt; may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of an element of &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt; and an element of {{math|''D''}}). For every point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''E''}}, its '''projection''' to {{math|''F''}} parallel to {{math|''D''}} is the unique point {{math|''p''(''x'')}} in {{math|''F''}} such that
: &lt;math&gt;p(x) - x \in D.&lt;/math&gt;

This is an affine homomorphism whose associated linear map &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}(x - y) = p(x) - p(y),&lt;/math&gt;
for {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|E}}.

The image of this projection is  {{math|''F''}}, and its fibers are the subspaces of direction  {{math|''D''}}.

=== Quotient space ===
Although kernels are not defined for affine spaces, quotient spaces are defined. This results from the fact that "belonging to the same fiber of an affine homomorphism" is an equivalence relation.

Let  {{math|''E''}} be an affine space, and  {{math|''D''}} be a [[linear subspace]] of the associated vector space &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{E}&lt;/math&gt;. The '''quotient'''  {{math|''E''/''D''}} of  {{math|''E''}} by  {{math|''D''}} is the [[quotient by an equivalence relation|quotient]] of  {{math|''E''}} by the [[equivalence relation]]
: &lt;math&gt;x-y \in D. &lt;/math&gt;

This quotient is an affine space, which has &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{E}/D&lt;/math&gt; as associated vector space.

For every affine homomorphism &lt;math&gt;E \to F&lt;/math&gt;, the image is isomorphic to the quotient of  {{math|''E''}} by the kernel of the associated linear map. This is the [[first isomorphism theorem]] for affine spaces.

==Affine transformation==
{{main|Affine transformation|Affine group}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}

==Axioms==
Affine space is usually studied as [[analytic geometry]] using coordinates, or equivalently vector spaces. It can also be studied as [[synthetic geometry]] by writing down axioms, though this approach is much less common. There are several different systems of axioms for affine space.

{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1969|p=192}} axiomatizes affine geometry (over the reals) as [[ordered geometry]] together with an affine form of [[Desargues's theorem]] and an axiom stating that in a plane there is at most one line through a given point not meeting a given line.

Affine planes satisfy the following axioms {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 2}}:
(in which two lines are called parallel if they are equal or
disjoint):
* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
* Given a point  and line  there is a unique line which contains the point and is parallel to the line
* There exist three non-collinear points.
As well as affine planes over fields (or [[division ring]]s), there are also many [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s satisfying these axioms. {{harv|Cameron|1991|loc=chapter 3}} gives axioms for higher-dimensional affine spaces.

== Relation to projective spaces ==

[[File:Affine space, projective space, vector space.svg|thumb|An affine space is a subspace of a projective space, which is in turn the quotient of a vector space by an equivalence relation (not by a linear subspace)]]
Affine spaces are subspaces of [[projective space]]s: an affine plane can be obtained from any [[projective plane]] by removing a line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane as a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] by adding a [[line at infinity]] whose points correspond to equivalence classes of [[parallel lines]].

Further, transformations of projective space that preserve affine space (equivalently, that leave the [[hyperplane at infinity]] [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|invariant as a set]]) yield transformations of affine space. Conversely, any affine linear transformation extends uniquely to a projective linear transformation, so the [[affine group]] is a [[subgroup]] of the [[projective group]]. For instance, [[Möbius transformation]]s (transformations of the complex projective line, or [[Riemann sphere]]) are affine (transformations of the complex plane) if and only if they fix the [[point at infinity]].

==Affine algebraic geometry==

In [[algebraic geometry]], an [[affine variety]] (or, more generally, an [[affine algebraic set]]) is defined as the subset of an affine space that is the set of the common zeros of a set of so-called ''polynomial functions over the affine space''. For defining a ''polynomial function over the affine space'', one has to choose an [[affine coordinate system]]. Then, a polynomial function is a function such that the image of any point is the value of some multivariate [[polynomial function]] of the coordinates of the point. As a change of affine coordinates may be expressed by [[linear function]]s (more precisely affine functions) of the coordinates, this definition is independent of a particular choice of coordinates.

The choice of a system of affine coordinates for an affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n&lt;/math&gt; of dimension {{math|''n''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}} induces an affine [[isomorphism]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n&lt;/math&gt; and the affine [[coordinate space]] {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This explain why, for simplification, many textbooks write &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n = k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and introduce affine algebraic varieties as the common zeros of polynomial functions over {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. I, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the whole affine space is the set of the common zeros of the [[zero polynomial]], affine spaces are affine algebraic varieties.

===Ring of polynomial functions===

By the definition above, the choice of an affine coordinate system of an affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n&lt;/math&gt; allows one to identify the polynomial functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n&lt;/math&gt; with polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables, the ''i''th variable representing the function that maps a point to its ''i''th coordinate. It follows that the set of polynomial functions over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}_k^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[algebra over a field|{{math|''k''}}-algebra]], denoted &lt;math&gt;k\left[\mathbb{A}_k^n\right],&lt;/math&gt; which is isomorphic to the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;k\left[X_1, \ldots, X_n\right].&lt;/math&gt;

When one changes coordinates, the isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;k\left[\mathbb{A}_k^n\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]&lt;/math&gt; changes accordingly, and this induces an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;k\left[X_1, \ldots, X_n\right]&lt;/math&gt;, which maps each indeterminate to a polynomial of degree one. It follows that the [[total degree]] defines a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] of  &lt;math&gt;k\left[\mathbb A_k^n\right],&lt;/math&gt; which is independent from the choice of coordinates. The total degree defines also a [[graded ring|graduation]], but it depends on the choice of coordinates, as a change of affine coordinates may map indeterminates on non-[[homogeneous polynomial]]s.

===Zariski topology===
{{see also|Zariski topology}}
Affine spaces over [[topological field]]s, such as the real or the complex numbers, have a natural [[topology (structure)|topology]]. The Zariski topology, which is defined for affine spaces over any field, allows use of topological methods in any case. Zariski topology is the unique topology on an affine space whose [[closed sets]] are [[affine algebraic set]]s (that is sets of the common zeros of polynomials functions over the affine set). As, over a topological field, polynomial functions are continuous, every Zariski closed set is closed for the usual topology, if any. In other words, over a topological field, Zariski topology is [[coarser topology|coarser]] than the natural topology.

There is a natural injective function from an affine space into the set of [[prime ideal]]s (that is the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]]) of its ring of polynomial functions. When affine coordinates have been chosen, this function maps the point of coordinates &lt;math&gt;\left(a_1, \ldots, a_n\right)&lt;/math&gt; to the [[maximal ideal]] &lt;math&gt;\left\langle X_1 - a_1, \ldots, X_n - a_n\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This function is a [[homeomorphism]] (for the Zariski topology of the affine space and of the spectrum of the ring of polynomial functions) of the affine space onto the image of the function.

The case of an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed ground field]] is especially important in algebraic geometry, because, in this case, the homeomorphism above is a map between the affine space and the set of all maximal ideals of the ring of functions (this is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]).

This is the starting idea of [[scheme theory]] of [[Grothendieck]], which consists, for studying algebraic varieties, of considering as "points", not only the points of the affine space, but also all the prime ideals of the spectrum. This allows gluing together algebraic varieties in a similar way as, for [[manifold]]s, [[chart (topology)|charts]] are glued together for building a manifold.

===Cohomology===
Like all affine varieties, local data on an affine space can always be patched together globally: the [[cohomology]] of affine space is trivial. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;H^i\left(\mathbb{A}_k^n,\mathbf{F}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all coherent sheaves '''F''', and integers &lt;math&gt;i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. This property is also enjoyed by all other [[affine variety|affine varieties]]. But also all of the [[etale cohomology]] groups on affine space are trivial. In particular, every [[line bundle]] is trivial. More generally, the [[Quillen–Suslin theorem]] implies that ''every'' algebraic [[vector bundle]] over an affine space is trivial.

In [[mathematics]], an '''analytic semigroup''' is particular kind of [[C0 semigroup|strongly continuous semigroup]].  Analytic semigroups are used in the solution of [[partial differential equations]]; compared to strongly continuous semigroups, analytic semigroups provide better [[smooth function|regularity]] of solutions to [[initial value problem]]s, better results concerning perturbations of the [[C0 semigroup#Infinitesimal generator|infinitesimal generator]], and a relationship between the type of the semigroup and the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of the infinitesimal generator.

==Definition==

Let Γ(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(''At'') be a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup on a [[Banach space]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||·||) with infinitesimal generator ''A''.  Γ is said to be an '''analytic semigroup''' if

* for some 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''π''&amp;nbsp;⁄&amp;nbsp;2, the [[continuous linear operator]] exp(''At'')&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' can be extended to ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Δ&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\theta} = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ t \in \mathbb{C} : | \mathrm{arg}(t) | &lt; \theta \},&lt;/math&gt;

:and the usual semigroup conditions hold for ''s'',&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;theta;''&lt;/sub&gt;: exp(''A''0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;id, exp(''A''(''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(''At'')exp(''As''), and, for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'', exp(''At'')''x'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] in ''t'';

* and, for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Δ&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0}, exp(''At'') is [[analytic function|analytic]] in ''t'' in the sense of the [[uniform convergence|uniform operator topology]].

==Characterization==

The infinitesimal generators of analytic semigroups have the following characterization:

A [[closed operator|closed]], [[dense set|densely defined]] [[linear operator]] ''A'' on a Banach space ''X'' is the generator of an analytic semigroup [[if and only if]] there exists an ''ω''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''' such that the [[half-plane]] Re(''λ'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''ω'' is contained in the [[resolvent set|resolvent set]] of ''A'' and, moreover, there is a constant ''C'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\| R_{\lambda} (A) \| \leq \frac{C}{| \lambda - \omega |}&lt;/math&gt;

for Re(''λ'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''ω'' and where &lt;math&gt;R_\lambda(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]] of the operator ''A''. Such operators are called ''[[sectorial Operator|sectorial]]''. If this is the case, then the resolvent set actually contains a sector of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \lambda \in \mathbf{C} : | \mathrm{arg} (\lambda - \omega) | &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} + \delta \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and an analogous resolvent estimate holds in this sector.  Moreover, the semigroup is represented by

:&lt;math&gt;\exp (At) = \frac1{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} e^{\lambda t} ( \lambda \mathrm{id} - A )^{-1} \, \mathrm{d} \lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''γ'' is any curve from ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''iθ''&lt;/sup&gt;∞ to ''e''&lt;sup&gt;+''iθ''&lt;/sup&gt;∞ such that ''γ'' lies entirely in the sector

:&lt;math&gt;\big\{ \lambda \in \mathbf{C} : | \mathrm{arg} (\lambda - \omega) | \leq \theta \big\},&lt;/math&gt;

with ''π''&amp;nbsp;⁄&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''π''&amp;nbsp;⁄&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''δ''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2858">An '''aperiodic finite-state automaton''' is a [[finite-state automaton]] whose [[transition monoid]] is [[aperiodic monoid|aperiodic]].

==Properties==
A [[regular language]] is [[Star-free language|star-free]] if and only if it is accepted by an automaton with a finite and aperiodic [[transition monoid]]. This result of algebraic [[automata theory]] is due to [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]].&lt;ref name="Schutzenberger65"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul| title=On Finite Monoids Having Only Trivial Subgroups| journal=Information and Control| year=1965| volume=8| number=2| pages=190–194| url=http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1965-4TrivialSubgroupsIC.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(65)90108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counter-free language''' is a regular language for which there is an integer ''n'' such that for all words ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and integers ''m'' ≥ ''n'' we have ''xy''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''z'' in ''L'' if and only if ''xy''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''z'' in ''L''.  A '''counter-free automaton''' is a finite-state automaton which accepts a counter-free language.  A finite-state automaton is counter-free if and only if it is aperiodic.

An aperiodic automaton satisfies the [[Černý conjecture]].&lt;ref name="Trahtman07"&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=1152.68461 | last=Trahtman | first=Avraham N. | authorlink=Avraham Trahtman | title=The Černý conjecture for aperiodic automata | journal=Discrete Math.

In [[combinatorics]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the autocorrelation of a [[word (group theory)|word]] is the set of periods of this word. More precisely, it is a sequence of values which indicate how much the end of a word looks likes the beginning of a word. This value can be used to compute, for example, the average value of the first occurrence of this word in a random string.

==Definition==
In this article, ''A'' is an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]], and &lt;math&gt;w=w_1\dots w_n&lt;/math&gt; a [[Word (group theory)|word]] on ''A'' of length ''n''. The autocorrelation of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the [[correlation (formal language)|correlation]] of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; with itself. However, we redefine this notion below.

===Autocorrelation vector===
The autocorrelation vector of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;c=(c_0,\dots,c_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; being 1 if the [[Substring#Prefix|prefix]] of length &lt;math&gt;n-i&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[Substring#Suffix|suffix]] of length &lt;math&gt;n-i&lt;/math&gt;, and with &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; being 0 otherwise. That is &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; indicates whether &lt;math&gt;w_{i+1}\dots w_n=w_1\dots w_{n-i}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the autocorrelation vector of &lt;math&gt;aaa&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; since, clearly, for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; being 0, 1 or 2, the prefix of length &lt;math&gt;n-i&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the suffix of length &lt;math&gt;n-i&lt;/math&gt;. The autocorrelation vector of &lt;math&gt;abb&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; since no strict prefix is equal to a strict suffix. Finally, the autocorrelation vector of &lt;math&gt;aabbaa&lt;/math&gt; is 100011, as shown in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
!a
!a
!b
!b
!a

|- 
|

| 
| 
|a
|a
|b
|b
|a
|a
|1
|}

Note that &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is always equal to 1, since the prefix and the suffix of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are both equal to the word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;c_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is 1 if and only if the first and the last letters are the same.



===Autocorrelation polynomial===
The autocorrelation polynomial of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;c(z)=c_0z^0+\dots+c_{n-1}z^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a polynomial of degree at most &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;. 

For example, the autocorrelation polynomial of &lt;math&gt;aaa&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1+z+z^2&lt;/math&gt; and the autocorrelation polynomial of &lt;math&gt;abb&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the autocorrelation polynomial of &lt;math&gt;aabbaa&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1+z^4+z^5&lt;/math&gt;.

==Property==
We now indicate some properties which can be computed using the autocorrelation polynomial.

===First occurrence of a word in a random string===
Suppose that you choose an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of letters of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, randomly, each letter with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|A|}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; is the number of letters of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Let us call &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; the expectation of the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;|A|^nc\left(\frac{1}{|A|}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, each subword &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; which is both a prefix and a suffix causes the average value of the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to occur &lt;math&gt;|A|^{|v|}&lt;/math&gt; letters later. Here &lt;math&gt;|v|&lt;/math&gt; is the length of &lt;math&gt;|v|&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, over the binary alphabet &lt;math&gt;A=\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; is at position &lt;math&gt;2^2(1+\frac 12)=6&lt;/math&gt;  while the average first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is at position &lt;math&gt;2^2(1)=4&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, the fact that the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; is later than the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; can be explained in two ways:
*We can consider, for each position &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, what are the requirement for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;'s first occurrence to be at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
**The first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; can be at position 1 in only one way in both case. If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; starts with &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. This has probability &lt;math&gt;\frac14&lt;/math&gt; for both considered values of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
**The first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is at  position 2 if the prefix of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of length 3 is &lt;math&gt;aab&lt;/math&gt; or is &lt;math&gt;bab&lt;/math&gt;. However, the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; is at position 2 if and only if the prefix of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of length 3 is &lt;math&gt;baa&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note that the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;aaa&lt;/math&gt; is at position 1.). 
**In general, the number of prefixes of length &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; such that the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; is at position &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is smaller for &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; than for &lt;math&gt;ba&lt;/math&gt;. This explain why, on average, the first &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt; arrive later than the first &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;.
*We can also consider the fact that the average number of occurrences of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in a random string of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|A|^{l-n}&lt;/math&gt;. This number is independent of the autocorrelaction polynomial. An occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; may overlap another occurrence in different ways. More precisely, each 1 in its autocorrelaction vector correspond to a way for occurrence to overlap. Since many occurrences of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; can be packed together, using overlapping, but the average number of occurrences does not change, it follows that the distance between two non-overlapping occurrences is greater when the autocorrelaction vector contains many 1's.


===Ordinary generating functions===
Autocorrelation polynomials allows to give simple equations for the [[ordinary generating functions]] (OGF) of many natural questions.

*The OGF of the languages of words not containing  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{c(z)}{z^n+(1-|A|z)c(z)}&lt;/math&gt;.
*The OGF of the languages of words containing  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{z^n}{(1-|A|z)(z^n+(1-|A|z)c(z))}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*The OGF of the languages of words containing a single occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, at the end of the word is &lt;math&gt;\frac{z^n}{z^{|A|}+(1-|A|z)c(z)}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Bernstein Approximation.gif|thumb|right|Bernstein polynomials approximating a curve]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[numerical analysis]], a '''Bernstein polynomial''', named after [[Sergei Natanovich Bernstein]], is a [[polynomial]] in the '''Bernstein form''', that is a [[linear combination]] of '''Bernstein basis polynomials'''.

A [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is [[de Casteljau's algorithm]].

Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem|Stone–Weierstrass approximation theorem]]. With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], became important in the form of [[Bézier curve]]s.

==Definition==
The ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 '''Bernstein basis polynomials''' of degree ''n'' are defined as

: &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu,n}(x) = {n \choose \nu} x^{\nu} \left( 1 - x \right)^{n - \nu}, \quad \nu = 0, \ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{n \choose \nu}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binomial coefficient]].

The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree ''n'' form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the [[vector space]] Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of polynomials of degree at most&amp;nbsp;''n''.

A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(x) = \sum_{\nu=0}^{n} \beta_{\nu} b_{\nu,n}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is called a '''Bernstein polynomial''' or '''polynomial in Bernstein form''' of degree&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;G. G. Lorentz (1953) ''Bernstein Polynomials'', [[University of Toronto Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coefficients &lt;math&gt;\beta_\nu&lt;/math&gt; are called '''Bernstein coefficients''' or '''Bézier coefficients'''.

==Example==
[[File:Bernstein Polynomials.svg|thumb|385x385px|Bernstein basis polynomials for 4th degree curve blending]]
The first few Bernstein basis polynomials are:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
b_{0,0}(x) &amp; = 1, \\
b_{0,1}(x) &amp; = 1 - x, &amp; b_{1,1}(x) &amp; = x \\
b_{0,2}(x) &amp; = (1 - x)^2, &amp; b_{1,2}(x) &amp; = 2x(1 - x), &amp; b_{2,2}(x) &amp; = x^2 \\
b_{0,3}(x) &amp; = (1 - x)^3, &amp; b_{1,3}(x) &amp; = 3x(1 - x)^2, &amp; b_{2,3}(x) &amp; = 3x^2(1 - x), &amp; b_{3,3}(x) &amp; = x^3  \\
b_{0,4}(x) &amp; = (1 - x)^4, &amp; b_{1,4}(x) &amp; = 4x(1 - x)^3, &amp; b_{2,4}(x) &amp; = 6x^2(1 - x)^2, &amp; b_{3,4}(x) &amp; = 4x^3(1 - x), &amp; b_{4,4}(x) &amp; = x^4
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
: 
==Properties==
The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\nu &gt; n&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,\ 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}\left( 1 - x \right) = b_{n - \nu, n}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(0) = \delta_{\nu, 0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(1) = \delta_{\nu, n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] function: &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
0 &amp;\text{if } i \neq j,   \\
1 &amp;\text{if } i=j.   \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a root with multiplicity &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; (note: if &lt;math&gt;\nu = 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no root at 0).
* &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a root with multiplicity &lt;math&gt;\left( n - \nu \right)&lt;/math&gt; at point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt; (note: if &lt;math&gt;\nu = n&lt;/math&gt;, there is no root at 1).
* The [[derivative]] can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree:
*: &lt;math&gt;b'_{\nu, n}(x) = n \left( b_{\nu - 1, n - 1}(x) - b_{\nu, n - 1}(x) \right).&lt;/math&gt;
* The transformation of the Bernstein Polynomial to monomials is
*: &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu,n}(x) = \binom{n}{\nu}\sum_{k=0}^{n-\nu} \binom{n-\nu}{k}(-1)^k x^{\nu+k} = \sum_{l=\nu}^n \binom{n}{l}\binom{l}{\nu}(-1)^{l-\nu}x^l&lt;/math&gt;
and by the [[Binomial transform|inverse binomial transformation]] the reverse transformation is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1802.09518|first1=R. J. |last1=Mathar|year=2018| title=Orthogonal basis function over the unit circle with the minimax property}} App. B&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^i=\sum_{k=0}^{n-i}\binom{n-i}{k}\frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}}b_{n-k,n}(x)
=\frac{1}{\binom{n}{i}} \sum_{s=i}^n \binom{s}{i}b_{s,n}(x).
   &lt;/math&gt; 
* The indefinite [[integral]] is given by:
*: &lt;math&gt;\int b_{\nu, n}(x)dx = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{j=\nu+1}^{n+1} b_{j, n+1}(x) &lt;/math&gt; 
* The definite integral is constant for a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
*: &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}b_{\nu, n}(x)dx = \frac{1}{n+1}        ; \forall \nu = 0,1 \dots n&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique local maximum on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\ 1]&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\nu}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This maximum takes the value:
*: &lt;math&gt;\nu^\nu n^{-n} \left( n - \nu \right)^{n - \nu} {n \choose \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; form a [[partition of unity]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu = 0}^n b_{\nu, n}(x) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^n {n \choose \nu} x^\nu \left( 1 - x \right)^{n - \nu} = \left(x + \left( 1 - x \right) \right)^n = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
* By taking the first derivative of &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y = 1-x&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that
*: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu=0}^{n}\nu b_{\nu, n}(x) = nx&lt;/math&gt;
* The second derivative of &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y = 1-x&lt;/math&gt; can be used to show
*: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu=1}^{n}\nu(\nu-1) b_{\nu, n}(x) = n(n-1)x^2&lt;/math&gt;
* A Bernstein polynomial can always be written as a linear combination of polynomials of higher degree:
*: &lt;math&gt;b_{\nu, n - 1}(x) = \frac{n - \nu}{n} b_{\nu, n}(x) + \frac{\nu + 1}{n} b_{\nu + 1, n}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

==Approximating continuous functions==
Let ''&amp;fnof;'' be a [[continuous function]] on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial

: &lt;math&gt;B_n(f)(x) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^n f\left( \frac{\nu}{n} \right) b_{\nu,n}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}{ B_n(f) } = f &lt;/math&gt;

[[uniform convergence|uniformly]] on the interval&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].&lt;ref name=Nat6&gt;Natanson (1964) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a stronger statement than the proposition that the limit holds for each value of ''x'' separately; that would be [[pointwise convergence]] rather than [[uniform convergence]]. Specifically, the word ''uniformly'' signifies that

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup \left\{\, \left| f(x) - B_n(f)(x) \right| \,:\, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \,\right\} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Bernstein polynomials thus afford one way to prove the [[Stone&amp;ndash;Weierstrass theorem#Weierstrass approximation theorem|Weierstrass approximation theorem]] that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.&lt;ref name=Nat3&gt;Natanson (1964) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A more general statement for a function with continuous ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative is

: &lt;math&gt;{\left\| B_n(f)^{(k)} \right\|}_\infty \le \frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } \left\| f^{(k)} \right\|_\infty \text{ and } \left\| f^{(k)}- B_n(f)^{(k)} \right\|_\infty \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

where additionally

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } = \left( 1 - \frac{0}{n} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right) \cdots \left( 1 - \frac{k - 1}{n} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[eigenvalue]] of ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; the corresponding eigenfunction is a polynomial of degree&amp;nbsp;''k''.

===Proof===

Suppose ''K'' is a [[random variable]] distributed as the number of successes in ''n'' independent [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''x'' of success on each trial; in other words, ''K'' has a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters ''n'' and&amp;nbsp;''x''.  Then we have the [[expected value]] E(''K''/''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.

By the [[law of large numbers|weak law of large numbers]] of [[probability theory]],
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}{ P\left( \left| \frac{K}{n} - x \right|&gt;\delta \right) } = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for every ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in ''x'', which can be seen from its proof via [[Chebyshev's inequality]], taking into account that the variance of ''K''/''n'', equal to ''x''(1-''x'')/''n'', is bounded from above by 1/(4''n'') irrespective of ''x''.

Because ''&amp;fnof;'', being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] on that interval, one infers a statement of the form
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}{ P\left( \left| f\left( \frac{K}{n} \right) - f\left( x \right) \right| &gt; \varepsilon \right) } = 0&lt;/math&gt;
uniformly in ''x''. Taking into account that ''ƒ'' is bounded (on the given interval) one gets for the expectation
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}{ E\left( \left| f\left( \frac{K}{n} \right) - f\left( x \right) \right| \right) } = 0&lt;/math&gt;
uniformly in ''x''. To this end one splits the sum for the expectation in two parts. On one part the difference does not exceed ε; this part cannot contribute more than ε.
On the other part the difference exceeds ε, but does not exceed 2''M'', where ''M'' is an upper bound for |''ƒ''(x)|; this part cannot contribute more than 2''M'' times the small probability that the difference exceeds ε.

Finally, one observes that the absolute value of the difference between expectations never exceeds the expectation of the absolute value of the difference, and that E(''&amp;fnof;''(''K''/''n'')) is just the Bernstein polynomial&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ƒ'',&amp;nbsp;''x'').

The '''Berry mechanism''', or '''Berry pseudorotation mechanism''', is a type of vibration causing molecules of certain geometries to [[isomerization|isomerize]] by exchanging the two axial ligands (see Figure at right) for two of the equatorial ones. It is the most widely accepted mechanism for [[pseudorotation]] and most commonly occurs in [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|trigonal bipyramidal]] molecules such as [[PF5|PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], though it can also occur in molecules with a [[square pyramidal]] geometry.  The Berry mechanism is named after [[R. Stephen Berry]], who first described this mechanism in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;RS Berry, 1960, "Correlation of rates of intramolecular tunneling processes, with application to some Group V compounds," ''J. Chem. Phys.'' '''32''':933-938, DOI 10.1063/1.1730820; see [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/69547/JCPSA6-32-3-933-1.pdf?sequence=2] or [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/69547?show=full], accessed 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CassHiiRzepa05&gt;M Cass, KK Hii &amp; HS Rzepa, 2005, "Mechanisms that interchange axial and equatorial atoms in fluxional processes: Illustration of the Berry pseudorotation, the turnstile and the lever mechanisms via animation of transition state normal vibrational modes", ''J. Chem. Educ.'' (online), 2005; see [http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/bpr/], accessed 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berry mechanism in trigonal bipyramidal structure==
The process of pseudorotation occurs when the two axial ligands close like a pair of scissors pushing their way in between two of the equatorial groups which scissor out to accommodate them. Both the axial and equatorial constituents move at the same rate of increasing the angle between the other axial or equatorial constituent.&lt;ref name=CassHiiRzepa05/&gt; This forms a [[Square pyramidal molecular geometry|square based pyramid]] where the base is the four interchanging ligands and the tip is the ''pivot ligand'', which has not moved. The two originally equatorial ligands then open out until they are 180 degrees apart, becoming axial groups perpendicular to where the axial groups were before the pseudorotation. This requires about 3.6 kcal/mol in [[PF5|PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=CassHiiRzepa05/&gt;

[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-Berry-mechanism.png|700px|center|Iron-pentacarbonyl-Berry-mechanism]][[File:berry_pseudorotation.gif|300px|center]]

This rapid exchange of axial and equatorial ligands renders complexes with this geometry unresolvable (unlike carbon atoms with four distinct substituents), except at low temperatures or when one or more of the ligands is bi- or poly-dentate.

==Berry mechanism in square pyramidal structure==
The Berry mechanism in square pyramidal molecules (such as [[Iodine pentafluoride|IF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is somewhat like the inverse of the mechanism in bipyramidal molecules. Starting at the "transition phase" of bipyramidal pseudorotation, one pair of fluorines scissors back and forth with a third fluorine, causing the molecule to vibrate. Unlike with pseudorotation in bipyramidal molecules, the atoms and ligands which are not actively vibrating in the "scissor" motion are still participating in the process of pseudorotation; they make general adjustment based on the movement of the actively vibrating atoms and ligands. However, this geometry requires a significant amount of energy to occur of about 26.7 kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=CassHiiRzepa05/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10987">'''[[Circuit (computer theory)|Circuit]]s over [[natural number]]s''' are a mathematical model used in studying [[computational complexity theory]]. They are a special case of [[circuit (computer theory)|circuit]]s. The object is a labeled [[directed acyclic graph]] the nodes of which evaluate to sets of natural numbers, the leaves are finite sets, and the gates are set operations or arithmetic operations.

As an [[algorithm]]ic problem, the problem is to find if a given natural number is an element of the output node or if two circuits compute the same set. Decidability is still an open question.

== Formal definition ==
A natural number circuit is a [[circuit complexity|circuit]], i.e. a labelled [[directed acyclic graph]] of in-degree at most 2. The nodes of in-degree 0, the leaves, are finite sets of natural numbers, the labels of the nodes of in-degree 1 are&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}=\{x\in\mathbb{N}|x\not\in A\}&lt;/math&gt; and the labels of the nodes of in-degree 2 are +, ×, ∪ and ∩, where &lt;math&gt;A+B=\{a+b|a\in A, b\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A\times B=\{a\times b|a\in A, b\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;  and ∪ and ∩ with the usual [[Set (mathematics)|set]] meaning.

The subset of circuits which do not use all of the possible labels are also studied.

=== Algorithmic problems ===
One can ask:
*Is a given number ''n'' a member of the output node.
*Is the output node empty, does it contain a specific element, is it equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;?
*Is one node is a subset of another.

For circuits which use all the labels, all these problems are equivalent.

==== Proof ====
The first problem is reducible to the second one, by taking the intersection of the output gate and ''n''. Indeed, the new output get will be empty if and only if ''n'' was not an element of the former output gate.

The first problem is reducible to the third one, by asking if the node ''n'' is a subset of the output node.

The second problem is reducible to the first one, it suffices to multiply the output gate by 0, then 0 will be in the output gate if and only if the former output gate were not empty.

The third problem is reducible to the second one, checking if A is a subset of B is equivalent to ask if there is an element in &lt;math&gt;A\cap\overline{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Restrictions ===
Let O be a subset of {∪,∩,&amp;minus;,+,×}, then we call MC(O) the problem of finding if a natural number is inside the output gate of a circuit the gates' labels of which are in O, and MF(O) the same problem with the added constraint that the circuit must be a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]].

=== Quickly growing set ===
One difficulty comes from the fact that the complement of a finite set is infinite, and a computer has got only a finite memory. But even without complementation, one can create [[Double exponential function|double exponential]] numbers. Let &lt;math&gt;E_0=\{2\}, E_{i+1}=E_i\times E_i&lt;/math&gt;, then one can easily prove by induction on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;E_i=\{2^{2^i}\}&lt;/math&gt;, indeed &lt;math&gt;E_0=\{2\}=\{2^1\}=\{2^{2^0}\}&lt;/math&gt; and by induction &lt;math&gt;E_{i+1}=E_i\times E_i=\{2^{2^i}\}\times\{2^{2^i}\}=\{(2^{2^i})^2\}=\{2^{2^i\times2}\}=\{2^{2^{i+1}}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

And even double exponential—sized sets: let &lt;math&gt;S_0=\{0,1,2\}, S_{i+1}=(S_i\times S_i)+S_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\{x|0&lt;x&lt;2^{2^i}\}\subset S_i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; contains the &lt;math&gt;2^{2^i}&lt;/math&gt; firsts number. Once again this can be proved by induction on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, it is true for &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; by definition and let &lt;math&gt;x\in\{x|0&lt;x&lt;2^{2^{i+1}}\}&lt;/math&gt;, dividing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;2^{2^i}&lt;/math&gt; we see that it can be written as &lt;math&gt;x=2^{2^i}\times d+r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d,r&lt; 2^{2^i}&lt;/math&gt;, and by induction, &lt;math&gt;2^{2^i}, d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;, so indeed &lt;math&gt;x\in (S_i \times S_i)+ S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

These examples explains why addition and multiplication are enough to create problems of high complexity.

== Complexity results ==

=== Membership problem ===
The membership problem asks if, given an element ''n'' and a circuit, ''n'' is in the output gate of the circuit.

When the class of authorized gates is restricted, the membership problem lies inside well known complexity classes. Note that the size variable here is the size of the circuit or tree; the value of ''n'' is assumed to be fixed.

=== Equivalence problem ===
The equivalence problem asks if, given two gates of a circuit, they evaluate to the same set.

When the class of authorized gates is restricted, the equivalence problem lies inside well known complexity classes.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''control variable''' (or '''scientific constant''') in [[scientific experimentation]] is the experimental element which is constant and unchanged throughout the course of the investigation.  The control variable strongly influences experimental results, and it is held constant during the experiment in order to test the relative relationship of the [[dependent and independent variables]]. The control variable itself is not of primary interest to the experimenter.

==Usage==
A variable in an experiment which is held constant in order to assess the relationship between multiple variables, is the control variable.&lt;ref name="bus"&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/control-variable.html ''control variable'']; Business Dictionary online; retrieved September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fair"&gt;[http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_variables.shtml ''Definitions'']; Science Buddies – Science Fair Projects.&lt;/ref&gt; A control variable is the one element that is not changed throughout an experiment, because its unchanging state allows the relationship between the other variables being tested to be better understood.&lt;ref name="ppt"&gt;PPT Download; [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LEVu50wPNVgXcAlyEnnIlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTByaWg0YW05BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1442066676/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fbiologyjunction.com%2fScientific%2520Method%2520-%2520Controls%2520and%2520Variables.ppt/RK=0/RS=zvv0K01D27_3O42Ah4uTJSvOKmk-]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Essentially, a control variable is what is kept the same throughout the experiment, and it is not of primary concern in the experimental outcome.&lt;ref name="ppt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fair"/&gt;   Any change in a control variable in an experiment would invalidate the correlation of dependent variables (DV) to the independent variable (IV), thus skewing the results.&lt;ref name="ppt"/&gt;

==Experimental examples==
In any system existing in a natural state, many variables may be interdependent, with each affecting the other.  Scientific experiments tests the relationship of an IV –that element which is manipulated by the experimenter– to the DV –that element affected by the manipulation of the IV.  Any additional independent variable can be a control variable.&lt;ref name="bus"/&gt;

Take, for example, the [[combined gas law]], which is stated mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \frac {PV}{T}= k &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:{{math|''P''}} is the [[pressure]]
:{{math|''V''}} is the [[volume]]
:{{math|''T''}} is the [[thermodynamic temperature]] measured in [[kelvin]]s
:{{math|''k''}} is a constant (with units of energy divided by temperature).

:which shows that the ratio between the pressure-volume product and the temperature of a system remains constant.

In an experimental verification of one part of the combined gas law, [[Boyle's law]], ({{math|''P''}} * {{math|''V''}} = {{math|''T''}}), where '''P'''ressure, '''T'''emperature, and '''V'''olume are all variables, to test the resultant changes to any of these variables requires at least one to be kept constant.&lt;ref name="fair"/&gt; This is in order to see ''comparable experimental results'' in the remaining variables. 

If Volume is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between dependent variables, Pressure and Temperature,  can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other. For instance, if the Pressure is raised then the Temperature must increase.

If, however, Temperature is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between the dependent variables, Pressure and Volume, can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other. For instance, the Pressure is raised then the Volume must decrease.

The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) is a joint American and Canadian security accreditation program for cryptographic modules. The program is available to any vendors who seek to have their products certified for use by the [[U.S. Government]] and regulated industries (such as financial and health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate "sensitive, but not classified" information. All of the tests under the CMVP are handled by third-party laboratories that are accredited as [[CMTL|Cryptographic Module Testing Laboratories]] by the [[National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program]] (NVLAP). Product certifications under the CMVP are performed in accordance with the requirements of [[FIPS 140-2]].

The CMVP was established by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[Communications Security Establishment]] (CSE) of the [[Politics of Canada|Government of Canada]] in July 1995.

The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), which provides guidelines for validation testing for FIPS approved and NIST recommended cryptographic algorithms and components of algorithms, is a prerequisite for CMVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/|title=Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and technology|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4663">In [[algebraic geometry]], '''determinantal varieties''' are spaces of matrices with a given upper bound on their [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]s. Their significance comes from the fact that many examples in algebraic geometry are of this form, such as the [[Segre embedding]] of a product of two [[projective space]]s.

==Definition==

Given ''m'' and ''n'' and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;min(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''), the '''determinantal variety''' ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrices (over a field&amp;nbsp;''k'') with rank ≤&amp;nbsp;''r''. This is naturally an [[algebraic variety]] as the condition that a matrix have rank ≤&amp;nbsp;''r'' is given by the vanishing of all of its (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]. Considering the generic ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix whose entries are [[algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, these minors are polynomials of degree ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. The ideal of ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] generated by these polynomials is a '''determinantal ideal'''. Since the equations defining minors are homogeneous, one can consider ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; either as an [[affine variety]] in ''mn''-dimensional [[affine space]], or as a [[projective variety]] in (''mn''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[projective space]].

==Properties==

The [[radical ideal]] defining the determinantal variety is generated by the (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) minors of the matrix (Bruns-Vetter, Theorem 2.10).

Assuming that we consider ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; as an [[affine variety]], its dimension is ''r''(''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r''). One way to see this is as follows: form the product space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{mn} \times \mathbf{Gr}(r,m)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{mn}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Gr}(r,m)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grassmannian]] of ''r''-planes in an ''m''-dimensional vector space, and consider the subspace &lt;math&gt;Z_r = \{ (A, W) \mid A(k^n) \subseteq W \}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[resolution of singularities|desingularization]] of &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; (over the open set of matrices with rank exactly ''r'', this map is an isomorphism), and &lt;math&gt;Z_r&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector bundle]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Gr}(r,m)&lt;/math&gt; which is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(k^n, \mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the tautological bundle over the Grassmannian. So &lt;math&gt;\dim Y_r = \dim Z_r&lt;/math&gt; since they are [[birationally equivalent]], and &lt;math&gt;\dim Z_r = \dim \mathbf{Gr}(r,m) + nr = r(m-r) + nr&lt;/math&gt; since the fiber of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(k^n, \mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; has dimension ''nr''.

The above shows that the matrices of rank &lt;''r'' contains the [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular locus]] of &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt;, and in fact one has equality. This fact can be verified using that the radical ideal is given by the minors along with the [[Jacobian criterion]] for nonsingularity.

The variety ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; naturally has an action of &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbf{GL}(m) \times \mathbf{GL}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, a product of [[general linear group]]s. The problem of determining the [[Syzygy (mathematics)|syzygies]] of &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt;, when the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] is zero, was solved by [[Alain Lascoux]], using the natural action of&amp;nbsp;''G''.

==Related topics==

One can "globalize" the notion of determinantal varieties by considering the space of linear maps between two vector bundles on an algebraic variety. Then the determinantal varieties fall into the general study of [[degeneracy loci]]. An expression for the cohomology class of these degeneracy loci is given by the [[Thom-Porteous formula]], see (Fulton-Pragacz).

'''Elon Lindenstrauss''' ({{lang-he|אילון לינדנשטראוס}}, born August 1, 1970) is an Israeli [[mathematician]], and a winner of the 2010 [[Fields Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3939799,00.html|accessdate=19 August 2010|newspaper=ynet|date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/XjS8spYBEzE/Israeli+Mathemetician+Elon+Lindenstrauss+Wins |title=Israeli Mathemetician Elon Lindenstrauss Wins Field Medal&amp;nbsp;— Pictures |publisher=Zimbio |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, he has been a professor at [[Princeton University]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Mathematics Institute at the [[Hebrew University]].

== Biography ==
Lindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German origins. He was also born into a mathematical family, the son of the mathematician [[Joram Lindenstrauss]], the namesake of the [[Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma]], and computer scientist [[Naomi Lindenstrauss]], both professors at the [[Hebrew University]]. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the [[Hebrew University Secondary School]]. He enlisted to the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]'s [[Talpiot program]], and studied at the [[Hebrew University]], where he earned his BSc in [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] in 1991 and his master's degree in Mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being "Entropy properties of dynamical systems", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], then a Szego Assistant Prof. at [[Stanford University]]. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].

In Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elon Lindenstrauss|url=https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/elon-lindenstrauss|publisher=Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Lindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of [[ergodic theory]] and its applications in [[number theory]]. With [[Anatole Katok]] and [[Manfred Einsiedler]], he made progress on the [[Littlewood conjecture]].

In a series of two papers (one co-authored with [[Jean Bourgain]]) he made major progress on [[Peter Sarnak]]'s Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by [[Kannan Soundararajan]].

Recently with [[Manfred Einsiedler]], [[Philippe Michel]] and [[Akshay Venkatesh]], he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Yuri Linnik]].

Together with [[Benjamin Weiss]] he developed and studied systematically the invariant of [[mean dimension]] introduced in 1999 by [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]]. In related work he introduced and studied the [[small boundary property]].

Among his co-authors are [[Jean Bourgain]], [[Manfred Einsiedler]], [[Philippe Michel]], [[Shahar Mozes]], [[Akshay Venkatesh]] and [[Barak Weiss]].

== Awards ==
*In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] and won a bronze medal.
*During his service in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], he was awarded the [[Israel Defense Prize]].
*In 2003, he was awarded the [[Salem Prize]] jointly with [[Kannan Soundararajan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''extension topology''' is a [[topology (structure)|topology]] placed on the [[disjoint union]] of a [[topological space]] and another [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

There are various types of extension topology, described in the sections below.

== Extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where A is an open set of X and Q is a subset of P.

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where B is a closed set of X and Q is a subset of P.

For these reasons this topology is called the '''extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open and the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note the similitude of this extension topology construction and the [[One-point compactification#Alexandroff one-point compactification|Alexandroff one-point compactification]], in which case, having a topological space X which one wishes to compactify by adding a point ∞ in infinity, one considers the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞} to be the sets of the form: K, where K is a closed compact set of X, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞}, where B is a closed set of X.

== Open extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A, where A is an open set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''open extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where B is a closed set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the open extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[excluded point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the open extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

== Closed extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose closed sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B, where B is a closed set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''closed extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the open sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where A is an open set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the closed extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[particular point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the closed extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Genaille–Lucas rulers''' (also known as '''Genaille's rods''') are an [[arithmetic]] tool invented by [[Henri Genaille]], a French railway engineer, in 1891.  The device is a variant of [[Napier's bones]].  By representing the [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry]] graphically, the user can read off the results of simple [[multiplication]] problems directly, with no intermediate [[mental calculation]]s.

==History==

In 1885, French mathematician [[Édouard Lucas]] posed an arithmetic problem during a session of the [[Académie française]]. Genaille, already known for having invented a number of arithmetic tools, created his rulers in the course of solving the problem.  He presented his invention to the [[Académie française]] in 1891.  The popularity of Genaille's rods was widespread but short-lived, as [[mechanical calculator]]s soon began to displace manual arithmetic methods.&lt;ref name=Aspray&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

A full set of Genaille–Lucas rulers consists of eleven strips of wood or metal.  On each strip is printed a column of triangles and a column of numbers:

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers full.svg|700px]]

==Multiplication==

By arranging these rulers in the proper order, the user can solve multiplication problems.

Consider multiplying '''52749''' by '''4'''.  Five rulers, one for each digit of '''52749''', are arranged side-by-side, next to the "index" ruler:

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers example 1.png]]

The second multiplicand is '''4''', so we look at the fourth row:

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers example 2.png]]

We start from the top number in the last column of the selected row:

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers example 3.png]]

The grey triangle points the way to the next number:

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers example 4.png]]

We follow the triangles from right to left, until we reach the first column.

[[File:Genaille-Lucas rulers example 5.png]]

Then we simply read off the digits that we visited.  The product, shown in red, is '''210996'''.

==Division==
Soon after their development by Genaille, the rulers were adapted to a set of rods that can perform division. The division rods are aligned similarly to the multiplication rods, with the index rod on the left denoting the [[divisor]], and the following rods spelling out the digits of the dividend. After these, a special "remainder" rod is placed on the right. The [[quotient]] is read from left to right, following the lines from one rod to the next. The path of digits ends with a number on the remainder rod, which is the [[remainder]] given by the division.

'''Gerd Faltings''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfaltɪŋs|lang}}; born 28 July 1954) is a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in arithmetic [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Faltings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mathgene&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=18851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
From 1972 to 1978, Faltings studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Münster]]. In 1978 he received his [[PhD]] in mathematics.&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt;

==Career and research==
In 1981 he obtained the ''venia legendi'' ([[Habilitation]]) in mathematics, both from the [[University of Münster]]. During this time he was an assistant professor at the University of Münster. From 1982 to 1984, he was [[professor]] at the [[University of Wuppertal]].&lt;ref name=Zeit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1984/24/genie-ist-fuer-ihn-normal |title= Gerd Faltings: Genie ist für ihn normal |trans-title=Gerd Faltings: For him, genius is the norm |language=German |first=Roland |last=Kirbach |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=8 June 1984 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1985 to 1994, he was professor at [[Princeton University]]. In the fall of 1988 and in the academic year 1992–1993 he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/2239 Faltings, Gerd | Institute for Advanced Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] at Berkeley  for proving the [[Tate conjecture]] for abelian varieties over number fields, the [[Faltings's theorem|Shafarevich conjecture]] for abelian varieties over number fields and the [[Mordell conjecture]], which states that any non-singular projective curve of genus ''g'' &gt; 1 defined over a number field ''K'' contains only finitely many ''K''-rational points. As a Fields Medalist he gave an ICM plenary talk ''Recent progress in arithmetic algebraic geometry''. 

In 1994 as an [[invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM invited speaker]] in Zurich he gave a talk ''Mumford-Stabilität in der algebraischen Geometrie.'' Extending methods of [[Paul Vojta]], he proved the [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]], which is a generalization of the Mordell conjecture. Together with [[Gisbert Wüstholz]], he reproved [[Roth's theorem]], for which Roth had been awarded the Fields medal in 1958.

In 1994, he returned to Germany and from 1994 to 2018, he was a director of the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik|Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] in [[Bonn]]. 
In 1996, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research.

Faltings was the formal supervisor of [[Shinichi Mochizuki]],&lt;ref name=shin/&gt; [[Wieslawa Niziol]],&lt;ref name=niz/&gt; [[Nikolai Durov|Nikolai Dourov]].

{{Party politics}}
A '''grand coalition''' is an arrangement in a [[multi-party]] [[parliamentary system]] in which the two largest [[political party|political parties]] of opposing [[political spectrum|political ideologies]] unite in a [[coalition government]].&lt;ref&gt;Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction, Eighth Edition, Hague and Harrop, page 330; quoted on [https://thepoliticalloop.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/how-stuff-works-the-different-types-of-coalition/ The Political Loop]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used in countries where there are two dominant parties with different ideological orientations, and a number of smaller parties that have passed the [[election threshold]] to secure representation in the [[parliament]]. The two large parties will each try to secure enough seats in any [[election]] to have a [[majority government]] alone, and if this fails each will attempt to form a coalition with smaller parties that have a similar ideological orientation. Because the two large parties will tend to differ on major ideological issues, and portray themselves as rivals, or even sometimes enemies, they will usually find it more difficult to agree on a common direction for a combined [[government]] with each other than with smaller parties.

==Causes of a grand coalition==
Occasionally circumstances arise where normally opposing parties may find it desirable to form a government. One is a national crisis such as a [[war]] or [[depression (economics)|depression]], where people feel a need for national unity and stability that overcomes ordinary ideological differences. This is especially true where there is broad agreement about the best policy to deal with the crisis. In this case, a grand coalition may occur even when one party has enough seats to govern alone. An example would be the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|British national governments]] during [[World War I]] and before and during [[World War II]].

Another possibility is that the major parties may find they have more in common ideologically with each other than with the smaller parties, or that the fragmentation of the smaller parties is so great that no other coalition is stable. Examples include [[Austria]], where the mainstream parties of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] have often formed grand coalitions to keep parties of the [[far left]] or [[far right]] out of government (an example of a ''[[cordon sanitaire#In politics|cordon sanitaire]]''), or [[Israel]], where no single party has ''ever'' won enough seats to govern alone, and, in some parliaments, the fragmentation and intransigence of some of the smaller parties has made it easier to maintain a coherent platform with a grand coalition than with a narrow one. This is often done out of political necessity, to prevent an early election.

==Grand coalitions by country==
===Austria===
{{main|Grand coalition (Austria)}}
In post-war Austria, a "grand coalition" ({{lang-de|Große Koalition}}) between conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) has been the standard case of governance. Notable exceptions were [[Josef Klaus]]'s second government (ÖVP, 1966–70), the era of Chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] who governed from 1970 until 1983 with an SPÖ majority and from 1983 until 1987 in coalition with the FPÖ, ÖVP Chancellor [[Wolfgang Schüssel]]'s coalition governments with right-wing populist [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) from 2000 until 2005 and [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) from 2005 until 2007, and ÖVP Chancellor [[Sebastian Kurz]]'s current coalition government with the FPÖ since 2017.

===Germany===
{{main|Grand coalition (Germany)}}
In post-war Germany, "grand coalition" ({{lang-de|Große Koalition}}) refers to a governing coalition of the two largest parties, usually the Christian Democrats ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD). While Germany has historically tended to favor narrow coalitions of one of the two largest parties with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] or with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], four grand coalitions have been formed on a federal level: the [[Kiesinger cabinet]] (1966–1969), the [[First Merkel cabinet]] (2005–2009), the [[Third Merkel cabinet]] (2013-2018), and the [[Fourth Merkel cabinet]] (since 2018). Under the [[Weimar Republic]], a grand coalition was one including all of the major parties of the left, center, and center-right who formed the basis of most governments - the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Catholic Centre Party]], the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP). The two examples were the [[first Stresemann cabinet|first]] and [[second Stresemann cabinet]]s (August-November 1923) and, less ephemerally, the [[Hermann Müller (politician)|second Müller cabinet]] (1928-1930).

===Iceland===
{{main|Icelandic parliamentary election, 2017#Government formation}}
Iceland, a country in Europe has a grand coalition since  30 November 2017 between the largest parties of the centre-right to right-wing [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] (16), the left-wing [[Left-Green Movement]] (9), and the centre-right [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] (8).

===Iran===
{{main|Grand coalition (Iran)}}

===Italy===
{{main|Grand coalition (Italy)|Historic Compromise}}
In Italy, "grand coalition" ({{lang-it|Grande coalizione}}) refers to the only supermajority government formed in April 2013 between center-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD), center-right [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party, and the centrist [[Civic Choice]] (SC) and [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of the Centre]] (UdC) parties. In November 2013, The People of Freedom (later renamed as [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]]) however dropped out and broke apart, leaving the [[Letta Cabinet]] and further [[Renzi Cabinet]] (Coalition between PD, NCD, SC and UdC) with a small majority.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|National Government (United Kingdom)}}
The UK has had grand coalitions in central government during periods of wartime.  They are referred to as the "National Government".

====Northern Ireland====
{{main|Northern Ireland Executive}}
The [[Northern Ireland Executive]], the devolved administration of Northern Ireland, combines the largest Republican (also predominantly left of centre) and Unionist (also predominantly right of centre) parties.  The chief post, of [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]], is a diarchy. Most recently, this coalition was led by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Sinn Féin]].  

All parties, major and minor, are offered posts in the executive, although may [[Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Northern_Ireland)#Northern_Ireland_Assembly|now opt to form an opposition]].

====Cayman Islands====
{{main|Caymanian general election, 2017#Government formation}}
The Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory, has an incumbent coalition between the largest parties; the centre-left [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|Progressives]] and centre-right [[Cayman Democratic Party|Democrats]].

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there have been several [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinets]] which can be described as grand coalitions. The [[Roman/Red]] coalitions of the 1940s and 1950s under Prime Minister [[Willem Drees]] were composed of  the [[Catholicism|catholic]] [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) at its core and several smaller parties as backup ([[Drees–Van Schaik cabinet|Drees–Van Schaik]]). The [[Purple (government)|Purple]] coalitions in the 1990s under Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] were between the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), the [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[Democrats 66]] (D66) party ([[First Kok cabinet]]). The [[Second Rutte cabinet]] a grand coalition cabinet which also can be described as a purple coalition was composed of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA). A more traditional grand coalition cabinet was the [[Third Lubbers cabinet]], comprising the [[Christian democracy|christian-democratic]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA).

===Spain===
In Spain, the term "grand coalition" is typically used to refer to any hypothetical government formed between the centre-right to right-wing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and the centre-left [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). No such a coalition government as ever been formed at the national level, though it was proposed by then-[[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] during the [[2015–16 Spanish government formation|2015–2016 government formation process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 December 2015 |title=Mariano Rajoy pide una gran coalición y no descarta ofrecer ministerios a PSOE y Ciudadanos |url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Mariano-Rajoy-PSOE-Ciudadanos-Gobierno_0_467903488.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 February 2016 |title=Rajoy insiste en la gran coalición y ofrece la vicepresidencia al PSOE |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2016/02/18/56c5be2fe2704e653a8b4580.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 June 2016 |title=Rajoy afirma que la gran coalición con el PSOE ayudaría a "resolver" la cuestión catalana |url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20160621/rajoy-gran-coalicion-ayudaria-resolver-debate-independentista-catalan-5218696 |language=Spanish |work=El Periódico de Catalunya |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajoy's own investiture on 29 October 2016 was allowed through the abstention of PSOE's MPs in what was dubbed as a "covert grand coalition", in reference to PSOE's tolerance of Rajoy's minority government through punctual agreements until the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election, 2017|re-election]] of [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] as party leader in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 January 2017 |title=PP y PSOE escenifican ya la gran coalición en el primer pleno del año |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170131/413877085394/pp-psoe-gran-coalicion.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 May 2017 |title=Rajoy da por perdido al PSOE gane quien gane y apuesta todo a los nacionalistas |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2017-05-13/gobierno-pp-psoe-crisis-primarias-legislatura-nacionalistas-rajoy_1382004/ |language=Spanish |work=El Confidencial |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the regional level, grand coalitions between the two largest parliamentary forces have been rare, but examples exist:
*[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]: [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]]–[[Socialist Party of the Basque Country–Basque Country Left|PSE]], 1986–1990 and 1991–1998.
*[[Navarre]]: [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]]–[[Socialist Party of Navarre|PSN]], 2011–2012.

Additionally, both PSOE and PP formed a joint coalition government—which also included other parties—following a successful vote of no confidence on the Cantabrian regional government of [[Juan Hormaechea]] in 1990, enduring until the [[Cantabrian regional election, 1991|1991 regional election]]. At the time, however, the PP was not among the two largest political parties in the regional assembly.

'''''Grundzüge der Mengenlehre''''' (German for "Basics of Set Theory") is an influential book on [[set theory]] written by [[Felix Hausdorff]].

First published in April 1914, ''Grundzüge der Mengenlehre'' was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on [[measure theory]] and [[topology]], which were then still considered parts of set theory. Hausdorff presented and developed original material which was later to become the basis for those areas. In 1927 Hausdorff published an extensively revised second edition under the title ''Mengenlehre'' (German for "Set Theory"), with many of the topics of the first edition omitted. In 1935 there was a third German edition, which in 1957 was translated by John R. Aumann ''et al.'' into English under the title ''Set Theory''.

'''Heinrich Scholz''' ({{IPA-de|ʃɔlts|lang}}; December 17, 1884 – December 30, 1956) was a German [[logic]]ian, [[philosopher]], and [[Protestant]] [[Theology|theologian]] who was a peer of [[Alan Turing]], who wrote in his memoirs that he on the inclusion of his essay from 1936 "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]":&lt;ref&gt;Alan Turing: "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]." In: ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', 2nd series, vol. 42 (1937), pp. 230–265.&lt;/ref&gt; "[I was disappointed that only] two people could have understood it, and would have responded [had I been asked] – Heinrich Scholz and [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Bevan Braithwaite]]."

Scholz had an extraordinary career but was not considered a brilliant logician, for example  on the same level as [[Gottlob Frege]] or [[Rudolf Carnap]], but was considered an outstanding scientist of national importance. He provided a suitable academic environment for his students to thrive. He founded the Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at the University of Münster in 1936, which can be said enabled the study of logic at the highest international level after [[World War II]] up until the present day.&lt;ref name="Sholz2"&gt;Hans-Christoph Schmidt am Busch and [[Kai Wehmeier|Kai F. Wehmeier]] , "It is the only track that I leave '. documents about the history of the Institute of Mathematical Logic and basic research," In: Heinrich Scholz: logician, philosopher, theologian, ed. by H.-C. Schmidt am Busch and KF Wehmeier, mentis Verlag, Paderborn 2005, 93–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Herman Scholz father was a minister at [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Menzler-Trott2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eckart Menzler-Trott|title=Logic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXWGKlLTkqoC&amp;pg=PA183|date=1 January 2007|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-9129-2|pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1903 to 1907 he studied philosophy and theology at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen University]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] achieving a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in theology (Lic. theol.).  He was a student of [[Adolf von Harnack]], in philosophy with peers [[Alois Riehl]] and [[Friedrich Paulsen]]. On 28 July 1910, Scholz [[Habilitation|habilitated]] in the subjects of [[religious philosophy]] and [[systematic theology]] in Berlin, and was promoted to full [[professor]], therein working as a lecturer.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Scholz.html |title = History of Heinrich Scholz |publisher = School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland  |date = July 2009 |website = University of St Andrews |accessdate= 15 Dec 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, at Erlangen, Herman Sholz took his examination for promotion of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr. phil.]] with Richard Falckenberg [[Richard Falckenberg]], studying the work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], his thesis title: ''A contribution from the history of the German spirit.'' In 1917 was appointed to the chair  of Philosophy of Religion at the [[University of Wrocław|Breslau]] succeeding [[Rudolf Otto]] to teach religious philosophy and systematic theology. In the same year he married his fiancée, Elisabeth Orth. Due to 8 years of continuous gastric trouble, he was exempted from military service. In 1919, he underwent an operation in which he believed to be a large part of his stomach was removed. That year he took the call to [[University of Kiel|Kiel University]], as the chair of philosophy. It was while at Kiel, in 1924, that Scholz's first wife, Elisabeth Orth died.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;

From October 1928 onwards, he taught in [[University of Münster|Münster University]], first as ''Professor of Philosophy''. In 1938, this was changed to ''Professor of Philosophy of Mathematics and Science'' and again in 1943 to ''Chair of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Questions in Mathematics'' working as head of the Institute for Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at Münster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/org/en/ |title=Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research|publisher=University of Münster |accessdate=15 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until he retired in 1952 as professor emeritus.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;

Scholz was survived by his second wife, Erna.  Scholz grave is located on the Park Cemetery Eichhof near Kiel.

==Work==
From his own account, in 1921, having by accident came across [[Principia Mathematica]] by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] he began studying logic, which he had abandoned in his youth to study theology, leading later to a study of mathematics and theoretical physics by taking an undergraduate degree at Kiel.&lt;ref name="Sholz2" /&gt;  However another factor in his change of focus was the mathematician [[Otto Toeplitz]].&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt; Toeplitz's broad research interests including [[Hilbert space]]s and [[spectral theory]] encouraged Scholz interest in mathematics. Indeed, Segal&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Segal |first=S. L. |year= 2003 |title=Mathematicians under the Nazis |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate= 15 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Scholz love of structure was also an important factor in his move into mathematical logic, describing it this:

''Scholz's feeling for structure was no small thing. He apparently felt that when having guests for dinner: (1) no more than six people should be invited; (2) there must be an excellent menu; (3) a discussion theme must be planned; and (4) the guests should have prepared themselves as much as possible beforehand on this theme.''

In 1925, he was a peer of [[Karl Barth]] at Münster University, in which he taught [[Protestantism|Protestant theology]]. Under the influence of conversations with Scholz,  Barth later wrote in 1930/31. his book about the [[Anselm of Canterbury]] proof of God  "''fides quaerens intellectum''."

In the 1930s, he continued to maintain contact with [[Alan Turing]], who later wrote in his memoirs that he on the inclusion of his essay from 1936 "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was disappointed that only two people could have understood it, and would have responded – Heinrich Scholz and [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Bevan Braithwaite]].

At the [[University of Münster]], his study into mathematical logic and basic research, provided many of the critical insights, that contributed to the foundations of [[theoretical computer science]].&lt;ref name="Sholz2" /&gt; Right from the time he arrived at Münster, Scholz worked towards building a school of mathematical logic.&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; By 1935, his research team at Münster were being referred to as the ''Münster school of mathematical logic''.&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; Scholz names 1936, as the year the ''Münster School'' was born.&lt;ref name="Menzler-Trott2007" /&gt;  His professorship was rededicated in 1936 to a lectureship for mathematical logic and fundamental research  and in 1943 the first chair in Germany for mathematical logic and fundamental research. The Münster Chair is still regarded as one of the best in Germany.

Scholz was considered a [[Platonism|Platonist]], and in that sense, he regarded the mathematical logic as the foundation of knowledge. In 1936 he was awarded a grant from the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]], for the production of three volumes of research in logic and for the editing of the [[Gottlob Frege]] papers. He is considered the discoverer of the estate of [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Kai F. Wehmeier and Hans-Christoph Schmidt am Busch, "In Search of Frege's estate." In: Gottlob Frege: Works and Impact, ed. by G. Gabriel and U. Dathe, mentis Verlag, Paderborn 2005, 267–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]] whose thesis had been supervised by Scholtz, produced a book ''Grundzüge der mathematischen Logik'' in 1961 which was jointly authored with Scholz despite being published five years after Scholz's death.&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt;

===Work during World War II===
Initially Scholz was pleased with the rise of [[Nazism|Nazi]] power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Describing himself a conservative nationalist, describing himself as such "We felt like Prussians right to the bone,""&lt;ref name="Menzler-Trott2007" /&gt; and described by his friend [[Heinrich Behnke]] as a "small-minded Prussian nationalist".&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; Behnke found discussing political issues difficult. In the beginning the Nazi laws helped establish Münster as an important centre for Logic as other university staff at Göttingen and Berlin Universities were being obliterated.

On 14 March 1940, Scholz sent a letter to the Education department of occupied Poland, seeking the release of Jan Salamucha,&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; who had been professor of theology at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]. Salamucha was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in 1940. In October 1940, Scholz received a reply for the education minister which stated he had "injured the national honour" and was forbidden to send further petitions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/historie/kapitel52.pdf Vita] at Uni M&amp;uuml;nster (in German, p.111-118 = p.23-30 in the pdf document), here: p.114-115 = p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Salamucha was later released but killed by the Nazis in 1944&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; However, Scholz persisted, first helping [[Alfred Tarski]], who had fled Poland to the United States, to correspond with his wife who remained in Poland and later helping the Polish Logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Jan Lukasiewicz]], who he had been corresponding since 1938, to leave Poland with his wife and hide in Germany.&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt;

Although Scholz' recognized the true nature of the Nazis and abhorred them from mid-1942 onwards, he  remained on good terms with Nazi academics like [[Ludwig Bieberbach]].&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; During the period of National Socialism, Max Steck, who championed the ''German Mathematics'' which rejected the formalist approach to mathematics, deeply opposed [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] approach which he described as Jewish - the worst possible insult in Germany at this time.&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt; Max Steck acknowledged the "per se outstanding achievement of formalism" ("an sich betrachtet einmaligen Leistung des Formalismus"), but criticized the "missing epistemological component" ("Jede eigentliche Erkenntnistheorie fehlt im Formalismus")&lt;ref&gt;Max Steck: "Mathematik als Begriff und Gestalt" (i.e. "Mathematics as concept and model"), Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle (Saale), 1942, pages 27, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the only page of his main work where he connects formalism and Jews he mentions that "Jews were the actual trendsetters of formalism" ("die eigentlichen Schrittmacher des Formalismus").&lt;ref&gt;Max Steck: "Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik", 2nd extended edition, Dr. Georg Lüttke Verlag, Berlin 1943, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Bieberbach asked Scholz to write an article for [[Deutsche Mathematik]],  to answer the attacks on [[Formalism (mathematics)|mathematical formalism]] by Steck, which was surprising since Bieberbach led the Nazi mathematicians' attack on Jewish mathematics. Ensuring that Hilbert was not considered "Jewish", Scholz wrote "What does formalised study of the foundations of mathematics aim at?."&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Heinrich Scholz | title=Was will die formalisierte Grundlagenforschung? | journal=Deutsche Mathematik | volume=7 | number=2/3 | pages=206&amp;mdash;248 | date=Jul 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholz had received funding from Bieberbach as early as 1937, which prompted an annoyed Steck to write in his 1942 book:

{{quote|What Scholz has understood is doubtless this, to obtain from the German State huge amounts of publication money for this logic production. We fundamentally reject this logic which praises the English empiricists and sensory philosophers such as the Englishmen Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and by now find it really time to speak for once about the "Great Germans".&lt;ref name="St Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Steck, Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik, 2nd edition, Georg Lüttke Verlag, Berlin, 1943, page 157; direct quotation from Max Steck's book: "What Scholz has understood is doubtless this, to renounce the statements of the first edition of our book as belonging to the history of thought and turn personal. We fundamentally reject this formal mathematical logic, which praises the English empiricists and sensory philosophers such as "the Great Englishmen Locke, Berkeley, Hume" (Heinrich Scholz on page 15), and by now find it really time to speak for once about the "Great Germans"." (Original German text by Max Steck: ''"Was er verstanden hat ist zweifellos dies, die Darlegungen der 1. Auflage unseres Buches als geistesgeschichtliche Entwicklungen abzustreiten und ins Persönliche zu verbiegen. Wir lehnen grundsätzlich diese Logistik, die die englischen Empiristen und Sensualisten als die "großen Engländer, Locke, Berkeley, Hume" preist (so Heinrich Scholz ibid. S. 15) ab und finden es nachgerade an der Zeit, einmal von den "Großen Deutschen" zu sprechen."'')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were three other articles by Heinrich Scholz in the journal ''German Mathematics'': ''Ein neuer Vollständigkeitsbeweis für das reduzierte Fregesche Axiomensystem des Aussagenkalküls'' (1936), a review of the Nazi philosopher Wolfgang Cramer's book ''Das Problem der reinen Anschauung'' (1938) and a review of [[Andreas Speiser]]'s ''Ein Parmenideskommentar'' (1938).

==World's first computer science seminar==
In the late 2000s, Achim Clausing&lt;ref&gt;http://cs.uni-muenster.de/u/cl/&lt;/ref&gt; was tasked with going through the remaining estate of Scholz at Münster University, and while going through the archive papers in the basement of the Institute of Computer Science,  Clausing discovered two original prints of the most important publication of Alan Turing, which had been missing since 1945.&lt;ref name="Sholz5"&gt;{{cite news  |date=28 Jan 2013 |title=In the footsteps of a pioneer: In the University Library Münster are original prints of the computer scientist Alan Turing |newspaper=Westfälische Nachrichten |location=Münster |publisher= Westfälische Nachrichten Elmar Ries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the work "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]" from 1936, which Scholz had requested, and a postcard from Turing.  Based on the work by Turing and conversations with Scholz,  Clausing stated "[it was] the world's first [[seminar]] on computer science."  The second work, which was a Mind (journal) article,  dates from 1950 and is a treatise on the development of [[artificial intelligence]], Turing provided them with a handwritten comment. ''This is probably my last copy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.uni-muenster.de/u/cl/img/turingbig.jpg |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |last1=Turing |first1=Alan|date= Oct 1950 |website=http://cs.uni-muenster.de |publisher=Mind, A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy Vol LIX No 236 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At [[Sotheby's]] recently, comparable prints of Turing, with no attached dedication, sold for 180,000 euros.

== Marketing ==
The dust jacket of the original (Birkhäuser) edition had a picture of a star over a mountain and appeared to be a religious or mystical work.  Subsequent paperback reprintings had covers suggesting that the publishers wished to appeal to a "new age" market.  The most recent editions, from [[Princeton University Press]], have very austere covers suggesting an academic work.

== Synopsis ==
The book contains accessible popular expositions on the mathematical theory of [[infinity]], and a number of related topics.  These include [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and their relationship to concepts of [[artificial intelligence]] and the human mind, as well as the conceivability of some unconventional cosmological models.  The material is approached from a variety of viewpoints, some more conventionally mathematical and others being nearly mystical.  There is a brief account of the author's personal contact with [[Kurt Gödel]].

An appendix contains one of the few popular expositions on [[set theory]] research on what are known as "strong axioms of infinity."

The '''insider investment strategy''' is an [[investment strategy]] that follows the buying and selling decisions of [[insider trading|insiders]]. The primary insiders have information advantage and the proven theory is that they as a group over time will do better than the average [[investor]] on the [[Stock exchange|Stock Exchange]]. However, in the world there are only a few [[investment fund]]s that follow the insider trades, both of them were established in 2011.
In America Catalyst Capital Advisors LLC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalystMF.com | title = America Catalyst Capital Advisors |  publisher = America Catalyst Capital Advisors}}&lt;/ref&gt; manages &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalystmf.com/i/u/6149790/f/INSAX_Investor_Presentation_2014-08.pdf | title = America Catalyst Capital Advisors |  publisher = America Catalyst Capital Advisors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalyst Insider Buying Fund. This fund is a large-cap, long-only equity fund that only invests in companies where corporate insiders are buying their own company's stock on the open market.
In Europe Dovre Forvaltning UAB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dovreforvaltning.com/en/content/about-us | title = Dovre Forvaltning |  publisher = Dovre Forvaltning}}&lt;/ref&gt; manages Dovre Inside Nordic fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dovreforvaltning.com/en/din | title = Fund Facts: Dovre Inside Nordic |  publisher = Dovre Forvaltning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fund is a Nordic [[Stock fund|equity fund]], which strategy is to follow the primary insiders in listed companies and/or shareholders with assumed close relationship to company, board and management.

A Lorie-Niederhoffer study indicates that proper and prompt analysis of data on insider trading can be profitable.

Glass examines 14 different calendar months and selects the eight securities with the greatest excess of buyers to sellers among insiders within a month. He finds that the average return on these securities is 10 percent above the return on the stock market as a whole in the 7 months following the individual months of intensive buying.

In 2014 Dovre Forvaltning shared there analysis on insiders influence in the Nordic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dovreforvaltning.com/sites/default/files/public/docs/2014-10-30%20Insider%20Study.pdf | title = Dovre Insider Study |  publisher = Dovre Forvaltning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company analyzed these different yearly portfolios (both for Purchases and Sales):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dovreforvaltning.com/sites/default/files/public/docs/2014-10-30%20Insider%20Study.pdf | title = Dovre Insider Study |  publisher = Dovre Forvaltning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Had an insider Purchases in the past 1/3/6 months.
* Had only insider Purchases in the past 1/3/6 months.
* Last insider transaction in the past 1/3/6 months was an insider Purchase.
* Had an insider Sales in the past 1/3/6 months.
* Had only insider Sales in the past 1/3/6 months.
* Last insider transaction in the past 1/3/6 months was an insider Sale.

Only transactions above 80.000 SEK were included (33% of all insider trades were excluded because they were too small). If there were no Purchases/Sales in 1,3,6 months after a company's inclusion, it was excluded from the portfolio. All stocks are equally weighted.
The analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dovreforvaltning.com/sites/default/files/public/docs/2014-10-30%20Insider%20Study.pdf | title = Dovre Insider Study|  publisher = Dovre Forvaltning}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that:

* Highest outperformance is in Small Caps insider Purchase portfolios. Smaller in Mid Caps Purchase portfolios. And smallest in Large Caps insider Purchase portfolios.
* 'Insider effect' fades away with longer holding horizon.
* Sell signals are stronger than Buy signals.
* Sell signals are the strongest when more than 50% of holdings are sold.
* Buy signals are the strongest when signal transaction value is &lt;80.000 SEK.

The '''International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning''' ('''IJCAR''') is a series of conferences on the topics of [[automated reasoning]], [[automated deduction]], and related fields. It is organized semi-regularly  as a merger of other meetings. IJCAR replaces those independent conferences in the years it takes place. The conference is organized by [[Conference on Automated Deduction|CADE Inc.]], and CADE has always been one of the conferences partaking in IJCAR.

* The first IJCAR was held in [[Siena]], Italy in 2001 as a merger of CADE, [[International Workshop on First-Order Theorem Proving|FTP]], and [[TABLEAUX]].
* The second IJCAR was held in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland in 2004 as a merger of CADE, FTP, TABLEAUX, [[FroCoS]] and [[CALCULEMUS]].
* The third IJCAR was held as an independent subconference  of the fourth [[Federated Logic Conference]] in [[Seattle]], United States, and merged CADE, FTP, TABLEAUX, FroCoS and [[TPHOLs]].
* The fourth IJCAR was held in [[Sydney]], Australia in 2008, and merged CADE, FroCoS, FTP and TABLEAUX.
* The fifth IJCAR was held in 2010 as an independent subconference  of the fifth [[Federated Logic Conference]] in [[Edinburgh]], UK, and merged CADE, FTP, TABLEAUX, and FroCoS.
* The sixth IJCAR was held in [[Manchester]], UK, as part of the ''Alan Turing Year 2012'', and was collocated with the [[Alan Turing Centenary Conference]]. It again merged  CADE, FTP, TABLEAUX, and FroCoS.

Every operator on a non-trivial complex finite dimensional vector space has an eigenvector, solving the invariant subspace problem for these spaces.]]

In the field of [[mathematics]] known as [[functional analysis]], the '''invariant subspace problem''' is a partially unresolved problem asking whether every [[bounded operator]]  on a complex [[Banach space]] sends some non-trivial [[closed set|closed]] subspace to itself. The original form of the problem as posed by [[Paul Halmos]] was in the special case of polynomials{{clarify|reason=Operators?|date=September 2015}} with [[Compact operator|compact]] square.  This was resolved affirmatively, for a more general class of polynomially [[compact operator]]s, by [[Allen R. Bernstein]] and [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1966 (see {{slink|Non-standard analysis|Invariant subspace problem}} for a summary of the proof).

==Precise statement==

More formally,  the '''invariant subspace problem''' for a complex [[Banach space]] ''H'' of [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 is the question whether every [[bounded operator|bounded linear operator]] ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H''   has a non-trivial [[closed set|closed]] [[invariant subspace|''T''-invariant subspace]] (a closed [[linear subspace]] ''W'' of ''H'' which is different from {0} and ''H'' such that ''T''(''W'') ⊆ ''W'').

To find a [[counterexample]] to the invariant subspace problem means to answer affirmatively the following equivalent question: Does there exist a bounded linear operator ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'' such that for every non-zero vector ''x'', the [[vector space]] generated by the sequence {''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') : ''n'' ≥ 0} is norm [[dense set|dense]] in ''H''? Such operators are called [[hypercyclic operator|cyclic]].{{clarify|reason=It's not defined there. Also, for T to be cyclic, it requires only one ''x'' to be like that, not every ''x'' to be like that.|date=September 2015}}

==History==
The problem seems to have been stated in the mid-1900s after work by Beurling and [[von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="Yadav, page 292"&gt;Yadav, page 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Banach space]]s, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Enflo. (For [[Hilbert space]]s, the invariant subspace problem remains [[Unsolved problems in mathematics|open]].)

[[Per Enflo]] proposed a counterexample to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article's complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987&lt;ref name="Beauzamy 1988; Yadav"&gt;Beauzamy 1988; Yadav.&lt;/ref&gt; Enflo's long "manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians"&lt;ref name="Yadav, page 292"/&gt; and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976).&lt;ref&gt;For example, Radjavi and Rosenthal (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|pages=33–37
|author=Heydar Radjavi and Peter Rosenthal
|title=The invariant subspace problem
|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer
|volume=4
|issue=1
|date=March 1982
|doi=10.1007/BF03022994
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Enflo's works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo's ideas.&lt;ref name="Beauzamy 1988; Yadav" /&gt;

In the 1990s, Enflo developed a "constructive" approach to the invariant subspace problem on Hilbert spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Page 401 in {{cite journal|last1=Foiaş|first1=Ciprian|last2=Jung|first2=Il Bong|last3=Ko|first3=Eungil|last4=Pearcy|first4=Carl | title=On quasinilpotent operators. III | journal=Journal of Operator Theory | volume=54|year=2005|issue=2|pages=401–414}}. Enflo's method of ("forward") "minimal vectors" is also noted in the review of this research article by Gilles Cassier in ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'': {{MR|2186363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Known special cases===

While the general case of the invariant subspace problem is still open, several special cases have been settled for topological vector spaces (over the field of complex numbers):
*For finite-dimensional complex vector spaces of dimension greater than two every operator admits an eigenvector, so it has a 1-dimensional invariant subspace.
* The conjecture is true if the Hilbert space ''H'' is not [[separable space|separable]] (i.e. if it has an [[uncountable]] [[orthonormal basis]]). In fact, if ''x'' is a non-zero vector in ''H'', the norm closure of the vector space generated by the infinite sequence {''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') : ''n'' ≥ 0} is separable and hence a proper subspace and also invariant.
*von Neumann showed&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann's proof was never published, as relayed in a private communication to the authors of {{harvtxt|Aronszajn|Smith|1954}}. A version of that proof, independently discovered by Aronszajn, is included at the end of that paper.&lt;/ref&gt; that any compact operator on a Hilbert space of dimension at least 2 has a non-trivial invariant subspace.
* The [[spectral theorem]] shows that all [[normal operator]]s admit invariant subspaces.
* {{harvtxt|Aronszajn|Smith|1954}} proved that every [[compact operator]] on any Banach space of dimension at least 2 has an invariant subspace.
* {{harvtxt|Bernstein|Robinson|1966}} proved using [[non-standard analysis]] that if  the operator ''T'' on a Hilbert space is polynomially compact (in other words ''P''(''T'') is compact for some non-zero polynomial ''P'') then ''T'' has an invariant subspace. Their proof uses the original idea of embedding the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in a [[hyperfinite set|hyperfinite]]-dimensional Hilbert space (see [[Non-standard analysis#Invariant subspace problem]]).
* {{harvtxt|Halmos|1966}}, after having seen Robinson's preprint, eliminated the non-standard analysis from it and   provided a shorter proof in the same issue of the same journal.
* {{harvtxt|Lomonosov|1973}} gave a very short proof using the [[Schauder fixed point theorem]] that if the operator ''T'' on a Banach space commutes with a non-zero compact operator then ''T'' has a non-trivial invariant subspace.  This includes the case of polynomially compact operators because an operator commutes with any polynomial in itself. More generally, he showed that if ''S'' commutes with a non-scalar operator ''T'' that commutes with a non-zero compact operator, then ''S'' has an invariant subspace.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Pearcy|Shields|1974}} for a review.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first example of an operator on a Banach space with no invariant subspaces was found by  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Per Enflo|first=Per|last=Enflo|year1=1976|year2=1987}}, and his example was simplified by {{harvtxt|Beauzamy|1985}}.
*The first counterexample on a "classical" Banach space was found by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Charles Read (mathematician)|first=Charles|last= Read|year1=1984|year2=1985}}, who described an operator on the classical Banach space ''l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' with no invariant subspaces.
*Later {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Charles Read (mathematician)|first=Charles|last=Read|year=1988}} constructed an operator on ''l&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' without even a non-trivial closed invariant ''subset'', that is, with every vector [[hypercyclic vector|hypercyclic]], solving in the negative the ''invariant subset problem'' for the class of Banach spaces.
*{{harvtxt|Atzmon|1983}} gave an example of an operator without invariant subspaces on a [[nuclear space|nuclear]] [[Fréchet space]].
*{{harvtxt|Śliwa|2008}} proved that any infinite dimensional Banach space of countable type over a non-Archimedean field admits a bounded linear operator without a non-trivial closed invariant subspace. This completely solves the non-Archimedean version of this problem, posed by van Rooij and Shikhof in 1992.
*{{harvtxt|Argyros|Haydon|2009}} gave the construction of an infinite-dimensional Banach space such that every continuous operator is the sum of a compact operator and a scalar operator, so in particular every operator has an invariant subspace.

'''Isaac Todhunter''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (23 November 1820&amp;nbsp;– 1 March 1884), was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]] who is best known today for the books he wrote on mathematics and its history.

==Life and work==

The son of George Todhunter, a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] minister, and Mary née Hume, he was born at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], [[Sussex]]. He was educated at [[Hastings]], where his mother had opened a school after the death of his father in 1826. He became an assistant master at a school at [[Peckham]], attending at the same time evening classes at the [[University College, London]] where he was influenced by [[Augustus De Morgan]]. In 1842 he obtained a mathematical scholarship and graduated as B.A. at [[University of London|London University]], where he was awarded the gold medal on the M.A. examination. About this time he became mathematical master at a school at [[Wimbledon, London, England|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Todhunter, Isaac|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844 Todhunter entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was [[senior wrangler]] in 1848, and gained the first [[Smith's Prize]] and the Burney Prize; and in 1849 he was elected to a fellowship, and began his life of college lecturer and private tutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TDHR844I|name=Todhunter, Isaac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(Surname=%27todhunter%27) |title= Todhunter; Isaac (1820 - 1884); Mathematician; Fellow of Royal Society |accessdate=2008-08-04 |work= Search for Fellows |publisher= Royal Society |date= 5 June 1862 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1865 a member of the Mathematical Society of London. In 1871 he gained the [[Adams Prize]] and was elected to the council of the [[Royal Society]]. He was elected honorary fellow of St John's in 1874, having resigned his fellowship on his marriage in 1864. In 1880 his eyesight began to fail, and shortly afterwards he was attacked with paralysis.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

He is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge|Mill Road cemetery]], Cambridge.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Todhunter married 13 August 1864 Louisa Anna Maria, eldest daughter of Captain (afterwards Admiral) George Davies, R.N. (at that time head of the county constabulary force).  He died on 1 March 1884, at his residence, 6 Brookside, Cambridge.  A mural tablet and medallion portrait were placed in the ante-chapel of his college by his widow, who, with four sons and one daughter, survived him.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

He was a sound Latin and Greek scholar, familiar with French, German, Spanish, Italian, and also Russian, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. He was well versed in the history of philosophy, and on three occasions acted as examiner for the moral sciences [[tripos]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

An unfinished work, ''The History of the Theory of Elasticity'', was edited and published posthumously in 1886 by [[Karl Pearson]]. A biographical work on [[William Whewell]] was published in 1876, in addition to many original papers in scientific journals.

Todhunter wrote textbooks on [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]], and a revision of the translation by [[Robert Simson]] of [[Euclid's Elements]], which, with an introduction by [[Thomas Little Heath]], was republished by [[Everyman's Library|Everyman]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cairns|first=W.

Generally, a '''partition''' is a division of a whole into non-overlapping parts.  Among the kinds of partitions considered in [[mathematics]] are
* [[partition of a set]] or an [[ordered partition]] of a set,
* [[graph partition|partition of a graph]],
* [[Partition (number theory)|partition of an integer]],
* [[partition of an interval]],
* [[partition of unity]],
* partition of a matrix; see [[block matrix]], and
* [[partition of the sum of squares]] in [[statistics]] problems, especially in the [[analysis of variance]],
* [[quotition and partition]], two ways of viewing the operation of division of integers.

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''locally normal''' if intuitively it looks locally like a [[normal space]]. More precisely, a locally normal space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the space that is normal under the [[subspace topology]]. 

==Formal definition==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''locally normal''' [[if and only if]] each point, ''x'', of ''X'' has a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] that is [[normal space|normal]] under the [[subspace topology]].

Note that not every neighbourhood of ''x'' has to be normal, but at least one neighbourhood of ''x'' has to be normal (under the subspace topology).

Note however, that if a space were called locally normal [[if and only if]] each point of the space belonged to a subset of the space that was normal under the subspace topology, then every topological space would be locally normal. This is because, the singleton {''x''} is [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] normal and contains ''x''. Therefore, the definition is more restrictive.

==Examples and properties==

* Every locally normal [[T1 space]] is [[Locally regular space|locally regular]] and [[Locally Hausdorff space|locally Hausdorff]].
* A [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is always locally normal.
* A normal space is always locally normal.
* A [[T1 space]] need not be locally normal as the set of all real numbers endowed with the [[cofinite topology]] shows.

==Theorems==

'''Theorem 1'''

If ''X'' is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to ''Y'' and ''X'' is locally normal, then so is ''Y''.

'''Proof'''

This follows from the fact that the image of a normal space under a homeomorphism is always normal.

'''Luigi Amerio''' (15 August 1912 – 28 September 2004), was an Italian [[electrical engineer]] and [[mathematician]]. He is known for his work on [[almost periodic function]]s, on [[Laplace transform]]s in one and several dimensions, and on the theory of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.

==Works==
A selection of Luigi Amerio's scientific papers is published in the two volumes of his "''Selecta''" {{harv|Amerio|1990}}: he is also the author of several university textbooks and, jointly with his pupil [[Giovanni Prouse]], he wrote the influential monograph on almost periodic functions {{harv|Amerio|Prouse|1971}}.

In [[logic]], a '''metatheorem''' is a statement about a [[formal system]] proven in a [[metalanguage]]. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a [[metatheory]], and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the [[object theory]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A formal system is determined by a formal language and a [[deductive system]] ([[axiom]]s and [[rules of inference]]). The formal system can be used to prove particular sentences of the formal language with that system. Metatheorems, however, are proved externally to the system in question, in its metatheory. Common metatheories used in logic are [[set theory]] (especially in [[model theory]]) and [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (especially in [[proof theory]]). Rather than demonstrating particular sentences to be provable, metatheorems may show that each of a broad class of sentences can be proved, or show that certain sentences cannot be proved.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Examples==
Examples of metatheorems include:
* The [[deduction theorem]] for [[first-order logic]] says that a sentence of the form φ→ψ is provable from a set of axioms ''A'' if and only if the sentence ψ is provable from the system whose axioms consist of φ and all the axioms of ''A''. 
* The [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#Class existence theorem|class existence theorem]] of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] states that for every formula whose [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s range only over sets, there is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] consisting of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s satisfying the formula.
* [[Consistency proof]]s of systems such as [[Peano arithmetic]].

'''Molecular models of DNA structures''' are representations of the [[molecular geometry]] and [[DNA topology|topology]] of deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) molecules using one of several means,  with the aim of simplifying and presenting the essential, physical and chemical, properties of DNA molecular structures either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro''.  These representations include closely packed spheres ([[CPK coloring|CPK]] models) made of plastic, metal wires for ''skeletal models'', graphic computations and animations by computers, artistic rendering.  Computer molecular models also allow animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important for understanding how DNA functions ''in vivo''.

The more advanced, computer-based [[molecular model]]s of DNA involve [[molecular dynamics]] simulations and [[quantum mechanics]] computations of vibro-rotations, delocalized [[molecular orbital]]s (MOs), [[electric dipole moment]]s, [[hydrogen-bonding]], and so on.  ''DNA molecular dynamics modeling'' involves simulating deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) [[molecular geometry]] and [[DNA topology|topology]] changes with time as a result of both intra- and inter- molecular interactions of DNA. Whereas molecular models of DNA molecules such as closely packed spheres (CPK models) made of plastic or metal wires for ''skeletal models'' are useful representations of static DNA structures, their usefulness is very limited for representing complex DNA dynamics. Computer molecular modeling allows both animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important to understand how DNA functions ''[[in vivo]]''.

{{further|History of molecular biology}}

From the very early stages of structural studies of DNA by [[X-ray diffraction]] and biochemical means, molecular models such as the Watson-Crick [[nucleic acid double helix]] model were successfully employed to solve the 'puzzle' of DNA structure, and also find how the latter relates to its key functions in living cells. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns
of A-DNA were reported by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1107/S0365110X53001939 |author=Franklin, R.E., Gosling, R.G. |title=The Structure of Sodium Thymonucleate Fibres I.

The Cylindrically Symmetrical Patterson Function |journal=Acta Crystallogr. |volume=6 |issue=8 |page=678 |date=6 March 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Franklin made the critical observation that DNA exists in two distinct forms, A and B, and produced the sharpest pictures of both through X-ray diffraction technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=DEAN H.|last2=Maddox|first2=Brenda|date=2002|title=The Twisted Road to the Double Helix|jstor=26060090|journal=Scientific American|volume=287|issue=6|pages=127–128|doi=10.2307/26060090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first calculations of the Fourier transform of an atomic helix were reported one year earlier by Cochran, Crick and Vand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1107/S0365110X52001635 |author=Cochran, W., Crick, F.H.C., Vand V. |title=The Structure of Synthetic Polypeptides. 1. The Transform of Atoms on a Helix |journal=Acta Crystallogr. |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=581–6 |year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were followed in 1953 by the computation of the Fourier transform of a coiled-coil by Crick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1107/S0365110X53001952 |author=Crick, F.H.C. |title=The Fourier Transform of a Coiled-Coil |journal=Acta Crystallogr. |volume=6 |issue=8–9 |pages=685–9 |year=1953a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural information is generated from X-ray diffraction studies of oriented DNA fibers with the help of molecular models of DNA that are combined with crystallographic and mathematical analysis of the X-ray patterns.

The first reports of a double helix molecular model of B-DNA structure were made by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/171737a0 |author=Watson, James D., Crick, Francis H.C. |title=A structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=171 |issue=4356 |pages=737–8 |date=25 April 1953 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=13054692 |bibcode=1953Natur.171..737W}}, .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watson, J.D |author2=Crick F.H.C. |title=The Structure of DNA |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology |volume=18 |pages=123–31 |year=1953b |pmid=13168976 |doi=10.1101/SQB.1953.018.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Maurice F.

Epigenetic transformation studies of DNA ''in vivo'' were however much slower to develop despite their importance for embryology, morphogenesis and cancer research. Such chemical dynamics and biochemical reactions of DNA are much more complex than the molecular dynamics of DNA physical interactions with water, ions and proteins/enzymes in living cells.

== Importance ==
{{further|Nucleic acid structure}}

An old standing dynamic problem is how DNA "self-replication" takes place in living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called ''fibers'' or chains (that are made of repeating [[nucleotide]] units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure ''in vivo'' undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. Supercoiling, packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve  ''in vivo'' [[DNA topology]] which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists. Like other large molecules and biopolymers, DNA often exists in multiple stable geometries (that is, it exhibits [[conformational isomerism]]) and configurational, quantum states which are close to each other in energy on the potential energy surface of the DNA molecule.

Such varying molecular geometries can also be computed, at least in principle, by employing ''ab initio'' [[quantum chemistry]] methods that can attain high accuracy for small molecules, although claims that acceptable accuracy can be also achieved for polynuclelotides, and DNA conformations, were recently made on the basis of [[vibrational circular dichroism]] (VCD) spectral data. Such quantum geometries define an important class of ''ab initio'' molecular models of DNA which exploration has barely started, especially related to results obtained by VCD in solutions. More detailed comparisons with such ''ab initio'' quantum computations are in principle obtainable through 2D-FT NMR spectroscopy and relaxation studies of polynucleotide solutions or specifically labeled DNA, as for example with deuterium labels.

In an interesting twist of roles, the DNA molecule was proposed to be used for [[quantum computing]] via DNA. Both DNA nanostructures and [[DNA computing]] biochips have been built.

The chemical structure of DNA is insufficient to understand the complexity of the 3D structures of DNA. In contrast, animated molecular models allow one to visually explore the three-dimensional (3D) structure of DNA. The DNA model shown (far right) is a space-filling, or [[CPK coloring|CPK]], model of the DNA double helix. Animated molecular models, such as the wire, or skeletal, type shown at the top of this article, allow one to visually explore the three-dimensional (3D) structure of DNA. Another type of DNA model is the space-filling, or CPK, model.

The hydrogen bonding dynamics and proton exchange is very different by many orders of magnitude between the two systems of fully hydrated DNA and water molecules in ice.  Thus, the DNA dynamics is complex, involving nanosecond and several tens of picosecond time scales, whereas that of liquid ice is on the picosecond time scale, and that of proton exchange in ice is on the millisecond time scale.  The proton exchange rates in DNA and attached proteins may vary from picosecond to nanosecond, minutes or years, depending on the exact locations of the exchanged protons in the large biopolymers.

A simple [[harmonic oscillator]] 'vibration' is only an oversimplified dynamic representation of the longitudinal vibrations of the DNA intertwined helices which were found to be [[Anharmonicity|anharmonic]] rather than harmonic as often assumed in quantum [[Molecular dynamics|dynamic simulations]] of DNA.

===DNA structure===
The structure of [[DNA]] shows a variety of forms, both double-stranded and single-stranded. The mechanical properties of DNA, which are directly related to its structure, are a significant problem for [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Every process which binds or reads [[DNA]] is able to use or modify the mechanical properties of DNA for purposes of recognition, packaging and modification. The extreme length (a [[chromosome]] may contain a 10&amp;nbsp;cm long DNA strand), relative rigidity and helical structure of DNA has led to the [[evolution]] of [[histone]]s and of [[enzyme]]s such as [[topoisomerase]]s and [[helicase]]s to manage a cell's DNA. The properties of DNA are closely related to its molecular structure and sequence, particularly the weakness of the hydrogen bonds and electronic interactions that hold strands of DNA together compared to the strength of the bonds within each strand.

Experimental methods which can directly measure the mechanical properties of DNA are relatively new, and high-resolution visualization in solution is often difficult. Nevertheless, scientists have uncovered large amount of data on the mechanical properties of this polymer, and the implications of DNA's mechanical properties on cellular processes is a topic of active current research.

The DNA found in many cells can be macroscopic in length: a few centimetres long for each human chromosome. Consequently, cells must compact or ''package'' DNA to carry it within them. In [[eukaryote]]s this is carried by spool-like [[protein]]s named [[histone]]s, around which DNA winds. It is the further compaction of this DNA-protein complex which produces the well known mitotic eukaryotic [[chromosome]]s.

In the late 1970s, alternate [[non-helical models of DNA structure]] were briefly considered as a potential solution to problems in [[DNA replication]] in [[plasmid]]s and [[chromatin]].  However, the models were set aside in favor of the double-helical model due to subsequent experimental advances such as [[X-ray crystallography]] of DNA duplexes, and later the [[nucleosome core particle]], and the discovery of [[topoisomerase]]s. Such non-double-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stokes|first=T. D.|title=The double helix and the warped zipper—an exemplary tale|journal=Social Studies of Science|year=1982|volume=12|issue=2|pages=207–240|doi=10.1177/030631282012002002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gautham|first=N.|title=Response to "Variety in DNA secondary structure"|journal=Current Science|date=25 May 2004|volume=86|issue=10|pages=1352&amp;ndash;1353|url=http://cs-test.ias.ac.in/cs/Downloads/article_37537.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2012|quote=However, the discovery of topoisomerases took "the sting" out of the topological objection to the plectonaemic double helix. The more recent solution of the single crystal X-ray structure of the nucleosome core particle showed nearly 150 base pairs of the DNA (i.e. about 15 complete turns), with a structure that is in all essential respects the same as the Watson–Crick model. This dealt a death blow to the idea that other forms of DNA, particularly double helical DNA, exist as anything other than local or transient structures.}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nucleic acid structure determination}}

After DNA has been separated and purified by standard biochemical methods, one has a sample in a jar much like in the figure at the top of this article.  Below are the main steps involved in generating structural information from X-ray diffraction studies of oriented DNA fibers that are drawn from the hydrated DNA sample with the help of molecular models of DNA that are combined with crystallographic and mathematical analysis of the X-ray patterns.

==Paracrystalline lattice models of B-DNA structures==
[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Silica]] glass is another example of a material which is organized into a paracrystalline lattice.]]

A [[paracrystalline]] lattice, or paracrystal, is a molecular or atomic lattice with significant amounts (e.g., larger than a few percent) of partial disordering of molecular arrangements. Limiting cases of the paracrystal model are [[nanostructure]]s, such as [[glass]]es, [[liquid]]s, etc., that may possess only local ordering and no global order. A simple example of a paracrystalline lattice is shown in the following figure for a silica glass:

[[Liquid crystal]]s also have paracrystalline rather than [[crystal]]line structures.

Highly hydrated B-DNA occurs naturally in living cells in such a paracrystalline state, which is a dynamic one despite the relatively rigid DNA double helix stabilized by parallel hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide base-pairs in the two complementary, helical DNA chains (see figures). For simplicity most DNA molecular models omit both water and ions dynamically bound to B-DNA, and are thus less useful for understanding the dynamic behaviors of B-DNA ''in vivo''. The physical and mathematical analysis of X-ray&lt;ref&gt;Hosemann R., Bagchi R.N., ''Direct analysis of diffraction by matter'', North-Holland Publs., Amsterdam – New York, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baianu, I.C. |title=X-ray scattering by partially disordered membrane systems|journal=Acta Crystallogr.

The paracrystal model is also important for DNA technological applications such as [[DNA nanotechnology]]. Novel methods that combine X-ray diffraction of DNA with X-ray microscopy in hydrated living cells are now also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto Y, Shinohara K |title=Application of X-ray microscopy in analysis of living hydrated cells |journal=Anat.

Two-dimensional DNA junction arrays have been visualized by [[Atomic force microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mao |first=Chengde |author2=Sun, Weiqiong |author3=Seeman, Nadrian C. |date=16 June 1999 |title=Designed Two-Dimensional DNA Holliday Junction Arrays Visualized by Atomic Force Microscopy |journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume=121 |issue=23 |pages=5437–43 |doi=10.1021/ja9900398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Nomology]]" has been derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]], meaning "lawful", or in philosophy of science terms, "lawlike". It was [[Lee J. Cronbach|Cronbach]] and [[Paul E. Meehl|Meehl]]'s view of [[construct validity]] that in order to provide [[Scientific method|evidence]] that a [[Measurement|measure]] has construct validity, a nomological network has to be developed for its measure. &lt;ref name="Cronbach"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Cronbach |first=L.J. |last2= Meehl|first2= P.E. |year= 1955 |title = Construct validity in psychological tests |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=52 |pages=281-302 |doi=10.1037/h0040957 |pmid=13245896 |issue=4}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of a nomological network are:
* Must have at least two [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]s;
* [[Theory|Theoretical]] [[proposition]]s, specifying [[wikt:Special:Search/linkage|linkages]] between constructs: "As age increases, [[memory loss]] increases".
* [[Correspondence (mathematics)|Correspondence]] [[Operator (mathematics)|rule]]s, allowing a construct to be measured.  [[Operationalization]]: "Age" is measured by asking "how old are you?"
* [[Empiricism|Empirical]] constructs or variables that can actually be measured.  These are operationalized theoretical constructs.
* Empirical linkages: [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] before [[data]] collection. Empirical [[generalization]] after data collection.

Validity evidence based on '''nomological validity''' is a form of [[construct validity]]. It is the degree to which a construct behaves as it should within a system of related constructs (the nomological network).&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Liping |last2= Li |first2= Chan |last3= Zhu |first3=Dan |year= 2012 |title = A New Approach to Testing Nomological Validity and Its Application to a Second-Order Measurement Model of Trust |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Systems |volume=13 |issue=12 |url= http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol13/iss12/4 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''Pasch's theorem''', stated in 1882 by the German mathematician [[Moritz Pasch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pasch|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a result in [[plane geometry]] which cannot be derived from [[Euclid's postulates]].

==Statement==
The statement is as follows: {{math_theorem|name=Pasch's theorem|Given points {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, and {{mvar|d}} on a line, if it is known that the points are ordered as ({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}) and ({{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}}), then it is also true that ({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|d}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1969|p=179}} states the result in 12.274 but does not refer to it specifically as Pasch's theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;}} [Here, for example, ({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}) means that point {{mvar|b}} lies between points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|c}}.]

'''Pierre Dolbeault''' (October 10, 1924 – June 12, 2015) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]].

Dolbeault studied with [[Henri Cartan]] and graduated in 1944 from the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Paris]] in 1955 under the supervision of Cartan, with a dissertation titled ''Formes différentielles et cohomologie sur une variété analytique complexe''.

He taught in the 1950s at the [[University of Montpellier]] and the [[University of Bordeaux]], and later at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] ([[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]]). Together with [[Pierre Lelong]] and [[Henri Skoda]] he held an Analysis seminar in [[Paris]].

[[Dolbeault cohomology]] is named after him, and so is the [[Dolbeault cohomology#Dolbeault's theorem|Dolbeault theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3387">'''Plethystic substitution''' is a shorthand notation for a common kind of substitution in the [[Ring of symmetric functions|algebra of symmetric functions]] and that of [[Symmeric polynomial|symmetric polynomials]].  It is essentially basic substitution of variables, but allows for a change in the number of variables used.

==Definition==

The formal definition of plethystic substitution relies on the fact that the ring of symmetric functions &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_R(x_1,x_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; is generated as an ''R''-algebra by the power sum symmetric functions

&lt;math&gt;p_k=x_1^k+x_2^k+x_3^k+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

For any symmetric function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and any formal sum of monomials &lt;math&gt;A=a_1+a_2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;, the ''plethystic substitution'' f[A] is the formal series obtained by making the substitutions

&lt;math&gt;p_k \longrightarrow a_1^k+a_2^k+a_3^k+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

in the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a polynomial in the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'s.

==Examples==

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes the formal sum &lt;math&gt;X=x_1+x_2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f[X]=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can write &lt;math&gt;1/(1-t)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the formal sum &lt;math&gt;1+t+t^2+t^3+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;, and so the plethystic substitution &lt;math&gt;f[1/(1-t)]&lt;/math&gt; is simply the result of setting &lt;math&gt;x_i=t^{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; for each i.  That is,

&lt;math&gt;f\left[\frac{1}{1-t}\right]=f(1,t,t^2,t^3,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;.

Plethystic substitution can also be used to change the number of variables: if &lt;math&gt;X=x_1+x_2+\cdots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f[X]=f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding symmetric function in the ring &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric functions in ''n'' variables.

Several other common substitutions are listed below.  In all of the following examples, &lt;math&gt;X=x_1+x_2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y=y_1+y_2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; are formal sums.

*If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math&gt;f[tX]=t^d f(x_1,x_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math&gt;f[-X]=(-1)^d \omega f(x_1,x_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the well-known involution on symmetric functions that sends a [[Schur polynomial|Schur function]] &lt;math&gt;s_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; to the conjugate Schur function &lt;math&gt;s_{\lambda^\ast}&lt;/math&gt;.
*The substitution &lt;math&gt;S:f\mapsto f[-X]&lt;/math&gt; is the antipode for the [[Hopf algebra]] structure on the [[Ring of symmetric functions]].
*&lt;math&gt;p_n[X+Y]=p_n[X]+p_n[Y]&lt;/math&gt;
*The map &lt;math&gt;\Delta: f\mapsto f[X+Y]&lt;/math&gt; is the coproduct for the Hopf algebra structure on the ring of symmetric functions.
*&lt;math&gt;h_n\left[X(1-t)\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the alternating Frobenius series for the exterior algebra of the defining representation of the symmetric group, where &lt;math&gt;h_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complete homogeneous symmetric function of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;h_n\left[X/(1-t)\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the Frobenius series for the symmetric algebra of the defining representation of the symmetric group.

'''R. C. T. Lee''' ('''Lee Chia-Tung''' {{zh|c=李家同}}; born 1939 in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]), also known as '''Richard C. T. Lee''', received his B.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering of [[National Taiwan University]] and Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [[University of California, Berkeley]].

He worked for NCR from 1963 to 1964 after he got his M.S. degree. After getting his Ph.D. degree, he joined National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland in 1967 and later worked in Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. in 1974.

He returned to Taiwan in 1975 and started his teaching career in National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. In this university, he had been the chairperson of Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical Engineering. In 1984, after he became the Dean of College of Engineering and in 1988, he was appointed as the Provost. In 1994, he was the Acting President of National Tsing Hua University. From 1994 to 1999, he was the President of Providence University in Shalu, Taiwan and in 1999, he was the President of National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan. He is now a professor of Chi Nan University under the joint appointment of four departments: the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Information Management, the Department of Communication and the Department of Medical Science.

Professor Lee has published roughly 80 papers, all in prestigious academic journals. He has been editors for ten journals. In 1989, he became an IEEE fellow. He received the Distinguished Research Awards from the National Science Council, Republic of China, five times and the Ministry of Education Engineering Academic Achievement Award in 1989. He is a Micronix Chair Professor. Professor Lee and R.C.Chang coauthored the book “Symbolic Logic and Mechanical Theorem Proving” which was published by Academic Press in 1973. This book was translated into Japanese, Russian and Italian. In 2005, McGraw-Hill published his “Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, a Strategic Approach”, which he coauthored with  S.S. Tseng, R.C. Chang and Y.T.Tsai. In addition to publishing technical papers, Professor Lee has also been an author of short stories. His four books, “Let the Wall Come Down”, “The Stranger”, “The Curtain Never Falls” and “The Bell Rings Again” have been all popular in Taiwan. “Let the Wall Come Down” has been sold more than 300,000 copies within a short period of seven years. He also published a book advising young people to pay attention to basics, entitled “Let Us Go Back to Basics”.
Lee is a professor of both the Computer Science and Information Engineering Department and Information Management Department of [[National Chi Nan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Author/592328/richard-c-t-lee | title=Richard C.

: &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{\alpha+\sum_{i=0}^k \beta_ix_{n-i}}{A+\sum_{i=0}^k B_ix_{n-i}}~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the initial conditions &lt;math&gt;x_{0}, x_{-1},\dots, x_{-k}&lt;/math&gt; are such that the denominator  never vanishes for any {{mvar|n}}.

==First-order rational difference equation==
A '''first-order rational difference equation''' is a nonlinear [[difference equation]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt;w_{t+1} = \frac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}.&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d&lt;/math&gt; and the initial condition &lt;math&gt;w_{0}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, this difference equation is called a '''Riccati difference equation'''.&lt;ref name="Ladas-Kulenovic"/&gt;

Such an equation can be solved by writing &lt;math&gt;w_t&lt;/math&gt; as a nonlinear transformation of another variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; which itself evolves linearly.  Then standard methods can be used to solve the [[linear difference equation]] in &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;.

== Solving a first-order equation==

===First approach===

One approach &lt;ref&gt;Brand, Louis, "A sequence defined by a difference equation," ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' '''62''', September 1955, 489&amp;ndash;492.   [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2307362  online]&lt;/ref&gt; to developing the transformed variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;ad-bc \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, is to write
: &lt;math&gt;y_{t+1}= \alpha - \frac{\beta}{y_t}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (a+d)/c&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\beta = (ad-bc)/c^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;w_t = y_t -d/c&lt;/math&gt;.

Further writing  &lt;math&gt;y_t = x_{t+1}/x_t&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to yield
: &lt;math&gt;x_{t+2} - \alpha x_{t+1} + \beta x_t =0. &lt;/math&gt;

===Second approach===

This approach &lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Douglas W., "An analytic Riccati solution for two-target discrete-time control," ''[[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]'' 24, 2000, 615&amp;ndash;622.&lt;/ref&gt;  gives a first-order difference equation for &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; instead of a second-order one, for the case in which &lt;math&gt;(d-a)^{2}+4bc&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.  Write  &lt;math&gt;x_t = 1/(\eta + w_t)&lt;/math&gt;  implying &lt;math&gt;w_t = (1- \eta x_t)/x_t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\eta = (d-a+r)/2c&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{(d-a)^{2}+4bc}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; evolves according to

: &lt;math&gt;x_{t+1} =\left( \frac{d-\eta c}{\eta c+a}\right)x_t + \frac{c}{\eta c+a}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Third approach===

The equation

: &lt;math&gt;w_{t+1} = \frac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}&lt;/math&gt;

can also be solved by treating it as a special case of the [[Matrix difference equation#Nonlinear matrix difference equations: Riccati equations|more general matrix equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t+1} = -(E+BX_t)(C+AX_t)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where all of ''A, B, C, E,'' and ''X'' are ''n''×''n'' matrices (in this case ''n''=1); the  solution of this is&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. F., and Ammar, G., "The geometry of the matrix Riccati equation and associated eigenvalue method," in Bittani, Laub, and Willems (eds.), ''The Riccati Equation'', Springer-Verlag, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t}=N_tD_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} N_{t} \\ D_{t}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -B &amp; -E \\ A &amp; C \end{pmatrix}^t\begin{pmatrix} X_0\\ I \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

It was shown in &lt;ref&gt;Balvers, Ronald J., and Mitchell, Douglas W., "Reducing the dimensionality of linear quadratic control problems," ''[[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]'' 31, 2007, 141&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; that a dynamic [[matrix Riccati equation]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt; H_{t-1} = K +A'H_tA - A'H_tC(C'H_tC)^{-1}C'H_tA, &lt;/math&gt;

which can arise in some [[discrete-time]] [[optimal control]] problems, can be solved using the second approach above if the matrix ''C'' has only one more row than column.

The '''Rayleigh–Ritz method''' is a method of finding approximations to eigenvalue equations that cannot be solved easily (or at all) analytically. The name is a common misnomer used to describe the method that is more appropriately termed the [[Ritz method]] or the [[Galerkin method]].  This method was invented by [[Walter Ritz]] in 1909, but it bears some similarity to the [[Rayleigh quotient]] and so the misnomer persists.

== Description of method ==
The '''Rayleigh–Ritz method''' allows for the computation of Ritz pairs &lt;math&gt;(\tilde{\lambda}_i,\tilde{\textbf{x}}_i)&lt;/math&gt; which approximate the solutions to the eigenvalue problem&lt;ref name="TrefethenIII1997" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A \textbf{x} = \lambda \textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N} &lt;/math&gt;.

The procedure is as follows:&lt;ref name="SchofieldChelikowsky2012" /&gt;
# Compute an orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt; V \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times m} &lt;/math&gt; approximating the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors#eigenspace and spectrum|eigenspace]] corresponding to ''m'' eigenvectors
# Compute &lt;math&gt; R \gets V^* A V &lt;/math&gt;
# Compute the eigenvalues of R solving &lt;math&gt; R \mathbf{v}_i = \tilde{\lambda}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;
# Form the Ritz pairs &lt;math&gt;(\tilde{\lambda}_i,\tilde{\textbf{x}}_i) = (\tilde{\lambda}_i,V \textbf{v}_i)&lt;/math&gt;

One can always compute the accuracy of such an approximation via &lt;math&gt; \| A \tilde{\textbf{x}}_i - \tilde{\lambda}_i \tilde{\textbf{x}}_i\|&lt;/math&gt;

If a [[Krylov subspace]] is used and A is a general matrix, then this is the [[Arnoldi iteration#Finding eigenvalues with the Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi algorithm]].

=== The method in calculus of variations  ===
In this technique, we approximate the [[variational method|variational]] problem and end up with a finite dimensional problem. So let us start with the problem of seeking a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; that extremizes an integral &lt;math&gt;I[y(x)]&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that we are able to approximate y(x) by a linear combination of certain linearly independent functions of the type:

&lt;math&gt;y(x)\approx \varphi_0 (x) + c_1 \varphi_1 (x) + c_2 \varphi_2 (x)+ \cdots + c_N \varphi_N (x)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''&lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt;''''' are constants to be determined by a variational method, such as one which will be described below.

The selection of which approximating functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i (x)&lt;/math&gt; to use is arbitrary except for the following considerations:

'''a)''' If the problem has [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] such as fixed end points, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0 (x)&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to satisfy the problem’s boundary conditions, and all other &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i (x)&lt;/math&gt; vanish at the boundary.

'''b)''' If the form of the solution is known, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i (x)&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen so that &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; will have that form.

The expansion of &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of approximating functions replaces the variational problem of extremising the functional integral &lt;math&gt;I[y(x)]&lt;/math&gt; to a problem of finding a set of constants &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt; that extremizes &lt;math&gt;I(c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N)&lt;/math&gt;. We can now solve this by setting the partial derivatives to zero. For each value of i,

&lt;math&gt;{\partial I \over \partial c_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The procedure is to first determine an initial estimate of &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; by the approximation &lt;math&gt;y(x)\approx \varphi_0 (x) + c_1 \varphi_1 (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Next, the approximation &lt;math&gt;y(x)\approx \varphi_0 (x) + c_1 \varphi_1 (x) + c_2 \varphi_2 (x)&lt;/math&gt; is used (with &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; being redetermined). The process continues with &lt;math&gt;y(x)\approx \varphi_0 (x) + c_1 \varphi_1 (x) + c_2 \varphi_2 (x)+ c_3 \varphi_3 (x)&lt;/math&gt; as the third approximation and so on. At each stage the following two items are true:
# At the ith stage, the terms &lt;math&gt;c_1,\cdots,c_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; are redetermined
# The approximation at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; stage &lt;math&gt;y(x)\approx \varphi_0 (x) + c_1 \varphi_1 (x) + \cdots + c_i \varphi_i (x)&lt;/math&gt;  will be no worse than the approximation at the &lt;math&gt;(i-1)^{th}&lt;/math&gt; stage

Convergence of the procedure means that as i tends to infinity, the approximation will tend towards the exact function &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; that extremizes an integral &lt;math&gt;I[y(x)]&lt;/math&gt;.

In many cases one uses a complete set of functions e. g. [[polynomial]]s or sines and [[Law of cosines|cosines]]. A set of functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i (x)&lt;/math&gt; is called complete over [a, b] if for each [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] integrable function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a set of values of coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt; that reproduces &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The above outlined procedure can be extended to cases with more than one independent variable.

== Applications in mechanical engineering ==
The Rayleigh–Ritz method is often used in [[mechanical engineering]] for finding the approximate real [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of multi [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] systems, such as [[spring mass system]]s or [[flywheel]]s on a shaft with varying [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. It is an extension of Rayleigh's method. It can also be used for finding buckling loads and post-buckling behaviour for columns.

Consider the case whereby we want to find the resonant frequency of oscillation of a system. First, write the oscillation in the form,

&lt;math&gt;y(x,t)=Y(x)\cos\omega t&lt;/math&gt;

with an unknown mode shape &lt;math&gt;Y(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Next, find the total energy of the system, consisting of a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term. The kinetic energy term involves the square of the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;y(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and thus gains a factor of &lt;math&gt;\omega ^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can calculate the total energy of the system and express it in the following form:

&lt;math&gt;E=T+V\equiv A[Y(x)] \omega^2\sin^2 \omega t + B[Y(x)] \cos^2 \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of energy, the average kinetic energy must be equal to the average potential energy. Thus,

&lt;math&gt;\omega^2=\frac{B[Y(x)]}{A[Y(x)]}=R[Y(x)]&lt;/math&gt;

which is also known as the [[Rayleigh quotient]]. Thus, if we knew the mode shape &lt;math&gt;Y(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we would be able to calculate &lt;math&gt;A[Y(x)]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B[Y(x)]&lt;/math&gt;, and in turn get the eigenfrequency. However, we do not yet know the mode shape. In order to find this, we can approximate &lt;math&gt;Y(x)&lt;/math&gt; as a combination of a few approximating functions &lt;math&gt;Y_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Y(x)=\sum_{i=1}^N c_iY_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt; are constants to be determined. In general, if we choose a random set of &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt;, it will describe a superposition of the actual eigenmodes of the system. However, if we seek &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt; such that the eigenfrequency &lt;math&gt;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; is minimised, then the mode described by this set of &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_N&lt;/math&gt; will be close to the lowest possible actual eigenmode of the system. Thus, this finds the lowest eigenfrequency. If we find eigenmodes orthogonal to this approximated lowest eigenmode, we can approximately find the next few eigenfrequencies as well.

In general, we can express &lt;math&gt;A[Y(x)]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B[Y(x)]&lt;/math&gt; as a collection of terms quadratic in the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;B[Y(x)]=\sum_i\sum_j c_i c_jK_{ij}=\bf{c^T K c}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A[Y(x)]=\sum_i\sum_j c_i c_jM_{ij}=\bf{c^T M c}&lt;/math&gt;

The minimization of &lt;math&gt;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \omega^2 \over \partial c_i}={\partial \over \partial c_i}\frac{\bf{c^T K c}}{\bf{c^T M c}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this,

&lt;math&gt;\bf{c^T M c}{\partial \bf{c^T K c} \over \partial c}-\bf{c^T K c}{\partial \bf{c^T M c} \over \partial c}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bf{K c}-\frac{\bf{c^T K c}}{\bf{c^T M c}}\bf{M c}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bf{K c}-\omega^2\bf{M c}=0&lt;/math&gt;

For a non-trivial solution of c, we require determinant of the matrix coefficient of c to be zero.

&lt;math&gt;\det({\bf{K}-\omega^2\bf{M}})=0&lt;/math&gt;

This gives a solution for the first N eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system, with N being the number of approximating functions.

== Simple case of double spring-mass system ==
The following discussion uses the simplest case, where the system has two lumped springs and two lumped masses, and only two mode shapes are assumed. Hence ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

A [[mode shape]] is assumed for the system, with two terms, one of which is weighted by a factor&amp;nbsp;''B'', e.g. ''Y'' =&amp;nbsp;[1,&amp;nbsp;1]&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''[1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1].
[[Simple harmonic motion]] theory says that the [[velocity]] at the time when deflection is zero, is the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; times the deflection (y) at time of maximum deflection. In this example the [[kinetic energy]] (KE) for each mass is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\omega^2 Y_1^2 m_1&lt;/math&gt; etc., and the [[potential energy]] (PE) for each [[Spring (device)|spring]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} k_1 Y_1^2&lt;/math&gt; etc.

We also know that without damping, the maximal KE equals the maximal PE. Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^2 \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 Y_i^2 M_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^2 \left(\frac{1}{2} K_i Y_i^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the overall amplitude of the mode shape cancels out from each side, always. That is, the actual size of the assumed deflection does not matter, just the mode ''shape''.

Mathematical manipulations then obtain an expression for &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, in terms of B, which can be [[derivative|differentiated]] with respect to B, to find the minimum, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;d\omega/dB=0&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the value of B for which &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is lowest. This is an upper bound solution for &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is hoped to be the predicted fundamental frequency of the system because the mode shape is ''assumed'', but we have found the lowest value of that upper bound, given our assumptions, because B is used to find the optimal 'mix' of the two assumed mode shape functions.

There are many tricks with this method, the most important is to try and choose realistic assumed mode shapes. For example, in the case of [[beam deflection]] problems it is wise to use a deformed shape that is analytically similar to the expected solution.  A [[quartic function|quartic]] may fit most of the easy problems of simply linked beams even if the order of the deformed solution may be lower. The springs and masses do not have to be discrete, they can be continuous (or a mixture), and this method can be easily used in a [[spreadsheet]] to find the natural frequencies of quite complex distributed systems, if you can describe the distributed KE and PE terms easily, or else break the continuous elements up into discrete parts.

This method could be used iteratively, adding additional mode shapes to the previous best solution, or you can build up a long expression with many Bs and many mode shapes, and then differentiate them [[partial differentiation|partially]].

{{For|a list of equations for second moments of area of standard shapes|List of second moments of area}}

The '''2nd moment of area''', also known as '''moment of inertia of plane area''', '''area moment of inertia''', or '''second area moment''', is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for an axis that lies in the plane or with a &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; for an axis perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, it is calculated with a [[multiple integral]] over the object in question. Its dimension is L (length) to the fourth power.   Its [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension when working with the [[International System of Units]] is meters to the fourth power, [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or inches to the fourth power, [[inch|in]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, when working in the [[Imperial units|Imperial System of Units]].

In [[structural engineering]], the second moment of area of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] is an important property used in the calculation of the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the calculation of stress caused by a moment applied to the beam. The '''planar''' second moment of area provides insight into a beam's resistance to bending due to an applied moment, force, or distributed load perpendicular to its neutral axis, as a function of its shape. The '''polar''' second moment of area provides insight into a beam's resistance to torsional deflection, due to an applied moment parallel to its cross-section, as a function of its shape. 

: '''''Note:''' Different disciplines use the term ''moment of inertia'' (''MOI'') to refer to different moments. It may refer to either of the '''planar''' second moments of area (often &lt;math&gt; I_x = \textstyle\iint_{R} x^2\, \mathrm{d}A \text{ or } I_y = \textstyle\iint_{R} y^2&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to some reference plane), or the '''polar''' second moment of area (&lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\iint_{R} r^2\, \mathrm{d}A &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some reference axis).  In each case the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''area'', dA, in some two-dimensional cross-section.  In physics, ''moment of inertia'' is strictly the second moment of '''mass''' with respect to distance from an axis: &lt;math&gt; I = \textstyle\int_{Q} r^2 \mathrm{d}m &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some potential rotation axis, and the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''mass'', dm, in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|Q}}.  The MOI, in this sense, is the analog of mass for rotational problems. In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), ''moment of inertia'' commonly refers to the second moment of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=471|quote=The term second moment is more proper than the term moment of inertia, since, logically, the latter should be used only to denote integrals of mass (see Sec. 9.11). In engineering practice, however, moment of inertia is used in connection with areas as well as masses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Definition==
[[File:Moment of area of an arbitrary shape.svg|thumb|175px|An arbitrary shape.  ''ρ'' is the radial distance to the element d''A'', with projections ''x'' and ''y'' on the axes.]]

The second moment of area for an arbitrary shape&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}} with respect to an arbitrary axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;J_{BB'} = \iint\limits_{R} {\rho}^2 \, \mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; is the differential area of the arbitrary shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the axis &lt;math&gt;BB'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkey|first1=Walter D.|title=Analysis and Design of Elastic Beams|page=15|date=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=978-0-471-38152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the desired reference axis is the x-axis, the second moment of area &lt;math&gt;I_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; (often denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt;) can be computed in [[Cartesian coordinates]] as

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x} = \iint\limits_{R} y^2\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

The second moment of the area is crucial in [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation|Euler–Bernoulli theory]] of slender beams.

=== Product moment of area ===
More generally, the '''product moment of area''' is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=495|chapter=Chapter 9.8: Product of inertia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{xy} = \iint\limits_{R} yx\, \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

== Parallel axis theorem ==
[[File:Parallel axis theorem.svg|thumb|175px|A shape with centroidal axis ''x''. The parallel axis theorem can be used to obtain the second moment of area with respect to the ''x''' axis.]]
{{Main article|Parallel axis theorem}}

It is sometimes necessary to calculate the second moment of area of a shape with respect to an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis different to the centroidal axis of the shape. However, it is often easier to derive the second moment of area with respect to its centroidal axis, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and use the parallel axis theorem to derive the second moment of area with respect to the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis. The parallel axis theorem states

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x'} = I_x + A d^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the shape, and
: &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular distance between the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axes.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbeler, R. C. (2004). Statics and Mechanics of Materials (Second ed.). Pearson Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-028127-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=481|chapter=Chapter 9.6: Parallel-axis theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statement can be made about a &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; axis and the parallel centroidal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. Or, in general, any centroidal &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; axis and a parallel &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; axis.

== Perpendicular axis theorem ==
{{Main article|Perpendicular axis theorem}}
For the simplicity of calculation, it is often desired to define the polar moment of area  (with respect to a perpendicular axis) in terms of two area moments of inertia (both with respect to in-plane axes). The simplest case relates &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = \iint\limits_{R} \rho^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} \left(x^2 + y^2\right)\,\mathrm{d}A = \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A + \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = I_x + I_y&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which relates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and on the [[linearity of integration]].

== Composite shapes ==
For more complex areas, it is often easier to divide the area into a series of "simpler" shapes. The second moment of area for the entire shape is the sum of the second moment of areas of all of its parts about a common axis. This can include shapes that are "missing" (i.e. holes, hollow shapes, etc.), in which case the second moment of area of the "missing" areas are subtracted, rather than added. In other words, the second moment of area of "missing" parts are considered negative for the method of composite shapes.

==Examples==
See [[list of second moments of area]] for other shapes.

===Rectangle with centroid at the origin===
[[File:Moment of area of a rectangle through the centroid.svg|thumb|175px|Rectangle with base ''b'' and height ''h'']]
Consider a rectangle with base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; whose [[centroid]] is located at the origin. &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the x-axis; &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the y-axis; &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; represents the polar moment of inertia with respect to the z-axis.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_x &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} y^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \frac{1}{3}\frac{h^3}{4}\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b h^3}{12} \\
  I_y &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} x^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} \int^\frac{h}{2}_{-\frac{h}{2}} x^2 \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = \int^\frac{b}{2}_{-\frac{b}{2}} h x^2\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{b^3 h}{12}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[second moment of area#Perpendicular axis theorem|perpendicular axis theorem]] we get the value of &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = I_x + I_y = \frac{b h^3}{12} + \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{b h}{12}\left(b^2 + h^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Annulus centered at origin===
[[File:Moment of area of an annulus.svg|thumb|175px|Annulus with inner radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and outer radius ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'']]

Consider an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose center is at the origin, outside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;, and inside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the symmetry of the annulus, the centroid also lies at the origin. We can determine the polar moment of inertia, &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;, about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis by the method of composite shapes. This polar moment of inertia is equivalent to the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; minus the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, both centered at the origin.  First, let us derive the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the origin.  In this case, it is easier to directly calculate &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; as we already have &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt;, which has both an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component.  Instead of obtaining the second moment of area from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as done in the previous section, we shall calculate &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; directly using [[polar coordinates]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_{x, circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} y^2\,dA = \iint\limits_{R} (r\sin{\theta)}^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r (r\sin{\theta})^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) \\
                &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\sin^2{\theta}\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4\sin^2{\theta}}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}r^4 \\
  J_{z,circle} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
               &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4}{4}\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}r^4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the polar moment of inertia about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis for an annulus is simply, as stated above, the difference of the second moments of area of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; and a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;J_z = J_{z, r_2} - J_{z, r_1} = \frac{\pi}{2}r_2^4 - \frac{\pi}{2}r_1^4 = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could change the limits on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}r&lt;/math&gt; integral the first time around to reflect the fact that there is a hole.  This would be done like this.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  J_{z} &amp;= \iint\limits_{R} r^2\,\mathrm{d}A = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^2\left(r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^3\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \\
        &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{r_2^4}{4} - \frac{r_1^4}{4}\right]\,\mathrm{d}\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Any polygon===

[[File:Moment of area of a polygon.svg|thumb|175px|A simple polygon]]

The second moment of area for any [[simple polygon]] on the XY-plane can be computed in general by summing contributions from each segment of the polygon after essentially chopping the area up into a set of triangles.
A polygon is assumed to have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, numbered in counter-clockwise fashion. If polygon vertices are numbered clockwise, returned values will be negative, but absolute values will be correct.

'''Attention, the following formulae must be trusted'''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     I_x &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i^2 + y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \\
     I_y &amp;= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2 \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i\right) \\
  I_{xy} &amp;= \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i y_{i+1} + 2 x_i y_i + 2 x_{i+1} y_{i+1} + x_{i+1} y_i \right) \left( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
{{Citation needed|reason=These formulae must be checked|date=September 2018}}

where &lt;math&gt;x_i,y_i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th polygon vertex, for &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be equal to the coordinates of the first vertex, i.e., &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1} = y_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Slewing''' is the [[rotation]] of an object around an axis, usually the [[z axis]]. An example is a [[radar]] scanning 360 degrees by slewing around the z axis. This is also common terminology in astronomy. The process of rotating a telescope to observe a different region of the sky is referred to as slewing.

The term slewing is also found in motion control applications.  Often the slew axis is combined with other axis to form a motion profile.

In [[Crane (machine)|crane]] terminology, slewing is the angular movement of a crane boom or crane jib in a horizontal plane.

The term is also used in the [[computer game]] [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]] wherein the user presses a key and he or she can rotate and move the virtual aircraft along all [[Three-dimensional space|three spatial planes]].

In the modern day use of CNC programs, ''slewing'' is a vital part of the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5313">In [[mathematics]], a '''sub-Riemannian manifold''' is a certain type of generalization of a [[Riemannian manifold]]. Roughly speaking, to measure distances in a sub-Riemannian manifold, you are allowed to go only along curves tangent to so-called ''horizontal subspaces''.
 
Sub-Riemannian manifolds (and so, ''a fortiori'', Riemannian manifolds) carry a natural [[intrinsic metric]] called the '''metric of Carnot–Carathéodory'''. The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of such [[metric space]]s is always an [[integer]] and larger than its [[topological dimension]] (unless it is actually a Riemannian manifold).

Sub-Riemannian manifolds often occur in the study of constrained systems in [[classical mechanics]], such as the motion of vehicles on a surface, the motion of robot arms, and the orbital dynamics of satellites. Geometric quantities such as the [[Berry phase]] may be understood in the language of sub-Riemannian geometry. The [[Heisenberg group]], important to [[quantum mechanics]], carries a natural sub-Riemannian structure.

==Definitions==

By a ''distribution'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; we mean a [[subbundle]] of the [[tangent bundle]] of  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Given a distribution &lt;math&gt;H(M)\subset T(M)&lt;/math&gt; a vector field in &lt;math&gt;H(M)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''horizontal'''. A curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''horizontal''' if  &lt;math&gt;\dot\gamma(t)\in H_{\gamma(t)}(M)&lt;/math&gt; for any 
&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

A distribution on &lt;math&gt;H(M)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''completely non-integrable''' if for any &lt;math&gt;x\in M&lt;/math&gt; we have that any tangent vector can be presented as a [[linear combination]] of vectors of the following types &lt;math&gt;A(x),\ [A,B](x),\ [A,[B,C]](x),\ [A,[B,[C,D]]](x),\dotsc\in T_x(M)&lt;/math&gt; where all vector fields &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D, \dots&lt;/math&gt; are horizontal.

A '''sub-Riemannian manifold''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;(M, H, g)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable [[manifold]], &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a ''completely non-integrable'' "horizontal" distribution and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth section of positive-definite [[quadratic form]]s on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

Any  '''sub-Riemannian manifold''' carries the natural [[intrinsic metric]], called the '''metric of Carnot–Carathéodory''', defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \inf\int_0^1 \sqrt{g(\dot\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))} \, dt,&lt;/math&gt;
where infimum is taken along all ''horizontal curves'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma: [0, 1] \to M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(1)=y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

A position of a car on the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for the location and an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which describes the orientation of the car. Therefore, the position of the car can be described by a point in a manifold 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2\times S^1.&lt;/math&gt;

One can ask, what is the minimal distance one should drive to get from one position to another? This defines a [[Carnot–Carathéodory metric]] on the manifold 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2\times S^1.&lt;/math&gt;

A closely related example of a sub-Riemannian metric can be constructed on a [[Heisenberg group]]: Take two elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; in the corresponding Lie algebra such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \alpha,\beta,[\alpha,\beta]\}&lt;/math&gt;

spans the entire algebra. The horizontal distribution &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; spanned by left shifts of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is ''completely non-integrable''. Then choosing any smooth positive quadratic form on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; gives a sub-Riemannian metric on the group.

==Properties==

For every sub-Riemannian manifold, there exists a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], called the '''sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian''', constructed out of the metric for the manifold. Conversely, every such quadratic Hamiltonian induces a sub-Riemannian manifold. The existence of geodesics of the corresponding [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s for the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian is given by the [[Chow–Rashevskii theorem]].

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Szekeres snark''' is a [[snark (graph theory)|snark]] with 50 [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and 75 edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Szekeres Snark|urlname=SzekeresSnark}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fifth known snark, discovered by [[George Szekeres]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szekeres, G.|authorlink=George Szekeres|title=Polyhedral decompositions of cubic graphs|journal=Bull.

Thrombodynamics is a method for blood [[coagulation]] monitoring and anticoagulant control. This test is based on imitation of coagulation processes occurring ''in vivo'', is sensitive both to pro- and anticoagulant changes in the hemostatic balance. Highly sensitive to thrombosis.

The method was developed in the Physical Biochemistry Laboratory under the direction of Prof. Fazly Ataullakhanov.

==Technology description==
[[File:Метод тромбодинамики и типичные фотографии роста сгустка.jpg|thumb|460px|Thrombodynamics analyser scheme]]

Thrombodynamics designed to investigate the ''in vitro'' spatial-temporal dynamics of blood coagulation initiated by localized coagulation activator under conditions similar to the conditions of the blood clotting'' in vivo''. Thrombodynamics takes into account the spatial heterogeneity trombodinamiki processes in blood coagulation. The test is performed without mixing in a thin layer of [[Blood plasma|plasma]].

The measurement cuvette with the blood plasma sample is placed inside the water thermostat. Clotting starts when activator with immobilized [[Tissue factor|TF]] is immersed into the cuvette. The clot then propagates from the activating surface into the bulk of plasma. Image of growing clot is registered via the CCD camera using a time-lapse microscopy mode in scattered light and then parameters of coagulation are calculated on the computer. Thrombodynamics analyser T-2 device also supports measurement of spatial dynamics of thrombin propagation during the process of clot growth via usage of the fluorogenic substrate for thrombin. Blood plasma sample is periodically irradiated with the excitation light and the emission of the fluorophore is registered by CCD camera.

Mathematical methods are used to restore spatio-temporal distribution of the thrombin from the fluorophore signal. This experimental model worked well in research and has demonstrated good sensitivity to various disorders of the coagulation system.

In [[statistics]], the '''uncertainty coefficient''', also called '''proficiency''', '''entropy coefficient''' or '''Theil's U''', is a measure of nominal [[Association (statistics)|association]].  It was first introduced by [[Henri Theil]]{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and is based on the concept of [[information entropy]].

==Definition==
Suppose we have samples of two discrete random variables, ''X'' and ''Y''.  By constructing the joint distribution, {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;X,Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')}}, from which we can calculate the [[conditional probability distribution|conditional distributions]], {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''X''{{!}}''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''{{!}}''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P&lt;sub&gt;X,Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')/''P&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y'')}} and {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''{{!}}X&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''{{!}}''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P&lt;sub&gt;X,Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')/''P&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}}, and calculating the various entropies, we can determine the degree of association between the two variables.

The entropy of a single distribution is given as:
&lt;ref name="Shannon_Weaver1963"&gt;
{{cite book
|author1=Claude E. Shannon
|author2=Warren Weaver
|year=1963
|title=[[The Mathematical Theory of Communication]]
|publisher=University of Illinois Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H(X)= -\sum_x P_X(x) \log P_X(x) ,
&lt;/math&gt;

while the [[conditional entropy]] is given as:&lt;ref name="Shannon_Weaver1963"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H(X|Y) = -\sum_{x,~y} P_{X,Y}(x,~y) \log P_{X|Y}(x|y) .
&lt;/math&gt;

The uncertainty coefficient&lt;ref name="Press_etal1992"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
U(X|Y) = \frac{H(X)-H(X|Y)}{H(X)} = \frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X)} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

and tells us: given ''Y'', what fraction of the bits of ''X'' can we predict? (The above expression makes clear that the uncertainty coefficient is a normalised [[mutual information]] ''I(X;Y)''.) In this case we can think of ''X'' as containing the "true" values. 
Note that the value of ''U'' (but not ''H''!) is independent of the base of the ''log'' since all logarithms are proportional.

The uncertainty coefficient is useful for measuring the validity of a statistical classification algorithm and has the advantage over simpler accuracy measures such as [[precision and recall]] in that it is not affected by the relative fractions of the different classes, i.e., ''P''(''x'')

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also has the unique property that it won't penalize an algorithm for predicting the wrong classes, so long as it does so consistently (i.e., it simply rearranges the classes). This is useful in evaluating [[Cluster analysis#Clustering_algorithms|clustering algorithms]] since cluster labels typically have no particular ordering.&lt;ref name=JimWhite/&gt;

==Variations==
The uncertainty coefficient is not symmetric with respect to the roles of ''X'' and ''Y''. The roles can be reversed and a symmetrical measure thus defined as a weighted average between the two:&lt;ref name="Press_etal1992"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(X,~Y) &amp; = \frac{H(X)U(X|Y)+H(Y)U(Y|X)}{H(X)+H(Y)} \\[8pt]
&amp; = 2 \left [\frac{H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,~Y)}{H(X)+H(Y)} \right ] .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Although normally applied to discrete variables, the uncertainty coefficient can be extended to continuous variables&lt;ref name="Shannon_Weaver1963"/&gt; using [[density estimation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[File:Heliographic_copy.jpg|thumb|Whiteprint plan copy.]]
'''Whiteprint''' describes a document reproduction produced by using the [[diazo]] chemical process. It is also known as the '''blue-line process''' since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the [[blueprint]] process for reproducing architectural and [[engineering drawing]]s because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but  a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642801/whiteprint Blueprints replaced by whiteprints]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The diazo printing process==
There are two components in this process:
# [[Diazonium compound|diazonium salt]]: a light sensitive chemical
# [[Azo dye]] (also known as the coupler): a colorless chemical that combines with the salt to produce color.

In a variety of combinations and strengths, these two chemicals are mixed together in water and coated onto [[paper]]. The resulting coating is then dried yielding the specially treated paper commercially sold as Diazo paper. This solution can also be applied to [[polyester]] film or to [[vellum]].

The process starts with original documents that have been created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, [[vellum]]s, linens, and translucent [[bond paper]]s (bonds). Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, the intensity of the [[ultraviolet|UV]] exposure light is adjusted using an intensity knob typically pre-marked for media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.

The original document is laid on top of the chemically-coated side of a sheet of diazo paper, which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two sheets are fed into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the diazo paper) pass in front of an [[ultraviolet]] lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light sensitive diazonium salt wherever there was no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase.

Next, the original is peeled from the diazo paper as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is fed into the developing chamber. Here, fumes of [[ammonium hydroxide]] create an extremely [[alkaline]] environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but [[Sepia (color)|sepia]] (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original no more than four or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of [[ammonia]] fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room.  A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists.  Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to outside.   Smaller and mid-size blueprint machines were often outfitted with neutralizers which absorbed some of the ammonia for a period of time.

If the lines are too light, it is also possible to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media.  Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia.  Sometimes both the master and the diazo print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the diazo paper and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines.

Diazo printing was one of the most economic methods to reproduce large engineering and architectural drawings.

==Fading prints==
A quirk of diazo blueline prints is that with continued exposure to ultraviolet light, either from natural sunlight or from typical office fluorescent lighting, a blueline copy can fade over a span of months (indoors) or just days (outdoors), becoming illegible. This fading process thus requires reduplication of the original documents every few months in a typical office for any project using bluelines. Hence, blueline drawings that are used as engineering working copy prints have to be protected when not in use by storing them in flat files in the dark. [[Incandescent light]]ing was often used in areas where blueline engineering prints needed to be posted on a wall for long periods to hinder rapid fading.

Improperly exposed bluelines are more likely to fade at an increased rate since the chemical reaction in the ammonia phase continues until the process is completed. But also properly exposed bluelines should not be exposed to the elements, and bluelines kept in flat files or hanging on racks in a cool, dry room often retain the majority of their lines and are able to be subsequently scanned into a digital format for various purposes.

==Document control==
During the 20th century, elaborate color-coding schemes were somewhat standardized in each engineering shop for indicating changes to blueline drawings. For example, revisions could be shown by using contrasting color on the bluelines: red markup of a blueprint copy by the engineer, then yellow markup on the copy by the draftsman who implemented the changes on the original drawing, then brown markup by the checker on a check-print (a ''brown-line''). Finally, the architect or engineer, draftsman, checker and supervisor would sign the original drawing, making it a legal document.

An alternative revision scheme was to use red-lines to indicate additions, yellow-lines to indicate deletions, and green-line tracings for checking (e.g., to confirm conductivities or to add notes to draftsmen on how to make corrections), entered on the copies of blue-line prints that were under engineering control.

Whatever scheme was standardized in each shop had to be documented. Colored lines were entered on the blue-line drawing using colored pencils and identified there. Once the modification process was complete, the red-lined blue-line prints were taken to document control, where the original master was modified to reflect the changes made during the engineering process. New blue-line prints would then be made of the modified master, and the process continued in this iterative manner until completion of the project. The master drawing, incorporating all changes and including the authorizing signatures, was finally archived in a vault.

==Demise of the technology==
The blueline print process was largely abandoned within the architectural/engineering community around the early 2000s. Contributing factors were the development of computer aided drafting and printing, the speed of machine printing, and the introduction of larger [[Xerography|xerographic]] machines from companies like Ricoh and Xerox. The cost of blueline production materials and equipment, the fact that the prints themselves faded in sunlight, and the need to use the pungent chemical ammonia as a developer speeded up its replacement.
