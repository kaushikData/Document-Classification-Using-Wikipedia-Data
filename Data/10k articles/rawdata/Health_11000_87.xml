'''Aceso''' ({{lang-el|Ἀκεσώ}}) was the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess of the healing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/AsklepiasAkeso.html Aceso], on Theoi&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of [[Asclepius]] and [[Epione]], sister of [[Iaso]], [[Hygieia]], [[Panacea (Greek mythology)|Panacea]], and [[Aegle (mythology)|Aegle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Suidas s.v. Epione (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather was [[Apollo]]. Unlike her sister Panacea (Cure-All) she represented the process of a curing rather than the cure itself. Her male counterpart was Acesis (Akesis).&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Guy Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=Aceso+%22Aegle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKgCT8e8BJDUsgaPlITWDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Aceso%20%22Aegle%22&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''], Routledge, 2005, p.335&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek sculptural reliefs, Aceso appears alongside her father Asclepius and sisters Hygeia, Panacea and Iaso.

In the book, Whitaker tries to answer that question and examines the long-term outcomes for the mentally ill in the U.S.

==Synopsis==

===Magic bullets===
[[File:SSDI-SSI-1987-2003.png|thumb|right|alt=Chart showing increase (in red) over baseline (in blue) between 1987 and 2003|Number of Americans who received [[Social Security Disability Insurance|SSDI]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] for mental disability in 1987 (blue) when [[Eli Lilly and Company]] introduced the antidepressive drug [[Prozac]], compared to 2003 (red).]]
Whitaker begins by reviewing the discovery of [[typical antipsychotics|antipsychotics]], [[benzodiazepines]] and [[antidepressants]].  These were discovered as side effects during research for antihistamines (specifically [[promethazine]]), gram negative antibiotics (specifically [[mephenesin]]) and the anti-tuberculosis agents [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]] respectively. The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known at the time and these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of "euphoric quietude"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and psychic energizers (now antidepressants) due to patients "dancing in the wards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = Crown Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry bolstered by the 1951 [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]], giving physicians monopolistic prescribing rights thus aligning the interests of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. This also followed the industry's development of "magic bullets" that treat people with, for example, [[diabetes]], which according to Whitaker provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms. According to Whitaker's analysis of the primary literature, lower levels of serotonin and higher levels of dopamine "have proved to be true in patients WITH prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics (ie as homeostatic mechanisms) but NOT in patients without prior exposure."

Whitaker further criticizes the magic bullet theory by attacking the historical notion that the "invention of the antipsychotic [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]]" emptied the asylums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic: Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America|url=http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic_Psychiatric_Drugs_Rise_of_Mental_Illness.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry|publisher=Springer|page=1|issue=I|volume=7|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His case begins by showing that during the late 1940s and 1950s ~75% of cases admitted for first episode schizophrenia recovered to the community by approximately 3 years (Thorazine was not released until 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In fact, based on the only large scale first episode schizophrenia study of this era, 88% of those who were not treated were discharged within eighteen months compared to 74% of [[neuroleptic]] treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = L. Epstein| title = An approach to the effect of ataraxic drugs on hospital release rates| journal = American Journal of Psychiatry| volume = 119| pages = 36–47| year = 1962| pmid = 13890431|doi=10.1176/ajp.119.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is additionally evidenced by the fact that when Thorazine was introduced in 1955 there were 267 thousand schizophrenia patients in state and county mental hospitals, and eight years later, there were 253 thousand, thus indicating that the advent of neuroleptics barely budged the number of hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These programs provided federal subsidies for nursing home care but no such subsidy for care in state mental hospitals, and so the states, seeking to save money, began shipping their chronic patients to nursing homes.

===Psychiatric drugs===
Whitaker acknowledges that psychiatric medications do sometimes work but believes that they must be used in a "selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances. And honestly, they should be used on a short-term basis."&lt;ref name=Lipinski&gt;{{cite news|author=Lipinski, Jed|title="Anatomy of an Epidemic": The hidden damage of psychiatric drugs|date=April 27, 2010|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media|accessdate=October 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101002200623/http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic| archivedate= 2 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitaker traces the effects of what looks like an [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] epidemic:&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; the drugs that patients receive can perturb their normal brain function.&lt;ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"&gt;Whitaker, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitaker suggests that the "wonder drug" glow around the second generation psychotropics has long since disappeared. He views the "hyping" of the top-selling [[atypical antipsychotic]]s as "one of the more embarrassing episodes in psychiatry's history, as one government study after another failed to find that they were any better than the first-generation anti-psychotics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of an Epidemic |author=Robert Whitaker |year=2010 |publisher=Crown |page=303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Whitaker's solutions is the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in [[Tornio]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis, with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocates that those with depression engage in exercise.

===Children===
Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a ''lifetime'' of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a "cocktail" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child reaches the age of eighteen, Whitaker says the child often becomes a disabled adult.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of data and statistics==
Whitaker spent a year and a half researching for this book,&lt;ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"/&gt; and maintains a website listing some relevant studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and media coverage==
Whitaker did interviews with ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' during the release of this book.&lt;ref name=Lipinski /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Weintraub, Karen|title=The downside of meds|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/05/10/robert_whitaker_talks_about_the_downside_to_psychiatric_meds/|date=May 10, 2010|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did a book tour, and  he spoke for an hour and a half on [[C-SPAN]] where there is an archived video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Robert Whitaker|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/293935-1|date=April 22, 2010|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in his book he says that this story was never told in mainstream newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Whitaker says a study of long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia done by Martin Harrow in 2007 (which Whitaker thinks is the best work ever done on the subject in the U.S) was never in a [[National Institute of Mental Health]] press release and thus never reached reporters at U.S. newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by sleep researcher Dennis Rosen for ''The Boston Globe'' concludes that "although extensively researched and drawing upon hundreds of sources, the gaps in his theory remain too large for him to succeed in making a convincing argument", and compares Whitaker to [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[AIDS denialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosen, Dennis|title=Tying the rise in mental illness to drugs used in its treatment|date=April 14, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/04/14/tying_the_rise_in_mental_illness_to_drugs_used_in_its_treatment/|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews were in ''[[New Scientist]]'',&lt;ref name=Burch /&gt; ''[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]'',&lt;ref name=Good /&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick /&gt; and ''[[Salon.com|Salon]].&lt;ref name=Lipinski /&gt;

Over a year after the book was published, [[Marcia Angell]], former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', published a two-part review of Whitaker's and other books in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why?|date=June 23, 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/}} and {{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Illusions of Psychiatry|date=July 14, 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jul/14/illusions-of-psychiatry/|work=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received a great deal of publicity.

Daniel Carlat criticized the book as "confusing causation with correlation".  While Whitaker notes that the number of persons on federal disability in the U.S. has risen in synchrony with increased psychiatric drug use, Carlat argues that other factors have caused the rise in disability.  Among these is a larger number of disorders recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; that the greater number of treatments available incentives physicians to look for symptoms of disease; and that changes in federal disability regulations have encouraged more people to seek disability benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlat, Daniel J.|title=Robert Whitaker's Anatomy of an Epidemic: The Carlat Take |url=http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/01/robert-whitakers-anatomy-of-epidemic.html|date=Jan 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitaker, who had been an invited keynote speaker, was "uninvited" from the Alternatives 2010 conference. The event has been funded since 1985 by the Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. [[MindFreedom International]] started an online campaign and many people wrote to [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]. Whitaker was reinvited and delivered his address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What About Bob? USA Mental Health Agency May Cancel Journalist Robert B.

Whitaker presented his views at a psychiatric Grand Rounds at Massachusetts General Hospital on January 13, 2011, where his data and approach were critiqued by psychiatrist Andrew Nierenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Goldberg, Carey|title=Special Report: Do Psych Drugs Do More Long-Term Harm Than Good?|url=http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2011/01/19/whitaker-psychiatry-epidemic|date=Jan 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional criticism has come from psychiatrist and author [[Daniel Carlat]]. Whitaker has responded to critics on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Answering the Critics|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/answering-the-critics-of-anatomy-of-an-epidemic/|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Investigative Reporters and Editors]] (IRE) announced that the book had won its award as the best investigative journalism book of 2010 stating, "this book provides an in-depth exploration of medical studies and science and intersperses compelling anecdotal examples. In the end, Whitaker rejects the conventional wisdom of treatment of mental illness with drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ire.org/awards/ire-awards/winners/2010-ire-awards-winners/#book|title=IRE Awards 2010 |publisher=Investigative Reporters and Editors|accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Physicians for Humanism''' is a not for profit organisation of medical doctors in [[South Korea]] founded on 21 November 1987.  Chung Hyung-jun is the executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the world’s most tech-obsessed nation is resisting virtual doctor’s visits|url=https://qz.com/752609/why-the-worlds-most-tech-obsessed-nation-is-resisting-virtual-doctors-visits/|accessdate=1 December 2017|publisher=Quartz|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Measles Control Campaign''' was initiated in August 1998 as part of the [[World Health Organization]]'s global [[Measles]] eradication program, and in response to major epidemics in [[Australia]] throughout 1994/95, together with a report predicting another impending measles epidemic in Australia. The campaign vaccinated 1.78 million children, making it the largest national vaccination campaign conducted in Australia since the introduction of [[poliomyelitis]] vaccination in 1956.

The campaign was promoted using the slogan ''"Let's Work Together to Beat Measles"''&lt;ref name=Beat&gt;{{Citation

==The Campaign==
Following the World Health Organization's adoption of a 2010 target date for Global Measles eradication and the notation that a single dose vaccination strategy was ineffective, the Federal Health Department began investigating the options for a measles eradication campaign in Australia. In 1996 and 1997, [[Serology|seroserveys]] were conducted in [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]] to assess the current levels of measles immunity. Results indicated that there were "probably enough susceptible children in the South Australian population to support a measles epidemic". In November 1997, a workshop of experts was formed to discuss the logistical, funding and surveillance issues of a potential measles elimination campaign. The group concluded that the 2nd dose of [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] should be brought forward from 12 years to 4 years (in line with WHO recommendations), and that a school-based campaign be implemented.&lt;ref name=Beat/&gt; Three groups would be targeted for vaccination:
* Primary School children(5-12yrs): This group would be offered vaccination at school-based clinics, to be provided by two [[Registered Nurse]]s per school.
* Pre-school children (1-4yrs): Letters would be sent to the parents of all children who were overdue for their 1st dose of MMR, encouraging them to attend their GP for vaccination.
* High-School children (12-18yrs): A letter would be sent to all parents encouraging them to ensure their children had received two doses of MMR.

===Objectives===

* Cease measles-related morbidity and mortality, by interrupting indigenous transmission of measles
* Prevent reintroduction of measles until global eradication is achieved, by maintaining uniformly low levels of population susceptibility

===Statistics===
[[File:Graphs measles Australia 1991-2009.jpg|thumb|Measles morbidity in Australia, 1991-2009]]
* 1.7 million primary-school aged children vaccinated, representing 96% of children in this age group.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
* 800,000 pre-school children vaccinated.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
* 89 total adverse events ''(33% of which were [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]])'' representing 5.24 total adverse events per 100,000 doses.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
* Prevented an estimated 17,500 cases of measles.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
* Prevented an estimated 8 measles-related fatalities.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
* Total cost of the campaign was A$30,841,356.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;

===Results===

* Increase in measles immunity for 1-18 year-olds from 85% to 90%, and 6-12 year-olds (the target age group) from 84% to 96% (Assessed by [[Serology|seroservey]]).&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;&lt;ref name=Results&gt;{{Cite journal

== Advantages ==

While some exercises may require some type of equipment, the majority of bodyweight exercises require none. For those exercises that do require equipment, common items found in the household are usually sufficient (such as a bath towel for towel curls), or substitutes can usually be improvised (for example, using a horizontal tree branch to perform pull ups). Therefore, bodyweight exercises are convenient when travelling or on holiday, when access to a gym or specialised equipment may not be possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/resistance-training-health-benefits|title=Resistance training – health benefits|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Better Health Channel|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of bodyweight training is that there are no costs involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

As bodyweight exercises use the individual's own weight to provide the resistance for the movement, the weight being lifted is never greater than the weight of one's own body. Another disadvantage is that bodyweight training may be daunting to novices and seen to be too easy for experienced athletes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women, in general, also find it more difficult to do bodyweight exercises involving upper body strength and may be discouraged from undertaking these exercises in their fitness regimens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bodyweight exercise for older adults ==
Some bodyweight exercises have been shown to benefit not just the young, but the elderly as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamauchi|first=Junichiro|last2=Nakayama|first2=Satoshi|last3=Ishii|first3=Naokata|date=17 August 2009|title=Effects of bodyweight-based exercise training on muscle functions of leg multi-joint movement in elderly individuals|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1447-0594.2009.00530.x|journal=Geriatrics &amp; Gerontology International|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0594.2009.00530.x|issn=1444-1586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older people undertaking bodyweight exercises benefit through increased muscle mass, increased mobility, increased bone density, decreased depression and improved sleep habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujita|first=Eiji|last2=Takeshima|first2=Nobuo|last3=Kato|first3=Yoshiji|last4=Koizumi|first4=Daisuke|last5=Narita|first5=Makoto|last6=Nakamoto|first6=Hiroki|last7=Rogers|first7=Michael E.|date=2016-01-01|title=Effects of Body-weight Squat Training on Muscular Size, Strength and Balance Ability in Physically Frail Older Adults|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ijshs/14/0/14_201504/_article|journal=International Journal of Sport and Health Science|volume=14|pages=21–30|doi=10.5432/ijshs.201504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://growingstronger.nutrition.tufts.edu/growing_stronger.pdf|title=Growing stronger: Strength training for older adults|last=Seguin|first=Rebecca|last2=Epping|first2=Jacqueline|date=|year=2002|website=|publisher=Tufts University|access-date=|last3=Buchner|first3=David|last4=Bloch|first4=Rina|last5=Nelson|first5=Miriam}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that bodyweight training may assist in decreasing or even preventing cognitive decline as people age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the increased risk of falls seen in elderly people can be mitigated by bodyweight training. Exercises focusing on the legs and abdomen such as squats, lunges and step ups are recommended to increase leg and core strength and, in doing so, reduce fall risk.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutritionaustralia.org/national/resource/physical-activity-older-adults|title=Physical activity for older adults|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nutrition Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bodyweight exercises provide multi-directional movement that mimics daily activities, and can thus be preferable to using weight machines.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''bromate''' [[ion|anion]], BrO{{su|b=3|p=&amp;minus;}}, is a [[bromine]]-based [[oxyanion|oxoanion]]. A '''bromate''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains this ion. Examples of bromates include [[sodium bromate]], ({{chem|NaBrO|3}}), and [[potassium bromate]], ({{chem|KBrO|3}}).

Bromates are formed many different ways in municipal drinking water. The most common is the reaction of [[ozone]] and [[bromide]]:

: Br{{su|p=−}} + {{chem|O|3}} → BrO{{su|b=3|p=−}}

Electrochemical processes, such as [[chloralkali process|electrolysis of brine without a membrane]] operating to form [[hypochlorite]], will also produce bromate when bromide ion is present in the brine solution.

[[Photoactivation]] (sunlight exposure) will encourage liquid or gaseous bromine to generate bromate in bromide-containing water.

In laboratories bromates can be synthesized by dissolving {{chem|Br|2}} in a concentrated solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH). The following reactions will take place (via the intermediate creation of [[hypobromite]]):

:{{chem|Br|2}} + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Br{{su|p=−}} + BrO{{su|p=−}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

:3 BrO{{su|p=−}} → BrO{{su|b=3|p=−}} + 2 Br{{su|p=−}}

==Human health issues==
Bromate in drinking water is undesirable because it is a suspected human [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Bromate formation during ozonation==

Although few by-products are formed by ozonation, ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce bromate. Bromide can be found in sufficient concentrations in fresh water to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 ppb of bromate—the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA. Proposals to reduce bromate formation include: lowering the water pH below 6.0, limiting the doses of ozone, using an alternate water source with a lower bromide concentration, pretreatment with ammonia, and addition of small concentrations of chloramines prior to ozonation.&lt;ref&gt;Neemann, Jeff; Hulsey, Robert; Rexing, David; Wert, Eric (2004). “Controlling Bromate Formation During Ozonation with Chlorine and Ammonia.” ''Journal American Water Works Association.'' 96:2 (February) 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reservoir pollution==

On December 14, 2007, the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] (LADWP) announced that it would drain [[Silver Lake Reservoir]] and Elysian Reservoir due to bromate contamination. At the Silver Lake and Elysian reservoirs a combination of bromide from well water, chlorine, and sunlight had formed bromate. The decontamination took 4 months, discharging over {{convert|600|e6USgal|e6m3}} of contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa''' (COSECSA) is an independent body that fosters postgraduate education in surgery and provides surgical training throughout the region of East, Central and Southern [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosecsa.org&lt;/ref&gt; COSECSA delivers a common surgical training programme with a common examination and qualification.

COSECSA is a non-profit making body that currently operates in 12 countries in the sub-Saharan region: [[Burundi]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

== History ==
COSECSA grew out of the Association of Surgeons of East Africa (ASEA). ASEA was formally inaugurated in Nairobi, Kenya on 9 November 1950.  In 1996, in response to perceived inadequacies of surgical training in the region, the ASEA steering committee decided to create the College of Surgeons of East, Central &amp; Southern Africa (COSECSA).   These inadequacies were seen to be the limited capacity of university teaching hospitals' surgical training programmes, the increasing difficulty in accessing UK surgical training programmes at that time&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?is06100"&lt;/ref&gt; and the variability of training programmes from country to country.

The official inauguration of the College was held in Nairobi in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.health.go.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68"&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2001, at the first annual general meeting in Lusaka, Zambia the council of the college was elected by the foundation fellows.

== Training model ==
COSECSA has been described as a "college without walls." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/surgery-remains-the-neglected-stepchild-of-global-health-1.2282262|title=Surgery remains ‘the neglected stepchild of global health’|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Trainee surgeons undertake their clinical training in accredited hospitals under supervision of an accredited Trainer.  The academic component of the programme is delivered online, through a learning portal, and through workshops held throughout the region.  

== Academic structure ==
COSECSA has two programmes:
* The Membership: A certificate of competence in surgery at General Medical Officer Grade (minimum 2 years training).
* The Fellowship: A specialist qualification in General Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Urology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery, Plastic Surgery or Otorhinolaryngology (minimum 5 years training).
As of December 2017, COSECSA has graduated 261 specialist surgeons.  

==Members and fellows==
There are over 1,000 Members and Fellows of the college.

== Partner organisations ==
COSECSA has a long-standing collaboration programme with the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] and is a founding association of the Pan African Association of Surgeons.

A '''date rape drug''' is any drug that is an [[incapacitating agent]] which—when administered to another person—incapacitates the person and renders them vulnerable to a [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA), including [[rape]]. One of the most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim consumes a recreational drug such as [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] that was administered surreptitiously.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=0849398088|page=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other most common form of DFSA involves the non-surreptitiously-administered consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name=alcohol&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85513.php Alcohol Is Most Common 'Date Rape' Drug]. Medicalnewstoday.com. Retrieved on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the victims in these cases are drinking voluntarily which then makes them unable to make informed decisions and/or give consent.

==Frequency==
There is currently no comprehensive data on how frequently DFSA occurs with the use of surreptitious drug administration. The lack of data is due to the low report rate of assaults, and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15622794|last=Canadian Public Health Association |date= December 2004 |title=Rising Incidence of Hospital-reported Drug-facilitated Sexual Assault in a Large Urban Community in Canada: Retrospective Population-based Study  |journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=441 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected DFSAs in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 48 (4.1%) positive for GHB, 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs searched for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/jat/23.3.141| title = Prevalence of Drugs Used in Cases of Alleged Sexual Assault| journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 141–6| year = 1999| last1 = Elsohly | first1 = M. A.| last2 = Salamone | first2 = S. J. | pmid=10369321}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected DFSAs found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard Lawrence|title=Drugs of abuse: a reference guide to their history and use|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0313318077|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame. 

A three-year study in the UK detected sedatives or disinhibiting drugs that victims said they had not voluntarily taken in the urine of two percent of suspected DFSA victims. In 65% of the 1014 cases included in this study, testing could not be conducted within a time frame that would allow detection of GHB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18925334.400 Alcohol, not drugs, poses biggest date rape risk – health – January 7, 2006].

This study defined a "plausible drink spiking case" in such a way that cases where (a) patients believed that their drink had been spiked, and (b) lab tests showed agents that patients said they had not ingested would still be ruled out as plausible if the patient did not also (c) exhibit "signs and symptoms" that were considered "consistent with agents detected by laboratory screening."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Quigley | first1 = P. | last2 = Lynch | first2 = D.

==Documented date rape drugs==

The drug most commonly used to facilitate sexual assault is [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], consumed voluntarily. Practically any drug (administered openly or surreptitiously) that facilitates rape could be considered a date rape drug. Since the mid-1990s, the media and researchers have documented a new form of DFSA featuring date rape drugs such as [[rohypnol]] and [[ketamine]]. Other drugs used in DFSA include [[hypnotics]] such as [[zopiclone]], [[methaqualone]] and the widely available [[zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[sedatives]] such as [[neuroleptics]] (anti-psychotics), [[chloral hydrate]] and some [[Histamine h1 antagonists|histamine H1 antagonists]], common recreational drugs such as [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]], and less common [[anticholinergics]], [[barbiturates]], [[opioids]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiabeat.com/main/2011/05/13/scopolamine-colombias-date-rape-drug/|title=Scopolamine: Colombia’s Date Rape Drug|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; nasal spray ingredient [[oxymetazoline]],&lt;ref name="al. 232"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Christopher P.

=== Alcohol ===
{{see also|Alcohol and sex}}
Researchers agree that the most common form of DFSA is alcohol-related,&lt;ref name=alcohol /&gt; with the victim in most cases consuming the alcohol voluntarily. In most jurisdictions, alcohol is legal and readily available and is used in the majority of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="al. 232"/&gt; Many perpetrators use alcohol because their victims often willingly drink it, and can be encouraged to drink enough to lose inhibitions or consciousness. Sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most jurisdictions and some assailants have committed "rapes of convenience" whereby they assaulted a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much.&lt;ref&gt;[http://survive.org.uk/date-rape.html Date Rape]. Survive.org.uk (2000-03-20). Retrieved on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol consumption is known to have effects on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] and [[aggression]]. During social interactions alcohol consumption causes more biased appraisal of a partner’s sexual motives while impairing communication about and enhancing misperception of sexual intentions, effects exacerbated by peer influence about how to behave when drinking.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abbey|first=A|year=2002 |title=Alcohol-related sexual assault: A common problem among college students|pmid=12022717 |pmc=4484270|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=63|issue=2|pages=118–128 |url=http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/journal/118-abbey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of alcohol at the point of [[forced sex]] commonly include an impaired ability to rectify misperceptions, and a diminished ability to resist sexual advances and aggressive sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;

''[[Toledo Blade|The Blade]]'' released a special report, "The Making of an Epidemic," criticizing a study conducted in the 1990s that concluded that 55% of rape victims had been intoxicated. According to ''The Blade'', the study specifically ignored an Ohio statute that excluded "...situations where a person plies his intended partner with drink or drugs in hopes that lowered inhibition might lead to a liaison." The author of the study later admitted that the wording of the survey had been ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Blade, special report. "The Making of an Epidemic", p. 5. October 10, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol in campus rape====
{{main|Campus rape#Influence of alcohol}}

The increase of sexual assaults on college campuses has been attributed to the social expectations of students to participate in alcohol consumption; [[norm (social)|social norm]] dictate that students drink heavily and engage in casual sex.&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nicholson|first=M.E.|year=1998 |title=Trends in alcohol-related campus violence: Implications for prevention |journal=Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education|volume=43|issue=3|pages=34–52|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/086cfc310466180bd40beb4488dd71d7/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various studies have concluded the following:
* On average, at least 50% of college sexual assault cases are associated with alcohol use.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;
* On college campuses, 74% of the perpetrators and 55% of the victims had been drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="Abbey 2002"/&gt;
* In 2002, more than 70,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 were victims of alcohol-related sexual assault in the U.S.&lt;ref name="ncadi.samhsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/prevalert/v5/11.aspx |title=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services |publisher= |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116034450/http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/prevalert/v5/11.aspx |archivedate=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}}

=== Z-drugs ===
{{main|Z-drug}}

====Zolpidem====
[[Zolpidem]] (Ambien) is one of the most common date-rape drugs according to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondbackonline.com/2.2795/students-encounter-dangerous-date-rape-drug-1.287280 |title=The Diamondback - Students encounter dangerous date-rape drug |publisher= |accessdate=9 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110052931/http://www.diamondbackonline.com/2.2795/students-encounter-dangerous-date-rape-drug-1.287280 |archivedate=10 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benzodiazepines ===
Benzodiazepines ([[tranquilizers]]), such as [[Valium]], [[Librium]], [[Xanax]], and [[Ativan]], are prescribed to treat [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], [[insomnia]], and several other conditions, and are also frequently used recreationally. Benzodiazepines are often used in DFSA, with the most notorious being [[flunitrazepam]] (chemical name) or [[Rohypnol]] (proprietary or brand name), also known as "roofies," "rope," and "roaches."&lt;ref name="Hazelwood&amp;Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Ann Wolbert|editor1-first=Robert R.|editor1-last=Hazelwood|title=Practical aspects of rape investigation: a multidisciplinary approach|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420065041|page=446|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Raymond|title=Drugs across the spectrum|year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495013455|page=195|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benzodiazepines [[midazolam]] and [[temazepam]] were the two most common benzodiazepines utilized for date rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Analysis of urine samples in cases of alleged sexual assault case history |author1=ElSohly, Mahmoud A. |author2=Lee, Luen F. |author3=Holzhauer, Lynn B. |author4=Salamone, Salvatore J. | journal = Benzodiazepines and GHB | year = 2001 | pages = 127–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines can be detected in urine through the use of drug tests administered by medical officials or sold at pharmacies and performed at home. Most tests will detect benzodiazepines for a maximum of 72 hours after it was taken. Most general benzodiazepine detection tests will not detect Rohypnol: the drug requires a test specifically designed for that purpose. One new process can detect a 2&amp;nbsp;mg dose of Rohypnol for up to 28 days post-ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watch out for Date Rape Drugs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/DateRapeDrugs_2002MSP_rv2011_355106_7.pdf |title=Watch out for Date Rape Drugs |publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests for Rohypnol include blood and hair tests. Because the most commonly used drug tests often yield false negatives for Rohypnol, experts recommend use of [[gas chromatography]]-[[mass spectrometry]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rape investigation handbook"/&gt;

====Rohypnol====
This drug is also known as Whitleys, Trip-and-Fall, Ruffies, Rophies, Rope, Roopies, Roofies, Roches, Roach-2, Roach,  Mind Erasers, Rib, Lunch Money, R-2, Poor Man’s Quaalude, Mexican Valium, LA Rochas, Forget Pill, and Circles. Rohypnols comes as a pill that dissolves in liquids. Some are small, round, and white. Newer pills are oval and green-gray in color. When slipped into a drink, a dye in these new pills makes clear liquids turn bright blue and dark drinks turn cloudy. But this color change might be hard to see in a dark drink, like cola or dark beer, or in a dark room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/date_rape_drugs/article.htm|title=Date Rape Drug: List and Side Effects|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one 2002 survey of 53 women who used Rohypnol recreationally, 10% said they were physically or sexually assaulted while under its influence.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168" /&gt; If enough of the drug is taken, a person may experience a state of [[automatic behavior|automatism]] or dissociation. After the drug wears off, users may find themselves unable to remember what happened while under its influence ([[anterograde amnesia]]), and feeling woozy, hung-over, confused, dizzy, sluggish and uncoordinated, often with an upset stomach. They may also have some difficulty moving their limbs normally.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 168" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rape investigation handbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John O. Savino |author2=Brent E. Turvey |title=Rape investigation handbook|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|location=Waltham, MA|isbn=0123860296|pages=338–9|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohypnol is believed to be commonly used in DFSA in the United States, the United Kingdom, and throughout Europe, Asia and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Ann Wolbert|editor1-first=Robert R.|editor1-last=Hazelwood|title=Practical aspects of rape investigation: a multidisciplinary approach|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420065041|pages=339–446|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rohypnol's use in DFSA has been covered extensively in the news media, researchers disagree about how common such use actually is. Law enforcement manuals describe it as one of the drugs most commonly implicated in DFSA,&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"/&gt; but according to research conducted by Michael Robertson from the [[San Diego]] [[Medical examiner|Medical Examiner]]'s office and Dr. Mahmoud El Sohly of El Sohly Laboratories, test results indicated that flunitrazepam was only used in around 1% of reported date rapes according to Robertson and 0.33% according to urine lab tests done by El Sohly, of the rape-kits that actually get tested in time. Despite having a long half-life (18–28 hours) an incorrect belief is that Rohypnol is undetectable 12 hours after administration which may result in victims failing to get a blood or urine test the following day.

=== GHB/GBL/1,4 BDO ===
[[Gamma-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB) is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]. It has no odor, tastes salty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Abadinsky| first=Howard| title=Drug use and abuse: a comprehensive introduction|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning| location=Australia| isbn=0495809918|page=169|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is undetectable by humans when mixed in a drink.

GHB is used recreationally to stimulate [[euphoria]], to increase sociability, to promote libido and lower inhibitions.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard Lawrence|title=Drugs of abuse: a reference guide to their history and use|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0313318077|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold under names such as Rufies, Liquid E and Liquid X. It is usually taken orally, by the capful or teaspoon.&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 72–75"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=0849398088|pages=72–75|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1999, 22 reports of GHB being used in DFSA were made to the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. A 26-month study of 1,179 urine samples from suspected DFSAs across the United States found 4% positive for GHB.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"/&gt; The [[National Drug Intelligence Center]] (NDIC) says that in the United States GHB had surpassed Rohypnol as the substance most commonly used in DFSA, likely because GHB is much more easily available, cheaper and leaves the body more quickly.&lt;ref name="Miller 2002 183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173–176"/&gt; GHB is only detectable in urine for six to twelve hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pyrek 2006 173–176"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyrek|first=Kelly|title=Forensic nursing|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=084933540X|pages=173–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
There were three stories in the media about [[Rohypnol]] in 1993, 25 in 1994 and 854 in 1996. In early 1996 [[Newsweek]] magazine published "Roofies: The date-rape drug" which ended with the line "Don't take your eyes off your drink." That summer, researchers say all major American urban and regional newspapers covered date rape drugs, with headlines such as "Crackdown sought on date rape drug" ([[Los Angeles Times]]), "Drug zaps memory of rape victims" ([[San Francisco Chronicle]]) and "Slow [[DEA]] Action Gives Women No Relief from the Threat of New Date-Rape Drug" ([[Detroit News]]). Date rape drugs were also covered in media aimed at young women such as [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']] and [[Sassy (magazine)|''Sassy'']] magazines. In 1997 and 1998, the date rape drug story received extensive coverage on [[CNN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']] and [[Primetime Live]], the [[Oprah Winfrey Show]], and the fictitious TV shows [[Beverly Hills 90210]] and [[South Park]]. Women were instructed to never drink from punch bowls, never leave a drink unattended, try no new drinks, drink nothing with an unusual taste or appearance, take their own drinks to parties, and drink nothing opened by another person.

News media has been criticized for overstating the DFSA threat, for providing "how to" material for potential date rapists and for advocating "grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|pages=20 and 161–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goode|first=Erich|title=Moral panics: the social construction of deviance|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=1405189347|page=217|edition=2nd|author2=Ben-Yehuda, Nachman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law enforcement representatives and feminists have also been criticized for supporting the overstatements for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Christine Shearer-Cremean|title=Survivor rhetoric: negotiations and narrativity in abused women's language|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto [u.a.]|isbn=0802089739|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Webber states that this extensive coverage has created or amplified a [[moral panic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Craig|title=Psychology &amp; crime|year=2009|publisher=Sage.|location=London|isbn=1412919428|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  rooted in societal anxieties about rape, hedonism and the increased [[Women's liberation|freedoms of women]] in modern culture. Goode et al say it has given a powerful added incentive for the suppression of [[club drugs|party drugs]],&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"/&gt; has inappropriately undermined the long-established argument that [[recreational drug use]] is purely a consensual and [[victimless crime]]. By shining a spotlight on premeditated criminal behavior, Philip Jenkins states that it has relieved the culture from having to explore and evaluate more nuanced forms of male sexual aggression towards people, such as those displayed in date rapes that were not facilitated by the surreptitious administration of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|pages=161–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For similar moral panics around social tensions manifesting via discussion of drugs and sex crime, researchers point to the opium scare of the late 19th century, in which "sinister Chinese" were said to use opium to coerce white women into [[sexual slavery]]. Similarly, in the Progressive Era, a persistent [[urban legend]] told of white middle-class women being surreptitiously drugged, abducted and sold into sexual slavery to Latin American brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs|year=1999|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0814742440|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubinsky|first=Karen|title=Improper advances: rape and heterosexual conflict in Ontario, 1880-1929|year=1993|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago u.a.|isbn=0226167534|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis doesn't contradict instances when date rape drugs are used or sexual trafficking occurs; its focus is on actual prevalence of certain crimes relative to media coverage of it.

==Date rape drug detectors==
Michael Abramson, a patent attorney who believes he was once drugged at a bar, has invented a cup and plastic straw that detect date rape drugs and signal their presence by changing color.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:edmartell.jpg|right|thumb]] --&gt;
'''Edward A. Martell''' (1920? – July 12, 1995) was an American [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] for the US [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR) in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  He fought fervently throughout his life against the medical establishment and the [[National Institute of Health]] for what he perceived to be insufficient research into radiation-induced [[lung cancer]], particularly in regard to [[cigarette]] smoking.

== Education ==
Martell received his education the [[U.S. Military Academy]] in [[West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  He was commissioned as a second lieutenant after graduating in 1942 and served in the Okinawa campaign of World War II, retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel.  He received a Ph.D. in radiochemistry from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1950.

== Research ==
After receiving his Ph.D., he became a group leader at the Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago and also took up a position at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory in [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], [[Massachusetts]].  He managed radiation-effects projects studying a series of nuclear weapons tests in Nevada and the 1954 hydrogen bomb tests at the [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].

In 1962, after witnessing the devastating effects of nuclear weapons, Martell decided to pursue a different direction in his life and took up a position as a radiochemist in the Atmospheric Chemistry Division at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado.

In 1980 he published a paper in ''Newscript'' in which he argued that [[radium]] progeny, particularly [[polonium]]-210, are responsible for the cancer-causing effects of cigarettes.  He followed this up in 1983 with a [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/5/1285 subsequent research paper] in which he calculated that smokers who die of lung cancer have been exposed to 80-100 [[rad (unit)|rads]] of radiation.

In 1993 he published a paper in which he theorized that ionizing radiation in artesian groundwater was the energy source which fueled the evolution of DNA and the first living cells, after exchanging ideas with the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]'s [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemist [[Tom Cech]].  At the time of his death, he was working on a book called "Natural Radionuclides and Life".

== Positions and efforts ==
During his time at NCAR he served as president of the International Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Radioactivity within the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences.  He was also a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and a member of numerous other scientific societies.

He served as an expert witness during hearings before the U.S. Congress and United Nations on radioactive fallout.  He also spearheaded the cleanup of [[plutonium]] contamination in the soil surrounding the [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]] nuclear weapons manufacturing facility located outside of Boulder, after measuring levels of radioactivity surrounding the site.  He also supported the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] which represented the victims of government-sponsored radiation testing on low-income black citizens.

There are high rates of '''diabetes in First Nation''' people compared to the general Canadian population. Statistics from 2011 showed that 17.2% of First Nations people living on reserves had Type 2 Diabetes.&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"&gt;Population Health Agency Canada PHAC (2011). Diabetes in Canada: Facts and figures from a public health perspective. Retrieved February 4, 2012: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cd-mc/publications/diabetes-diabete/facts-figures-faits-chiffres-2011/highlights-saillants-eng.php#chp6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributing factors to the high prevalence of [[Type 2 diabetes|Type 2 Diabetes]] between First Nation and the general population include a combination of environmental (lifestyle, diet, poverty), and genetic and biological factors (e.g. [[Thrifty gene hypothesis|thrifty genotype hypothesis]], [[thrifty phenotype]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, T. M. 2008. Western Diseases: An Evolutionary Perspective. Chapter 4: The thrifty genotype versus thrifty phenotype debate: efforts to explain between population variation in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent each factor plays a role is not clear.&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"&gt;Dyck R, Osgood N, Lin TH, Gao A, and Stang MR (2010) Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus among First Nations and non-First Nations adults. Canadian Medical Association Journal 182:249-256; published ahead of print January 18, 2010, doi:[http://10.1503/cmaj.090846 10.1503/cmaj.090846]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diabetes mellitus Type 2==

Rates of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in First Nation communities were non-existent 20 years ago, but increased steeply.&lt;ref&gt;Shubair, MM, &amp; Tobin, PK (2010) Type 2 diabetes in the First Nations population: a case example of clinical practice guidelines. Rural and Remote Health; 10, 1505 - 1511.&lt;/ref&gt; Age-standardized rates of T2D show 17.2% prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes among First Nations individuals living on reserves, compared to 5.0% in the non-Aboriginal population;&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"/&gt;

Statistics indicate that the Type 2 Diabetes prevalence rate in First Nations people is 3 to 5 times higher than the general Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Aboriginal Diabetes Strategy from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (2011) Retrieved February 6, 2012: www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/ministry_reports/oads_06/oads_06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As well as having a higher rate of Type 2 Diabetes than the general population, there are also differences in the disease pattern in First Nations Type 2 Diabetes sufferers compared to the general population, especially in terms of age of onset and gestational diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, E, Moore, K, Dean, H (2009) Clinical Management of type 2 diabetes in indigenous youth. In Pedriatric Clinic of North America 56: 1141-1459.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
===Diabetes in youth===

Diabetes in first nations has increasingly become a disease of the younger population, who thus experience a high burden of disease, diabetes-related complications and co-morbidity. To illustrate, in the general population Type 2 Diabetes is an old-age associated disease: New diabetes cases peaked in First Nations people between ages 40–49 compared with a non-First Nations peak of age 70+.&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/&gt;

This earlier onset of disease in First Nation population has serious health implications for the women, especially during her reproductive life-years: it increases the chance of her children to develop diabetes, contributing to diabetes [[prevalence]] and [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] in the future generations.
	 	
===Diabetes in women===

First Nations women in particular suffer from diabetes, especially between ages 20–49. They have a 4 times higher incidence of diabetes than non-first nation women&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/&gt; as well as experiencing higher rates of gestational diabetes than non-Aboriginal females, 8-18% compared to 2-4%.&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"/&gt;

==== Gestational diabetes ====
A third type of diabetes, other than [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] is gestational diabetes mellitus. This is a temporary type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. Most women with [[gestational diabetes]] will return to normal glucose levels after delivery of the baby; if a woman does not return to normal glucose levels she will be re-diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and is no longer considered to have gestational diabetes.&lt;ref name="naho.ca"&gt;First Nations Centre, National Aboriginal Health Organization, (2009). Gestational Diabetes and First Nations Women: A literature review. Retrieved from http://www.naho.ca/documents/fnc/english/gestational_diabetes_first_nations_women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestational diabetes carries risks for both the mother and the baby. It increases the likelihood of the infant developing T2D, and giving birth to high body-weight baby. High body-weight increases risk of the child developing diabetes even if mother does not have it.&lt;ref name="naho.ca"/&gt;

==Screening programs for First Nations==

The Review of Guidelines for Screening and Treatment affirms the use of [[glucose test|fasting plasma glucose test]] (FPG) or a 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) as a screening tool.&lt;ref name="Health 2010"&gt;Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH-HTIS). (2010b). Diabetes in Aboriginal Populations: Review of Guidelines for Screening and Treatment. Prepared by Health Technology Inquiry Service (HTIS). August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the higher incidence of diabetes in Aboriginals, more frequent screening is recommended to improve diabetes management and prevention strategies. Instead of a standard screening every third year, aboriginal adults in Canada with a higher risk of developing diabetes are called upon to be screened every one or two years.&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/&gt;

Children above the age of ten identified as at high risk for developing diabetes are recommended for screening, especially important in First Nations and Aboriginal populations, as the age of onset of diabetes is lower (happening in at earlier age) compared to the general population.&lt;ref name="10.1503/cmaj.090846"/&gt; Obese children ([[Body mass index|BMI]] &gt; 99.5) should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test each year.&lt;ref&gt;Ur, Ehud; Chiasson, Jean-Louis; Ransom, Tom; Rowe, Richard (2008) Screening for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. In Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee (ed.) 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though a range of different screening programs for Aboriginals exist, there is a need for screening programs in partnership with communities.&lt;ref name="Health 2010"/&gt;

==Current policies for diabetes in First Nations==

The Government of Canada has policies and programs in place aimed at improving the health of Aboriginal people. One such measure was the implementation of the [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/diseases-maladies/diabete/index-eng.php Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative] (ADI) in 1999. The ADI has been funded continuously over three phases: Phase 1 (1999–2004); Phase 2 (2005–2010), and; Phase 3 (2011–2015).

The goal of ADI is to reduce the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes through [[health promotion]] campaigns and initiatives implemented by trained community diabetes workers and health professionals. The ADI has four main components from which the program expects to achieve its objectives.	
# Community-based health promotion and primary prevention	
# Screening and management activities in order to diagnose disease early
# Capacity building and training activities to equip community health workers and health professional	
# Knowledge mobilization activities to enhance sharing of knowledge
The current Phase 3 includes healthy living initiatives for children, youth, parents, and families; diabetes in pre-pregnancy and pregnancy; community-led food security planning; and enhanced training for health professionals on clinical practice guidelines and chronic disease management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada (HC) (2011). Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative: Program Framework 2010-2015. Retrieved February 6, 2012: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/diseases-maladies/_diabete/2010-2015-frame-cadre/index-eng.php#a4.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flavan-3-ols''' (sometimes referred to as '''flavanols''') are derivatives of [[flavan]]s that use the 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2''H''-chromen-3-ol skeleton.  These compounds include [[catechin]], [[epicatechin gallate]], [[epigallocatechin]], [[epigallocatechin gallate]], [[proanthocyanidin]]s, [[theaflavin]]s, [[thearubigin]]s.

Flav'''a'''nols (with an "a") are not to be confused with [[flavonol]]s (with an "o"), a class of [[flavonoid]]s containing a [[ketone]] group.

The single-molecule (monomer) catechin, or isomer epicatechin (see diagram), adds four hydroxyls to flavan-3-ol, making building blocks for concatenated polymers ([[proanthocyanidin]]s) and higher order polymers ([[anthocyanidin]]s).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;OPC in Practice, 1995 3rd Edition, by Bert Schwitters in collaboration with Prof. Jack Masquelier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flavanols possess two chiral carbons, meaning four [[diastereoisomer]]s occur for each of them.

Catechins are distinguished from the yellow, ketone-containing flavonoids such as [[quercitin]] and [[rutin]], which are called [[flavonol|flav'''o'''nols]]. Early use of the term '''bioflavonoid''' was imprecisely applied to include the flavanols, which are distinguished by absence of ketone(s).  Catechin monomers, dimers, and trimers (oligomers) are colorless.  Higher order polymers, anthocyanidins, exhibit deepening reds and become [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources of catechins==

The catechins are abundant in [[tea]]s derived from the tea plant ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'', as well as in some [[Cocoa solids|cocoas]] and [[chocolate]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hammerstone JF, Lazarus SA, Schmitz HH |title=Procyanidin content and variation in some commonly consumed foods |journal=J.

== Catechin and the gallates ==

[[Catechin]] and [[epicatechin]] are [[epimer]]s, with (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin being the most common optical [[isomer]]s found in nature. Catechin was first isolated from the plant extract [[catechu]], from which it derives its name. Heating catechin past its point of decomposition releases [[pyrocatechol]] (also called catechol), which explains the common origin of the names of these compounds.

[[Epigallocatechin]] and [[gallocatechin]] contain an additional phenolic [[hydroxyl group]] when compared to epicatechin and catechin, respectively, similar to the difference in [[pyrogallol]] compared to pyrocatechol.

Catechin gallates are [[gallic acid]] [[ester]]s of the catechins; an example is [[epigallocatechin gallate]], which is commonly the most abundant catechin in tea.

== Metabolism of flavan-3-ols ==

=== Biosynthesis of (-)-epicatechin ===

The flavonoids are products from a cinnamoyl-CoA starter unit, with chain extension using three molecules of malonyl-CoA. Reactions are catalyzed by a type III PKS enzyme. These enzyme do not use ACPSs, but instead employ coenzyme A esters and have a single active site to perform the necessary series of reactions, e.g. chain extension, condensation, and cyclization. Chain extension of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA gives initially a polyketide (Figure 1), which can be folded. These allow Claisen-like reactions to occur, generating aromatic rings.&lt;ref name="Dewick2009p168" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winkel-Shirley2001p485-493" /&gt;

==Potential health effects of catechins==
{{Main|Tea and health|Wine and health|Cocoa bean#Health_benefits}}
The supposed health benefits of catechins have been studied extensively in humans and animal models, but there are no proven effects that apply to human health.

[[Fluorescent lamp]]s have been suggested to affect human health in various ways.

==Flicker effects==
New lighting systems have not used magnetic ballasts since the turn of the century, however some older installations still remain.  Fluorescent lamps with magnetic [[electrical ballast|ballast]]s flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with [[light sensitivity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/soar/vision/light.html|title=Working with Light Sensitivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with [[autism]], [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/epilepsy.html|title=Accommodation Ideas for Employees with Epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/Lupus.html|title=Accommodation and Compliance Series: Employees with Lupus}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Lyme disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10610642 |title=Musculoskeletal and neurologic outcomes in patients with previously treated Lyme disease |volume=131 |issue=12 |date=December 1999 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|pages=919–26|vauthors=Shadick NA, Phillips CB, Sangha O |display-authors=etal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-131-12-199912210-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/enews/2004/Enews_V2-I1.htm#four |title=Accommodating People with Vertigo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608034400/http://www.jan.wvu.edu/enews/2004/Enews_V2-I1.htm#four |archivedate=2008-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer fluorescent lights without magnetic ballasts have essentially eliminated flicker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/lighting_flicker.html Lighting flicker, retrieved 2010 April 19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flickering-fallacy-cfl-bulb-headaches/|title=Flickering Fallacy: The Myth of Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb Headaches|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Individuals with high [[flicker fusion threshold]] are particularly affected by these obsolete, electromagnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=433–47 |date=1998 |title=The impact of flicker from fluorescent lighting on well-being, performance and physiological arousal |pmid=9557586 |vauthors=Küller R, Laike T |doi=10.1080/001401398186928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50Hz – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Light Res Tech |volume=27 |issue=4 |date=1995 |pages=243–256 |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc38944/nrcc38944.pdf/ |accessdate=2012-06-28 |vauthors=Veitch JA, McColl SL |title=Modulation of fluorescent light: flicker rate and light source effects on visual performance and visual comfort |doi=10.1177/14771535950270040301}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and [[stereotypy|repetitive movement]] in [[autistic]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Child Schizophr |date=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=157–62 |title= The effects of fluorescent and incandescent illumination upon repetitive behaviors in autistic children |vauthors=Colman RS, Frankel F, Ritvo E, Freeman BJ |doi=10.1007/BF01538059 |pmid=989489}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these studies had interpretive problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |date=1999 |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=839–49 |title= Annotation: Repetitive behaviour in autism: a review of psychological research |author= Turner M |pmid=10509879 |doi= 10.1017/S0021963099004278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not been replicated.

==Ultraviolet radiation risk==
[[File:Compact-Fluorescent-Bulb.jpg|thumb|upright|An open (single envelope) CFL.&lt;ref name=lamptech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Spec%20Sheets/Philips%20CFL%20Tornado.htm |title=Philips Tornado Asian Compact Fluorescent |publisher=Lamptech.co.uk |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Closed double envelope compact fluorescent lamp.jpg|thumb|right|An encapsulated/closed (double envelope) CFL]]

Some fluorescent lamps emit [[ultraviolet]] radiation.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The [[Health Protection Agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]] has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30&amp;nbsp;cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Not all open CFLs produce significant UV emissions. However, close proximity to bare skin can result in exposure levels similar to direct sunlight. The [[Health Protection Agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]] recommend that in situations requiring close proximity to the light source, open (single envelope) CFLs be replaced with encapsulated (double envelope) CFLs.&lt;ref name=hpa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1223534061375|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201848/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb%26HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1223534061375|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-13|title=Emissions from compact fluorescent lights|accessdate=2009-08-31|publisher=Health Protection Agency|date=2008|format=PDF|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Natural Resources Canada]] released a report&lt;ref name=cflreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/oee.nrcan.gc.ca/files/pdf/residential/personal/pdf/hc-cfl-executive-summary-2009-12-21-final-eng.pdf|title=Executive Summary: Report on Health Canada Survey of Ultraviolet Radiation and Electric and Magnetic Fields from Compact Fluorescent Lamps|accessdate=2016-06-15|publisher=Canada|date=2009-12-21|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report states that at 3&amp;nbsp;cm distance, the recommended daily exposure to ultraviolet radiation for skin and eye damage (if looking directly at the lamp) was attained between 50 minutes and 5 hours depending on the type of lamp. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. The report also states that most bare-spiral lamps tested gave off more UV than the 60 watt incandescent lamp tested, but that the encapsulated (double envelope) CFLs emitted less UV radiation. At 30&amp;nbsp;cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 Watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. The report states that the [[threshold limit value]]s used represent otherwise healthy individuals who are not experiencing any hypersensitivity conditions or exposed to substances that increase UV sensitivity. [[Health effects of sun exposure|Outdoor sunlight]] can supply the maximum recommended daily UV exposure in 20 to 100 minutes.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

==SCENIHR study and report==
The [[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]] (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed&lt;ref name=scenihr2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_019.pdf|title=Light Sensitivity, Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks|accessdate=2009-08-31|publisher=Director-General for Health and Consumers, European Commission|date=2008|format=PDF|pages=26–27|quote=''Although the carcinogenic UV dose from fluorescent lighting in offices is minor (~ 1%) when compared to equal exposure times in the summer sun, old risk assessments showed that actual annual exposures of office workers could increase by 10 to 30% from the fluorescent lighting, which over a lifetime was estimated to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinomas by around 4% with a baseline risk much lower than that for outdoor workers who dominate incidences (Lytle et al. 1992).''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:
*Ultraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased [[probability]] of contracting [[squamous cell carcinoma]] by 4 percent.
*[[Melanoma]] has been shown to not be affected by CFLs through normal use.
*The constituent [[high-energy visible light]] (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur.
*The report states that "people with [[autism]] or [[Asperger's syndrome]] have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed.
*The inner-ear condition [[Ménière's disease]] can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] are recommended to not use fluorescent lights.
*[[Polymorphous light eruption]] is a condition affecting the skin thought to be caused by an adverse reaction to ultraviolet light. Its prevalence across Europe is 10-20% of the population. Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption.
*[[Chronic actinic dermatitis]] is a condition where a subject's skin becomes inflamed due to a reaction to sunlight or artificial light. Its prevalence in [[Scotland]] is 16.5 per 100,000 population. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition.
*The autoimmune disease [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] is exacerbated by CFLs.
*There is evidence that [[actinic prurigo]] is worsened by CFLs. This disease affects 3.3% of the general population.
*3.1% of the population suffer [[solar urticaria]], a skin disorder affected by ultraviolet light. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs.
*[[Phytophotodermatitis]] may be aggravated by the additional levels of ultraviolet light emitted by CFLs.
*Patients undergoing [[photodynamic therapy]] are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs.
*Self-reporting suggests that 21% of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs.
*One cause of [[cataract]]s is exposure to ultraviolet light. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts.
*There is evidence that flicker can cause [[seizures]] in patients with [[photosensitive epilepsy]], but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps.
*Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate [[dyslexia]], but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. This opinion was updated by SCENIHR in 2012, with no significant changes from the opinion of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= SCENIHR |date=2012 |title= Health Effects of Artificial Light |author= Mattsson M-O |display-authors= etal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_035.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetic radiation risks==
The [[World Health Organization]]’s IARC categorizes EMF and radiofrequency exposure as class 2B possibly carcinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Lancet Oncology |date=2011 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=624–626 |title= Carcinogenicity of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields |author= Baan R, Grosse Y, Lauby-Secretan B, El Ghissassi F, Bouvard V, Benbrahim-Tallaa L, Guha N, Islami F, Galichet L, Straif K; WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group |pmid= 21845765 |doi= 10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70147-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other devices that are dependent on electricity for their functions, the electronic ballasts in fluorescent lamps emit electric and magnetic fields in the low-frequency range (the distribution frequency 50 Hz and possibly also harmonics thereof, e.g. 150 Hz, 250 Hz, etc. in Europe). Some fluorescent bulbs emit high-frequency fields (30-60 kHz).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions/en/energy-saving-lamps/l-3/3-cfl-characteristics.htm Public Health Europe - European Commission - EU - European Commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Radiat Prot Dosimetry |date=2010 |volume=142 |issue=2-4 |pages=354–357 |title= Spot measurements of intermediate frequency electric fields in the vicinity of compact fluorescent lamps |vauthors=Bakos J, Nagy N, Juhász P, Thuróczy G |pmid=20924120 |doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric fields of this intensity have been associated with biological effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Bioelectromagnetics |date=2001 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=371–383 |title= Mechanism of the fluorescent light induced suppression of Curly phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster |vauthors=Pavelka J, Jindrák L |pmid=11536279 |doi=10.1002/bem.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these can be reduced significantly by maintaining an appropriate distance from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Biomed Instrum Technol |date=2001 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=104–109 |title= Measurement of radiated electromagnetic field levels before and after a changeover to energy-efficient lighting |vauthors=Kerr LN, Boivin WS, Boyd SM, Coletta JN |pmid=11383307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assessment of EM Exposure of Energy-Saving Bulbs &amp; Possible Mitigation Strategies study has shown that worst-case exposure in bulbs tested is within the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) limits, the majority of which with large margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Informat Technol in Society |date=2010 |issue=Project BAG/08.004316/434.0001/-13 &amp; BFE/15350 |title=Assessment of EM Exposure of Energy-Saving Bulbs &amp; Possible Mitigation Strategies |vauthors=Nadakuduti J, Douglas M, Capstick M, Kuhn S, Benkler S, Kuster N |url=http://www.news-service.admin.ch/NSBSubscriber/message/attachments/18707.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421181151/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/reviews/2004/dichotomyb.html |archivedate=2009-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercury==
Fluorescent bulbs contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], a toxic substance. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) provide [http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html safety guidelines for how to clear up a broken fluorescent bulb]. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleared up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/mercury/effects.htm], ''[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]''. Last updated on 12/29/2014. Retrieved on May 08, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulbs which have reached the end of their life should not be disposed of in normal trash, as this may release the mercury into the environment if the bulb is damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluorescent Lamp Disposal and Recycling|url=https://www3.epa.gov/region02/waste/spent-lamp.pdf|quote=Fluorescent lamps that are not low-mercury or green-marked are generally considered to be regulated hazardous waste after their useful life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries have specialised recycling or disposal systems for fluorescent bulbs, ''e.g''. [https://www.epa.gov/cfl/recycling-and-disposal-cfls-and-other-bulbs-contain-mercury US bulb recycling]. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4-5 mg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2007/07/31/cfl_mercury-2/|accessdate=March 9, 2018|date=July 31, 2007|author=John Balbus|title=Mercury Risk in CFLs: The Facts|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070518-cfls-bulbs.html Fluorescent Lights' Mercury Poses Dim Threat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some linear fluorescent lamps contain reduced mercury (as low as 1.7 mg)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philips Lighting introduces revolutionary new Alto II linear fluorescent lamp technology|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/ugc/2007/09/philips-lighting-introduces-revolutionary-new-alto-ii-linear-fluorescent-lamp-technology.html|website=www.ledsmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are typically termed as “Green” and are recognizable by their green caps/tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of “Green” Fluorescent Bulbs - Wisconsin DNR|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/wa/wa653.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. EPA states that using energy-efficient CFLs reduces demand for power, which reduces the amount of coal burned by power plants and hence reduces the amount of mercury emitted from coal fired power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.epa.gov/cfl/what-are-connections-between-mercury-and-cfls What are the Connections between Mercury and CFLs? | Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other conditions associated with fluorescent light==
In rare cases individuals with [[solar urticaria]] (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dermatol |date=2003 |volume=139 |issue=9 |pages=1149–54 |title= Characteristics and prognosis of idiopathic solar urticaria: a cohort of 87 cases |vauthors=Beattie PE, Dawe RS, Ibbotson SH, Ferguson J |pmid=12975156 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/139/9/1149 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.139.9.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very photosensitive individuals with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] may experience disease activity under artificial light. Standard acrylic diffusers over the fluorescent lamps absorb nearly all the [[UV-B]] radiation and appear to protect against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Arthritis Rheum |date=1992 |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=949–52 |title= Fluorescent light photosensitivity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus |vauthors=Rihner M, ((McGrath H Jr)) |doi=10.1002/art.1780350816 |pmid=1642660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One paper suggested that in rare cases, [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]] can also induce [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]]; subsequently, it can worsen [[depersonalization disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref name=Simeon2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simeon D, Knutelska M, Nelson D, Guralnik O |date= 2003 |title= Feeling unreal: a depersonalization disorder update of 117 cases |url= |journal= Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume= 64 |issue= 9 |pages= 990–7 |pmid= 14628973 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerovital H3''' (or '''procaine hydrochloride''' and products known as GH3 and other variants which may or may not be identical to Gerovital H3) is a controversial preparation developed in [[Romania]] during the 1950s and promoted by its advocates as an effective anti-aging treatment. During Gerovital's "jet-set" heyday, Gerovital treatments were reportedly administered to [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Donald Beddoe]], [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Salvador Dalí]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In the United States, the FDA bans Gerovital H3 from interstate commerce as an unapproved drug and, since 1982, has prohibited its importation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Development and marketing==
The impetus for developing the drug is sometimes alleged to have come from [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]],  who funded the establishment of a research organization, the National Institute of Geriatrics, in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], headed by [[Ana Aslan]] (1897&amp;ndash;1988).&lt;ref name=Perls/&gt; In fact, Aslan's research began years before, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The main active ingredient is the well-known local anesthetic [[procaine]] hydrochloride (often referred to by the old brand name, ''Novocaine''). It also contains small amounts of [[benzoic acid]], [[potassium metabisulfite]] and [[disodium phosphate]] which are said to be important in the formulation, rendering it more effective by "stabilizing" it. Some advocates{{who|date=September 2015}} acknowledge that despite the stabilizers, the procaine in Gerovital H3 breaks down rapidly into [[DEAE]] and [[4-Aminobenzoic acid|PABA]], but ascribe the beneficial effects to these breakdown products.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

From the 1950s until her death in 1988, Aslan promoted Gerovital H3 with great success. In the 1960s and 1970s her Romanian clinic, the Parhon Institute, became a mecca for celebrities seeking treatment, and an upscale tourist attraction. ''The New York Times'' referred to Gerovital's "jet-set aura," noting that Aslan had been covered in "society columns where such public figures as [[Nikita S. Khrushchev]], [[Konrad Adenauer]], and [[Ibn Saud]] have been listed among the multitudes said to have taken the drug." As late as 1988 an advertisement by the Romanian National Tourist Office lauded "the picturesque and exciting cities, scenic delights, famous resorts (including Gerovital H3 treatment centers), cultural and historic treasures that await the traveler to Romania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Our colorful TOUROMANIA booklet has it all | publisher=New York Times | date=1988-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[World-wide web|web]] Gerovital has enjoyed a new lease of promotional life as it is promoted by many sites with claims of its "cure-all" abilities.&lt;ref name=Perls/&gt;

==Denouncement==
A 1973 ''[[New York Times]]'' article said "cold water was thrown on [Gerovital]'s reputation years ago" by "three reports published simultaneously in British Medical Journal [that said it] found no merit for procaine hydrochloride for any of the problems of aging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Disputed Drug Is Restudied for Use in Geriatrics | publisher=New York Times | date=1973-03-18 | author=Harold M. Schmeck Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some clinical trials in the mid-to-late 1970s suggested that Gerovital H3 acts as a weak, competitive, reversible [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitor]], and so may have some antidepressant value, but otherwise has negligible effect on disease. In 1994, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] Consumer magazine said: "No health claims for Gerovital have been substantiated, and FDA considers it an unapproved new drug. It has caused low blood pressure, respiratory difficulties, and convulsions in some users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/CONSUMER/CON00275.html |title=Unproven Medical Treatments Lure Elderly |publisher=FDA Consumer Magazine |date=March 1994 |author=Jed Disbennett |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211084928/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/CONSUMER/CON00275.html |archivedate=2004-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppliers assert that the product is safe, and one cites a brief quotation from a newspaper article that says "while as early as 1973 Elmer Gardner of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs stated 'There is no safety problem with Gerovital H-3.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realgh3.com/quotes.html | title=FDA Quotes | publisher=Tierra Mega-Nutrients | accessdate=2006-11-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620065731/http://realgh3.com/quotes.html |archivedate = 2006-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
There is no evidence that Gerovital is helpful in slowing aging or treating illness.&lt;ref name=Perls&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perls T |title=The reappearance of procaine hydrochloride (Gerovital H3) for antiaging |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1024–5 |date=June 2013 |pmid=23772727 |doi=10.1111/jgs.12278 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug or nutrient?==
Procaine itself is often considered to be a drug. Earlier references by advocates of Gerovital H3 refer to it as a drug. Hoffer and Walker (1980) call it a "youth drug." Mircea Dumitru, Aslan's colleague and personal physician, describes it as "a complex drug acting like the procaine molecule&amp;nbsp;... The addition of benzoic acid, potassium and disodium phosphate increase the effects of Gerovital-H3 biotrophic treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mircea |last=Dumitru M.D. Ph. D. |url=http://www.antiaging-systems.com/extract/geroh3.htm |title=Professor Ana Aslan and Gerovital-H3, the Original and First Anti-Aging Medicine |publisher=International Antiaging Systems |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518164154/http://www.antiaging-systems.com/extract/geroh3.htm |archivedate=2006-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based suppliers outside and inside the United States, that offer to ship the preparation to the U.S. generally characterize it as a "nutrient"  "vitamin" or "Dietary Supplement", perhaps because of less strict legal treatment of nutritional supplements in the U. S. under the [[Dietary supplement|Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]]. A federal court in decision June 17, 1994, US vs Rodger Sless/TMI classified GeroVital H3 as a dietary supplement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==FDA ban==
{{As of|2004}}, the FDA's 1982 automatic detention alert is still in effect and bans the import of Gerovital H3 into the U.S. as "a new drug within the meaning of 201(p), without an approved new drug application [Unapproved New Drug, Section 505(a)]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia6101.html |title=Automatic Detention [for Gerovital] (IA#61-01) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2006-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930123927/http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia6101.html |archivedate=2006-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban covers:
*Gerovital, GH3, KH3, Zell H3, GH3 etc. This order was rescinded for GEROVITAL Cosmetics Lines, not containing procaine.
*finished injectable or oral Procaine Hydrochloride

A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or as '''healthcare system''', is the [[organization]] of people, institutions, and resources that deliver [[health care]] services to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations.

There is a wide variety of health systems around the world, with as many histories and [[organizational structure]]s as there are nations. Implicitly, nations must design and develop health systems in accordance with their needs and resources, although common elements in virtually all health systems are [[primary healthcare]] and [[public health]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = White F | year = 2015 | title = Primary health care and public health: foundations of universal health systems | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/370197/| journal = Med Princ Pract | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 103–116 | doi = 10.1159/000370197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, health system planning is distributed among [[market (economics)|market]] participants. In others, there is a concerted effort among [[government]]s, [[trade unions]], [[charities]], religious organizations, or other co-ordinated bodies to deliver planned health care services targeted to the populations they serve. However, health care planning has been described as often evolutionary rather than revolutionary.&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-ha.org.uk/health-care-system.html |title=''Health care system'' |publisher=Liverpool-ha.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/26/090126fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all ''New Yorker'' magazine article: "Getting there from here."] 26 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system, is promoting a goal of [[universal health care]]: to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them. According to WHO, healthcare systems' goals are good health for the citizens, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair means of funding operations. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: [[health care provider|provision of health care services]], resource generation, financing, and stewardship.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and [[health equity|equity]].&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"/&gt; They have also been described in the United States as "the five C's": Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and [[chronic disease|Chronic Illness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.jhu.edu/president/speeches/2007/health.html Remarks by Johns Hopkins University President William Brody: "Health Care '08: What's Promised/What's Possible?"] 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[continuity of health care]] is a major goal.&lt;ref name=cook2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Render | first2 = M. | last3 = Woods | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.791 | title = Gaps in the continuity of care and progress on patient safety | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7237 | pages = 791–794 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10720370| pmc =1117777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Often '''health system''' has been defined with a reductionist perspective, for example reducing it to '''healthcare system'''. In many publications, for example, both expressions are used interchangeably. Some authors&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2797599 | pmid=20069038 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000089 | volume=7 | title=The global health system: strengthening national health systems as the next step for global progress | year=2010 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e1000089 | author = Frenk J}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:
* Health systems should not be expressed in terms of their components only, but also of their interrelationships;
* Health systems should include not only the institutional or supply side of the health system, but also the population;
* Health systems must be seen in terms of their goals, which include not only health improvement, but also [[Health equity|equity]], responsiveness to legitimate expectations, respect of dignity, and fair financing, among others;
* Health systems must also be defined in terms of their functions, including the direct provision of services, whether they are medical or [[public health]] services, but also "other enabling functions, such as stewardship, financing, and resource generation, including what is probably the most complex of all challenges, the health workforce."&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"/&gt;

===World Health Organization definition===
The [[World Health Organization]] defines health systems as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=WHO|year=2007|title=Everybody's business. Strengthening health systems to improve health outcomes : WHO's framework for action|url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Providers==
{{Main article|Health care provider}}
Healthcare providers are institutions or individuals providing healthcare services. Individuals including health professionals and [[allied health professions]] can be self-employed or working as an employee in a [[hospital]], [[clinic]], or other health care institution, whether government operated, private for-profit, or private not-for-profit (e.g. non-governmental organization). They may also work outside of direct patient care such as in a government [[health department]] or other agency, [[medical laboratory]], or health training institution. Examples of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] are [[physician|doctors]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[midwifery|midwives]], [[dietetics|dietitians]], [[paramedic]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[medical laboratory technologist]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[community health worker]]s, traditional medicine practitioners, and others.

There are generally five primary methods of funding health systems:&lt;ref name="WHO2"&gt;[http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm "Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224050244/http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm |date=24 February 2007 }}, [[World Health Organization]]. And [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/searo/2004/SEA_HSD_274_eng.pdf]. Retrieved 18 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

# general [[taxation]] to the state, county or municipality
# [[national health insurance]]
# voluntary or private [[health insurance]]
# [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket payments]]
# [[donation]]s to [[charities]]

Most countries' systems feature a mix of all five models. One study&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherry Glied|Glied, Sherry A.]] [http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13881 "Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity."] ''National Bureau of Economic Research'', March 2008. Accessed 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data from the [[OECD]] concluded that all types of health care finance "are compatible with" an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control.

The term health insurance is generally used to describe a form of [[insurance]] that pays for medical expenses. It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering [[Disability insurance|disability]] or [[Long term care insurance|long-term nursing or custodial care]] needs. It may be provided through a [[social insurance]] program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.

By estimating the overall cost of health care expenses, a routine finance structure (such as a monthly premium or annual tax) can be developed, ensuring that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is typically administered by a government agency, a non-profit health fund or a corporation operating seeking to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf How Private Insurance Works: A Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221100523/http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf |date=21 December 2008 }} by Gary Claxton, Institution for Health Care Research and Policy, Georgetown University, on behalf of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of commercial health insurance control their costs by restricting the benefits that are paid by through [[deductible]]s, [[co-payment]]s, [[coinsurance]], policy exclusions, and total coverage limits and will severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government schemes also have co-payment schemes but exclusions are rare because of political pressure. The larger insurance schemes may also negotiate fees with providers.

Many forms of social insurance schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs in the health care delivery system. For example, by negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies negotiating standard fees with the medical profession, or reducing [[unnecessary health care]] costs. Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver [[universal health care]], which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).

In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or [[innovative financing]] mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|title=Markets, Information Asymmetry And Health Care: Towards New Social Contracts|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2076–2087|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/markets-information-asymmetry-and-health-care-towards-new-so.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.034|pmid=18316147|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as micro-contributions, [[public-private partnership]]s, and market-based [[financial transaction tax]]es. For example, as of June 2011, [[UNITAID]] had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.&lt;ref name="UNITAID"&gt;UNITAID. [http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html ''Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112114051/http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html |date=12 November 2011 }} Geneva, 30 June 2011. Accessed 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment models===
In most countries, [[wage]] costs for healthcare practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Saltman RB, Von Otter C. ''Implementing Planned Markets in Health Care: Balancing Social and Economic Responsibility''. Buckingham: Open University Press 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kolehamainen-Aiken RL | year = 1997 | title = Decentralization and human resources: implications and impact | url = | journal = Human Resources for Health Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Fee-for-service====
''[[Fee-for-service]] arrangements'' pay [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) based on the service.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; They are even more
widely used for specialists working in [[ambulatory care]].&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

There are two ways to set fee levels:&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/53/22364122.pdf|title=Health-Care Systems: Lessons from the Reform Experience|publisher=OECD|author1=Elizabeth Docteur |author2=Howard Oxley |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By individual practitioners.
* Central negotiations (as in Japan, Germany, Canada and in France) or hybrid model (such as in Australia, France's sector 2, and New Zealand) where GPs can charge extra fees on top of standardized patient reimbursement rates.

====Capitation====
In ''[[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation payment systems]]'', GPs are paid for each patient on their "list", usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in "managed care" environments in the United States."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

According to OECD, "Capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations. However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of "money following the patient" may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Salary arrangements====
In several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on ''[[salary|salaries]]'' for the government.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; There has been movement away from this system.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

==Information resources==
{{Main article|Health care delivery|Health information management|Health informatics|eHealth}}
Sound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics&amp;nbsp;– the intersection of [[information science]], [[medicine]] and [[healthcare]]&amp;nbsp;– deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]], formal [[Medical terminology|medical terminologies]], and computers and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. The kinds of [[health data]] processed may include [[medical records|patients' medical records]], [[hospital information system|hospital administration and clinical functions]], and [[HRHIS|human resources information]].

The use of health information lies at the root of [[evidence-based policy]] and [[evidence-based management]] in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=H|title=Information And Communications Technology For Future Health Systems In Developing Countries|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2122–2132|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/information-and-communications-technology-for-future-health.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.033|pmid=18343005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main article|Health policy|Public health|Health administration|Disease management (health)}}
The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of [[health policy|policies and plans]] adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, [[pharmaceutical policy|pharmaceuticals]], [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]], and [[public health]].

Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health is typically divided into [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental]], social, [[behavioral health|behavioral]], and [[occupational health]] are also important subfields.

[[File:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|A child being immunized against [[polio]].]]
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and [[health equity|health inequities]], although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a [[vaccination policy]], supporting public health programs in providing [[vaccination]]s to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.

The rapid emergence of many [[chronic disease]]s, which require costly [[chronic care management|long-term care and treatment]], is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_hiv_aids.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – HIV/Aides page |publisher=[[EUPHIX|Euphix]].org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major public health concern is [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_diabetes.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Diabetes page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of [[tobacco smoking]], linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_health_behaviours_smoking.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Smoking Behaviors page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. The [[World Health Organization]], for its [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]] campaign, is calling for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other [[antimicrobial]] medicines for future generations.

Since 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the [[global health]] system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progresses in global health. The elaboration and the selection of [[performance indicator]]s are indeed both highly dependent on the [[conceptual framework]] adopted for the [[evaluation]] of the health systems performances.&lt;ref&gt;Handler A, Issel M, Turnock B. A conceptual framework to measure performance of the public health system.

In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization's Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the 'policy implementation gap'. Recognizing the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of health systems is crucial to ensure that evidence-based guidelines are tested with requisite humility and without a rigid adherence to models dominated by a limited number of disciplines.&lt;ref name="Peters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyder|first=A|title=Exploring health systems research and its influence on policy processes in low income countries|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2007|volume=7|pages=309|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/exploring-health-systems-research-and-its-influence-on-polic.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-7-309|pmid=17974000|pmc=2213669|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare services often implement Quality Improvement Initiatives to overcome this policy implementation gap.

Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that challenges 'disciplinary capture' by dominant health research traditions, arguing that these traditions generate premature and inappropriately narrow definitions that impede rather than enhance health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheikh|first=Kabir|author2=Lucy Gilson |author3=Irene Akua Agyepong |author4=Kara Hanson |author5=Freddie Ssengooba |author6=Sara Bennett |title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: Framing the Questions|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001073|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001073 |accessdate=22 May 2012|pages=e1001073|pmid=21857809|pmc=3156683}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPSR focuses on low- and middle-income countries and draws on the relativist social science paradigm which recognises that all phenomena are constructed through human behaviour and interpretation.

Health systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The [[World Health Organization]], in its ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2000]]'', provided a [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|ranking of health systems]] around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of [[health]] in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; The goals for health systems, according to the WHO's ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'' (WHO, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2000) [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/ ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm ''Health Systems Performance: Overall Framework.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617053343/http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm |date=17 June 2012 }} Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially based on the country [[ranking]] linked to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Navarro V | year = 2000 | title = Assessment of the World Health Report 2000 | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 356 | issue = | pages = 1598–601 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)03139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained [[performance indicator|indicators]].

Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations are complex. The [[Commonwealth Fund]], in its annual survey, "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall", compares the performance of the health systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the United States Its 2007 study found that, although the United States system is the most expensive, it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2007/May/Mirror--Mirror-on-the-Wall--An-International-Update-on-the-Comparative-Performance-of-American-Healt.aspx|title=Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|date=15 May 2007|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major difference between the United States and the other countries in the study is that the United States is the only country without [[universal health care]].

}}
In [[high-throughput screening]] (HTS), one of the major goals is to select compounds (including [[small molecule]]s, [[siRNA]]s, [[shRNA]], [[gene]]s, et al.) with a desired size of inhibition or activation effects. A compound with a desired size of effects in an HTS screen is called a hit. The process of selecting hits is called '''hit selection'''.

==Methods for hit selection in general==
HTS experiments have the ability to screen tens of thousands (or even millions) of compounds rapidly. Hence, it is a challenge to glean chemical/biochemical significance from mounds of data in the process of hit selection. To address this challenge, appropriate analytic methods have been adopted for hit selection. There are two main strategies of selecting hits with large effects

There are two major types of HTS experiments, one without replicates (usually in primary screens) and one with replicates (usually in confirmatory screens). The analytic methods for hit selection differ in those two types of HTS experiments. For example, the z-score method is suitable for screens without replicates whereas the t-statistic is suitable for screens with replicate. The calculation of [[SSMD]] for screens without replicates also differs from that for screens with replicates.&lt;ref name= ZhangBook2011 /&gt;

==Screens without replicates==
There are many metrics used for hit selection in primary screens without replicates.
The easily interpretable ones are fold change, mean difference, percent inhibition, and percent activity. However, the drawback common to all of these metrics is that they do not capture data variability effectively. To address this issue, researchers then turned to the z-score method or [[SSMD]], which can capture data variability in negative references

The z-score method is based on the assumption that the measured values (usually fluorescent intensity in log scale) of all investigated compounds in a plate have a normal distribution. SSMD also works the best under the normality assumption. However, true hits with large effects should behave very different from the majority of the compounds and thus are outliers. Strong assay artifacts may also behave as outliers. Thus, outliers are not uncommon in HTS experiments. The regular versions of z-score and SSMD are sensitive to outliers and can be problematic. Consequently, robust methods such as the z*-score method, [[SSMD]]*, B-score method, and quantile-based method have been proposed and adopted for hit selection in primary screens without replicates

.

In a primary screen without replicates, every compound is measured only once. Consequently, we cannot directly estimate the data variability for each compound. Instead, we indirectly estimate data variability by making a strong assumption that every compound has the same variability as a negative reference in a plate in the screen. The z-score, z*-score and B-score relies on this strong assumption; so are the SSMD and SSMD* for cases without replicates.

==Screens with replicates==
In a screen with replicates, we can directly estimate data variability for each compound, and thus we can use more powerful methods, such as SSMD for cases with replicates and t-statistic that does not rely on the strong assumption that the z-score and z*-score rely on. One issue with the use of t-statistic and associated p-values is that they are affected by both sample size and effect size

. They come from testing for no mean difference, thus are not designed to measure the size of small molecule or siRNA effects. For hit selection, the major interest is the size of effect in a tested [[small molecule]] or [[siRNA]]. [[SSMD]] directly assesses the size of effects

The population value of [[SSMD]] is comparable across experiments and thus we can use the same cutoff for the population value of [[SSMD]] to measure the size of siRNA effects

SSMD can overcome the drawback of average fold change not being able to capture data variability. On the other hand, because SSMD is the ratio of mean to standard deviation, we may get a large SSMD value when the standard deviation is very small, even if the mean is small. In some cases, a too small mean value may not have a biological impact. As such, the compounds with large SSMD values (or differentiations) but too small mean values may not be of interest. The concept of [[dual-flashlight plot]] has been proposed to address this issue. In a [[dual-flashlight plot]], we plot the [[SSMD]] versus average log fold-change (or average percent inhibition/activation) on the y- and x-axes, respectively, for all compounds investigated in an experiment.&lt;ref name="ZhangPharmacogenomics2010"/&gt;
With the dual-flashlight plot, we can see how the genes or compounds are distributed into each category in effect sizes, as shown in the figure. Meanwhile, we can also see the average fold-change for each compound

Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, but in the 3000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and deified.

Today, outside the Egyptological community, he is referred to as a [[polymath]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/436803|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614113755/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/436803|archivedate=June 14, 2011 |title=The Egyptian Building Mania |publisher=Ancientworlds.net |date= |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet,&lt;ref name= "Musso2005"&gt;Musso, C.

(2013). The Maze of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Discovery, Anat Res Int, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, some have considered Imhotep alongside [[Hippocrates]] and [[Charaka]] as [[List_of_people_considered_father_or_mother_of_a_scientific_field#Medicine_and_physiology|the fathers of early medicine]]. These claims are founded on the legends that flourished in the millennia after his death, not on historical records. No text from his lifetime mentions these capacities and no text mentions his name in the first 1200 years following his death.&lt;ref&gt;Teeter, E. (2011). Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baud, M. (2002). Djéser et la IIIe dynastie, p. 125. (In French).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that establish him as chancellor to the pharaoh, the first text to reference Imhotep dates to the time of [[Amenhotep III]] (c. 1391–1353 BC). It is addressed to the owner of a tomb, and reads:

{{Quote|text=The wab-priest may give offerings to your ka. The wab-priests may stretch to you their arms with libations on the soil, as it is done for Imhotep with the remains of the water bowl. |source=D. Wildung (1977), ''Egyptian Saints: Deification in Pharaonic Egypt'', p. 34.}}

It appears that this libation to Imhotep was done regularly, as they are attested on papyruses associated to statues of Imhotep until the Late Period (c. 664–332 BC). To Wildung, this cult holds its origin in the slow evolution of the memory of Imhotep among intellectuals from his death onwards. To [[Alan Gardiner]], this cult is so distinct from the offerings usually made to commoners that the epithet of "demi-god" is likely justified to describe the way Imhotep was venerated in the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1077 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hurry, J. B. (1926). ''Imhotep: The Egyptian God of Medicine'' (2014 reimpression, 133 pages). Oxford: Traffic Output, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first references to the healing abilities of Imhotep occur from the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] (c. 380–343 BC) onwards, some 2200 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Baud, M. (2002). ''Djéser et la IIIe dynastie'', p. 127. (In French).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildung, D. (1977). Egyptian Saints – Deification in Pharaonic Egypt, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of only two commoners ever to be deified after death (the other being [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]]). The center of his cult was in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].
The location of Imhotep's self-built tomb was well hidden from the beginning and it remains unknown, despite efforts to find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/harpers_lay.htm |title=Lay of the Harper |publisher=Reshafim.org.il |date= |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that it is hidden somewhere at [[Saqqara]].

==Historicity==

Imhotep's historicity is confirmed by two contemporary inscriptions made during his lifetime on the base or pedestal of one of Djoser's statues (Cairo JE 49889) and also by a [[graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] on the enclosure wall surrounding [[Sekhemkhet]]'s unfinished step-pyramid.&lt;ref name=Malek&gt;Jaromir Malek. "The Old Kingdom" in ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'' by Ian Shaw (ed.) Oxford University Press paperback 2002. p. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Kahl "Old Kingdom: Third Dynasty" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' by Donald Redford (ed.) Vol. 2, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The latter inscription suggests that Imhotep outlived Djoser by a few years and went on to serve in the construction of King Sekhemkhet's pyramid, which was abandoned due to this ruler's brief reign.&lt;ref name=Malek/&gt;

===Architecture and engineering===
[[Image:Sakkara 01.jpg|right|thumb|Pyramid of Djoser]]
Imhotep was one of the chief officials of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Djoser]]. Egyptologists ascribe to him the design of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]], a [[step pyramid]] at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 2630–2611 B.C..&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry J. Kemp]], ''Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 2005, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have been responsible for the first known use of stone [[column]]s to support a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Rosalie |last2=Baker |first2=Charles |date=2001 |title=Ancient Egyptians: People of the Pyramids |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=23 |isbn=978-0195122213 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these later attestations, the pharaonic Egyptians themselves never credited Imhotep as the designer of the stepped pyramid nor with the invention of stone architecture.&lt;ref&gt;John Romer, "A History of Ancient Egypt From the First Farmers to the Great Pyramid", Penguin Books 2013 p.294-295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythification==
Two thousand years after his death, Imhotep's status had risen to that of a god of medicine and [[healing]]. He was eventually equated with [[Thoth]], the god of architecture, mathematics and medicine, and patron of [[scribes]]: Imhotep's cult had merged with that of his former tutelary god.

He was revered in the region of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as the "brother" of [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]], another deified architect, in the temples dedicated to Thoth.&lt;ref&gt;''Thoth or the Hermes of Egypt: A Study of Some Aspects of Theological Thought in Ancient Egypt'', p. 166–168, Patrick Boylan, Oxford University Press, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', The University of California Press 1980, vol. 3, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Imhotep was also linked to [[Asclepius|Asklepios]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52716451|title=Handbook of Egyptian mythology|last=Geraldine,|first=Pinch,|isbn=9781576072424|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=52716451|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to myth, Imhotep's mother was a mortal named Kheredu-ankh, she too being eventually revered as a demi-goddess as daughter of [[Banebdjedet]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Warner, Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''World of Myths'', University of Texas Press 2003, {{ISBN|0-292-70204-3}}, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, since Imhotep was known as the "Son of [[Ptah]],"&lt;ref&gt;[[Miriam Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings'', University of California Press 1980, {{ISBN|0-520-04020-1}}, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; his mother was sometimes claimed to be [[Sekhmet]], the patron of [[Upper Egypt]] whose consort was [[Ptah]].

The Upper Egyptian [[Famine Stela]], which dates from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]] (305–30 B.C.), bears an inscription containing a legend about a famine lasting seven years during the reign of [[Djoser]]. Imhotep is credited with having been instrumental in ending it.  One of his priests explained the connection between the god [[Khnum]] and the rise of the [[Nile]] to the king, who then had a dream in which the Nile god spoke to him, promising to end the drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/famine_stele.htm |title=The Famine Stele on the Island of Sehel |publisher=Reshafim.org.il |date= |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] papyrus from the temple of [[Tebtunis]], dating to the 2nd century A.D., preserves a long story about Imhotep.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Ryholt]], 'The Life of Imhotep?', ''Actes du IXe Congrès International des Études Démotiques'', edited by G. Widmer and D. Devauchelle, Bibliothèque d'étude 147, Le Caire, Institut français d'archéologie orientale, 2009, pp. 305–15.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Djoser]] plays a prominent role in the story, which also mentions Imhotep's family; his father the god [[Ptah]], his mother Khereduankh, and his younger sister Renpetneferet. At one point Djoser desires Renpetneferet, and Imhotep disguises himself and tries to rescue her. The text also refers to the royal tomb of Djoser. Part of the legend includes an anachronistic battle between the Old Kingdom and the Assyrian armies where Imhotep fights an [[Assyria]]n sorceress in a duel of magic.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As an instigator of Egyptian culture, Imhotep's idealized image lasted well into the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. In the Ptolemaic period, the Egyptian priest and historian [[Manetho]] credited him with inventing the method of a stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Stone walling, flooring, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and jambs had appeared sporadically during the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Archaic Period]], though it is true that a building of the size of the step pyramid made entirely out of stone had never before been constructed. Prior to Djoser, pharaohs were buried in [[mastaba]] tombs.

===Medicine===
Egyptologist [[James Peter Allen]] states that "The Greeks equated him with their own god of medicine, [[Asklepios]], although ironically there is no evidence that Imhotep himself was a physician."&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=James Peter|title=The Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300107289|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jNbVl5LOjHUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Edwin+Smith+Papyrus+Imhotep#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Imhotep&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lok Biradari Prakalp''' ('''LBP''') ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]; '''[[Baradari (brotherhood)|Brotherhood]] of People project''') is a social project of the ''Maharogi Sewa Samiti'', Warora involving a hospital, a school and an animal orphanage.&lt;ref name = LBP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lokbiradariprakalp.org/about-us/| title = About us| publisher =Lok Biradari Prakalp}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started on 23 December 1973, by the social worker [[Baba Amte]] for integrated development of [[Madia Gond]]. It is in [[Hemalkasa]], [[Bhamragad]] taluka in [[Gadchiroli District]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. 

Dr. [[Prakash Amte]] and his wife Dr. Mandakini Amte, who serve as the medical director and medical officer at the project respectively, were awarded the 2008 [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Community Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Citation for Prakash Amte and Mandakini Amte|publisher= [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] | url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationAmtes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Davakhana ==
Davakhana means clinic in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. In this project, primary health care has been given top priority. Six sub-centres were started in the interior forest area, geographically wide apart from the main hospital; three are still functional. 

The early years of the project entailed a massive struggle in the difficult conditions of a thick and remote forest. The centre, started in 1973, has recently developed into a full-fledged hospital of 40 beds and caters to over 45,000 patients annually. At Hemalkasa the hospital is ensconced in the surrounding dense forest, where the Madia Gond tribal patients feel most comfortable in recuperating. Hundreds of patients come daily to the hospital traversing long and difficult terrain sometimes on foot.

== Ashram Shala ==
[[Image:Hall of fame.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A board in the school office. It lists academic and sports achievements of its students and alumni]]
An [[ashram#Schools in Maharashtra|ashram shala]] or a residential school was started in 1976 for the tribal children now having classes from 1st to 12th Standard, giving free education to over 600 students. They are provided with free lodging and boarding facilities. All education material is also provided free of cost to them. Apart from formal education, they are provided vocational training and guidance, which will be useful in their day-to-day life, e.g., practical training in farming, seed production, dairy, bamboo craft, ceramic art, greeting cards, tailoring, health education, etc. These programmes are aimed at the survival of the tribals to bring about awareness of social rights and duties through continued dialogue and social exposure.

43 students of the school appeared for the 2007-2008 Secondary School Certificate Examination, held by the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. 36 students passed, a pass percentage of 83.72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mahresult.nic.in/ssc2008/divi2/S2-SCHOL.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206180602/http://mahresult.nic.in/ssc2008/divi2/S2-SCHOL.HTM |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the state passing percentage was 86.33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mahresult.nic.in/ssc2008/SS-OVALL.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205160704/http://mahresult.nic.in/ssc2008/SS-OVALL.htm |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dada Panchal with monitor lizard 6 x 4.JPG|thumb|right|Dada Panchal, retired headmaster of the LBP's primary school nursing a [[monitor lizard]] at the Amte's Animal Arc]]
A small sheltered enclosure has been formed at Hemalkasa to keep orphaned babies of wild animals, thereby protecting them from being killed for food. The Hemalkasa community of workers live in complete harmony with a great diversity of wild animals in this relatively undisturbed, thick forest. Amte’s Animal Ark – Orphanage cum Rescue Center at Hemalkasa includes leopards, bears, snakes, deer, wild boars, crocodiles, lions, etc.

''Negal I'' and  ''Negal II'' are books based upon real stories of leopards who grew here. Authored by Vilas Balkrishna Manohar, volunteer with the Lok Biradari Prakalp, the books describe his experience living with wild animals including [[big cats]]. He wrote two more books, ''Eka Nakshalwadya Cha Janma'' and ''Nari Bhakshak''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QA1V7sICaIwC&amp;pg=PA723&amp;lpg=PA723&amp;dq=vilas+manohar+writer&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iZo851RPGh&amp;sig=uEHP-KtmRvUV1iO8KLsoKHx9ccU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e-ucSeCrOo_akAWtjPiiBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Who's Who of Indian Writers, 1999 by K.

The '''Danish Ministry of Health''' is responsible for [[healthcare]] policy in Denmark. First created as an independent ministry in 1926, it has at various times been combined with the [[Ministry of the Interior (Denmark)|Ministry of the Interior]] as the [[Ministry of Interior and Health (Denmark)|Ministry of Interior and Health]], most recently in 2010–2011, and has had various names. From June 2015 to November 2016 its official name was the '''Ministry of Health and the Aged''' ({{lang-da|'''Sundheds- og Ældreministeriet'''}}). The current Minister of Health is [[Ellen Trane Nørby]]; the [[Permanent Secretary (Denmark)|Permanent Secretary]] is {{Interlanguage link multi|Per Okkels|da}}.

== Responsibilities ==
The ministry oversees all aspects of healthcare in Denmark, including hospitals, medical treatments, dispensaries, patient rights, healthcare data collection and medical and research ethics.

== History ==
The ministry was first created in 1926, and since then has several times been merged with the Ministry of the Interior and re-established under various official names. In modern times it was first re-established in September 1987,&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sum.dk/Om-ministeriet/Ministeriets-historie.aspx |title=Ministeriets historie |publisher=Sundheds- og Ældreministeriet |language=Danish |accessdate=15 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibilities drawn in part from other ministries, including oversight over foodstuffs, anti-narcotics and anti-alcohol efforts, education of medical personnel, and health care in [[Greenland]]—some of these were later reassigned—and was recombined with the Ministry of the Interior in November 2001. In November 2007 it again became an independent ministry under the name Ministerium for Sundhed og Forebyggelse (Ministry for Health and Prevention), taking on some responsibilities from the Family Ministry, which was dissolved; the Ministry of the Interior, in turn, was merged into a new [[Ministry of Welfare (Denmark)|Ministry of Welfare]] (Velfærdsministerium).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 2010 the combined Ministry of Interior and Health was again reconstituted, but the following year the Ministry of the Interior was included in a new {{Interlanguage link multi|Ministry of the Economy and the Interior|da|3=Økonomi- og Indenrigsministeriet}} while the Ministry of Health once more became the Ministry for Health and Prevention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15398">'''Miriam Dorothy (Posner) Finkel''' (22 January 1916 – 20 August 1999) was a [[radiobiologist]] who made significant contributions to molecular biology.

==Biography==
Miriam Dorothy (Miriam Dvorah) Posner was born on 22 January 1916 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to parents that had emigrated from [[Russia]]. Her parents were Jacob Posner and Harriet M. Posner.&lt;ref&gt;United States Census, 1930. Database with images. FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XMKM-MQT: accessed 16 August 2015). Miriam Posner in household of Jacob Posner. Davenport, Scott, Iowa, United States. National Archives and Records Administration. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; She married Asher Finkel. Finkel died on 20 August 1999 at home in [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Social Security Death Index. FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V9K2-HZ7: accessed 16 August 2015. Miriam P Finkel, 20 Aug 1999; citing U.S. Social Security Administration. Death Master File, database. Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkel grew up in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. She attended the [[University of Chicago]] and in 1938 earned a B.S. in [[zoology]]. She worked as a laboratory instructor at Wilson Junior College in Chicago while she pursued doctoral studies and coursework in zoology. In 1944, she was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Miriam Posner. (1945). The relation of sex hormones to pigmentation and to testis descent in the opossum and ground squirrel. American Journal of Anatomy. 76(1): 93-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, C.A. (1 Aug 2000). In memoriam: Miriam Dorothy (Posner) Finkel (1916-1999). Radiation Research. 154(2):  224-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkel worked at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] as a radiobiologist.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, Ruth H. &amp; Herzenberg, Caroline L. (22 May 2003). Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project. Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of her career, she worked at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. She was a member of the American Biological Society.

Finkel made significant contributions to several [[radiation protection|radiological health]] standards including work on the basis of [[relative biological effectiveness]] for [[Radiobiology#Internal|internal exposure]] to [[radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, M. P. (1953). Relative biological effectiveness of radium and other alpha emitters in CF No. 1 female mice. Experimental Biology and Medicine, 83(3), 494-498.&lt;/ref&gt;
Finkel lent her name to the Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins or FBJ virus. Through her work and that of her colleagues, she was able to isolate the [[FOSB|murine osteogenic sarcoma virus]], now known as the Finkel-Biskis-Jenkins or FBJ virus. This and other pursuits resulted in discoveries in viral-induced tumors and resulted in the [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] tool, the [[c-Fos|FOS gene]].

The '''National Policy and Legal Analysis Network to Prevent Childhood Obesity''', or '''NPLAN''' for short, is a nonprofit organization funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], and which, according to its website, plays an important role in the Foundation's effort to reverse the obesity epidemic by 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/content/co-about About NPLAN]&lt;/ref&gt; a commitment that was announced in 2007.&lt;ref name=Lawyers&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2722393 | pmid=19527596 | volume=6 | title=A special role for lawyers in a social norm change movement: from tobacco control to childhood obesity prevention | journal=Prev Chronic Dis | page=A95 | last1 = Graff | first1 = S | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their partners include, in addition to the RWJF, [[Active Living by Design]] and the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/content/co-partners Our Partners]&lt;/ref&gt; They are run by ChangeLab Solutions, originally known as Public Health Law and Policy,&lt;ref name=Lawyers/&gt; which focuses not only on obesity but also on tobacco regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/about-us About ChangeLab Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; The NPLAN advocates for a [[soda tax]], specifically an excise tax, and have published model legislation which earmarks the funds raised to go to programs to prevent and treat obesity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/publications/ssb-model-tax-legislation Model Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[American Public Health Association]], they provide "legal technical assistance focused on childhood obesity prevention policy." The Network has also "developed model menu labeling ordinances, requiring chain restaurants to post calorie and other nutrition information on menus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apha.org/membergroups/newsletters/sectionnewsletters/comm/spring09/fightingobesity.htm Fighting Childhood Obesity Through Local Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; NPLAN has advocated for the use of licensing and zoning laws to "shape the way land is used and how businesses operate,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/publications/licensing-zoning Licensing and Zoning: Tools for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; and has praised regulations requiring nutrition standards on foods sold in snack machines in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://changelabsolutions.org/news/nplan-calls-usda-rule-strong-step-right-direction NPLAN calls USDA rule strong step in right direction]&lt;/ref&gt; According to their website, they "work on four broad issue areas: healthy community food systems, healthy schools, healthy land use planning, and [[food marketing]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nplan.rhine.rockriverstar.com/nplan/content/nplan-101 NPLAN 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Bar Association]]'s director of public health and policy Marice Ashe wrote the following soon after the NPLAN's founding was announced: "NPLAN will serve as an incubator where lawyers, policymakers, advocates, and scientists collaborate to produce legal and policy tools and resources. As research and products are developed, NPLAN will also operate as a national one-stop source for access to practical, efficient, and effective legal technical assistance products."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/ashe.html Legal and Policy Resources to Prevent Childhood Obesity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine dependence is defined as a neurobiological adaptation to repeated drug exposure that is manifested behaviorally by highly controlled or compulsive use; psychoactive effects such as tolerance, physical dependence, and pleasant effect; and nicotine-reinforced behavior, including an inability to quit despite harmful effects, a desire to quit, and repeated cessation attempts.&lt;ref name=SGUSReport2016&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General|url=https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/documents/2016_SGR_Full_Report_non-508.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|agency=[[Surgeon General of the United States]]|year=2016}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine dependence is a chronic, relapsing disease defined as a [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]] craving to use the drug, despite harmful social consequences; inability to control drug use; and onset of withdrawal-like symptoms when the drug is discontinued.&lt;ref name=FalconeLee2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falcone|first1=Mary|last2=Lee|first2=Bridgin|last3=Lerman|first3=Caryn|last4=Blendy|first4=Julie A.|title=Translational Research on Nicotine Dependence|volume=28|year=2015|pages=121–150|issn=1866-3370|doi=10.1007/7854_2015_5005|pmid=26873019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] report states, "Tolerance" is another aspect of drug addiction [dependence] whereby a given dose of a drug produces less effect or increasing doses are required to achieve a specified intensity of response.

== Diagnosis ==
There are different ways of measuring nicotine dependence.&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt; The five common [[substance dependence|dependence]] assessment scales are the [[Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence]], the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', the Cigarette Dependence Scale, the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives.&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt;

The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence focuses on measuring physical dependence which is defined "as a state produced by chronic drug administration, which is revealed by the occurrence of signs of physiological dysfunction when the drug is withdrawn; further, this dysfunction can be reversed by the administration of drug".&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piper|first1=Megan|last2=McCarthy|first2=Danielle|last3=Baker|first3=Timothy|title=Assessing tobacco dependence: A guide to measure evaluation and selection|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research|volume=8|issue=3|year=2006|pages=339–351|issn=1462-2203|doi=10.1080/14622200600672765|pmid=16801292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long use of Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is supported by the existence of significant preexisting research, and its conciseness.&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt;

The 4th edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV (1994)|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV)]] had a nicotine dependence diagnosis which was defines as "...a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms..."&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt; In the updated ''[[DSM-5]]'' there is no nicotine dependence diagnosis, but rather Tobacco Use Disorder, which is defined as, "A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least 2 of the following [11 symptoms], occurring within a 12-month period."&lt;ref name=APA2013&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5®)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ|date=22 May 2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-0-89042-557-2|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cigarette Dependence Scale was developed "to index dependence outcomes and not dependence mechanisms".&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt; The Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, "a 19-item self-report measure, was developed as a multidimensional scale to assess nicotine dependence".&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt; The Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives "is a 68-item measure developed to assess dependence as a motivational state".&lt;ref name=PiperMcCarthy2006/&gt;

Traditional cigarettes are the most common delivery device for nicotine.{{CN|date=October 2018}} However, [[electronic cigarette]]s are becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=Payne2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=JD|last2=Orellana-Barrios|first2=M|last3=Medrano-Juarez|first3=R|last4=Buscemi|first4=D|last5=Nugent|first5=K|title=Electronic cigarettes in the media.|journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent).|year=2016|pmc=4900769|pmid=27365871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine can also be delivered via other tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, snus, pipe tobacco, hookah, all of which can produce nicotine dependence.{{CN|date=October 2018}}

=== Psychosocial ===
In addition to the specific neurological changes in nicotinic receptors, there are other changes that occur as dependence develops.{{CN|date=October 2018}} Through various conditioning mechanisms ([[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[classical conditioning|cue/classical]]), smoking comes to be associated with different mood and cognitive states as well as external contexts and cues.&lt;ref name=Martin-Soelch2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin-Soelch|first1=Chantal|title=Neuroadaptive Changes Associated with Smoking: Structural and Functional Neural Changes in Nicotine Dependence|journal=Brain Sciences|volume=3|issue=1|year=2013|pages=159–176|issn=2076-3425|doi=10.3390/brainsci3010159|pmc=4061825|pmid=24961312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
There are treatments for nicotine dependence, although the majority of the evidence focuses on treatments for cigarette smokers rather than people who use other forms of tobacco (e.g., [[chewing tobacco|chew]], [[snus]], [[pipe tobacco|pipes]], [[hookah]], e-cigarettes).{{CN|date=September 2016}} [[Evidence-based medicine]] can double or triple a smoker's chances of quitting successfully.&lt;ref name=Fiore2008/&gt;

=== Medication ===
There are eight major evidence-based medications for treating nicotine dependence: [[bupropion]], [[cytisine]] (not approved for use in some countries, including the US), [[nicotine gum]], [[nicotine inhaler]], [[nicotine lozenge|nicotine lozenge/mini-lozenge]], [[nicotine nasal spray]], [[nicotine patch]], and [[varenicline]].&lt;ref name=Hartmann-Boyce2013/&gt; These medications have been shown to significantly improve long-term (i.e., 6-months post-quit day) abstinence rates, especially when used in combination with psychosocial treatment.&lt;ref name=Fiore2008/&gt; The [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement treatments]] (i.e., patch, lozenge, gum) are dosed based on how dependent a smoker is—people who smoke more cigarettes or who smoke earlier in the morning use higher doses of nicotine replacement treatments.{{CN|date=October 2018}} There is no consensus for remedies for tobacco use disorder among pregnant smokers who also use alcohol and stimulants.&lt;ref name=AkermanBrunette2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akerman|first1=Sarah C.|last2=Brunette|first2=Mary F.|last3=Green|first3=Alan I.|last4=Goodman|first4=Daisy J.|last5=Blunt|first5=Heather B.|last6=Heil|first6=Sarah H.|title=Treating Tobacco Use Disorder in Pregnant Women in Medication-Assisted Treatment for an Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment|volume=52|year=2015|pages=40–47|issn=07405472|doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2014.12.002|pmc=4382443|pmid=25592332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial ===
Psychosocial interventions delivered in-person (individually or in a group) or over the phone (including mobile phone interventions) have been shown to effectively treat nicotine dependence.&lt;ref name=Hartmann-Boyce2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartmann-Boyce|first1=J|last2=Stead|first2=LF|last3=Cahill|first3=K|last4=Lancaster|first4=T|title=Efficacy of interventions to combat tobacco addiction: Cochrane update of 2012 reviews.|journal=Addiction|date=October 2013|volume=108|issue=10|pages=1711-21|pmid=23834141}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interventions focus on providing support for quitting and helping with smokers with problem-solving and developing healthy responses for coping with cravings, negative moods, and other situations that typically lead to relapse.{{CN|date=October 2018}} The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions has been shown to be especially effective.&lt;ref name=Fiore2008/&gt;

'''Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections''' ('''PANDAS''') is a hypothesis that there exists a subset of children with rapid onset of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) or [[tic disorder]]s and these symptoms are caused by [[Group A streptococcal infection|group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt; The proposed link between infection and these disorders is that an initial [[autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]] to a GABHS infection produces antibodies that interfere with [[basal ganglia]] function, causing symptom exacerbations. It has been proposed that this autoimmune response can result in a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name= deOliveira2010/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boileau2011/&gt;

The PANDAS hypothesis was based on observations in clinical case studies  at the US [[National Institutes of Health]] and in subsequent clinical trials where children appeared to have dramatic and sudden OCD exacerbations and tic disorders following infections.&lt;ref name=Pichichero2009 /&gt;   There is supportive evidence for the link between ''streptococcus'' infection and onset in some cases of OCD and [[tic]]s, but proof of causality has remained elusive.&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulman2009&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shulman ST |title=Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS): update |journal=Curr.

== Characteristics ==
In addition to an OCD or tic disorder diagnosis, children may have other symptoms associated with exacerbations such as emotional lability, [[enuresis]], anxiety, and deterioration in handwriting.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt; In the PANDAS model, this abrupt onset is thought to be preceded by a [[Group A streptococcal infection|strep]] throat infection. As the clinical spectrum of PANDAS appears to resemble that of Tourette's syndrome, some researchers hypothesized that PANDAS and Tourette's may be associated; this idea is controversial and a focus for current research.&lt;ref name=Boileau2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cortese2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Felling2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertson2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2011/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The PANDAS diagnosis and the hypothesis that symptoms in this subgroup of patients are caused by infection are controversial.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boileau2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boileau B |title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents |journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=401–11 |year=2011 |pmid=22275846 |pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Felling2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Felling RJ, Singer HS |title=Neurobiology of tourette syndrome: current status and need for further investigation |journal=J.

Whether the group of patients diagnosed with PANDAS have developed tics and OCD through a different mechanism (pathophysiology) than seen in other people diagnosed with Tourette syndrome is unclear.&lt;ref name=Robertson2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalra2009/&gt;  Researchers are pursuing the hypothesis that the mechanism is similar to that of [[rheumatic fever]], an autoimmune disorder triggered by streptococcal infections, where antibodies attack the brain and cause neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt;

The [[molecular mimicry]] hypothesis is a proposed mechanism for PANDAS:&lt;ref name=Lombroso2008/&gt; this hypothesis is that [[antigen]]s on the cell wall of the streptococcal bacteria are similar in some way to the [[protein]]s of the heart valve, joints, or brain. Because the antibodies set off an immune reaction which damages those [[biological tissue|tissue]]s, the child with rheumatic fever can get heart disease (especially [[mitral valve]] regurgitation), [[arthritis]], and/or abnormal movements known as [[Sydenham's chorea]] or "St. Vitus' Dance".&lt;ref name=Bonthius2003&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bonthius D, Karacay B |title=Sydenham's chorea: not gone and not forgotten |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=11–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12785743 |doi=10.1016/S1071-9091(02)00004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a typical [[bacteria]]l infection, the body produces [[antibody|antibodies]] against the invading bacteria, and the antibodies help eliminate the bacteria from the body. In some rheumatic fever patients, autoantibodies may attack heart tissue, leading to carditis, or cross-react with joints, leading to arthritis.&lt;ref name=Lombroso2008/&gt;  In PANDAS, it is believed that tics and OCD are produced in a similar manner. One part of the brain that may be affected in PANDAS is the [[basal ganglia]], which is believed to be responsible for movement and behavior. It is thought that similar to Sydenham's chorea, the antibodies cross-react with neuronal brain tissue in the basal ganglia to cause the tics and OCD that characterize PANDAS.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt;&lt;ref name = LeckmanBloch2009/&gt; Studies neither disprove nor support this hypothesis: the strongest supportive evidence comes from a controlled study of 144 children (Mell ''et al'', 2005), but prospective longitudinal studies have not produced conclusive results.&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
According to Lombroso and Scahill, 2008, "(f)ive diagnostic criteria were proposed for PANDAS: (1) the presence of a tic disorder and/or OCD consistent with DSM-IV; (2) prepubertal onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms; (3) a history of a sudden onset of symptoms and/or an episodic course with abrupt symptom exacerbation interspersed with periods of partial or complete remission; (4) evidence of a temporal association between onset or exacerbation of symptoms and a prior streptococcal infection; and (5)  adventitious movements (e.g., motoric hyperactivity and choreiform movements) during symptom exacerbation".&lt;ref name=Lombroso2008/&gt; The children, originally described by Swedo ''et al'' in 1998, usually have dramatic, "overnight" onset of symptoms, including motor or vocal [[tic]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsession]]s, and/or compulsions.&lt;ref name=Swedo1998&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Swedo SE, Leonard HL, Garvey M, etal |title=Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections: clinical description of the first 50 cases |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=264–71 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9464208 |url= http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=155&amp;page=264 |doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have supported acute exacerbations associated with streptococcal infections among clinically defined PANDAS subjects (Murphy and Pichichero, 2002; Giulino ''et al'', 2002); others have not (Luo ''et al'', 2004; Perrin ''et al'', 2004).&lt;ref name=Moretti2008&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moretti G, Pasquini M, Mandarelli G, Tarsitani L, Biondi M |title=What every psychiatrist should know about PANDAS: a review |journal=Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health |volume=4|issue=1 |pages=13 |year=2008 |pmid=18495013 |pmc=2413218 |doi=10.1186/1745-0179-4-13 |url=http://cpementalhealth.com/content/4/1/13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that PANDAS may be overdiagnosed, as a significant number of patients diagnosed with PANDAS by community physicians did not meet the criteria when examined by specialists, suggesting the PANDAS diagnosis is conferred by community physicians without conclusive evidence.&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Leckman JF, Denys D, Simpson HB, etal |title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: a review of the diagnostic criteria and possible subtypes and dimensional specifiers for DSM-V |journal=Depress Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=507–27 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20217853 |doi=10.1002/da.20669 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Anxiety,%20OC%20Spectrum,%20PTSD,%20and%20DD%20Group/OC%20Spectrum%20Disorders/Leckman%20et%20al_OCD.PDF|format=PDF|pmc=3974619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShulmanOD&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shulman ST |title=Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS): update |journal=Curr.

PANDAS is hypothesized to be an [[autoimmune disorder]] that results in a variable combination of tics, obsessions, compulsions, and other symptoms that may be severe enough to qualify for diagnoses such as chronic tic disorder, OCD, and [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS or TD). The cause is thought to be akin to that of [[Sydenham's chorea]], which is known to result from childhood [[Group A streptococcal infection|Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection]] leading to the autoimmune disorder [[acute rheumatic fever]] of which Sydenham's is one manifestation. Like Sydenham's, PANDAS is thought to involve autoimmunity to the brain's [[basal ganglia]]. Unlike Sydenham's, PANDAS is not associated with other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever, such as [[inflammation of the heart]].&lt;ref name=Pichichero2009&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pichichero ME |title=The PANDAS syndrome |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |volume=634 |pages=205–16 |year=2009 |pmid=19280860 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxfTmEAqdAoC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=pichichero |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-79837-0|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79838-7_17|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |quote= PANDAS is not yet a validated nosological construct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pichechero notes that PANDAS has not been validated as a disease classification, for several reasons. Its proposed age of onset and clinical features reflect a particular group of patients chosen for research studies, with no systematic studies of the possible relationship of GAS to other neurologic symptoms. There is controversy over whether its symptom of choreiform movements is distinct from the similar movements of Sydenham's. It is not known whether the pattern of abrupt onset is specific to PANDAS. Finally, there is controversy over whether there is a temporal relationship between GAS infections and PANDAS symptoms.&lt;ref name=Pichichero2009/&gt;

To establish that a disorder is an autoimmune disorder, [[Ernst Witebsky|Witebsky criteria]] require 
# that there be a self-reactive antibody, 
# that a particular target for the antibody is identified (autoantigen) 
# that the disorder can be caused in animals and 
# that transferring antibodies from one animal to another triggers the disorder (passive transfer).&lt;ref name=Giavannoni2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giavannoni G|title=PANDAS: overview of the hypothesis|journal=Adv Neurol |year=2006 |volume=99 |pages=159–65 |pmid=16536362 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhE74A1fTQkC&amp;pg=PA160| publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| isbn=0-7817-9970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, to show that a microorganism causes the disorder, the [[Koch's postulates|Koch postulates]] would require one show that the organism is present in all cases of the disorder, that the organism can be extracted from those with the disorder and be cultured, that transferring the organism into healthy subjects causes the disorder, and the organism can be reisolated from the infected party.&lt;ref name=Giavannoni2006 /&gt; Giovanonni notes that the Koch postulates cannot be used in the case of postinfection disorders (such as PANDAS and SC) because the organism may no longer be present when symptoms emerge, multiple organisms may cause the symptoms, and the symptoms may be a rare reaction to a common pathogen.&lt;ref name=Giavannoni2006 /&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment for children suspected of PANDAS is generally the same as the standard treatments for TS and OCD.&lt;ref name= deOliveira2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Oliveira SK, Pelajo CF |title=Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS): a Controversial Diagnosis |journal=Curr Infect Dis Rep |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=103–9 |date=March 2010 |pmid=21308506 |doi=10.1007/s11908-010-0082-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalra2009/&gt; These include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and medications to treat OCD such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs);&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalra2009/&gt; and "conventional therapy for tics".&lt;ref name= deOliveira2010/&gt;

A controlled study (Garvey, Perlmutter, ''et al'', 1999) of prophylactic antibiotic treatment of 37 children found that [[Phenoxymethylpenicillin|penicillin V]] did not prevent GABHS infections or exacerbation of other symptoms; however, compliance was an issue in this study. A later study (Snider, Lougee, ''et al'', 2005) found that penicillin and [[azithromycin]] decreased infections and symptom exacerbation. The sample size, controls, and methodology of that study were criticized.&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt; Murphy, Kurlan and Leckman (2010) say, "The use of prophylactic antibiotics to treat PANDAS has become widespread in the community, although the evidence supporting their use is equivocal. The safety and efficacy of antibiotic therapy for patients meeting the PANDAS criteria needs to be determined in carefully designed trials";&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt;  de Oliveira and Pelajo (2009) say that because most studies to date have "methodologic issues, including small sample size, retrospective reports of the baseline year, and lack of an adequate placebo arm  ... it is recommended to treat these patients only with conventional therapy".&lt;ref name= deOliveira2010/&gt;

Evidence is insufficient to determine if tonsillectomy is effective.&lt;ref name= deOliveira2010/&gt;

===Experimental treatments===
Prophylactic antibiotic treatments for tics and OCD are experimental&lt;ref name=Shulman2009 /&gt; and controversial;&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5/&gt; overdiagnosis of PANDAS may have led to overuse of antibiotics to treat tics or OCD in the absence of active infection.&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5/&gt;

A single study of PANDAS patients showed efficacy of immunomodulatory therapy ([[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) or [[Plasmapheresis|plasma exchange]]) to symptoms,&lt;ref name=Moretti2008/&gt; but these results are unreplicated by independent studies as of 2010.&lt;ref name=Lombroso2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeckmanDSM5/&gt; Kalra and Swedo wrote in 2009, "Because IVIG and plasma exchange both carry a substantial risk of adverse effects, use of these modalities should be reserved for children with particularly severe symptoms and a clear-cut PANDAS presentation.&lt;ref name=Kalra2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalra SK, Swedo SE |title=Children with obsessive-compulsive disorder: are they just "little adults"? |journal=J.

==Society and culture==
The debate surrounding the PANDAS hypothesis has societal implications; the media and the Internet have played a role in the PANDAS controversy.&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swerdlow2005/&gt; Swerdlow (2005) summarized the societal implications of the hypothesis, and the role of the Internet in the controversy surrounding the PANDAS hypothesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;perhaps the most controversial putative TS trigger is exposure to streptococcal infections. The ubiquity of strep throats, the tremendous societal implications of over-treatment (e.g., antibiotic resistance or immunosuppressant side effects) versus medical implications of under-treatment (e.g., potentially irreversible autoimmune neurologic injury) are serious matters. With the level of desperation among Internet-armed parents, this controversy has sparked contentious disagreements, too often lacking both objectivity and civility.&lt;ref name=Swerdlow2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swerdlow NR |title=Tourette syndrome: current controversies and the battlefield landscape |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=329–31 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16131414 |doi=10.1007/s11910-005-0054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy, Kurlan and Leckman (2010) also discussed the influence of the media and the Internet in a paper that proposed a "way forward":&lt;blockquote&gt;The potential link between common childhood infections and lifelong neuropsychiatric disorders is among the most tantalizing and clinically relevant concepts in modern neuroscience ... The link may be most relevant in this group of disorders collectively described as PANDAS. Of concern, public awareness has outpaced our scientific knowledge base, with multiple magazine and newspaper articles and Internet chat rooms calling this issue to the public's attention. Compared with ~ 200 reports listed on Medline—many involving a single patient, and others reporting the same patients in different papers, with most of these reporting on subjects who do not meet the current PANDAS criteria—there are over 100,000 sites on the Internet where the possible ''Streptococcus''–OCD–TD relationship is discussed. This gap between public interest in PANDAS and conclusive evidence supporting this link calls for increased scientific attention to the relationship between GAS and OCD/tics, particularly examining basic underlying cellular and immune mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Murphy2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy TK, Kurlan R, Leckman J |title=The immunobiology of Tourette's disorder, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus, and related disorders: a way forward |journal=J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=317–31 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20807070 |doi=10.1089/cap.2010.0043|pmc=4003464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Susan Swedo first described the entity in 1998.&lt;ref name=Swedo1998 /&gt; In 2008 Lombroso and Scahill described five diagnostic criteria for PANDAS.&lt;ref name=Lombroso2008 /&gt; Revised criteria and guidelines for PANDAS was established by the NIMH in 2012 and updated in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised Treatment Guidelines Released for Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS/PANDAS)|url=http://www.liebertpub.com/global/pressrelease/revised-treatment-guidelines-released-for-pediatric-acute-onset-neuropsychiatric-syndrome-pans-pandas/2223/|website=www.liebertpub.com|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines published for treating PANS/PANDAS|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2017/guidelines-published-for-treating-pans-pandas.shtml|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|publisher=NIMH|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research directions ==
In a 2010 paper calling for "a way forward", Murphy, Kurlan and Leckman said: "It is time for the National Institutes of Health, in combination with advocacy and professional organizations, to convene a panel of experts not to debate the current data, but to chart a way forward. For now we have only to offer our standard therapies in treating OCD and tics, but one day we may have evidence that also allows us to add antibiotics or other immune-specific treatments to our armamentarium."&lt;ref name=Murphy2010/&gt; A 2011 paper by Singer proposed a new, "broader concept of ''childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms'' (CANS)", removing some of the PANDAS criteria in favor or requiring only acute-onset.  Singer said there were "numerous causes for CANS", which was proposed because of the "inconclusive and conflicting scientific support" for PANDAS, including "strong evidence suggesting the absence of an important role for GABHS, a failure to apply published [PANDAS] criteria, and a lack of scientific support for proposed therapies".&lt;ref name=CANS&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singer HS, Gilbert DL, Wolf DS, Mink JW, Kurlan R |title=Moving from PANDAS to CANS |journal=J Pediatr |volume= 160|issue= 5|pages= 725–31|date=December 2011 |pmid=22197466 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.11.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polavaram Project,''' is an underconstruction multi-purpose [[irrigation]] project on the [[Godavari River]] in the [[West Godavari District]] and [[East Godavari District]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The project has been accorded national project status by the [[Government of India|Union Government of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/National%20Projects.pdf|title= List of national projects, |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrmin.nic.in/forms/list.aspx?lid=380|title= Indirasagar (Polavaram) Project, Ministry of water resources, GoI|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be the last to be accorded the status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/all+india+times+english-epaper-indtimen/andhra+pradesh+polavaram+will+be+the+last+project+with+national+project+status+nitin+gadkari-newsid-94319940|title=Andhra Pradesh "Polavaram" Will Be The Last Project With National Project Status: Nitin Gadkari|last=|first=|date=|work=All India Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reservoir spreads into parts of [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Odisha]] States also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/over-60000-acres-yet-to-be-acquired-for-polavaram/article22432232.ece |title= Over 60,000 acres yet to be acquired for Polavaram|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandrp.in/dams/polavrm_article.pdf |title= Agitation against Polavaram, SANDRP|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, then [[Praja Rajyam Party]] chief, [[Chiranjeevi]] demanded national status for the Polavaram Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/National-status-for-Polavaram-project-demanded/article16037278.ece|title=National status for Polavaram project demanded|date=2010-05-19|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polavaram Project Authority was constituted by the Union Cabinet in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mowr.gov.in/schemes-projects-programmes/projects/polavaram-project-authority|title=Polavaram Project Authority|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the state was bifurcated under the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act]].

In December 2017, it was reported that the project contractor, Transstroy was seeking a deadline extension and a budget escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/131217/transstroy-sets-new-terms-for-polavaram.html|title=Transstroy sets new terms for Polavaram|date=2017-12-13|work=Deccan Chronicle|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transstroy was reported to have its Rs. 4,300 crore loan turn NPA in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/company-buys-luxury-cars-soon-turns-npa/99940/|title=Transstroy buys luxury cars, soon turns NPA|date=2015-07-13|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the state government signed a new contract for the project spillway, spill channel and stilling basin concrete work with [[Navayuga Engineering Company Limited|Navayuga Engineering]].

In a review meeting in February 2018, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu was informed that the project was 53% ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2018/feb/13/all-polavaram-details-available-on-website-government-1772462.html|title=All Polavaram details available on website: Government|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mountains in Godavari.jpg|thumb|left|[[Papi Hills]] on both sides of Godavari]]

In July 1941, the first conceptual proposal for the project came from the erstwhile [[Madras Presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/75-years-on-polavaram-project-remains-jinxed/article6964834.ece|title=75 years on, Polavaram project remains jinxed|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Rao Bahadur|Diwan Bahadur]] [[L. Venkatakrishna Iyer]], then chief engineer in the Presidency's irrigation department, made the first survey of the project site and made a definitive proposal for a reservoir at Polavaram. Sri Iyer not only visioned cultivation of {{convert|350000|acre}} over two crop seasons through this project, but also planned for a 40 [[megawatt]] [[hydroelectric]] plant within the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/can-andhra-pradesh-cm-chandrababu-naidu-deliver-four-decade-old-polavaram-project-within-next-2-years/articleshow/56707243.cms|title=Can Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu deliver four-decade old Polavaram project on time?|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire project was estimated to cost about {{INR}}6.5&amp;nbsp; crore.

By 1946–47, the estimated cost rose to {{INR}}129&amp;nbsp; crore. It was named the "Ramapada Sagar Project" since the backwaters of the reservoir would touch the Lord Rama temple at Bhadrachalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/letters/polavaram-project/article6210433.ece|title=Polavaram project|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the old finalised project design by Dr. [[K.L.

The project presently under construction is scaled down to FRL {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} MSL.

==Alternate site==
The dam could not be taken up for construction during the last century on techno economical grounds. The proposed dam site at Polavaram is located where the river emerges from the last range of the [[Eastern Ghats]] into plains covered with deep alluvial sandy strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/lreleng/lyr2000/rnov2000/r28112000.html|title=UTILISATION OF GODAVARI WATER|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Polavaram, the river width is about 1500 m. In view of large depth of excavation which is more than 30 m deep, to reach hard rock at this dam site, the dam project was not found economical to take up. However a lucrative alternate site is feasible located in upstream of Polavaram site where the river passes through deep gorges of Papi hill range.&lt;ref name="Sites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwda.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/6907034768.pdf |title= Salient design data of Polavaram project, National Water Development Authority, GoI|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of river is about 300 m only in the rocky gorge stretch. Thirty years back, this alternative was found technologically challenging task to connect the reservoir with the irrigation canals via tunnels across the ghat area. Also costly underground hydro electric station is mandated compared to river bed based hydro electric station.
When the project was actually taken up in the year 2004, the old finalised designs at Polavaram site are adopted without re-examining the latest cost of upstream alternate site in view of state of the art construction technology of tunnels and underground hydro electric station. The progress up to the year 2012 in construction of dam structures and the hydro electric station is almost nil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ppms.cgg.gov.in/jsp/login/login.jsp;jsessionid=1F89D6A98D4FCC0E155F527323062913  |title=  Irrigation projects status in Andhra Pradesh, AP Govt.|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternate site located in the gorge stretch is still worth of re-examination to reduce the ever-increasing cost of Polavaram dam.

The spillway and non-overflow dam are founded on [[Khondalite]] bed rock in Polavaram Project.&lt;ref name="Sites"/&gt; Khondalites, which are feldspar-rich, often contain soft graphite, hard garnet, etc. in addition to other minerals.

== Technical details ==
The project reservoir has live storage 75.2 tmcft at canal's full supply level of {{convert|41.15|m|ft|0}} MSL and gross storage 194 tmcft thereby enabling irrigation of 23,20,000 acre  (including stabilisation of existing irrigated lands) in [[Krishna district|Krishna]], [[West Godavari]], [[East Godavari]], [[Visakhapatnam district|Visakhapatnam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and [[Srikakulam]] districts of Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name="FT_1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwda.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/4129963896.PDF |title= Indirasagar (Polavaram) Project reservoir, Ministry of water resources, GoI|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silt free dead storage water of nearly 100 tmcft above the spillway crest level {{convert|24.5|m|ft|0}} MSL, can also be used in downstream  lift irrigation projects ([[Pattiseema#Pattiseema lift scheme|Pattiseema lift]], [[Pattiseema#Tadipudi lift scheme|Tadipudi lift]], Chintalapudi lift, Thorrigedda lift, Pushkara lift, Purushothapatnam lift, Venkatanagaram lift, [[Chagalnadu Lift Irrigation Scheme|Chagalnadu lift]], etc.) and [[Dowleswaram Barrage]] during the summer months.&lt;ref name=ppt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/polavaramReview|title= Refer PPT files dated 22 May 2017 '11.

However these lift stations are to be operated every year during the dry season to draw water from the substantial dead storage available behind the flood gates of the Polavaram dam. So these lift schemes are not for few years operation till the Polavaram dam is constructed but for permanent operation regularly for at least four months in every year. Nearly 60 tmcft live storage capacity available to Andhra Pradesh in [[Sileru river]] basin can also augment the water availability additionally to the Polavaram project during the dry season.

The dam construction involves building of a 1.5 m thick concrete [[diaphragm wall]] up to depths from 40 to 120 m below the river bed under the [[Embankment dam|earth dam]] which is first of its kind in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larsentoubro.com/media/32366/lntconstructionwinsordersvaluedrs1960crores.pdf |title= L&amp;T Geostructure-Bauer Joint Venture has secured an order worth 422 crores |accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of diaphragm wall is to secure the river bed stability for withstanding the water pressure across the dam.

The maximum flood level at Polavaram is {{convert|28|m}} MSL and lowest water level is {{convert|10.9|m}} MSL. Two [[cofferdam]]s are planned, one up to {{convert|41|m}} MSL, to facilitate faster pace of work on earth-cum-rock fill dam to complete the first phase of the project by June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/polavaram-the-cofferdam-which-will-act-as-a-dam/article18869578.ece |title= Polavaram: The cofferdam which will act as a dam |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With coffer dams inclusion and the bed level of the approach and discharge canals of the spillway increased to {{convert|17|m}} MSL, the spillway related rock excavation is reduced by 70% leading to substantial cost reduction in the project's head works cost. Ultimately, the cofferdams would become peripheral portion of the main earth-cum-rock fill dam. On the left side of the river, 12 [[water turbines]], each having 80 megawatt capacity, were to be installed. The right canal connecting to Krishna River in the upstream of [[Prakasam Barrage]] ({{convert|173|km}} long) discharges {{convert|17500|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} at head works and left canal ({{convert|182|km}} long) discharges {{convert|17500|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water.&lt;ref name="FT_1"/&gt;

==Interstate water sharing==

As per the inter state agreements  dated 4 August 1978 (page 89) and 29 January 1979 (page 101) with Andhra Pradesh, the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra are entitled to use 21 tmcft and 14 tmcft respectively out of the unallocated waters of Krishna river when  Godavari water transferred in a year by Polavaram right bank canal from Polavaram reservoir to Prakasam barrage across Krishna river is not exceeding 80 tmcft at 75% dependability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/img/tribunaryDisputes/GWDT%20AWARD.pdf|title=GWDT Award|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=agree/&gt; When additional Godavari water  exceeding 80 tmcft is transferred from Polavaram reservoir, Karnataka and Maharashtra are entitled  with additional water from the unallocated Krishna river waters in the same proportion (i.e. 21:14:45) provided all the following conditions are satisfied.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* The additional Godavari water from Polavaram project should be transferred to the Krishna river in the upstream of Prakasam barrage. Such additional Godavari water quantity to be shared is decided based on 75% dependability.
* The transferred water shall also displace the water discharges from [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam]] for the Krishna delta requirements. Krishna delta is the area located down stream of Prakasam barrage which is part of Krishna basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/Publications/WatershedSubbasinAtlas/3.%20Krishna%20Lower.pdf|title= Lower Krishna basin watershed map|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include adjacent coastal river basins which are being irrigated by the Krishna waters from the Prakasam barrage.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Thus Andhra Pradesh is entitled to transfer Godavari water in excess of 80 tmcft in three out of four years (below 75% dependability) reducing the water releases from Nagarjunasagar dam for Krishna delta requirements and need not share water with other states beyond 80 tmcft.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The above interstate water sharing agreement does not cover the Godavari water transferred to Krishna river which is not displacing the water releases from the Nagarjunasagar dam for the requirements of Krishna delta. Thus Andhra Pradesh need not share with other states the water transferred via Krishna river or any reservoir located on Krishna river for the water needs of any of its area (including Krishna basin) other than Krishna delta.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Godavari Penna River linking ==
To meet the immediate stabilization of existing irrigated area under Nagarjunasagar right canal, a lift scheme with five pump houses will transfer 7,000 [[cusec]]s of Godavari water from Prakasam barrage back waters  to the Nagarjunasagar right canal near [[Nekarikallu]]. The lift scheme, called first phase of Godavari Penna River linking to use 73 [[tmcft]] of Godavari water, is planned to be completed by May 2019 in five months duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telugu.samayam.com/latest-news/state-news/ap-cm-chandrababu-laying-foundation-stone-for-godavari-penna-rivers-linking/articleshow/66810179.cms|title=ఏపీ: గోదావరి-పెన్నా నదుల అనుసంధానానికి శ్రీకారం|access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 150&amp;nbsp;km long gravity canal will pass Wyra River, Munneru River and Krishna River and terminate at Ganapavaram near 16°25′22″N 80°02′17″E in Guntur District. A new dam with reversible turbines across near by hill range will pump the Godavari water into the new reservoir created by it. Thus it will store and use around 35TMC flood water of Godavari at it is at FRL 260m MSL. From this reservoir water will be released to [[Nagarjuna Sagar]] Right Main Canal at Nekarikallu through pipes.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

There is a proposal to link Nagarjuna Sagar Dam across the Krishna River and [[Somasila Dam]] across Penna River with 400&amp;nbsp;km canal as part of national river linking program. With help from the Indian Government, AP Govt can construct a new canal up to Somasila Dam as per DPR of [[Indian Rivers Inter-link]] program specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nwda.gov.in/index4.asp?ssslid=116&amp;subsubsublinkid=41&amp;langid=1|title=Welcome To NWDA|website=nwda.gov.in|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Godavari River water will travel up to Somasila Dam and then [[Swarnamukhi]] in [[Chittoor district]] via existing Somasila Swarnamukhi link canal. AP Govt can also provide water to Tamil Nadu from this Godavari water and retained water in Krishna River (15TMC allocation of Krishna water to Telugu Ganga) will be used for other projects in [[Rayalaseema]] region.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In future a new massive dam named Palnadu Sagar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.andhrajyothy.com/c/12472115|title=Clipping of Andhra Jyothy Telugu Daily - Andhra Pradesh|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; across hill range near Karempudi{{clarify|date=October 2016}} with 700TMC capacity reservoir is possible using of flood water of Krishna River and Godavari River diverted via the contour canal. It will submerge 300Sq KM of land at FRL 260m MSL. Palnadu Sagar will receive Godavari River water from adjacent 260M FRL reservoir via siphon effect by using 25&amp;nbsp;km long pipe lines between them under the fields. Palnadu Sagar spillway with [[Francis Turbine]] will release water into Nagarjuna Sagar right canal along with [[Hydroelectricity]] power generation. Flood water of Krishna River will be pumped to Palnadu Sagar through Nagarjuna Sagar Canal with the help of reversible turbines. The water stored in Palnadu Sagar will be used for irrigation and drinking in drought years.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Future potential==

A barrage would be constructed on Krishna river located near {{Coord|16|34|41|N|80|24|43|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}} in the upstream of Prakasam barrage with FRL at 24m [[Sea level|MSL]] to receive Godavari water diverted from Polavaram dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New barrage between Pulichintala dam and Prakasam barrage across Krishna river|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/inland-waterway-set-to-become-a-reality-uma/article8066381.ece|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch from this lift canal is also extended up to [[Pulichinthala Project|Pulichinthala dam]] (FRL 53.34 m MSL) to store Godavari water in Pulichintala reservoir during drought years and to irrigate low lands along Krishna river up to Pulichintala dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AP government not utilising Pulichintala Project fully|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2018-08-16/AP-government-not-utilising-Pulichintala-Project-fully-/405996|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another high level lift canal from above Krishna river location {{Coord|16|42|50|N|80|08|24|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}}  up to 90 m MSL would be constructed to join [[Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond]] (FRL 75 m MSL)  irrigating lands en route along Krishna river in Guntur district. During drought years, the water transferred by this canal to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond is further lifted to Nagarjuna Sagar and [[Srisailam Dam|Srisailam reservoirs]] with the existing [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage hydro units]] for use in all the projects receiving water from these reservoirs.

[[Fresh water]] coastal reservoirs can be established in the shallow sea area by constructing sea [[Levee|dikes]] / bunds/ [[causeway]] up to the depth of 20 meters from the coast line.&lt;ref name=scri&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/389150657/Feasibility-of-coastal-reservoir-to-harness-Godavari-river-surplus-waters |title=Feasibility of coastal reservoir to harness Godavari river surplus waters|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water can be pumped from this artificial fresh water lagoon throughout the year for meeting agriculture, etc. needs. Also top surface of the dike can be used as coastal road &amp; rail rout. The proposed dikes would be similar to the [[land reclamation]] of [[North Sea]] area called [[Delta Works]] in [[Netherlands]] or [[Saemangeum Seawall]] in [[South Korea]]. The earth bunds / dikes located on sea bed at 20 meters below the sea level, is lesser challenging technically when compared to Saemangeum Seawall project which is having 36 meters average water depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coastal reservoirs strategy for water resource development-a review of future trend|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2991&amp;context=eispapers|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reservoir in sea to end Bengaluru's drinking water problems?|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/reservoir-in-sea-to-end-citys-drinking-water-problems/articleshow/59966048.cms|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea area up to 20 meters depth adjacent to [[coast]] line between the locations (near {{Coord|16|20|07|N|81|39|31|E|name=Eastern tip of Coastal reservoir}}) where Vashista Godavari, the right side branch of the Godavari river, is joining the sea and the mouth of the [[Gundlakamma River]] (near {{Coord|15|34|09|N|80|13|49|E|name=Western tip of Coastal reservoir}}), is highly suitable for creating the  fresh water coastal reservoir. The average width of the sea up to 20 m depth is nearly 16&amp;nbsp;km wide and the length of the sea [[Levee|dikes]] is nearly 200&amp;nbsp;km. The area of the coastal reservoir would be nearly 2900&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A barrage would be constructed across the Vashista Godavari river (near {{Coord|16|23|35|N|81|42|31|E|name=Vashista Godavari barrage}}) near [[Narasapuram, West Godavari district|Narasapuram]] town. A flood canal (11&amp;nbsp;km long) from this barrage would feed Godavari river water to the coastal reservoir. With 70 tmcft live storage above the full supply level of its canals, Polavaram reservoir will assist in moderating the Godavari flood water and make available to the coastal reservoir.

The off shore earth dam extending up to 8 m [[Mean sea level|msl]] high, is in the form of two parallel dikes separated by 1000 meters gap. The main purpose of the twin dikes is to prevent any sea water seepage into coastal reservoir as its water level is below the sea water level. The water level between the dikes is always maintained up to 1 m above the sea level by pumping fresh water from the coastal reservoir to the 1000 m gap between the dikes. The higher level water barrier between the two dikes fully eliminate any sea water seepage in to the coastal reservoir by establishing fresh water seepage to the sea. The rain water falling on the coastal reservoir area and run off water from its catchment area is adequate to cater the seepage and evaporation losses from the coastal reservoir. The  180&amp;nbsp;km long, 1000 m gap between the two dikes is also used as deep water mega harbor for shipping, ship breaking, ship building, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gadkari moots Vodarevu for locating port in Prakasam|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vodarevu-suggested-for-locating-port/article25064112.ece|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For shipping purpose, the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] outer dike facing the sea is envisaged with few [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] fitted with twin gates for access to the open sea. The top surface of inner dike would serve as access to the main land from the mega [[harbor]] with rail and road links. The coastal reservoir whose full reservoir water level (FRL) is at 0.0 m msl, would also reduce drastically the cyclone damage and flooding in coastal areas of West Godavari, [[Krishna district|Krishna]], [[Guntur district|Guntur]] and Prakasam districts. It would also greatly improve the irrigated coastal lands drainage in these districts. The coastal reservoir area can also be used for locating [[floating solar]] power plants to generate the needed water pumping power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Power Island: A blue battery for green energy|url=http://www.gottliebpaludan.com/en/project/green-power-island|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dikes are built by [[dredging]] sand and clay from the nearby shallow sea bed to reduce the construction cost. Nearly 1850 tmcft water of Godavari and Krishna flood waters can be utilized for irrigation, etc. requirements with this fresh water coastal reservoir.

Vast lands in the districts of Prakasam, [[Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore district|Nellore]], Cudapah and Chittoor are drought prone and do not have adequate water sources for irrigating the dry lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lester R.|date=November 29, 2013 |title=India's dangerous 'food bubble'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/opinion/la-oe-brown-india-food-bubble-famine-20131129|deadurl= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |publisher= |archiveurl=http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2013/update119|archivedate=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water from this coastal reservoir would be pumped uplands to Ramathirtham water tank (near {{Coord|15|37|37|N|79|48|47|E|type:landmark_region:IN-AP}})  which is at 85 m msl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ramathirtham Dam D06139|url=http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Ramathirtham_Dam_D06139|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this water tank, dry lands in Prakasam and Nellore districts up to Tamil Nadu border can be brought under irrigation by gravity canals. From this canal, water would be further pumped to the uplands of Chittoor  and Cudapah districts up to 600 m msl across the [[Eastern Ghats|Seshachalam]] mountains. This canal would also be extended with lifts to transfer 350 tmcft water up to the Kavery river in Tamil Nadu state during [[South-west monsoon]] period. The total cost to Andhra Pradesh state would be less than Rs 300 billions which is nearly Rs 1,00,000 per acre of irrigated land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India is not running out of water, water is running out of India|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/op-ed/260317/by-invitation-india-is-not-running-out-of-water-water-is-running-out-of-india.html|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The proposed project would displace 276 villages and 44,574 families spread across Andhra Pradesh state mainly. Tribals constitute 50% of such a displaced population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. |first=Laxman Rao |author2=Priya Deshingkar |author3=John Farrington|title=Tribal Land Alienation in Andhra Pradesh|journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|date=30 December 2006|pages=5401–5407|url=http://www.yerukala.info/files/misc/TribalLandAlienation_AP.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights activists came out against the project because of these reasons. In addition, one activist pointed out that this interlinking of the rivers will harm the interests of the region in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polavaram project will spell doom for tribals: Human Rights Forum|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/05/19/stories/2005051903271700.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=The Hindu Business Line|date=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental activist [[Medha Patkar]] said that the project not only will displace several thousands of families, it will also submerge several [[archaeological]] sites, coal deposits, a [[wildlife sanctuary]] and several hectares of farm land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green signal for Polavaram dam|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-10-25/hyderabad/27852732_1_polavaram-irrigation-projects-medha-patkar|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=25 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty-four years after the initial conception of the project, the [[Government of Andhra Pradesh]] secured the environmental clearance from the central agency in 2005. This clearance was obtained after the state government prepared a {{INR}}4,500 crore forest management plan and rehabilitation and resettlement proposal covering 59,756 hectares that were being lost under the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP farmers get compensation, business picks up in Bhadrachalam|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/160617/ap-farmers-get-compensation-business-picks-up-in-bhadrachalam.html|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{INR}}40,000 was to be allotted for each dwelling to be constructed for the displaced as against {{INR}}25,000 provided by other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polavaram project gets clearance|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/26/stories/2005102623460100.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this clearance, the project faced political roadblocks. The [[CPI(M)|Communist Party of India (M)]] and [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] were troubled with the issue of submerging agricultural lands by the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TRS stalls Assembly over Polavaram|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-02-17/hyderabad/27798853_1_trs-floor-leader-trs-members-polavaram|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=17 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CPI(M) plans Chalo Assembly on Polavaram|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/09/stories/2006020910140500.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, work on the project began in April 2006 and was expected to be completed by February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.

The neighbouring state of [[Odisha]] also expressed its concern on the submerging of its land and decided to study this together with the officials from Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orissa for joint survey on Polavaram project|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/15/stories/2006111505570800.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh]] Late [[Y. S.

Odisha and Chhattisgarh have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Project which has probability of temporarily submerging large areas of its state and allege that union government are going ahead with the project without the necessary permissions from Environment Ministry. Under section 90 of the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]], union government has taken the responsibility of taking all clearances and approvals for the project execution and also declared the project as national project.&lt;ref name=np/&gt; The states also allege that public hearing in the effected areas are not held. Under section 90 (3) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Telangana state has already given the approval in all respects to the Polavaram project.&lt;ref name=np&gt;{{cite web |author=Ministry of Law and Justice |url=http://www.indiacode.nic.in/acts2014/6%20of%202014.pdf|title=The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, 6 of 2014 |date= 1 March 2014 |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation  (Amendment) Act, 2014|date=17 July 2014 |url=http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2014/160253.pdf|accessdate= 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, it was reported that Naveen Patnaik, Chief Minister of Odisha had written to the Central Government to halt the Polavaram Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/odisha-seeks-to-halt-polavaram/articleshow/64435135.cms?&amp;utm_source=Articleshow&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=Related_Stories|title=Odisha seeks to halt Polavaram - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interstate river water disputes ==
Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into agreement (clause vi of final order, page 80 of original GWDT) which were made part of [[Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal]] (GWDT) award.&lt;ref name=agree&gt;[http://cwc.gov.in/main/downloads/legal_instruments_2.pdf "Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal final report, page 52"]&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement allows Andhra Pradesh to construct the Polavaram reservoir with full reservoir level (FRL) at 150 feet above the mean sea level (MSL). Odisha approached Supreme Court against the design discharge capacity of the Polavaram dam spill way stating that it should be designed for five million cusecs (cubic feet per second) which is the estimated  probable maximum flood (PMF) once in 1000 years duration. Odisha argues that otherwise there would be additional submergence above 150&amp;nbsp;ft MSL in its territory during peak floods. The recorded maximum flood is 3.0 million cusecs in the year 1986 during last 115 years.&lt;ref name=Sakti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P2856900.html|title= Water flow data at Polavaram|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The projected back water level build up at Konta due to PMF in Godavari river after construction of Polavaram project with designed maximum water level (measured at dam point) shall be cross checked with the level that can occur at Konta in Sabari basin from the PMF generated in the upstream of Konta when the downstream main Godavari is not under spate. Then only enhanced submergence during the PMF of Godavari river in Odisha and Chhattisgarh states can be assessed due to Polavaram dam construction.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The location of Polavaram dam is in the plain area at  approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km downstream from the 50&amp;nbsp;km long narrow gorge in the Papi Hills. It is also to be ascertained whether the higher back water level during the PMF in Godavari river is solely due to the presence of long narrow gorge which is acting as a natural dam / barrier or further enhanced by the presence of downstream Polavaram barrage.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It is purely an academic interest showing concern for the few thousand hectares of farm/forest land submerged by the back water level build up once in five hundred or thousand years without showing concern for the thousands of square kilometres land submerged in the area downstream of the dam with a river flood of magnitude five million cusecs.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Thirty two years have passed after GWDT award in 1980, Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have not made serious efforts to harness the major Godavari tributaries such as [[Sabari River]], [[Indravati River]] and [[Pranahita River]] to utilise the allocated share of Godavari waters. This underutilisation of water is the main reason for the very high flood flows at Polavaram dam site. Vast area in excess of 10,000 square km up to sea are frequently flooded (at least once in a decade) by Godavari floods in Andhra Pradesh by the flood waters originated in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh states. The land submergence due to Polavaram dam in Odisha and Chhattisgarh states is fraction of Andhra Pradesh area which is affected by the floods in Godavari River. During the years from 1953 to 2011, Andhra Pradesh suffered nearly {{INR}}55,800 crore which is 26% of total flood damage in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.gov.in/main/downloads/FFM.2200-2291.27112012.pdf|title= State wise flood damage statistics in India|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is justified to raise the FRL of Polavaram dam further on this ground alone. One single criterion shall be applied by the tribunals / courts for all the submerged lands whether they are related to reservoir projects construction or due to river floods (i.e. non-utilisation of river water). Upstream states shall not take granted that downstream state areas are permitted to be flooded /inundated by the river flood water without offering agreeable relief / comforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Odisha and Chhattisgarh entered into agreement (clause 3e, Annexure F, Page 159 of original GWDT) to construct a Hydro electricity project at Konta / Motu just upstream of the confluence point of [[Sileru river|Sileru tributary]] with [[Sabari River]] (tri-junction point of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chhattisgarh borders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.savitripower.com/24mw_sukuma_proj.php|title= 24 MW Sukuma Hydro Project near Konta |accessdate= 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this project is constructed, the land submergence would be more than that of Polavaram back waters. It would be better that Odisha and Chhattisgarh enter into agreement with Andhra Pradesh to shift the location of this Hydro electricity project further down stream in Andhra Pradesh territory to harness Sileru river water also for hydro electricity generation. This joint project of the three states would eliminate the back waters issue of Polavaram dam.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The 200&amp;nbsp;km long stretch of the Sabari river forming boundary between Chhattisgarh and Odisha drops by 2.25 meters per km length on average. This stretch of the river has substantial hydro electricity generation potential by building medium head (&lt; 20 m) barrages in series to minimise land submergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meenakshigroup.com/html/power_projects.html#hydelpower|title= Middle Kolab (25 MW) and Lower Kolab (12 MW) hydro power stations|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surplus water of [[Indravati River]] in Odisha can also be diverted to Sabari river via Jouranala through which Indravati River flood waters naturally overflow into Sabari basin for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowrorissa.gov.in/Projects/MajMed/Proposed/HydelProjects.pdf|title= Middle Kolab Hydro Electric Project, 285 MW|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute with Odisha and Telangana ===
In July 2018, a two member bench of the Supreme Court asked Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Chhattisgarh governments to frame the issues for arguments.
Telangana said to the court it is in-principle agree for project but centre should takeup study by Neutral central institute like CWPRS, Pune to study impact of Backwater due to increase of 36 Lakh cusecs to 50 Lakh cusecs of design discharge, it is to ascertain Safety of important temple town like Bhadrachalam, Mining areas and heavy water Plant.Orissa also insisting for Backwater studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/odisha-challenges-national-status-polavaram-sc-issues-notice-andhra-ts-85295|title=As Odisha challenges national status for Polavaram, SC issues notice to Andhra, TS|date=2018-07-24|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Preherpetic neuralgia''' is a form of nerve pain ([[neuralgia]]) specifically associated with a [[Shingles]] (herpes zoster) viral infection. This nerve pain often precedes visible indications of a Shingles infection and consequently can be a key early indicator of a need to begin preventative anti-viral drug therapy. Pain associated with Shingles can be extremely difficult to treat whereas the source is related to the virus attacking the nervous system itself. Pain symptoms can last months or years beyond any outward sign of viral infection and can be quite severe. The combination of extreme pain severity and longevity can contribute to chronic depression and even suicide.&lt;ref name=pmid1866008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/WNL.41.8.1215 |pmid=1866008 |title=Preherpetic neuralgia |journal=Neurology |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1215–8 |year=1991 |last1=Gilden |first1=D.

'''Publicly funded healthcare''' is a form of [[health care]] financing designed to meet the cost of all or most healthcare needs from a publicly managed fund.  Usually this is under some form of democratic accountability, the right of access to which are set down in rules applying to the whole population contributing to the fund or receiving benefits from it.

The fund may be a not-for-profit trust that pays out for healthcare according to common rules established by the members or by some other democratic form.  In some countries, the fund is controlled directly by the government or by an agency of the government for the benefit of the entire population.  That distinguishes it from other forms of private [[medical insurance]], the rights of access to which are subject to contractual obligations between an insurer (or his sponsor) and an [[insurance company]], which seeks to make a profit by managing the flow of funds between funders and providers of health care services.

When taxation is the primary means of financing health care and sometimes with compulsory insurance, all eligible people receive the same level of cover regardless of their financial circumstances or risk factors.&lt;ref name="Blanchette"&gt;Claude Blanchette, Erin Tolley. [http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp438-e.htm "PUBLIC- AND PRIVATE-SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS: A COMPARISON OF OECD COUNTRIES."] May 1997. Retrieved September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties of public systems==
{{main|Health care system}}

Most developed countries have partially or fully publicly funded health systems. Most western industrial countries have a system of [[social insurance]] based on the principle of social solidarity that covers eligible people from bearing the direct burden of most health care expenditure, funded by taxation during their working life.

Among countries with significant public funding of healthcare there are many different approaches to the funding and provision of medical services. Systems may be funded from general government revenues (as in [[Canada]]) or through a government social security system (as in [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Japan]] and [[Germany]]) with a separate budget and [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecated]] taxes or contributions. The proportion of the cost of care covered also differs: in Canada, all hospital care is paid for by the government, while in Japan, patients must pay 10 to 30% of the cost of a hospital stay. Services provided by public systems vary. For example, the Belgian government pays the bulk of the fees for dental and eye care, while the Australian government covers eye care but not dental care.

Publicly funded medicine may be administered and provided by the government, as in the [[Nordic countries]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]]; in some systems, though, medicine is publicly funded but most hospital providers are private entities, as in Canada. The organization providing public health insurance is not necessarily a public administration, and its budget may be isolated from the main state budget. Some systems do not provide universal healthcare or restrict coverage to public health facilities. Some countries, such as Germany, have multiple public insurance organizations linked by a common legal framework. Some, such as the [[Netherlands]], allow private for-profit insurers to participate.

===Two-tier healthcare===
{{main|Two-tier healthcare}}

Almost every major country that has a publicly funded healthcare system also has a parallel private system for patients who hold private medical insurance or themselves pay for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc35/2005scc35.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202122636/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc35/2005scc35.html |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }} [[Canadian Supreme Court]], after expert testimony, found that all [[OECD]] countries and four of the ten Canadian provinces allow private medical insurance alongside the state system&lt;/ref&gt; In those states, those able to pay have access to treatment and comforts that may not be available to those dependent upon the state system.

From the inception of the NHS model (1948), public hospitals in the [[United Kingdom]] have included "amenity beds" which would typically be siderooms fitted more comfortably, and private wards in some hospitals where for a fee more amenities are provided. Patients using these beds are in an NHS hospital for surgical treatment, and operations are generally carried out in the same operating theatres as NHS work and by the same personnel but the hospital and the physician receive funding from an insurance company or the patient. These amenity beds do not exist in all publicly funded systems, such as in Spain. The NHS also pays for private hospitals to take on surgical cases under contract.

==Policy discussion==
{{main|Health system|Health care reform}}
Many countries are seeking the right balance of public and private insurance, public subsidies, and out-of-pocket payments.

Many OECD countries have implemented reforms to achieve policy goals of ensuring access to health care, improving the quality of health care and health outcomes, allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare but at the same time ensuring that services are provided in a cost-efficient and cost-effective manner (microeconomic efficiency). A range of measures, such as better payment methods, have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers. However, introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/53/22364122.pdf|title=Health-Care Systems: Lessons from the Reform Experience|publisher=OECD|author1=Elizabeth Docteur |author2=Howard Oxley |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 Harvard study published in the [[American Journal of Public Health]] found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States because of Americans' lacking health insurance, equivalent to one excess death every 12 min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf |title=Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=December 2009 |volume=99 |issue=12|accessdate=10 September 2014|doi=10.2105/ajph.2008.157685 |pages=2289–2295 |pmid=19762659 |pmc=2775760 |author=Wilper AP, Woolhandler S, Lasser KE, McCormick D, Bor DH, Himmelstein DU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care was estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 336, no. 11 [1997]) "concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of AIDs."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44707">'''Psychological recovery''' or '''recovery  model''' or the '''recovery approach''' to [[mental disorder]] or [[substance dependence]] emphasizes and supports a person's potential for recovery. Recovery is generally seen in this approach as a personal [[quest|journey]] rather than a set outcome, and one that may involve developing [[hope]], a secure base and sense of self, supportive [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[empowerment]], [[social inclusion]], coping skills, and [[value (personal and cultural)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|title="I'm in this world for a reason": Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|first1=Jessica H.

William Anthony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mha.ohio.gov/Portals/0/assets/Supports/RecoverytoWork/toward-a-vision-of-recovery.pdf |title=Toward a  Vision of Recovery  |last=Anthony |first=William |publisher=Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the Boston Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation developed a quaint cornerstone definition of mental health recovery in 1993. "Recovery is a deeply personal, unique process of changing one's attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills and/or roles. It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by the illness. Recovery involves the development of new meaning and purpose in one's life as one grows beyond the catastrophic effects of mental illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcmhrsb.org/education/recovery-resources/|title=Recovery: Definition &amp; Components|publisher=Hamilton County Mental Health &amp; Recovery Services Board|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/practice/leadership/smi/recovery-resolution.pdf|title=Resolution on APA Endorsement Of The Concept Of Recovery For People With Serious Mental Illness|publisher=APA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222063240/http://www.apa.org/practice/leadership/smi/recovery-resolution.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the concept in [[mental health]] emerged as [[deinstitutionalization]] resulted in more individuals living in the community. It gained impetus as a [[social movement]] due to a perceived failure by services or wider society to adequately support [[social inclusion]], and by studies demonstrating that many people do recover. A recovery approach has now been explicitly adopted as the guiding principle of the mental health or substance dependency policies of a number of countries and states. In many cases practical steps are being taken to base services on a recovery model, although a range of obstacles, concerns and criticisms have been raised both by service providers and by recipients of services. A number of standardized measures have been developed to assess aspects of recovery, although there is some variation between professionalized models and those originating in the [[psychiatric survivors movement]].

==History==
In [[medicine|general medicine]] and [[psychiatry]], recovery has long been used to refer to the end of a particular experience or episode of [[illness]]. The broader concept of "recovery" as a general philosophy and model was first popularized in regard to recovery from [[substance abuse]]/[[drug addiction]], for example within [[twelve-step program]]s.

Application of recovery models to psychiatric disorders is comparatively recent. The concept of recovery can be traced back as far as 1840, when John Perceval, son of one of Britain's prime ministers, wrote of his personal recovery from the psychosis that he experienced from 1830 until 1832, a recovery that he obtained despite the "treatment" he received from the "lunatic" doctors who attended him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recoverywithinreach.org/Recovery/history History of the Recovery Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; But by consensus the main impetus for the development came from the within the [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement]], a grassroots self-help and advocacy initiative, particularly within the [[United States]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="USsurgeon"&gt;Office of the Surgeon General and various United States Government agencies (1999) [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec10.html Mental Health: A report of the Surgeon General. Section 10: Overview of Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt; The professional literature, starting with the [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] movement in particular, began to incorporate the concept from the early 1990s in the United States, followed by New Zealand and more recently across nearly all countries within the "[[First World]]".&lt;ref name="RecoveryEmergent"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramon S, Healy B, Renouf N |title=Recovery from mental illness as an emergent concept and practice in Australia and the UK |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=108–22 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17472085 |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17472085 |doi=10.1177/0020764006075018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches developed around the same time, without necessarily using the term recovery, in Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.

Developments were fueled by a number of long term outcome studies of people with "major mental illnesses" in populations from virtually every continent, including landmark cross-national studies by the [[World Health Organization]] from the 1970s and 1990s, showing unexpectedly high rates of complete or partial recovery, with exact statistics varying by region and the criteria used. The cumulative impact of personal stories or [[testimony]] of recovery has also been a powerful force behind the development of recovery approaches and policies. A key issue became how service consumers could maintain the ownership and authenticity of recovery concepts while also supporting them in professional policy and practice.&lt;ref name="Deegan88"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Deegan PE | year = 1988 | title = Recovery: The lived experience of rehabilitation | url = http://www.bu.edu/cpr/repository/articles/pdf/deegan1998.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal | volume = 11 | issue =  | page = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926115018/http://www.bu.edu/cpr/repository/articles/pdf/deegan1998.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, recovery became both a subject of mental health services research and a term emblematic of many of the goals of the [[Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient Movement]]. The concept of recovery was often defined and applied differently by consumers/survivors and professionals. Specific policy and clinical strategies were developed to implement recovery principles although key questions remained.&lt;ref name="USsurgeon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5countymh.org/Docs/JacobsonCurtis%202-5-99%20fin.pdf Jacobson, N. and Curtis, L. (2000)] Recovery as Policy in Mental Health Services: Strategies Emerging from the States. ''Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal'', Spring&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of recovery==
It has been emphasized that each individual's journey to recovery is a deeply personal process, as well as being related to an individual's community and society.&lt;ref name= "InclusionRecovery"&gt;Repper, J. &amp; Perkins, R. (2006) ''Social Inclusion and Recovery: A Model for Mental Health Practice.'' Bailliere Tindall, UK. {{ISBN|0-7020-2601-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of features or signs of recovery have been proposed as often core elements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/01/recovery-principles.aspx|title=Recovery principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprehensively they have been categorized under the concept of CHIME.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishrecovery.net/what-helps/|title=What helps - Scottish Recovery Network|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew|date=|website=SRN|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHIME is an abbreviation of Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning &amp; Purpose and Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Leamy, M., Bird, V.J., Le Boutillier, C., Williams, J. &amp; Slade, M. (2011). [https://www.scottishrecovery.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conceptual_framework_CHIME.pdf A conceptual framework for personal recovery in mental health: systematic review and narrative synthesis]. British Journal of Psychiatry, 199:445-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connectedness and supportive relationships===
A common aspect of recovery is said to be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While [[mental health professional]]s can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with [[friendship|friends]], [[family]] and the [[community]] are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance.&lt;ref name="Friendships"&gt;Hack Thyself (2012) [http://hackthyself.net Recovery Is Impossible Without Friends] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004024621/http://hackthyself.net/ |date=2016-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]] relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to [[self-esteem]] and recovery.&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt;

===Hope===
Finding and nurturing hope has been described as a key to recovery. It is said to include not just [[optimism]] but a sustainable belief in oneself and a willingness to persevere through uncertainty and setbacks. Hope may start at a certain turning point, or emerge gradually as a small and fragile feeling, and may fluctuate with [[wikt:despair|despair]]. It is said to involve trusting, and risking [[disappointment]], [[failure]] and further [[pain|hurt]].&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt;

===Identity===
Recovery of a durable sense of self (if it had been lost or taken away) has been proposed as an important element. A research review suggested that people sometimes achieve this by "positive withdrawal"—regulating social involvement and negotiating public space in order to only move towards others in a way that feels safe yet meaningful; and nurturing personal psychological space that allows room for developing understanding and a broad sense of self, interests, [[spirituality]], etc. It was suggested that the process is usually greatly facilitated by experiences of interpersonal [[acceptance]], mutuality, and a sense of social belonging; and is often challenging in the face of the typical barrage of overt and covert negative messages that come from the broader social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sells DJ, Stayner DA, Davidson L |title=Recovering the self in schizophrenia: an integrative review of qualitative studies |journal=Psychiatr Q |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=87–97 |year=2004 |pmid=14992305 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0033-2720&amp;volume=75&amp;page=87 |doi=10.1023/B:PSAQ.0000007563.17236.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to move on can mean having to cope with feelings of [[grief|loss]], which may include despair and [[anger]]. When an individual is ready for change, a process of [[Grief counseling|grieving]] is initiated. It may require accepting past [[suffering]] and lost opportunities or lost [[time]].&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt;

===Formation of healthy coping strategies and meaningful internal schema===
The development of personal [[coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] (including [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] or [[self-help]]) is said to be an important element. This can involve making use of [[medication]] or [[psychotherapy]] if the patient is [[informed consent|fully informed]] and [[active listening|listened]] to, including about [[adverse effect]]s and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and [[problem solving]] skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which may or may not be seen as [[symptom]]s of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own [[expert]], in order to identify key [[stress (biology)|stress]] points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping.&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt; Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose is said to be important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[politics]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt; From a [[postmodern]] perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment and building a secure base===
Building a positive culture of healing is essential in recovery approach. Since recovery is not synonymous with cure a strong supportive network is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jacobson | first=Nora | last2=Greenley | first2=Dianne | title=What Is Recovery? A Conceptual Model and Explication | journal=Psychiatric Services | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | volume=52 | issue=4 | year=2001 | issn=1075-2730 | doi=10.1176/appi.ps.52.4.482 | pages=482–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate [[house|housing]], a sufficient [[income]], freedom from [[violence]], and adequate access to [[health care]] have also been proposed.&lt;ref name="OntarioRecovery"/&gt; It has been suggested that home ([[housing first]]) is where recovery may begin. Housing services, if required, need to flexibly involve people and to build on individuals' personal visions and strengths, instead of "placing" and potentially "[[Deinstitutionalization|re-institutionalizing]]" people.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Ashcraft, PhD, William A.

This can mean developing the [[confidence]] for independent [[assertive]] [[decision making]] and help-seeking which translates into proper medication and active self care practices. Achieving social inclusion and overcoming challenging [[social stigma]] and [[prejudice]] about mental [[mental distress|distress]]/[[mental disorder|disorder]]/[[neurodiversity|difference]] is an important part of empowerment. This may require recovering detached [[social skill]]s and identity, making up for gaps in [[wikt:work history|work history]] for better self-management, etc.&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt;

==Concepts of recovery==

===Varied definitions===
What constitutes 'recovery', or a recovery model, is a matter of ongoing debate both in theory and in practice. In general, professionalized clinical models tend to focus on improvement in particular symptoms and functions, and on the role of treatments, while consumer/survivor models tend to put more emphasis on [[peer support]], empowerment and real-world personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and consumer models of recovery in schizophrenia: concordance, contrasts, and implications |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16461575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recovering from Illness or Recovering your Life?

Gill, Nora M. Barrett, Kevin K. Hull, Melissa M. Roberts (2002) ''Psychiatric Rehabilitation''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, recovery may be viewed in terms of a [[social model of disability]] rather than a [[medical model of disability]], and there may be differences in the acceptance of diagnostic "labels" and treatments.&lt;ref name="InclusionRecovery"/&gt;

A review of research suggested that writers on recovery are rarely explicit about which of the various concepts they are employing. The reviewers classified the approaches they found in to broadly "rehabilitation" perspectives, which they defined as being focused on life and meaning within the context of enduring disability, and "clinical" perspectives which focused on observable remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Concepts of recovery: competing or complementary? |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=664–7 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16639093 |doi= 10.1097/01.yco.0000184418.29082.0e |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/4828_pnt |vauthors=Davidson L, Lawless MS, Leary F }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] perspective, a number of additional qualities of the recovery process have been suggested, including that it: can occur without professional intervention, but requires people who believe in and stand by the person in recovery; does not depend on believing certain theories about the cause of conditions; can be said to occur even if symptoms later re-occur, but does change the frequency and duration of symptoms; requires recovery from the consequences of a psychiatric condition as well as the condition itself; is not [[linear]] but does tend to take place as a series of small steps; does not mean the person was never really psychiatrically disabled; focuses on wellness not illness, and on consumer choice.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W.A., Cohen, M., Farkas, M, &amp; Gagne, C. (2002). Psychiatric Rehabilitation. 2nd edition. Boston: Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation. {{ISBN|1-878512-11-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus statement on mental health recovery from US agencies, that involved some consumer input, defined recovery as a journey of healing and transformation enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential. Ten fundamental components were elucidated, all assuming that the person continues to be a "consumer" or to have a "mental disability".&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of Health and Human Services and SAMHSA Center for Mental Health Services (2004) [http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/sma05-4129/ National Consensus Statement on Mental Health Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907014314/http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/sma05-4129 |date=2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences have been held on the importance of the "elusive" concept from the perspectives of consumers and psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recovery Movement Gains Influence In Mental Health Programs |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=10 |date=January 3, 2003 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/1/10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802211827/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/1/10 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to recovery known as the [[Tidal Model]] focuses on the continuous process of change inherent in all people, conveying the meaning of experiences through water [[metaphor]]s. [[Crisis]] is seen as involving opportunity; [[creativity]] is valued; and different domains are explored such as sense of security, personal [[narrative]] and relationships. Initially developed by [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|mental health nurses]] along with service users, Tidal is a particular model that has been specifically researched. Based on a discrete set of values (the Ten Commitments), it emphasizes the importance of each person's own voice, resourcefulness and wisdom. Since 1999, projects based on the Tidal Model have been established in several countries.

For many, recovery has a political as well as personal implication—where to recover is to: find meaning; challenge prejudice (including diagnostic "labels" in some cases); perhaps to be a "bad" non-compliant patient and refuse to accept the indoctrination of the system; to reclaim a chosen life and place within society; and to validate the self.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, J. [http://www.power2u.org/articles/recovery/confessions.html Confessions of a non-compliant patient] National Empowerment Center&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery can thus be viewed as one manifestation of empowerment. Such an empowerment model may emphasize that conditions are not necessarily permanent; that other people have recovered who can be role models and share experiences; and that "symptoms" can be understood as expressions of distress related to emotions and other people. One such model from the US [[National Empowerment Center]] proposes a number of principles of how people recover and seeks to identify the characteristics of people in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fisher, D. |title=Empowerment Model of Recovery From Severe Mental Illness |journal=Medscape Psychiatry &amp; Mental Health |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2005 |url=http://www.power2u.org/articles/recovery/expert_interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, recovery may be seen as more of a philosophy or attitude than a specific model, requiring fundamentally that "we regain personal power and a valued place in our communities. Sometimes we need services to support us to get there".&lt;ref name="NZvision"&gt;Doug Banks, Jim Burdett, Vicki Burnett, Deb Christensen, Susie Crooks, Elva Edwards, Stewart Fenton, Seulata Fui, Maria Glanville, Sonja Goldsack, Alex Handiside, Chris Hansen, Anne Helm, Iwa Natana, Mary O'Hagan, Lina Samu, Ana Sokratov, Te Wera Te Kotua, John Tovey, Debra Wells and Ranui Wilson (2004) [http://www.mhc.govt.nz/documents/0000/0000/0097/MCH_OUR_LIVES_FINAL_B_.PDF Our Lives in 2014: A recovery vision from people with experience of mental illness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016164504/http://www.mhc.govt.nz/documents/0000/0000/0097/MCH_OUR_LIVES_FINAL_B_.PDF |date=2008-10-16 }} Published with the assistance of the New Zealand Mental Health Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery from substance dependence===
Particular kinds of recovery models have been adopted in [[drug rehabilitation]] services. While interventions in this area have tended to focus on [[harm reduction]], particularly through [[Opioid replacement therapy|substitute prescribing]] (or alternatively requiring total abstinence) recovery approaches have emphasised the need to simultaneously address the whole of people's lives, and to encourage aspirations while promoting equal access and opportunities within society. From the perspective of services the work may include helping people with "developing the skills to prevent relapse into further illegal drug taking, rebuilding broken relationships or forging new ones, actively engaging in meaningful activities and taking steps to build a home and provide for themselves and their families. Milestones could be as simple as gaining weight, re-establishing relationships with friends, or building self-esteem. What is key is that recovery is sustained.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/05/22161610/5 The Road to Recovery: A New Approach to Tackling Scotland's Drug Problem] by the Scottish Government, May 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the philosophy of the recovery movement is the aim for an equal relationship between "Experts by Profession" and "Experts by Experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drew|first=Emma|author-link=Emma Drew|title=The Whole Person Recovery Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===
Some concerns have been raised about a recovery approach in theory and in practice. These include suggestions that it: is an old concept; only happens to very few people; represents an irresponsible fad; happens only as a result of active treatment; implies a cure; can only be implemented with new resources; adds to the burden of already stretched providers; is neither reimbursable nor evidence based; devalues the role of professional intervention; and increases providers' exposure to risk and liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davidson L, O'Connell M, Tondora J, Styron T, Kangas K |title=The top ten concerns about recovery encountered in mental health system transformation |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=640–5 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16675756 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.5.640 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ps.2006.57.5.640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms focused on practical implementation by service providers include that: the recovery model can be manipulated by officials to serve various political and financial interests including withdrawing services and pushing people out before they're ready; that it is becoming a new [[orthodoxy]] or bandwagon that neglects the empowerment aspects and structural problems of societies and primarily represents a [[middle class]] experience; that it hides the continued dominance of a medical model; and that it potentially increases social exclusion and marginalizes those who don't fit into a recovery narrative.&lt;ref name="George2008"&gt;George, C. (2008) [http://www.psychminded.co.uk/recovery-approach-in-mental-health-is-idea-whose-time-has-come/ 'Recovery' approach in mental health is idea 'whose time has come'] Psychminded.co.uk Retrieved on 29 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been specific tensions between recovery models and "evidence-based practice" models in the transformation of US mental health services based on the recommendations of the [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daly, R. |title=Tensions Complicate Efforts to Transform MH Systems |journal=Psychiatr News |volume=42 |issue=13 |pages=14 |date=July 6, 2007 |url=http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.42.13.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's emphasis on recovery has been interpreted by some critics as saying that everyone can fully recover through sheer will power and therefore as giving false hope and implicitly blaming those who may be unable to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (2003) [http://www.psychlaws.org/PressRoom/stmtNewFreedomCommissionfailssickest.htm Treatment Advocacy Center Statement] Newswire. Retrieved on Aug 12 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the critics have themselves been charged with undermining consumer rights and failing to recognize that the model is intended to support a person in their personal journey rather than expecting a given outcome, and that it relates to social and political support and empowerment as well as the individual.&lt;ref name="McLean2003part2"&gt;McLean, A. (2003) [http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_8/Recovering1-McLean.html Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System  in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part II: Impact of Managed Care and Continuing Challenges] International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation. 8, 58-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various stages of resistance to recovery approaches have been identified amongst staff in traditional services, starting with "Our people are much sicker than yours. They won't be able to recover" and ending in "Our doctors will never agree to this". However, ways to harness the energy of this perceived resistance and use it to move forward have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Ashcraft, William A. Anthony (2008) [http://www.behavioral.net/article/addressing-resistance-recovery Addressing Resistance to Recovery:Strategies for working with staff resistant to change] Behavioral Healthcare: Tools for Transformation, March&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, staff training materials have been developed by various organisations, for example by the National Empowerment Center.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern L, Fisher D. Personal Assistance in Community Existence: A Recovery Guide. Lawrence, Mass: National Empowerment Center; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahern L, Fisher D. PACE/Recovery Curriculum.

Some positives and negatives of recovery models were highlighted in a study of a [[community mental health service]] for people diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. It was concluded that while the approach may be a useful corrective to the usual style of [[Case management (mental health)|case management]] - at least when genuinely chosen and shaped by each unique individual on the ground - serious social, institutional and personal difficulties made it essential that there be sufficient ongoing effective support with [[stress (biological)|stress]] management and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] in daily life. Cultural biases and uncertainties were also noted in the 'North American' model of recovery in practice, reflecting views about the sorts of contributions and lifestyles that should be considered valuable or acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Laurenzo &amp; Myers (2010) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068598/?tool=pubmed Culture, Stress and Recovery from Schizophrenia: Lessons from the Field for Global Mental Health]. Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry. 2010 September; 34(3): 500–528.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
A number of standardized questionnaires and assessments have been developed to try to assess aspects of an individual's recovery journey. These include the Milestones of Recovery (MOR) Scale, Recovery Enhancing Environment (REE) measure, Recovery Measurement Tool (RMT), Recovery Oriented System Indicators (ROSI) Measure,&lt;ref&gt;Website of the National Association of State Mental Health Directors [http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04measures.cfm Tools In Development: Measuring Recovery at the Individual, Program, and System Levels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417203321/http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04measures.cfm |date=2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andresen R, Caputi P, Oades L |title=Stages of recovery instrument: development of a measure of recovery from serious mental illness |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=40 |issue=11–12 |pages=972–80 |year=2006 |pmid=17054565 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2006.01921.x |url= http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1614.2006.01921.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous related instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Theodora Campbell-Orde, M.P.A., Judi Chamberlin, Jenneth Carpenter, M.S.W., &amp; H.

The data-collection systems and terminology used by services and funders are said to be typically incompatible with recovery frameworks, so methods of adapting them have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Ashcraft, William A.

==National policies and implementation==

===United States and Canada===
The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health has proposed to transform the mental health system in the US by shifting the [[paradigm]] of care from traditional medical psychiatric treatment toward the concept of recovery, and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] has endorsed a recovery model from a psychiatric services perspective.&lt;ref&gt;President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) [http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/FinalReport/FullReport.htm Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012043/http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/FinalReport/FullReport.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharfstein, S. |title=Recovery Model Will Strengthen Psychiatrist-Patient Relationship |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=40 |issue=20 |pages=3 |year=2005 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/20/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325073617/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/20/3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] reports developing national and state initiatives to empower consumers and support recovery, with specific committees planning to launch nationwide pro-recovery, anti-stigma education campaigns; develop and synthesize recovery policies; train consumers in carrying out evaluations of mental health systems; and help further the development of peer-run services.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of Health and Human Sciences [http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/NMH05-0193/default.asp Consumer-Directed Transformation to a Recovery-Based Mental Health System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130004539/http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/NMH05-0193/default.asp |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental Health service directors and planners are providing guidance to help state services implement recovery approaches.&lt;ref&gt;NASMHPD/NTAC (2004) [http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04intro.cfm Implementing Recovery-based Care: Tangible Guidance for SMHAs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001605/http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04intro.cfm |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US states, such as [[California]] (see the [[California Mental Health Services Act]]), [[Wisconsin]] and [[Ohio]], already report redesigning their mental health systems to stress recovery model values like hope, healing, empowerment, social connectedness, human rights, and recovery-oriented services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobson N, Greenley D |title=What is recovery?

At least some parts of the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]], such as the [[Ontario]] region, have adopted recovery as a guiding principle for reforming and developing the mental health system.&lt;ref name="OntarioRecovery"&gt;Canadian Mental Health Association, Ontario (2003) [http://www.ontario.cmha.ca/content/reading_room/policy_positions.asp?cID=3739 Recovery rediscovered: Implications for the Ontario mental health system]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unprecedented initiative, a group of parents of autistic children created the ''Revista Autismo''. All this was done only thanks to volunteer work and donations. The magazine is free, being circulated throughout Brazil and the first copy was published in September 2010.&lt;ref name=RemedySpot /&gt;

The founders are the journalist Paiva Junior (editor-in-chief) and the advertising Martim Fanucchi (art-editor), both fathers of autistic children. A lot of other parents collaborate with the magazine work, donations and sharing knowledge about [[Autism spectrum|ASD]].

'''Saccharin Study and Labeling Act of 1977''' or '''Saccharin Study, Labeling and Advertising Act''' was a [[United States Statutes at Large|United States federal statute]] [[Enacted law|enacting]] requirements for a [[Observational study|scientific observation]] regarding the [[Impurity|impurities]] in, potential [[toxicity]], and problematic [[carcinogen]]icity of a [[Sugar substitute|non-nutritive sweetener]] better known as [[saccharin]]. The [[Act of Congress]] invoked an immediate eighteen month [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] prohibiting the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health, Education, and Welfare]] from pursuing [[Regulation|regulatory]] implications by limiting the [[Production (economics)|production]] and use of saccharin. The Act [[Codification (law)|codified]] a warning label requirement [[Advocacy|advocating]] the non-nutritive sweetener had been discovered to yield carcinogenicity in laboratory animals.

The S. 1750 [[legislation]] was passed by the 95th Congressional session and signed into law by the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|39th President of the United States]] Jimmy Carter on November 23, 1977.

==Research Perspective==
In 1948 to 1949, [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] [[Pathology|pathologists]] conducted laboratory [[Analysis|analyses]] on [[Laboratory rat#Stocks and strains|Osborne-Mendel rat]] [[Laboratory specimen|specimens]] concluding [[Lymphoma|lymphosarcoma]] after a two-year laboratory analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carcinogenicity of Saccharin |last=Reuber |first=Melvin Dwaine |date=August 1978 |pages=174–175, 187 |pmc=1637197 |pmid=363408 |volume=25 |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |doi=10.1289/ehp.7825173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, scientists [[Collaboration|collaboratively]] suggested the white [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[Sugar substitute|sweetening agent]] could be a possible carcinogen. In 1958, saccharin was registered [[Generally recognized as safe|Generally Recognized As Safe]] (GRAS) by [[decree]] of the [[Delaney clause|food additives amendment]] retaining the non-nutritive sweetener as a [[Marketing|marketable]] [[Product (business)|product]] for [[Consumer (food chain)|human consumption]].

In 1972 to 1973 after much growing concern among the [[Demographics of the United States|United States population]], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF) led carcinogenic studies concluding the incidence of [[Bladder cancer|bladder tumors]] in [[Laboratory rat#Sprague Dawley rat|Charles River Sprague-Dawley rat]] [[Laboratory specimen|specimens]]. As a result of the laboratory analyses, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revoked the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) classification and imposed regulatory procedures restricting the use of saccharin in food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/29/archives/fda-removes-saccharin-from-list-of-safe-foods.html |title=F.D.A.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act established criteria for the scientific study of saccharin with key elements regarding the display, notification, and labeling of the non-nutritive sweetener.

===Saccharin and sweetening agent variants===
:'Saccharin' includes [[calcium]] saccharin, [[sodium]] saccharin, and [[ammonium]] saccharin.

===Saccharin and conduct of study===
:(A) The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall arrange an [[Analytical technique|analytical]] study to be conducted and based on available information of;
::* Current technical capabilities are to be utilized to predict the direct or secondary carcinogenicity or other toxicity in humans of substances which are added to, become a part of, or naturally occur in, food and which have been found to cause cancer in animals.
::* Direct and  indirect  health benefits  and  risks  to  individuals from foods which   contain carcinogenic or other toxic substances.
::* Existing means of evaluating the risks to health from the carcinogenicity or other toxicity of such substances, the existing means of evaluating the health benefits of  foods  containing such substances, and the existing statutory authority for, and appropriateness of, weighing such risks against such benefits.
::* Instances in which requirements to restrict or prohibit the use of such substances do not accord with the relationship between such risks and benefits.
::* Relationship between existing Federal food regulatory policy and existing Federal regulatory policy applicable to carcinogenic and other toxic substances used as other than foods.
:(B) The Secretary shall arrange a study to be conducted and to determine to the extent feasible of;
::* [[Chemical element|Chemical]] identity of any impurities contained in commercially used saccharin.
::* Toxicity or potential toxicity of any such impurities, including the carcinogenicity or potential carcinogenicity in humans.
::* Health benefits, if any, to humans resulting from the use of non-nutritive sweeteners in general and saccharin in particular.

===Entity to conduct study===
:National  Academy of Sciences is to conduct the studies whereby the actual expenses incurred by the Academy directly related to the non-nutritive sweeteners studies will be incurred by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. If the National Academy of Sciences declines the request to conduct any such study under such an arrangement, then the Secretary shall enter into a similar arrangement with another appropriate public or nonprofit private entity to conduct the non-nutritive sweeteners study.

===Reports to congressional committees===
:Within twelve months of the date of the [[enactment of a bill|enactment]] of the Act a report is to be submitted to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Human Resources]] and the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce]];
::* Results of the study conducted shall include supporting data and other materials provided by the entity which conducted the study.
::* Any action proposed to be taken on the basis of the results of the study.

:Within fifteen months of the date of the enactment of the Act a report is to be submitted to the Senate Committee on Human Resources and the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce;
::* Results of the studies shall include supporting data and other materials provided by the entity which conducted the study
::* Recommendations, if any, of such entity for legislative and administrative action
::* Recommendations for legislative action as the Secretary deems necessary.

===Labeling requirement===
:If product contains saccharin, a label or labeling shall bear the following statement:

::* ''USE OF THIS PRODUCT MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SACCHARIN WHICH HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CAUSE CANCER IN LABORATORY ANIMALS.''

:The statement is to be located in a conspicuous place on such label and labeling as proximate as possible to the name of such food and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by [[typography]], layout, and color with other printed matter on such label and labeling.

===Labeling requirement for retail establishments, notice, and display===
:* If it contains saccharin and is offered for sale, but not for immediate consumption, at a [[retail]] establishment, unless such retail establishment displays prominently, where such food is held for sale shall bear the labeling statement.
:* Each manufacturer of [[food]] which contains saccharin and which is offered for sale by retail establishments but not for immediate consumption shall bear the labeling statement.
:* The Secretary may by regulation review and revise or remove the labeling requirement if a determination of such action is necessary to reflect the current state of knowledge concerning saccharin.
:* The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the form, text, and manner of display of the notice and such other matters as may be required for the implementation of the requirements. Regulations shall be promulgated after an oral hearing but without regard to the [[National Environmental Policy Act|National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] and chapter 5 of [[Title 5 of the United States Code|title 5]], United States Code. In any action brought for [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]] of any such regulation, the reviewing court may not postpone the effective date of such regulation.

===Vending machines and health risk statement requirements===
:Regulation requires [[vending machine]]s through which food containing saccharin is sold to bear a statement of the risks to health which may be presented by the use of saccharin. Regulation requires such statement to be located in a conspicuous place on such vending machine and as proximate as possible to the name of each food containing saccharin which is sold through such machine. Any food containing saccharin which is sold in a vending machine which does not meet the labeling requirement is to be considered a misbranded food.

A '''samosa ''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|s|ə}}), '''sambusa''', '''sambuus''', '''samoosa''',  or '''samboksa''' is a fried or baked dish with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, or [[lentil]]s. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.&lt;ref name="OCF"&gt;{{cite book | first=Alan | last=Davidson | year=1999 | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-211579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaminskyLong2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold P.

Due to [[cultural diffusion]] and [[emigration]] from these areas, samosas in today's world are also prepared in other regions.

==Etymology==
The word "samosa" can be traced to the ''sanbosag'' ({{lang-fa|{{nastaliq|سنبوساگ}}}}).&lt;ref name=hin/&gt; The pastry name in other countries can also derive from this root, such as the crescent-shaped ''sanbusak'' or ''sanbusaj'' in the [[Arab world]], ''sambosa'' in [[Afghanistan]], ''somosa'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: {{lang|bn|সমোসা/ সিঙ্গারা }}) in [[Bengal]], ''samosa'' ([[Urdu]]:{{nq| سموسہ}}) in [[Pakistan]], ''samosa'' ([[Hindi]]:{{lang|sa|समोसा}}) in [[India]], ''({{lang-sd|سمبوسو Samboso/sambosa}})'', ''samboosa'' in [[Tajikistan]],''Sambôsy '' in [[Madagascar]] , ''samsa'' by [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking nations, ''sambuus'' by [[Somali languages|Somalis]] Of [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]],  [[Somali Region]] of [[Ethiopia]] and North Eastern Province of [[Kenya]],  ''chamuça'' in [[Goa]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Portugal]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} While they are currently referred to as ''sambusak'' in the Arabic-speaking world, Medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it ''sambusaj''.&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson, Maxime, Arthur Arberry, and Charles Perry. ''Medieval Arab cookery''. Prospect Books (UK), 2001. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sweets 1.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval India]]n Manuscript (''circa'' 16th century) showing samosas being served.]]
The term samosa and its variants cover a family of pastries and dumplings popular from north-eastern Africa to western China. An ancient recipe for samosa, widespread in the [[Near East]] and India, involves mixing 1 cup of oil, 1 cup of melted butter, 1 cup of warm water, and 1 teaspoon of salt with dough. A praise of samosa (as ''sanbusaj'') can be found in a 9th-century poem by the Persian poet [[Ishaq al-Mawsili]]. Recipes for the dish are found in the 10th-13th century Arab cookery books, under the names ''sanbusak'', ''sanbusaq'', and ''sanbusaj'', all of which derive from the Persian word ''sanbosag''. In [[Iran]], the dish was popular until 16th century, but by the 20th century, its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the ''sambusas'' of Larestan).&lt;ref name="OCF"/&gt; [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi]] (995-1077), an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] historian, mentioned it in his history, ''[[Tarikh-e Beyhaghi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beyhaqi, Abolfazl, ''Tarikh-e Beyhaghi'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Asian ''[[samsa (food)|samsa]]'' were introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by traders from [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=hin&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/lovely-triangles/story-aIL2GLawECV084GXmGqshI.html Lovely triangles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108021557/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print.aspx?Id=587bdb22-9913-4871-a1ed-705840d9a281 |date=8 January 2009 }} "[[Hindustan Times]]", 23 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amir Khusro]] (1253–1325), a scholar and the royal poet of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], wrote in around 1300 CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the "samosa prepared from meat, [[ghee]], onion, and so on".&lt;ref name=tri&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/food.htm Savoury temptations] ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', 5 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]], a 14th-century traveler and explorer, describes a meal at the court of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], where the ''samushak'' or ''sambusak'', a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and spices, was served before the third course, of ''[[Pilaf|pulao]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-today.com/iplus/1999_3/life3.html Regal Repasts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107113339/http://www.india-today.com/iplus/1999_3/life3.html |date=7 January 2009 }} Jiggs Kalra and Dr [[Pushpesh Pant]],  ''[[India Today|India Today Plus]]'', March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'', a 16th-century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] document, mentions the recipe for ''qutab'', which it says, “the people of [[Hindustan]] call ''sanbúsah''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00702015%26ct%3D50%26rqs%3D666 Recipes for Dishes] ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'', by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]].

This can be cooked in 20 different ways, and gives four full dishes.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional varieties==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
Regions where the dish serves as a staple of local cuisine have different ways of preparing it.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Samosas were brought to the Indian subcontinent by various Muslim merchants, and patronized under various Islamic dynasties in the region.

====India====
[[File:Samosasindia.jpg|thumb|left|Samosas being fried at a road-side restaurant in [[Raipur]], [[India]]]]
The samosa is made with [[all-purpose flour]] locally known as [[Maida flour|maida]] shell stuffed with some filling, generally a mixture of mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, spices and green chili, or fruits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gujjurecipes.com/content/sumosa Samosa recipe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114174429/http://gujjurecipes.com/content/sumosa |date=14 January 2011 }}''Samosa recipe from Gujarat''. Retrieved 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yoghurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''. It can also be served with tomato sauce. Some people relish the crunchy samosa without any accompaniment.

In [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookclickndevour.com/samosa-recipe-how-to-make |title= Punjabi samosa|date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]

In [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.

Usually, shingaras are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.

[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]
In [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.

In the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], Kerala, and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamuças'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc.&lt;!---, but completely lack the mashed potato filling of its northern variation conflicting?---&gt; It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables. &lt;!--repeat of above Samosas made with a spiced mashed potato mixture are quite popular in the Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Karnataka]], Kerala and [[Tamil Nadu]].
 --&gt;
Samosa is one of the most popular [[India]]n [[snack]] items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neelam Batra|title=1000 Indian Recipes|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UmQ9hLYcULMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=indian+snacks+recipe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS_dLw8pjcAhVKKo8KHTA3BbcQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=samosa&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 July 2018|year=2018|publisher=Natalie Chapman|ISBN =978-0-7645-1972-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ist [[vegetable]] or potato filling coated with maida dough and deep fried in oil. &lt;!-- While you come across spicy huge samosas in [[Punjab]], there are less spicy mixed vegetable variations in other [[states]]. --&gt; The Muslims prepare meat filled variations of the snack during [[Ramadan]] and other festive occasions. [[Mathri]] samosa is yet another popular snack in [[North India]] for spice-loving snack eaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://livingfoodz.com/recipes/Mathri-Samosa-1435|title=Mathri Samosa|author=Ranveer Brar|publisher=Livingfoodz.com|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bangladesh====
[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]

Both flat-shaped and full-shaped samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a সিঙাড়া (''shingara'') and is normally much smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes and vegetables, however, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.

====Nepal====
Samosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.

====Pakistan====
Samosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.

In Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|کاغذی سموسہ}}}}; "paper samosa" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). 
Sweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.

==== Maldives ====
The types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''Eating on the Islands'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===

====Burma====
Samosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].

====Indonesia====
The local equivalent of samosas in [[Indonesia]] are known as ''pastel,'' closer to Spanish [[Empanada|empanadas]] style, ie not so much curry/spices  flavor as it is lightly seasoned compared to Indian samosa that are richer in spices. 

The light thin pastry are usually filled with vegetables, minced beef, chicken or shrimp, topped with slices of egg depending on taste, before deep fried to golden color. As customary this popular snack is enjoyed with green hot [[Bird's eye chili|chili padi]].

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:Sambusadish2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somali cuisine|Somali]] ''Sambuus'' being deep-fried]]
Sambuus are a staple of local cuisine in the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Djibouti]] and [[Somalia]], where they are known as ''sambuus''. They are traditionally made with a thinner pastry dough, similar to egg roll wraps, and stuffed with ground beef. While they can be eaten any time of the year, they are usually reserved for special occasions.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], a {{transl|he|sambusaq}} ({{lang-he|סמבוסק}}) is a semicircular pocket of dough filled with mashed chickpeas, fried onions, and spices. Another variety is filled with meat, fried onions, parsley, spices, and pine nuts, which is sometimes mixed with mashed chickpeas and breakfast version with feta or [[tzfat cheese]] and ''[[za'atar]]''. It is associated with [[Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi Jewish cuisine]]. An Israeli ''sambusak'' is not as spicy as the Indian version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000039492.htm|title=Gems in Israel: Sabich - The Alternate Israeli Fast Food|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122052152/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000039492.htm|archivedate=22 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gil Marks, an Israeli food historian, sambusak has been a traditional part of the Sephardic [[Sabbath]] meal since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lb3MVYVp_9sC&amp;pg=PT289&amp;lpg=PT289&amp;dq=sambusak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkjdABmC6u&amp;sig=UbDJx4XB9UnanyPM-E6g9kN3aMs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XlKaUdawFune4QTC1YGAAw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBzgy|title=Olive Trees and Honey: A Treasury of Vegetarian Recipes from Jewish Communities Around the World|last=Marks|first=Gil|date=2008-03-11|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0544187504|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese-speaking regions===
[[File:Chamuças.jpg|thumb|[[Goan cuisine|Goan]] ''chamuças'']]
In [[Goa]] (India) and [[Portugal]], samosas are known as ''chamuças''. They are usually filled with chicken, beef, pork, lamb or vegetables, and generally served quite hot. Samosas are an integral part of [[Goan cuisine|Goan]] and [[Portuguese cuisine]], where they are a common snack.

A samosa-inspired snack is also very common in [[Brazil]], and relatively common in several former Portuguese colonies in [[Africa]], including [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], where they are more commonly known as {{lang|pt|[[Pastel (food)|pastéis]]}} (in Brazil) or {{lang|pt|empadas}} (in Portuguese Africa; in Brazilian Portuguese, {{lang|pt|empada}} refers to a completely different snack, always baked, small in size, and in the form of an inverse pudding). They are related to the Hispanic [[empanada]] and to the Italian [[calzone]].

===English-speaking regions===
Samosas are popular in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], and are also growing in popularity in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/01/30/nb-boycesamosas.html|title=Lineups threaten to stall Fredericton's hot samosa market|date=30 January 2007|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailygleaner.canadaeast.com/rss/article/743845|title=Patel couldn't give her samosas away|last=Fox|first=Chris|date=29 July 2009|work=[[The Daily Gleaner]]|publisher=dailygleaner.com|page=A1|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].

'''Simulation Open Framework Architecture''' ('''SOFA''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Allard|first1=Jérémie|last2=Cotin|first2=Stéphane|last3=Faure|first3=François|last4=Bensoussan|first4=Pierre-Jean|last5=Poyer|first5=François|last6=Duriez|first6=Christian|last7=Delingette|first7=Hervé|last8=Grisoni|first8=Laurent|title=SOFA - an Open Source Framework for Medical Simulation|booktitle=Medicine Meets Virtual Reality (MMVR'15)|date=2007|url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00319416/document|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source framework primarily targeted at real-time [[physical simulation]], with an emphasis on '''medical simulation'''. &lt;br/&gt;
It is mostly intended for the research community to help develop newer algorithms, but can also be used as an efficient prototyping tool or as a [[physics engine]].

==Features==
Based on an advanced software architecture, SOFA allows users to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sofa-framework.org/about/features/|title=SOFA Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Create '''complex and evolving simulations''' by combining new algorithms with existing algorithms
* Modify most parameters of the simulation (deformable behavior, surface representation, solver, constraints, collision algorithm, ...) by simply editing a XML file
* Build complex models from simpler ones using a [[scene graph]] description
* Efficiently simulate the dynamics of interacting objects using '''abstract equation solvers'''
* Reuse and easily compare a variety of available methods
* Transparently '''parallelize''' complex computations using semantics based on data dependencies
* Use new generations of GPUs through the CUDA API to greatly improve computation times

===Scene graph===
A key aspect of SOFA is the use of a [[scene graph]] to organize and process the elements of a simulation while clearly separating the computation tasks from their possibly parallel scheduling. The description of a SOFA simulation can easily be done in an '''XML file'''. For even more flexibility, a Python plugin allows scripting simulations using the Python language. &lt;br/&gt;
Basically, a SOFA scene-graph is composed with:
* '''Nodes''': used to categorise the components and keep the XML file clean (mechanical node, collision node, visual node, ...)
* '''Components''': main elements used to build a scene (solver component, forcefield component, rendering component, ...)
* '''Datas''': everything that components have to deal with (forces, velocities, positions, ratios, ...)

===Plugins===
To extend its capacities and provide more features, SOFA is bundled with a lot of plugins:
* Drivers for VR / '''haptic''' / simulation devices (Geomagic®, ARTTrack™, Novint® Falcon™…)
* Visualization and simulation of medical images
* Python scripting
* Parallelization:
** Multithreading
** GPU computing using the '''CUDA''' API

==Community==

===SOFA Day===
Organized each year, the SOFA Day is a one-day event dedicated to SOFA. This event is '''open to everyone''' interested in SOFA, from beginner to advanced users. It contains an introduction to SOFA, several tutorials (adapted to the audience) and a large time to experience SOFA with the help of the instructors.

===SOFA Consortium===
Exactly ten years after the first commit in SOFA, [[Inria]] founded the SOFA Consortium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/|title=SOFA Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2015. &lt;br/&gt;
The Consortium missions are to:
* Represent the '''identity of SOFA'''
* Organize and develop the '''community'''
* Distribute and make SOFA more '''stable'''

'''St. Rita's Medical Center''' is a large hospital serving a 70-mile radius of [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  It was started in 1918 by [[Sisters of Mercy]], an order of [[Roman Catholic]] women founded by [[Catherine McAuley]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1831.

There are also separate facilities in [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]], [[Glandorf, Ohio|Glandorf]] and [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapakoneta]] that serve other parts of the [[region]] for rehabilitation, orthopedics and other medical services.

==History==
In 1918, the Sisters of Mercy opened a [[hospital]] in [[Lima, Ohio]].

St. Rita's was the fulfillment of a dream of the Right Reverend Monsignor A.E. Manning, the Reverend William Tobin and Mother Bernardine McMullen, R.S.M. At the time of its opening, the hospital was not completely finished, but was opened in order to administer care to victims of one of the first and most devastating epidemics to plague the Lima area, the [[Spanish Flu]] [[influenza pandemic]] of 1918.

Through the coming years, St. Rita's expanded to add more beds and services to meet the [[healthcare]] needs of the [[community]]. In 1948, a seven-story addition to the original building was completed which housed modern [[Surgery|operating]], [[Childbirth|delivery]] and [[X-ray]] rooms, more office space and an additional 150 beds. Just nine years later, it again became apparent that new facilities, additional beds, and a School of Nursing building would be needed to keep St. Rita's Hospital on the updated move to provide quality [[medical]] care for the people of [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and surrounding counties.

After 59 years as St. Rita's Hospital, on March 9, 1977, the hospital name was changed to St. Rita's Medical Center.

In 2007, St. Rita’s opened “The Medical Center of The Future.” The campus now looks more like a university campus stretching six blocks with covered walkways, ponds, water fountains, gardens and a track for walking and running.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mercy.com/en/lima/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the Medical Center, additional space has been created to accommodate families whose involvement in the healing process is essential. The spacious rooms within the Medical Center not only provide a private and therapeutic environment for healing but also an aesthetic appeal with the presence of glass atriums, greenery, and decorative water details.

The corridors of the modern looking High Street Walkway lead patients to their physicians’ offices and to the new High Street Café and Courtyard Café.

The Henry &amp; Beverly Hawk Heart Center expanded services in 2008 and became The Henry &amp; Beverly Hawk Heart and Vascular Center and now offers vascular screening tests for blockages in the carotid artery, blockages in the legs from peripheral arterial disease and Aortic aneurysm, bulging of the main artery.

St. Rita's has, over the years, emphasized long range planning and keeping completely up-to-date not only with the most sophisticated pieces of equipment, but in medical procedures and services to the community.  In 2008, St. Rita's purchased Lima Allen County Paramedics (LACP) and operates the service of emergency/911 response, interfacility transfers, and Ambulette transports.

==Other facilities==
The St. Rita's Medical Center provides other facilities across the region including two Urgent Care locations in [[Lima, Ohio]] and regional locations in [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]], [[Glandorf, Ohio|Glandorf]], and [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapakoneta]].

===Lima urgent care===
St. Rita’s added St. Rita’s Westside Luke-Urgent Care (formerly) Luke Medical Center, 2195 Allentown Road, Lima, OH 45905 and St. Rita’s Eastside Urgent Care, 967 Bellefontaine Avenue, Lima, OH 45804.

===Delphos===
The Delphos  Ambulatory Care Center, located in Delphos, offers urgent care, outpatient services and specialty physician clinics to the people of [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Van Wert County, Ohio|Van Wert]] counties in [[Ohio]].

The center accepts appointments for the following services or tests.

* [[cardiology]]
* [[gastroenterology]]
* [[St. Rita's Medical Center#Delphos|OB/GYN]]
* [[orthopedics]]
* [[podiatry]]
* [[urology]]

===Glandorf===
The Putnam County Ambulatory Care Center located in [[Glandorf, Ohio|Glandorf]] provides a 24-hour [[emergency]] care for patients in the [[Putnam County, Ohio|Putnam County]] area who need immediate care, rather than being [[transported]] to Lima.

The following tests or services can be completed at the ambulatory care center for greater patient convenience.

* [[X-rays]]
* [[Mammography]]
* [[Computed tomography]]
* [[Electrocardiogram]]
* [[Bone density|Bone density screenings]]
* [[Laboratory Tests]]
* [[Audiology]] [[Exams]]
* [[Ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]]
* [[Occupational Health Services]]
* [[Outpatient Nursing]]

===Wapakoneta===
St. Rita's Medical Center provides comprehensive rehabilitation services at the [[YMCA]] in [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapakoneta]], which works with St. Rita's to provide the following [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services in Auglaize County.
* [[Physical Therapy]]
* [[Occupational Therapy]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">A '''treef''' ([[Surinamese Dutch]], derived from [[Sranantongo]] trefu) is a food taboo.

In Suriname there certain groups have long adhered to belief in treef, especially among the African descendants. The consumption of certain foods is prohibited for some, on the belief that it could cause major diseases, particularly leprosy.&lt;ref&gt; [[Albert Helman]]. Cultureel mozaïek van Suriname. Zutphen: De Walburg Pers 1977,  p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; These prohibitions can vary individually, but it is inextricably related to conditions in the family. A treef is inherited from the father's side, but it can be revealed in a dream, often by a woman. In addition, a woman must take into account special food taboos during pregnancy. There is great importance attached to the treef; if a child observes the treef of his father, and yet experiences a skin condition, this is seen as a strong indication that the child was begotten by the woman with another man. Finally treef also be acquired later in life by wearing certain charms that compel you to abstain from certain foods. &lt;ref&gt;Albert Helman. ''Cultureel mozaïek van Suriname.''  Zutphen: De Walburg Pers 1977, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], due to influence from Portuguese-speaking Jews who came to Suriname in the 17th century. This is also the source of Sranan ''kaseri'' 'ritually clean, [[kosher]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Ic5Kth7aiusC&amp;pg=PA475&amp;lpg=PA475&amp;dq=sranan%20trefu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YsBcSPHaVy&amp;sig=T75UBY1wpFchSZnsl9pI2-Alg4c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC3eTE7_XQAhXMtRQKHSdKAogQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sranan%20trefu&amp;f=false|title=Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of "Jewish" Languages: With Special Attention to Judaized Arabic, Chinese, German, Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Slavic (modern Hebrew/Yiddish), Spanish, and Karaite, and Semitic Hebrew/Ladino ; a Collection of Reprinted Articles from Across Four Decades with a Reassessment|first=Paul|last=Wexler|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|accessdate=25 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water privatisation in Jakarta''' began when the British water company [[Thames Water]] entered into an agreement with the son of then-President [[Suharto]] in 1993 to obtain a water concession. Under the influence of the French water company [[Suez Environnement|Suez]], however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the [[Indonesian rupiah]] massively lost in value due to the [[East Asian financial crisis]], and President Suharto was toppled. The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors.

The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body|title=Concession Agreement: Technical Targets and Service Standards|url=http://www.jakartawater.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=204&amp;lang=in&amp;limitstart=3|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers.

On 24 March 2015 the  Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. The court noted that the private operators were "negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta’s residents.”&lt;ref name="thejakartapost.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elyda|first1=Corry|title=Court decision ends privatization of water in Jakarta |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/24/court-decision-ends-privatization-water-jakarta.html|website=Jakarta Post|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charmila|first1=Winda A.|title=Coalition opposing Jakarta water privatization wins appeal|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/10/coalition-opposing-jakarta-water-privatization-wins-appeal.html|publisher=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varagur|first1=Krithika|title=Massive Water Privatization Program to End in Jakarta After 18 Years|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/water-privatization-to-end-in-jakarta/4077224.html|website=VOA News|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
To understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources and on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, [[groundwater]] [[overexploitation]] and [[land subsidence]].

===Water and the poor===
[[File:Jakarta slumlife22.JPG|thumb|300px|Slum residents in Jakarta.]]
According to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors.&lt;ref name=Gerlach/&gt; Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. Some households also collect rainwater. According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water.&lt;ref name="HDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.5248&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Disconnected: Poverty, Water Supply  and Development in Jakarta, Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|year=2006|publisher=UNDP|author1=Karen Bakker|author2=Michelle Kooy|author3=Nur Endah Shofiani|author4=Ernst-Jan Martijn|last-author-amp=yes|work=Human Development Report 2006, Occasional Paper|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply.&lt;ref name=Gerlach/&gt; Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, [[nitrate]] and [[e-coli]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=KRuHA&gt;{{cite web|last=KRuHA People's coalition for the rights to water|title=Poor Water Service, Most of Jakarta People Threatened by E-Coli|url=http://www.kruha.org/page/en/dinamic_detil/50/194/Press_Releases/Poor_Water_Service__Most_of_Jakarta_People_Threatened_by_E_Coli.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling of water is frequent.&lt;ref name=Gerlach/&gt; Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.&lt;ref name=Gerlach&gt;Esther Gerlach and Alizar Anwar:[https://books.google.com/books?id=_H87dGQI_RAC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=kekarpola+airindo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L2ayr-O1MS&amp;sig=Jy_PVVJ9NVOAFkBs8yC1T0MCqZc&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=x0TJTvGuA5CxhAfnhIDrDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jakarta&amp;f=false Case Study 5:Jakarta, Indonesia], p. 110-121, in:R. Franceys and Esther Gerlach, Regulating water and sanitation for the poor, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial arrangements and the concessions===
Under a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. It consists of ''water tariffs'' collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from ''water charges'' paid by the government to the private operators.&lt;ref&gt;Nila Ardhianie and Irfan Zamzami:[http://www.waterjustice.org/uploads/attachments/no%20pro-poor%20Jakarta_0.pdf No Pro-poor Agenda in Jakarta Water Concession], Amrta Institute for Water Literacy and KRuHA - People's coalition for the rights to water, 21 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22  percent.&lt;ref name=Santono/&gt;&lt;ref name="Concession Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body|title=Concession Agreement|url=http://www.jakartawater.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=204&amp;lang=in&amp;limitstart=2|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector.

'''Water tariffs'''. Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:

* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);
* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);
* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);
* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).

Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; In 2010 customers in Category IVa  paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Tariff&gt;{{cite web|last=Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body|title=Tabel Tarif Air Per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Tahun 1998 - 2010 (Water tariff table per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the years 1998-2010): 2007-2010|url=http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/tarif_air.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62).&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:[http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007.&lt;ref name=Ardhianie&gt;{{cite web|last=Nila Ardhianie|title=Questioning ADB’s Loan to Palyja|url=http://www.forum-adb.org/inner.php?sec=13&amp;ref=extras&amp;id=107|publisher=Amrta Institute for Water Literacy|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deficit between water tariffs and water charges'''. There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company ''Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya'' (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies than was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a “balanced composition of connections” in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta.&lt;ref name=Gerlach/&gt; Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022.&lt;ref name="Ardhianie 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ardhianie|first=Nila|title=Thirteen years of privatized water in Jakarta|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/11/thirteen-years-privatized-water-jakarta.html|publisher=Jakarta Post|accessdate=20 November 2011|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financing'''. In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the [[European Investment Bank]] and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005.&lt;ref name=Ardhianie/&gt; In 2007 the [[Asian Development Bank]] approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja.&lt;ref name="ADB West Jakarta"/&gt; The loan has been criticised for having been based on "careless assumptions", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales.&lt;ref name=Ardhianie/&gt; In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market.&lt;ref name=Aetra/&gt;

===Water resources===
'''Flooding'''. Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70  percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Indonesia's Urban Studies|title=Jakarta's Vulnerability to Global Warming|url=http://indonesiaurbanstudies.blogspot.com/2007/04/global-warming-and-jakarta.html|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies.

'''Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence'''. Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far [[overdrafting|exceeds]] [[groundwater recharge]], leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in  the Sarinah bridge in 1978. Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. It varies by neighbourhoods. Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. In North Jakarta the decline was 57&amp;nbsp;cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28&amp;nbsp;cm only respectively. However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits.

'''Surface water used by the utilities'''. The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from ''Perum Jasa Tirta II'', a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the [[Citarum River]] 70&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city. According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations.&lt;ref name="ADB West Jakarta"/&gt; The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned.

Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by [[Tangerang]] District Water Works Enterprise 30&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Jakarta.&lt;ref name=Zamzami&gt;{{cite web|last=Zamzami|first=Irfan|title=Jakarta Water Privatization Today: Dried Water Tap, or Change|url=http://www.waterjustice.org/uploads/attachments/dried%20water_eng_for%20web.pdf|publisher=Amrta Institute for Water Literacy|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it.&lt;ref&gt;Palyja:[http://en.palyja.co.id/news-activities/news-update/read/146/river-water-treatment-in-jakarta-attracs-participants-of-siww/ River Water Treatment in Jakarta Attracs Participants of SIWW], 7 July 2011, retrieved on 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted [[Ciliwung River]] is used for backup supply.

==History==

===Prelude (1993-1997)===
In 1993 the British water company [[Thames Water]] International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President [[Suharto]]. Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo – which had no experience in water supply - received 20  percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. The French water company [[Suez (company)|Lyonnaise des Eaux]], now [[Suez Environnement]], which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. It already had a joint venture with the [[Salim Group]] of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body.

Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1990/05/10/000009265_3960928164906/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf Staff appraisal report, Second jabotabek urban development project], 10 May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concession award (1997)===
In June 1997 the two 25-year water [[concession (contract)|concession]]s were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya ('''Palyja'''), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of [[Thames Water]] International, called  Thames PAM Jaya ('''TPJ'''), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of [[non-revenue water]] to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone.&lt;ref name=Santono&gt;Hamong Santono, Coordinator Koalisi Rakyat untuk Hak Atas Air (KRuHA)/Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water, Indonesia:[http://kruha.org/oneMODUL/oneDocument/1300268730.pdf Current Situation of Jakarta Water Privatization], ca. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated based on exchange rates from www.oanda.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the concession contracts. British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years.

===Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator===
[[File:Jakarta.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View of Jakarta.]]
Due to the impact of the [[1997 East Asian financial crisis]] the contracts were renegotiated through a "Restated Cooperative Agreement" signed in October 2001. The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an "independent" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;Lanti, Achmad:[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a747672654~frm=titlelink?words=achmad,lanti A Regulatory Approach to the Jakarta Water Supply Concession Contracts], in: International Journal of Water Resources Development, Volume 22, Number 2, June 2006, pp. 255-276(22)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged.&lt;ref name=Tariff/&gt; After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in with the support of the [[Asian Development Bank]] about the so-called "rate rebasing" for the period 2002-2007. During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged.&lt;ref name=Tariff/&gt; For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; 
In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic tariff adjustment (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the water charge would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body. [http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA).&lt;ref name=Santono/&gt; The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20040617.G03 Jakarta Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exit of Thames Water and freeze of water tariffs and charges (2006-2009)===
In January 2006 Jakarta Governor [[Sutiyoso]] and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;Jakarta Post:[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/01/05/governor-bows-pressure-delays-water-rates-increase.html Governor bows to pressure; delays water charges increase], 5 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate [[Astra International]], and [[Citigroup]] of the US (19 percent).&lt;ref name="ADB West Jakarta"&gt;Asian Development Bank:[http://www.adb.org/documents/rrps/ino/41913-ino-rrp.pdf Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia: West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project], August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Intelligence|title=Thames continues Asian exit plan. Buyout firms seek to reassure regulator as PAM Jaya sale goes ahead.|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/7/10/general/thames-continues-asian-exit-plan.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|volume=7 |issue=10 |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta ('''Aetra''').&lt;ref name=Aetra&gt;{{cite web|last=Aetra|title=Aetra at a glance|url=http://www.aetra.co.id/en/cp_aetra_at_glance.htm|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Fauzi Bowo]], who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Lako and Nila Ardhianie:[http://www.waterjustice.org/uploads/attachments/Financial%20Machinations-1.pdf Jakarta Water Privatization: Financial Machination and the Impact to the Customer], KRuHA People's Coalition for the Right to Water, Amrta Institute for Water Literacy and Public Services International, 31 January 2010, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen.

===Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)===
In 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of [[GDF Suez]], Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister [[Francois Fillon]] and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations.&lt;ref name=Zamzami/&gt; Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations,&lt;ref name="Ardhianie 2011"/&gt; despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra.&lt;ref name=Zamzami/&gt;

In October 2012 [[Suez Environnement]] announced that it would sell its 51% share in Palyja to [[Manila Water]], under the condition that the city council provided a letter of support.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:Suez to exit Jakarta water concession after 14 years, 18 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 the city council and PAM Jaya, however, announced that they did not approve the sale, which was called off. The city instead announced its intention to buy the shares itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City turns down Palyja  offer to sell water shares|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/25/city-turns-down-palyja-offer-sell-water-shares.html|publisher=Jakarta Post, 25 June 2013|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court Case against Privatization (since 2013)===
The Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization (KMMSAJ) initiated a petition against the private management of Jakarta's water supply with 588 signatories in 2011 and supported a similar petition in court by 12 people in 2013. On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled that the terms of the privatisation of Jakarta's water violated the common right to water guaranteed by Article 33 of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]]. The court also noted that the private operators were "negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta’s residents.”&lt;ref name="thejakartapost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia: Jakarta Court Bans Water Privatization|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205404362_text|publisher=Global Legal Monitor, The Library of Congress|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision. The concessions remained in place pending a final court decision.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian government rallies behind private water|publisher=Global Water Intelligence, May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the appeal court reversed the district court decision on the ground that the claimants did not have standing to bring the claim. The claimants brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. 

====Impact of privatisation====
The concession contracts included specific targets for service coverage, water production, water sales and [[non-revenue water]]. The contracts also foresaw that by the 2008, the tenth contract year, drinking water quality standards had to be met and that water supply had to be continuous at a pressure of 7.5 meters water column.&lt;ref name="Concession Agreement"/&gt; Until 2004 both private operators succeeded to increase the share of the population with access to water and reduced water losses in line with the renegotiated contractual targets. After 2004 they further increased access and reduced water losses, but did not reach the targets any more. Overall, from 1998 to 2008 access to water increased from 46 to 64  percent (revised target: 68  percent) and water losses were reduced from 61  percent to 50  percent (revised target: 42  percent). After targets were reduced to more realistic levels in 2008, the operators were able to reach most of their new targets.

===Overall access===
Estimates of how access to piped water changed during the concession period vary considerably. According to the regulatory agency, access increased substantially. In the Palyja service area it almost doubled from 209,000 customers in 1998 to 399,000 customers in 2008, exceeding the renegotiated contractual target of 392,000. In the TPJ service area it increased less quickly during the same period from 278,000 to 380,000 customers, somewhat below the target of 403,000.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:[http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; In relative terms, Palyja says that in its concession area access almost doubled from 34 percent in 1998 to 59 percent in 2007 and 64 percent in 2011.&lt;ref name="Palyja figures"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palyja|title=Key Figures|url=http://en.Palyja.co.id/profile/key-figures/|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the TPJ service area, access increased from about 57 percent in 1998 to about 67 percent in 2004, but stagnated afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:[http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt; However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an [[improved water source]] from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Percentage of Households by Province and Source of Improved Drinking Water, 1993-2010|url=http://dds.bps.go.id/eng/tab_sub/view.php?tabel=1&amp;daftar=1&amp;id_subyek=29&amp;notab=13|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures.

===Access by the poor===
The private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. However, these attempts have been fairly limited. For example, Palyja has installed so-called ''Master Meters'', from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as [[Mercy Corps]]. As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in [[Jembatan Besi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palyja|title=Master Meter|url=http://en.palyja.co.id/main-business/water-for-all/master-meter/|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voice of America|title=Jakarta Struggles to Provide Clean Water to All|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/jakarta-struggles-to-provide-clean-water-to-all-99487644/166124.html|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palyja|title=Water Kiosks|url=http://en.palyja.co.id/main-business/water-for-all/water-kiosk/|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piped connections were also expanded. One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an ''[[output-based aid]]'' grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Iain Menzies  |author2=Irma Magdalena Setiono |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Output-Based Aid in Indonesia: Improved Access to Water Services for Poor Households in Western Jakarta|url=http://www.gpoba.org/gpoba/sites/gpoba.org/files/OBA%20No.%2038%20Jakarta%2011-12-10web.pdf|work=OBApproaches|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a "mafia" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt;

===Water sales===
The concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011.&lt;ref name="Palyja figures"/&gt; In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year to more than 140 in 2004. However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target.&lt;ref name=Iwan&gt;{{cite web|last=Iwan|first=Renalia|title=Ten Years of Public Private Partnership in Jakarta Drinking Water Service (1998-2007) Eastern Jakarta Drinking Water Service by Thames PAM Jaya|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/978/thesis.pdf?sequence=1|work=Master Thesis|publisher=School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=42–44|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service quality===
According to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day.&lt;ref name="jakartawater.org"&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:[http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 83 and 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jakarta Globe|title=Cilincing Residents Blame Dirty Tap Water for Spate of Health Problems|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/cilincing-residents-blamedirty-tap-water-for-spate-of-health-problems/433469|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began.&lt;ref name="Amrta Video"&gt;{{cite web|last=Transnational Institute:|title=Video: Through the Empty Tap - Water Privatisation in Jakarta, March 2011|url=http://www.tni.org/video-through-empty-tap-water|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.

===Water losses===
[[File:Jakarta slumlife14.JPG|thumb|300px|A boy takes a shower from what may be an illegal water connection, illustrating the complicated notion of "water losses" in a city characterised by widespread poverty.]] 
Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession [[non-revenue water]] declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012.&lt;ref name="Palyja figures"/&gt; According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:[http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 128-130&lt;/ref&gt; Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs.

===Tariffs===
'''Tariff increases'''. Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category.&lt;ref name=Tariff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The exchange rate, after the massive devaluation in 1997, was about the same in 2010 as in 1998 at about 9,000 Rupiahs per USD&lt;/ref&gt; This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor.

'''Affordability'''. According to a study by the [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia]] in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Palyja: Affordability study (Power Point Presentation)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparison with other cities'''. At an average of USD 0.70/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body. [http://www.jakartawater.org/images/stories/unduh/10tahunbrEng.pdf The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008)] (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and USD 0.71/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Public Utilities Board:[http://www.pub.gov.sg/general/factsandfigures/pages/watertariff.aspx Water tariff], accessed on 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Profitability===

Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies.

===Customer satisfaction===
The Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28  percent for responsiveness to complaints.&lt;ref name="jakartawater.org"/&gt; Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute [[Taylor Nelson Sofres]] (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57  percent in 2005 to 75  percent in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palyja|title=Customer Satisfaction Survey|url=http://en.Palyja.co.id/customer-services/customers-satisfaction-survey/|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey carried out by [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia]] in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia: Customer Satisfaction Survey 2008, Presentation by Palyja&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Żywiec Lake''' (Polish: ''Jezioro Żywieckie'') is a [[reservoir]] on the [[Soła]] river in southern Poland, near the town of [[Żywiec]]. It was created in 1966, when several villages in the area, such as Zarzecze, Tresna, Zadziel and Old Żywiec were flooded following the construction of a dam. The lake has the area of around 10 square kilometres, and the earth-filled dam is 39 metres high and 310 metres long. The maximum depth of the lake is 26,8 meters, and the average depth - 8,6 metres. Near the dam there is a hydro-electric power plant with the capacity of 21 MW. Żywiec Lake is used mostly for tourist purposes, to regulate the flow of water, and to protect the area from flooding.

On November 15, 1978, at 5 a.m., two [[Autosan]] [[Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacji Samochodowej|PKS]] buses, in a 15-minute interval, skidded while driving along the lake, and fell into icy water. The buses were carrying coal miners to work at [[Brzeszcze]] coal mine. Thirty people died, and nine survived. This tragedy is commemorated by a plaque near the bridge.
