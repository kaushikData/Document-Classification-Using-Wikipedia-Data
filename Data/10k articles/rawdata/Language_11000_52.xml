      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">The '''American National Corpus''' (ANC) is a  [[text corpus]] of [[American English]] containing 22 million words of written and spoken data produced since 1990. Currently, the ANC includes a range of genres, including emerging genres such as email, tweets, and web data that are not included in earlier corpora such as the [[British National Corpus]]. It is annotated for [[Lexical category|part of speech]] and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[shallow parsing|shallow parse]], and [[Named entity|named entities]].

The ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A fifteen million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the ANC Website.

The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool (ANC2Go), the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including CoNLL IOB format, the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard]] (XCES) (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software. Plugins to import the annotations into [[General Architecture for Text Engineering]] (GATE) are also available.

The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and  annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation.

ANC annotations are automatically produced and unvalidated. 
A 500,000 word subset called the [[Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)]] is annotated for approximately 20 different kinds of linguistic annotations, all of which have been hand-validated or manually produced. These include [https://web.archive.org/web/20160404152309/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations, among others. Like the OANC, MASC is freely available for any use, and can be downloaded from the ANC site or from the  [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. It is also distributed in part-of-speech tagged form with the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].

The ANC and its sub-corpora differ from similar corpora primarily in the range of linguistic annotations provided and the inclusion of modern genres that do not appear in resources like the [[British National Corpus]]. Also, because the initial target use of the corpora was the development of statistical language models, the full data and all annotations are available, thus differing from the  [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (COCA) which is available only selectively through a web browser.

Continued growth of the OANC and MASC relies on contributions of data and annotations from the computational linguistics and corpus linguistics communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''aphanisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφάνισις ''aphanisis'', "disappearance") is the disappearance of [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860761-X | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was later applied to the disappearance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

==Jones==
According to the theories of [[Ernest Jones]], who coined the term in 1927,&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; aphanisis is the foundation of all [[neurosis|neuroses]]. Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than [[castration anxiety]], an argument he used against [[Sigmund Freud]] in their debate over [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Jones considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up "either their sex or their incest".&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuker/N. A. Levinson, ''Female Psychology'' (1991) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] of separation, a point taken up by [[John Bowlby]] in the context of his own theory of [[Anxiety|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''Separation'' (2010) pp. 431–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: "''aphanisis'' is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the ''fading'' of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: "when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...''aphanisis''".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself ''vis-a-vis'' something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. 

Because the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.

[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;R/ Maule/J. Beaulieu, ''In the Dark Room'' (2009), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
[[Montaigne]] has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Les quatre concepts fondamnetaux de la psychanalyse'' (Le Séminaire, Livre XI, 1964), Texte établi par J.-A. Miller, Paris, Seuil, coll. Points, 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apollon/R. Feldstein, ''Lacan, Politics, Aestetics'' (1996) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
{{Contains Bengali text}}
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] ({{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'') is one of the [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Magadhan languages]], evolved from [[Magadhi Prakrit]] and [[Pali]] languages native to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The core of Bengali vocabulary is thus [[etymology|etymologically]] of [[Magadhi Prakrit]] and [[Pali]] languages. However, centuries of major [[loanword|borrowing]] and [[reborrowing]] from [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Austroasiatic languages]] and other languages has led to the adoption of a wide range of words with foreign origins. Thus making the origins of borrowed and reborrowed words in the '''Bengali vocabulary''' numerous and diverse, due to centuries of contact with various languages.

==Classifications of origin types==
[[File:Bengali Vocabulary2.gif|thumb|Sources of modern literary Bengali words{{Legend|#FFCC99|তদ্ভব ''Tôdbhôbô'' (native)}}{{Legend|#993300|তৎসম ''Tôtsômô'' (Sanskrit reborrowings)}}{{Legend|#FF6666|দেশী ''Deshi'' (indigenous loans) and বিদেশী ''Bideshi'' (foreign loans)}}|250px|right]]
The typical Bengali dictionary lists 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered তৎসম ''tôtsômô'' (words directly reborrowed from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]), 21,100 (28%) are তদ্ভব ''tôdbhôbô'' (native Bengali vocabulary with Sanskrit cognates), and the rest being borrowings from দেশী ''deshi'' "[[Austroasiatic languages|indigenous (Austroasiatic)]]" and বিদেশী ''bideshi'' "foreign" sources.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a huge chunk of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimising their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly 67% of native ''tôdbhôbô'' words, while ''tôtsômô'' reborrowings only make up 25% of the total. ''Deshi'' and ''bideshi'' borrowings together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.

==Differences in Vocabulary==

This table below compares the differences of spoken and used vocabularies in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]].

==Examples of borrowed words==
Due to centuries of contact with [[European ethnic groups|European]]s, [[Mughals]], [[Arabs]], [[Persia]]ns, and East Asians, The [[Bengali language]] has absorbed countless words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these [[Loanword|borrowings]] into the core vocabulary. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. After centuries of contact from [[Persia]] and the Middle East, followed by the invasions of the [[Mughal Empire]], numerous [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] words were absorbed and fully integrated into the lexicon. Later, East Asian travellers and European [[colonialism]] brought words from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], French, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and most significantly English. Some very common borrowings are shown below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2578">'''Body image''' is a medical term, often used in the context of describing a patient's cognitive perception of their own body. The medical concept began with the work of the Austrian neuropsychiatrist and psychoanalyst [[Paul Schilder]], described in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' first published in 1935.

== Medical applications ==
In psychology, it typically refers to one's perceptions, beliefs, and emotional attitudes towards one's body.&lt;ref name = "Cash"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cash|first=S.|author2=Brown, T.A.|title= Body image in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: A review of the literature|journal= Behavior Modification|year= 1987|volume= 11|pages=487–521|doi=10.1177/01454455870114005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is used to discuss various pathologies and disorder, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and other eating disorders, [[body dysmorphic disorder]], [[body integrity identity disorder]] and various post-[[stroke]] conditions like [[somatoparaphrenia]], and [[unilateral neglect]].

Body image problems may also manifest themselves in psychopathologies like [[schizophrenia]] and the [[Cotard delusion]]. Although it is often confused with the term '[[body schema]]', which concerns postural and motor control, 'body image' is distinct from the former phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Gallagherbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher |first=S.|title= How the body shapes the mind|year= 2006|isbn=0-19-920416-0|publisher= Oxford University Press, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

===Feel status minus Actual status Inconsistency===
FAI (Feel status minus Actual status Inconsistency) index is used to assess someone’s weight perception. FAI scores range from -3 to +3: Negative FAI values mean weight status underestimation, positive FAI values mean weight status overestimation and a FAI score of 0 means a realistic perception of one’s weight status. One study found that women tend to have positive FAI values (overestimating their weight) while  men had negative FAI values (underestimating their weight) &lt;ref name=" pmid = 24512483 "&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zaccagni L | title = Body image and weight perceptions in relation to actual measurements by means of a new index and level of physical activity in Italian university students. | journal = J Transl Med. | volume = 12 | issue = |date=Feb 2014 | pmid = 24512483 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-12-42 | pages=42 | pmc=3923553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12763">[[File:CartesianLinguistics.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Harper &amp; Row]])]]
The term '''Cartesian linguistics''' was coined with the publication of '''''Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought''''' (1966), a book on [[linguistics]] by [[Noam Chomsky]]. The word "Cartesian" is the adjective pertaining to [[René Descartes]], a prominent 17th-century philosopher.  However, rather than confine himself to the works of Descartes, Chomsky surveys other authors interested in rationalist thought.
In particular, Chomsky discusses the ''[[Port-Royal Grammar]]'' (1660), a book which foreshadows some of his own ideas concerning [[universal grammar]].

Chomsky traces the development of linguistic theory from Descartes to [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], that is, from the period of [[the Enlightenment]] directly up to [[Romanticism]]. The central doctrine of ''Cartesian Linguistics'' maintains that the general features of grammatical structure are common to all languages and reflect certain fundamental properties of the mind. The book was written with the purpose of deepening "our understanding of the nature of language and the mental processes and structures that underlie its use and [[language acquisition|acquisition]]".
Chomsky wished to shed light on these underlying structures of the human language, and subsequently whether one can infer the nature of an organism from its language.

Chomsky's book received mostly unfavorable reviews. Critics argued that "Cartesian linguistics" fails both as a methodological conception&lt;ref&gt;Percival K.,''On the Non-Existence of Cartesian Linguistics'', in Cartesian Studies, edited by R. J. Butler (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1972), pp. 137–145. {{ISBN|0 631 13750 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a historical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Aarsleff H., ''The History of Linguistics and Professor Chomsky'',  Language, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Sep., 1970), pp. 570-585&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes covered in ''Cartesian Linguistics''==

=== Man vs. brute ===
Certain mechanical factors of language function, such as response to stimuli, are evident in both humans and animals; however, Chomsky cites several 17th-century Cartesian experiments that show that the ''creative'' aspect of language is specific only to human beings. This is, in essence, the Cartesian theory of language production.

Chomsky writes, "one fundamental contribution of what we have been calling 'Cartesian linguistics' is the observation that human language, in its normal use, is free from the control of independently identifiable external stimuli or internal states and is not restricted to any practical communicative function, in contrast, for example, to the pseudo language of animals". "In short, animal 'language' remains completely within the bounds of mechanical explanation as this was conceived by Descartes and [[Géraud de Cordemoy|Cordemoy]]" and the creative aspect of language is what separates humans and animals.

===Freedom from instinct===
[[philosophy|Philosophical]] undertones permeate Cartesian theory. One example of this is the idea that freedom from instinct and from stimulus control is the basis for what we call "human reason". Weakness of instinct is man's natural advantage, that which makes him a rational being. "From this conception of language, it is only a short step to the association of the creative aspect of language use with true ''artistic'' creativity". In other words, "the 'poetical' quality of ordinary language derives from its independence of immediate stimulation and its freedom from practical ends", essentially subject matter that correlates with Cartesian philosophy.

===Universality===
Chomsky parallels theories of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Goethe]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], holding them up as researchers who were seeking a universal order and to show the tendency of Cartesian thinking to diffuse into different areas of academia. Humboldt's effort to reveal the organic form of language, like many of the cited experiments, is placed into the context of modern linguistics to show the differences between the Cartesian model of linguistics and the modern model of linguistics, and to illustrate the contributions of the former to the latter.

Another aspect of this universality is [[generative grammar]], a Chomskyan approach, which is one finite, ubiquitous aspect of language that provides the "[[organic unity]]" of which Humboldt wrote. Also Humboldtian is the idea that the forces generating language and thought are one and the same.

===Deep structure vs. surface structure===
"Pursuing the fundamental distinction between body and mind, Cartesian linguistics characteristically assumes that language has two aspects", namely, the sound/character of a linguistic sign and its significance. Semantic and phonetic interpretation may not be identical in Cartesian linguistics. [[Deep structure]]s are often only represented in the mind (a mirror of thought), as opposed to surface structures, which are not{{clarification needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;!--Are not what?--&gt;.

Deep structures vary less between languages than surface structures. For instance, the transformational operations yielding surface forms of Latin and French may obscure common features of their deep structures. Chomsky proposes, "In many respects, it seems to me quite accurate, then, to regard the theory of [[transformational grammar|transformational generative grammar]], as it is developing in current work, as essentially a modern and more explicit version of the [[Port Royal Grammar|Port-Royal]] theory".

===Summary of Port Royal Grammar===
The [[Port Royal Grammar]] is an often cited reference in ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]'' and is considered by Chomsky to be a more than suitable example of Cartesian linguistic philosophy. "A sentence has an inner mental aspect (a deep structure that conveys its meaning) and an outer, physical aspect as a sound sequence." This theory of [[transformational grammar|deep and surface structures]], developed in Port Royal linguistics, meets the formal requirements of language theory. Chomsky describes it in modern terms as "a base system that generates deep structures and a transformational system that maps these into surface structures", essentially a form of [[transformational grammar]] akin to modern theories.

===Past and present===
Chomsky bridges the past with the present by stating that from the standpoint of modern linguistic theory, the characterization and discovery of deep structures is absurd, in accordance with the present study and quantification of such things as "linguistic fact" and "sound-meaning correspondences". In any case, traditional attempts to deal with deep and surface structure theory were unsuccessful.

Descartes' idea of language is that it is a form of self-expression, not merely communication…Modern linguistics hasn't dealt with, or rather hasn't fully acknowledged, problems raised by Cartesian philosophy. They have been glossed over as unnecessary problems of a generally well-accepted theory.

Another aspect of Cartesian linguistics is the "necessity for supplementing descriptive statements with a rational explanation", in order to qualify as a true science. Chomsky claims that an excessive rationality and priorism were common to the Enlightenment period and that a great, underlying hypothesis as to the general nature of language is missing in the Cartesian analysis of deep structure.

==="Common notions" (Herbert of Cherbury's ''De Veritate'' (1624))===
These refer to the "inborn capacitiies" or a certain "natural instinct" that "instructs us in the nature, manner, and scope of what is to be heard, hoped for, or desired" (Cherbury). These latent notions are only activated through an outside stimulus. Chomsky asserts that this focus on innate and psychological doctrine as a precursor to experience and knowledge is typical of ''Cartesian'' linguistics, along with the requisite of an external stimulus for activation of the doctrine's latent function.

===Approach to language learning===
With this said, "language acquisition is a matter of growth and maturation of relatively fixed capacities, under appropriate external conditions". The 17th century's amenable approach to language learning was very non-conforming, as the overall perception was that knowledge arose on the basis of scattered, inadequate data. Properties conducive to what is learned were attributed to the mind. Theories of perception and learning were essentially the same, though it was an acknowledged difference that would consequently become indistinct during acquisition.

"Thus prior knowledge and set play a large role in determining what we see" ([[Ralph Cudworth|Cudworth]] [Treatise on Morality] 423-424)
A common idea/perception was that an object/idea could be stamped upon the soul upon the occasion of an idea excited from the comprehensive power of the intellect itself. Only Humboldt, who was a living connection between the rationalist Enlightenment and the Romantic period, devised the underlying generative system of language perception . Again, Chomsky asserts that "contemporary research in perception has returned to the investigation of internally represented schemata...". The current work of modern linguistics continues the tradition of ''Cartesian'' linguistics in transformational grammar.

Chomsky formulates fundamental conclusions of Cartesian linguistics in his studies.

==Reception and developments==
Chomsky accomplished his research for ''Cartesian Linguistics'' while he was a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies; thereafter a great deal of subject matter was presented at the Christian Gauss seminars at Princeton University in 1965. Since the publication of ''Cartesian Linguistics'', Chomsky's history has been criticized as an artificial predecessor to his own ideas, mainly formulated in the context of 1950s psychological behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;Hamans, C., &amp; Seuren, P. A. M. (2010). ''Chomsky in search of a pedigree''. In D. A. Kibbee (Ed.), Chomskyan (R)evolutions (pp. 377-394). New York: Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky replied to his critics and defended the validity of his conception by further elaborating his historical perspective. The book was re-edited by James McGilvray in 2002 and 2009 with only minor changes and lengthy introductions. New reviews invariably point to previous criticism which had been left unanswered, suggesting that the introductory essays also failed to convince.&lt;ref&gt;Sharbani, B. (2003). Review of ''Cartesian Linguistics'', [http://linguistlist.org/issues/14/14-2061.html LINGUIST List 14.2061] (accessed on August 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Behme C., Review of ''Cartesian Linguistics'', Metapsychology Online Reviews, vol.13 iss. 36 (sept 1.st 2009)
[http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=5110&amp;cn=394]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objection to the book's argument bears on the point that, for his "Cartesian linguistics", Chomsky relies mostly on the Port-Royal grammar and not on Descartes' writings. However, the grammar is not Cartesian in any interesting sense. The whole discussion was succinctly summarized in 1969: "Professor Chomsky may wish to cling to the term "Cartesian linguistics" for reasons not fully explicit in his book, although his remarks on the use of such a label suggest that he means simply 'rationalist linguistics.' But if he wishes to include under his label the Cartesian notion of language as species-specific to man, and the notion of underlying structures (which I argue is not Cartesian in origin), as well as the general rational approach, he can do no better than to use the term 'Port-Royal linguistics'."&lt;ref&gt;Miel J., ''Pascal, Port-Royal, and Cartesian Linguistics'', Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1969), pp. 261-271&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christine Westermann''' (born 2 December 1948 in [[Erfurt]]) is a [[Germany|German]] television and radio host, [[journalist]] and [[author]].

== Radio and television career ==
Westermann grew up in [[Mannheim]]. After finishing her [[Abitur]] she did an editorial traineeship at {{Interlanguage link multi|Mannheimer Morgen|de}} and attended the [[Deutsche Journalistenschule]] (German Journalism School) in [[Munich]]. Starting in 1972, she worked as a freelance journalist for several radio and TV stations, produced films and reports and moderated the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Drehscheibe (TV show){{!}}drehscheibe|de|3=Drehscheibe (Fernsehsendung)}}'' on [[ZDF]]. In 1983 she switched to [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and moderated the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Aktuelle Stunde (TV show){{!}}Aktuelle Stunde|de|3=Aktuelle Stunde (Fernsehsendung)}}'' until 2002, from 1987 on together with [[Frank Plasberg]].

Since 1996 Westermann has been moderating the show ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Zimmer frei! (TV show){{!}}Zimmer frei!|de|3=Zimmer frei!}}'' together with [[Götz Alsmann]], in which an alternating famous  "roommate" will be challenged with unusual tasks and games. Westermann and Alsmann called the format a "children's birthday party for celebrities“. For their work with ''Zimmer frei!'' the duo has been awarded with the [[Adolf-Grimme-Preis]] in 2000.

Westermann also works as a host for the German radio station [[WDR 2]], where she presents - rotating with her colleagues - the ''Montalk'' (Monday talk) and on Sundays the ''Buchtipp'' (Book tip). In 2010 she was awarded with the German Radio prize ({{Interlanguage link multi|Deutscher Radiopreis|de}}) in the category ''Best Interview''.

== Writer ==
In 1999 Christine Westermann published her first book ''Baby, when will you marry me? - A novel from the jungle of relationships'' (German title: ''Baby, wann heiratest du mich?''). One year later her second book ''I think he dropped (me). Stories out of the real life'' (German: ''Ich glaube, er hat Schluss gemacht. Geschichten aus dem richtigen Leben'') followed. In collaboration with {{Interlanguage link multi|Jörg Thadeusz|de}} she published the 2008 book ''Invitation for dance – a twosome story'' (German: ''Aufforderung zum Tanz – Eine Zweiergeschichte''), a correspondence between two journalists.

== Personal life ==
Between 1990 and 2000 Westermann had a secondary residence in San Francisco, where she worked as a freelance correspondent. During that time she shuttled regularly between the US and her workplace in [[Cologne]]. Since June 2000 Westermann has been married to corporate consultant Jochen Baller, who is also her agent. They live in Cologne.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1094">'''Conceptual necessity''' is a property of the certainty with which a state of affairs, as presented by a certain description, occurs: it occurs by conceptual necessity if and only if it occurs just by virtue of the meaning of the description. If someone is a [[bachelor]], for instance, then he is bound to be unmarried by conceptual necessity, because the meaning of the word "bachelor" determines that he is.

Alternatively, there is [[metaphysical necessity]], which is a certainty determined, not by the meaning of a description, but instead by facts in the world described.

Historically, [[Baruch Spinoza]] was a subscriber to this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/notes.html |title=Notes to Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Bergish''' is a group of dialects of the [[Bergisches Land|Bergisches Land Region]] in West Germany. It combines features of the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] group, [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], and (predominantly) the [[South Guelderish]] or Cleverlands group, it is usually seen as part of the latter. South Guelderish covers much of the [[Lower Rhine]] area in [[Germany]] and extends into the Central [[Netherlands]]. It is a [[Low Franconian]] group, whereas Westphalian belongs to the [[Low German]] group.
It is also seen as part of the larger [[Meuse-Rhenish]] language group.
East Bergish is called ''{{lang|de|Ostbergisch}}'' in German.

In popular, rather than scientific view, East Bergish dialects are often referred to as ''[[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]'' by locals, or ''[[Rhinelandic]]'' by outsiders.

'''Eugenie Söderberg ''' (1903–1973) was a Swedish-American writer and journalist born in [[Heidelberg]], Germany noted for her profound concern with women's issues which she addressed in her novels and short stories.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/soderberg.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126061546/http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/soderberg.shtml |archivedate=2008-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

In 1912, her father, Alexander Riwkin, a [[Russian-Jewish]] immigrant who had studied [[philosophy]] established himself in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, as an industrialist following a short return to the family's home town, Gomel in Russia. The Riwkin home flourished as a center for culture, attracting both established and upcoming literary figures from [[Scandinavia]] and abroad.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; Eugenie, the eldest daughter was encouraged by her philosopher father who was also a lecturer and writer of short stories in Russian and [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

Eugenie's younger brother Joseph Riwkin also followed a similar path, acting for a while as a stimulating nucleus within a group of the most aspiring young writers of Sweden. These included [[Gunnar Ekelöf]], [[Harry Martinson]], [[Karin Boye]], Ebbe Linde, who with many others participated as writers and editors in the avant-garde Swedish magazine, ''Spektrum''.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

==Career==

Eugenie was soon working as a creative writer and earning her living as an editor, journalist and newspaper reporter.  She attained immediate success in 1930 with her first novel ''Studentfabriken'' (''The Student Factory''). The work was translated into fourteen languages and also produced as a film.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

In 1928 she married the young writer [[Mikael Söderberg]] and son of [[Hjalmar Söderberg]]. After only several years of marriage her husband died in 1931.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; She continued to maintain a close relationship with her in-laws, in particular her father-in-law. However it was her sister [[Anna Riwkin]], Sweden's foremost photographer, who was to be her closest friend throughout her lifetime. Although she remained close to her brother Joseph and her sister-in-law, [[Ester Riwkin]], both also writers.

==Later life==

In 1940 Eugenie Söderberg came to the United States as a reporter for Scandinavian newspapers and in the following year she married the well-known art dealer and [[Plato]] scholar [[Hugo Perls]].&lt;ref name=name/&gt; She eventually became an American citizen and continued to write both journalistically and creatively, covering American theater, music and art. One of her later books, ''Min Son är Min'' (''My Son is Mine''), appeared in 1965 and was well received.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

The writer died in January 1973, at the age of sixty-nine.

[[File:English letter frequency (alphabetic).svg|right|340px|thumbnail|A typical distribution of letters in [[English language]] text. Weak ciphers do not sufficiently mask the distribution, and this might be exploited by a cryptanalyst to read the message.]]

In [[cryptanalysis]], '''frequency analysis''' (also known as '''counting letters''') is the study of the [[letter frequencies|frequency of letters]] or groups of letters in a [[ciphertext]]. The method is used as an aid to breaking [[classical cipher]]s.

Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of [[English language]], &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;O&lt;/tt&gt; are the most common, while &lt;tt&gt;Z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; are rare. Likewise, &lt;tt&gt;TH&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ER&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ON&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;AN&lt;/tt&gt; are the most common pairs of letters (termed ''[[bigram]]s'' or ''digraphs''), and &lt;tt&gt;SS&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;EE&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;TT&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;FF&lt;/tt&gt; are the most common repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | last = Singh | first = Simon | authorlink = Simon Singh | title = The Black Chamber: Hints and Tips | url = http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/hintsandtips.html | accessdate = 26 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonsense phrase "[[ETAOIN SHRDLU]]" represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical English language text.

In some ciphers, such properties of the natural language plaintext are preserved in the ciphertext, and these patterns have the potential to be exploited in a [[ciphertext-only attack]].

== Frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers ==
In a simple [[substitution cipher]], each letter of the [[plaintext]] is replaced with another, and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext. For instance, if all occurrences of the letter &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; turn into the letter &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;, a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; would suggest to a cryptanalyst that &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; represents &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;.

The basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them. More &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; corresponds to &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; in the plaintext, but this is not certain; &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; are also very common in English, so &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; might be either of them also. It is unlikely to be a plaintext &lt;tt&gt;z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; which are less common. Thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters.

More complex use of statistics can be conceived, such as considering counts of pairs of letters (''bigrams''), triplets (''trigrams''), and so on. This is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst, for instance, &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;U&lt;/tt&gt; nearly always occur together in that order in English, even though &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; itself is rare.

=== An example ===

Suppose [[Alice and Bob|Eve]] has intercepted the [[cryptogram]] below, and it is known to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher as follows:

For this example, uppercase letters are used to denote ciphertext, lowercase letters are used to denote plaintext (or guesses at such), and &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; represents the plaintext letter &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt;.

Eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines: counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that &lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt; is the most common single letter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asecuritysite.com/security/Challenges/scramb A worked example of the method from bill's "A security site.com"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;tt&gt;XL&lt;/tt&gt; most common [[bigram]], and &lt;tt&gt;XLI&lt;/tt&gt; is the most common [[trigram]]. &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; is the most common letter in the English language, &lt;tt&gt;th&lt;/tt&gt; is the most common bigram, and &lt;tt&gt;the&lt;/tt&gt; is the most common trigram. This strongly suggests that &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; and  &lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;. The second most common letter in the cryptogram is &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;; since the first and second most frequent letters in the English language, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; are accounted for, Eve guesses that &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, the third most frequent letter. Tentatively making these assumptions, the following partial decrypted message is obtained.

 {{not a typo|heVeTCSWPeYVaWHaVSReQMthaYVaOeaWHRtatePFaMVaWHKVSTYhtZetheKeetPeJVSZaYPaRRGaReM

Using these initial guesses, Eve can spot patterns that confirm her choices, such as "&lt;tt&gt;that&lt;/tt&gt;". Moreover, other patterns suggest further guesses. "&lt;tt&gt;Rtate&lt;/tt&gt;" might be "&lt;tt&gt;state&lt;/tt&gt;", which would mean &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt;. Similarly "&lt;tt&gt;atthattMZe&lt;/tt&gt;" could be guessed as "&lt;tt&gt;atthattime&lt;/tt&gt;", yielding &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Z&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt;. Furthermore, "&lt;tt&gt;heVe&lt;/tt&gt;" might be "&lt;tt&gt;here&lt;/tt&gt;", giving &lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt;. Filling in these guesses, Eve gets:

 {{not a typo|hereTCSWPeYraWHarSseQithaYraOeaWHstatePFairaWHKrSTYhtmetheKeetPeJrSmaYPassGasei

In turn, these guesses suggest still others (for example, "&lt;tt&gt;remarA&lt;/tt&gt;" could be "&lt;tt&gt;remark&lt;/tt&gt;", implying &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;~&lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt;) and so on, and it is relatively straightforward to deduce the rest of the letters, eventually yielding the plaintext.

At this point, it would be a good idea for Eve to insert spaces and punctuation:

 Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle
 from a glass case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at
 that time, unknown to naturalists&amp;mdash;of course a great prize in a scientific point
 of view. There were two round black spots near one extremity of the back, and a
 long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the
 appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and,
 taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion
 respecting it.

In this example from [[The Gold-Bug]], Eve's guesses were all correct. This would not always be the case, however; the variation in statistics for individual plaintexts can mean that initial guesses are incorrect. It may be necessary to [[backtracking|backtrack]] incorrect guesses or to analyze the available statistics in much more depth than the somewhat simplified justifications given in the above example.

It is also possible that the plaintext does not exhibit the expected distribution of letter frequencies. Shorter messages are likely to show more variation. It is also possible to construct artificially skewed texts. For example, entire novels have been written that omit the letter "&lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;" altogether &amp;mdash; a form of literature known as a [[lipogram]].

== History and usage ==
[[File:Al-kindi-cryptanalysis.png|thumb|right|First page of [[Al-Kindi]]'s 9th century ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'']]

[[File:HurufUNCsort.png|thumb|right|[[Arabic Letter Frequency]] distribution.]]

The first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis (indeed, of any kind of cryptanalysis) was given in the 9th century by [[Al-Kindi]], an [[Arab]] [[polymath]], in ''A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Kindi|Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi]] "The origins of cryptology: The Arab contributions", ''[[Cryptologia]]'', 16(2) (April 1992) pp. 97&amp;ndash;126.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that close textual study of the [[Qur'an]] first brought to light that [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has a characteristic letter frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Our Time: Cryptography|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004y272|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use spread, and similar systems were widely used in European states by the time of the [[Renaissance]]. By 1474, [[Cicco Simonetta]] had written a manual on deciphering encryptions of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] text.&lt;ref name="isbn0-684-83130-9"&gt;{{ Cite book | last = Kahn | first = David L. | authorlink = David Kahn (writer) | title = The codebreakers: the story of secret writing | publisher = Scribner | year=1996 | location = New York | isbn = 0-684-83130-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic Letter Frequency]] and a detailed study of letter and word frequency analysis of the entire book of [[Qur'an]] are provided by Intellaren Articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | last = Madi | first = Mohsen M. | title = Quran Suras Statistics | url = http://www.intellaren.com/articles/en/qss | publisher = Intellaren Articles | year=2010 | accessdate = 16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several schemes were invented by cryptographers to defeat this weakness in simple substitution encryptions. These included:

* ''[[Homophonic substitution cipher|Homophonic substitution]]'': Use of ''homophones'' &amp;mdash; several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. For example, for English, both X and Y ciphertext might mean plaintext E.
* ''[[Polyalphabetic cipher|Polyalphabetic substitution]]'', that is, the use of several alphabets &amp;mdash; chosen in assorted, more or less devious, ways ([[Leone Alberti]] seems to have been the first to propose this); and
* ''[[Polygraphic substitution]]'', schemes where pairs or triplets of plaintext letters are treated as units for substitution, rather than single letters, for example, the [[Playfair cipher]] invented by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in the mid-19th century.

A disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering, leading to mistakes. Famously, a British Foreign Secretary is said to have rejected the Playfair cipher because, even if school boys could cope successfully as Wheatstone and Playfair had shown, "our attachés could never learn it!".

The [[rotor machine]]s of the first half of the 20th century (for example, the [[Enigma machine]]) were essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis.
However, other kinds of analysis ("attacks") successfully decoded messages from some of those machines.

Frequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During [[World War II]] (WWII), both the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[United States|Americans]] recruited codebreakers by placing [[crossword]] puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the [[Axis powers]] were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally [[IBM]] card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's [[Signals Intelligence Service|SIS]]. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by [[computer]] [[software]], which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.

== Frequency analysis in fiction ==
[[File:Dancing men.svg|thumb|right|Part of the cryptogram in ''The Dancing Men'']]
Frequency analysis has been described in fiction. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Gold-Bug]]", and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] tale "[[The Adventure of the Dancing Men]]" are examples of stories which describe the use of frequency analysis to attack simple substitution ciphers. The cipher in the Poe story is encrusted with several deception measures, but this is more a literary device than anything significant cryptographically.

[[File:Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-Muqri al Fayyumi - Glossary of Islamic Legal Terminology - Walters W590 - Bottom Exterior.jpg|thumb|right |A Glossary of Islamic Legal Terminology]]
A '''glossary''', also known as a '''vocabulary''' or '''clavis''', is an alphabetical list of [[Term (language)|terms]] in a particular [[domain of knowledge]] with the [[definition]]s for those terms. Traditionally, a glossary appears at the end of a [[book]] and includes terms within that book that are either newly introduced, uncommon, or specialized. While glossaries are most commonly associated with non-fiction books, in some cases, fiction novels may come with a glossary for unfamiliar terms.

A bilingual glossary is a list of terms in one language defined in a second language or glossed by [[synonym]]s (or at least near-synonyms) in another language.

In a general sense, a glossary contains explanations of [[concept]]s relevant to a certain field of study or action. In this sense, the term is related to the notion of [[ontology]]. Automatic methods have been also provided that transform a glossary into an ontology&lt;ref&gt;R. Navigli, P. Velardi.

Buitelaar and P. Cimiano, Eds.), Series information for Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, IOS Press, 2008, pp. 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; or a computational lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;R. Navigli.

== Core glossary ==
[[File:Intelligence Law Glossary 2011.pdf|thumb|right|200px|The Intelligence Law glossary provides a description of the key terms in intelligence law.]]
A '''core glossary''' is a simple glossary or [[defining dictionary]] that enables definition of other concepts, especially for newcomers to a language or field of study. It contains a small working vocabulary and definitions for important or frequently encountered concepts, usually including idioms or metaphors useful in a culture.

These methods typically start from domain [[terminology]] and extract one or more glosses for each term of interest. Glosses can then be analyzed to extract [[hypernym]]s of the defined term and other lexical and semantic relations.

A [[telephony]] system based on '''host media processing''' (HMP) is one that uses a general-purpose computer to process a telephony call’s media stream rather than using [[digital signal processor]]s (DSPs) to perform the task. When telephony call streams started to be digitized for time-division-multiplexed ([[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]]) transport, processing of the media stream, to enhance it in some way, became common. For example, digital echo cancellers were added to long-haul circuits, and transport channels were shaped to improve modem performance. Then, in the mid-‘80s, computer-based systems that implemented messaging, for example, used DSPs to compress the audio for storage, and [[fax server]]s used DSPs to implement [[fax modem]]s.

However, since the late ‘90s, the [[instructions per second|millions of instructions per second]] (MIPS) of processing power available on low-cost [[Personal computer|PCs]] have been adequate to process several media streams, while still leaving enough processing power to handle the application. And, following [[Moore’s Law]], PC capacity continues to double every 18 months, while the MIPS required to process a call’s media stream have remained relatively constant. Now, in the latter half of the century’s first decade, a single PC can handle well over 100 simultaneous calls.

Prior to IP telephony, when you wanted to connect a [[telecommunications]] system to a telecom network it was necessary to have a telecom-specific physical interface. This could mean an analog interface (POTS/DS-0), for low-density non-network systems, or a digital interface, such as a [[Digital Signal 1|T-1]] or [[E-carrier level 1|E-1]] line ([[Digital Signal 1|DS-1]], delivering 24 or 32 DS-0s). A DS-4 connection delivers 274.176 Mbit/s or 4032 DS-Os. In each case, telecom-specific electronic interfaces, which were proprietary and, therefore, relatively expensive, were necessary. The situation changes dramatically with an all-IP telecom infrastructure. The network interfaces move from being a significant proprietary component to off-the-shelf high-performance IP interfaces, an inherent feature in every modern computing system. Today, 10-[[Gigabit]] [[Ethernet]]' telephony systems are being deployed.

The term Host Media Processing was first used in a product name by Intel in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Intel Announces Two Standards-based Software Building Blocks | publisher = Speechtekmag | date = September 1, 2003 | url = http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/Industry-News/Intel-Announces-Two-Standards-based-Software-Building-Blocks-33852.aspx | accessdate = 2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly adopted as a generic term for software-based telephony products, used by many companies including [[Aculab]], Pika, [[Eicon Networks]], Uniqall, Commetrex, and NMS. Intel's Host Media Processing product line (still called HMP) exists today under the [[Dialogic Corporation|Dialogic]] banner.

The concept of using an industry standard PC to do telephony processing is now widely understood and accepted, with open-source platforms like [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]], [[YATE Yet another telephony engine|YATE]] and [[FreeSWITCH]] using the same principle. The rise of interest in [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] and Fax-over-IP (FoIP) have driven demand for open, host-based solutions that can be molded into a variety of different communications solutions. HMP components are used today to implement many different kinds of solutions including [[Private branch exchange|PBX]], conference servers, unified communications servers and [[Interactive voice response|IVR]]. The emergence of [[Hardware virtualization|virtualization]] in recent years also increases the appeal of HMP, since it is then possible to think of telephony resources as being virtual channels (rather than dedicated hardware boards), which offer the same benefit as virtual processors and servers, i.e. resilience; less hardware; space saving; lower maintenance.

Network connectivity through low-cost industry-standard interfaces influences the consideration of whether to use DSPs or server blades for media processing, especially in media servers, where packet-delays are not as troublesome and TDM interfaces are not required. Without telephony interface blades and their attendant chassis and power systems available to host the DSPs, the addition of DSPs on proprietary blades must be independently justified. They will continue to be justified for the highest-density applications. However, with the semiconductor industry continuing to follow Moore’s law, host media processing will support 1500 channels on one blade in 2010. DSPs will always offer even higher densities, but if 1500 channels meets the system requirement, higher densities will have little incremental value.

Not every use of the term “HMP” means the same thing. There are, for example, HMP systems that do no actual media processing, so it is important to understand how the term is being used today.

Modern digital-media telephony systems require signal processing to transform a call stream or extract information from it. Transformation includes the processing required to send or receive a fax and to transcode the stream from one speech codec to another for capability matching or bandwidth reduction. [[DTMF]] detection, caller ID, and in-band [[Call progress analysis|call-progress analysis]] are good examples of information extraction.

There are many limited-function media servers on the market that don’t actually do any media (signal) processing. There is an Internet Engineering Task Force ([[IETF]]) “RFC” (2833) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2833.html&lt;/ref&gt; that defines how a gateway can perform the in-band-tone analysis to extract some of the embedded information, such as DTMF and caller ID. In this case, all the media server need do is parse the RTP buffers from a gateway to derive the tone information.

But what about transcoding, where one voice-compression scheme (vocoder) it transcoded to another? Some media servers, for example, simply process buffers, and, therefore, cannot perform any transcoding, limiting them to low-function voice messaging. RTP [[Network packet|packets]] are simply stored and played back as they are received. This means no [[Automatic gain control|AGC]], volume control, time-scale modification (playback speedup and slowdown), or capabilities matching with endpoint terminals, making this type of so-called HMP media server a viable option only in the most functionally constrained applications.

For years, the terms “[[signal processing]]” and “media processing” have been used interchangeably, so, most appropriately, the term HMP is reserved for those systems where host MIPS are actually used to perform digital signal-processing tasks.

An '''imaging biomarker''' is a biologic feature, or [[biomarker]] detectable in an image.&lt;ref name="pmid12663828"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith JJ, Sorensen AG, Thrall JH | title = Biomarkers in imaging: realizing radiology's future | journal = Radiology | volume = 227 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–8 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12663828 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2273020518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, an imaging biomarker is a feature of an image relevant to a patient's diagnosis. For example, a number of biomarkers are frequently used to determine risk of lung cancer. First, a simple lesion in the lung detected by [[X-ray]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], or [[MRI]] can lead to the suspicion of a neoplasm. The lesion itself serves as a biomarker, but the minute details of the lesion serve as biomarkers as well, and can collectively be used to assess the risk of neoplasm. Some of the imaging biomarkers used in lung nodule assessment include size, [[spiculation]], calcification, cavitation, location within the lung, rate of growth, and rate of metabolism. Each piece of information from the image represents a [[probability]]. Spiculation increases the probability of the lesion being cancer. A slow rate of growth indicates benignity. These variables can be added to the patient's history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and pathology to reach a proposed diagnosis. Imaging biomarkers can be measured using several techniques, such as CT, [[electroencephalography]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and MRI.
== History ==

Imaging biomarkers are as old as the [[X-ray]] itself. A feature of a radiograph that represent some kind of pathology was first coined "Roentgen signs" after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], the discoverer of the X-ray.&lt;ref&gt;Meschan, Farrer-Meschan, Roentgen Signs in Clinical Diagnosis, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of medical imaging developed and expanded to include numerous imaging modalities, imaging biomarkers have grown as well, in both quantity and complexity as finally in [[chemical imaging]].

== Quantitative imaging biomarkers ==

A '''quantitative imaging biomarkers''' (QIB) is ''an objective characteristic derived from an in vivo image measured on a ratio or interval scale as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or a response to a therapeutic intervention''.&lt;ref name="pmid24919826"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler LG, Barnhart HX, Buckler AJ, Choudhury KR, Kondratovich MV, Toledano A, Guimaraes AR, Filice R, Zhang Z, Sullivan DC | title = The emerging science of quantitative imaging biomarkers terminology and definitions for scientific studies and regulatory submissions | journal = Stat Methods Med Res | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–26 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 24919826 | doi = 10.1177/0962280214537333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; advantage of QIB's over qualitative imaging biomarkers is that they are better suited to be used for follow-up of patients or in clinical trials. Examples of a frequently used QIB are the [[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors|RECIST]] criteria, measuring the evolution in tumor size to assess treatment response for patients with cancer, the [[Nuchal scan]] used for prenatal screening, or the assessment of lesion load and brain atrophy for patients with [[multiple sclerosis]].

== Use in clinical trials ==

[[Clinical trials]] are known to be one of the most valuable sources of data in evidence-based medicine. For a pharmaceutical, device, or procedure to be approved for regular use in the U.S., it must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, and demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Unfortunately clinical trials are also extremely expensive and time consuming. End-points, such as morbidity and mortality, are used as measures to compare groups within a clinical trial. The most basic endpoint used in clinical trials, mortality, requires years and sometimes decades of follow-up to sufficiently assess. Morbidity, although potentially faster to measure than mortality, can also be a very difficult endpoint to measure clinically, as it is often very subjective. These are some of the reasons why biomarkers have been increasingly used in clinical trials to detect subtle changes in physiology and pathology before they can are detected clinically. The biomarkers act as [[surrogate endpoints]]. The use of [[surrogate endpoints]] has been shown to significantly decrease the time and resources used in clinical trials. Because surrogate end-points allow researchers to assess a marker rather than the patient, it allows participants to act as their own control, and in many cases allows for easier blinding.

In addition to [[surrogate endpoints]], imaging biomarkers can be used as ''predictive classifiers'', to assist in selecting appropriate candidates for particular treatment. Predictive classifiers are frequently used in [[molecular imaging]] in order to ensure enzymatic response to treatment.

== FDA approval of surrogate end-points ==

The [[United States Congress]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] have acknowledged the value of imaging biomarkers as evidenced by recent actions that encourage their use. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was instituted to improve the regulatory process for medical products. Section 112 of the Act gives explicit authority to give expedited approval for drugs that treat serious conditions as long as it has shown to have an effect on a surrogate end-point that reasonably indicates a clinical benefit. Other provisions enables monitoring of the products following market approval to ensure the efficacy of the surrogate end-points and requires the FDA to establish a program that promotes the development and use of surrogate end-points for serious diseases. Although the act does not specifically mention the use of surrogate end-points for medical devices, section 205 requires that the "least burdensome means necessary" be used in their approval.&lt;ref name="pmid11824468"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith JJ, Shyjan AM | title = Defining "least burdensome means" under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 | journal = Food Drug Law J | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 435–47 | date = 2000 | pmid = 11824468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wording is much more general than the provision for pharmaceuticals, but is generally accepted that [[surrogate endpoints]] will often qualify as being the "least burdensome means".

== Qualification and validation ==

Developing an understanding of clinical significance for specific biomarkers can be a difficult process. There are two steps of certification for a [[surrogate endpoint]] to be fully established: Qualification and Validation. For a biomarker to become qualified it must go through a somewhat formal qualification process. A request must be submitted to IPRG to qualify an imaging biomarker for a specific use.  The Biomarker Qualification Review Team, recruited from nonclinical and clinical review divisions, assesses the context and available data regarding the biomarker. They also evaluate the qualification study strategy methods and results and ultimately make a decision to accept or reject. After qualification, a biomarker may have limited use as a [[surrogate endpoint]]. They may be used in phase I and II [[clinical trials]], but can only be used in [[phase III trials]] for early futility analyses.

There are two steps to validation, probable validation and known validation. "Probable validation" requires widespread agreement in the medical or scientific community as to its efficacy. "Known validation" requires a scientific framework or body of evidence that appears to elucidate the marker’s efficacy.&lt;ref name="pmid17408233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodsaid F, Frueh F | title = Biomarker qualification pilot process at the US Food and Drug Administration | journal = AAPS J | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = E105–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17408233 | pmc = 2751298 | doi = 10.1208/aapsj0901010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For full validation, a biomarker must demonstrate that the treatment versus control differences are similar to the treatment versus control differences for clinical outcome. It is not sufficient to simply demonstrate that the biomarker responders survive longer than the biomarker non-responders.

== Quality ==

The following are 3 measures of quality to determine the strength of biomarker for use in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schatzkin A, Gail M | year = 2002 | title = The promise and peril of surrogate endpoints in cancer research | url = | journal = Nat Rev Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 19–27 | doi=10.1038/nrc702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The presence of the imaging biomarker is closely coupled or linked to the presence of the target disease or condition.
#The detection and/or quantitative measurement of the imaging biomarker is accurate, reproducible, and feasible over time.
#The measured changes over time in the imaging biomarker are closely coupled or linked to the success or failure of the therapeutic effect and the true end-point sought for the medical therapy being evaluated.

== Organizations ==

Because the project of compiling a library of validated biomarkers requires an enormous amount of resources, the FDA has encouraged the creation of consortia between public and private organization in order to facilitate the sharing of data for the qualification and validation of biomarkers.

The Biomarkers Consortium was created by the [[Foundation for the National Institutes of Health]], [[National Institute of Health]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], and [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]]. It is a public-private biomedical research partnership aimed to provide grants for the generation of data for clinical biomarker qualification.

The Predictive Safety Testing Consortium, was created by the [[Critical Path Institute]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to develop a framework needed for data sharing between its members in order to make biomarker qualification easier. They are also working with regulatory agencies to replace the currently unstructured qualification process.

In 2001, the Radiology department at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], founded the MGH Center for Biomarkers in Imaging, a center dedicated to encourage the development and use of imaging biomarkers. Their initial project was to catalogue the known biomarkers in order to make them readily available to scientists, regulators, and industry representatives (now available on their website). The catalogue includes the pathology specific to the biomarkers, the investigator(s) involved in creating and using the biomarker, and the modalities used in the detection of the biomarker.

International Cancer Biomarker Consortium was created to assist in discovery of biomarkers by facilitating coordinated research and by leveraging resources. Each international team chooses a cancer site(s) for study, functions independently, and secures its own funding. The president of the organization, [[Leland Hartwell]], is a [[nobel prize]] winner for physiology/medicine in 2001.

Uniform Protocols for Imaging in Clinical Trials (UPICT) was created by the [[American College of Radiology]].

Imaging Response Assessment Teams was created by the [[National Cancer Institute]] and AACI to advance the role of imaging in assessment of response to therapy and to increase the application of quantitative, anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging endpoints in clinical therapeutic trials. Aims to strengthen clinical collaboration between imaging scientists and oncologic investigators.

Oncology Biomarker Qualification Initiative was created by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]] to qualify new cancer biomarkers. Their first project involves PET imaging in [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].

'''Juana Maria''' (died October 19, 1853), better known to history as the '''Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island''' (her Native American name is unknown), was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman who was the last surviving member of her tribe, the [[Nicoleño]]. She lived alone on [[San Nicolas Island]] off the coast of [[California]] from 1835 until her rescue in 1853. [[Scott O'Dell]]'s award-winning children's novel ''[[Island of the Blue Dolphins]]'' (1960) was inspired by her story. She was the last native speaker of the [[Nicoleño#Language|Nicoleño language]].

=== Background ===
The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] have long been inhabited by humans, with Native American colonization occurring 10,000 years ago or earlier.&lt;ref name="Erlandson2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erlandson |first1=J.

In the early 1540s Portuguese conquistador [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] explored the California coast, [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|claiming it on behalf of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Braje2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braje |first1=T.

=== Arrival of the fur trappers ===
In 1814, a party of Native Alaskan otter hunters working for the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC), massacred most of the islanders after accusing them of killing a Native Alaskan hunter.&lt;ref name="Morris2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=S.

Although there was speculation that the Franciscan padres of the California missions requested that the remaining Nicoleños be removed from the island, there is no documentary evidence to back that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=S. L.|last2=Johnson|first2=J. R.|last3=Schwartz|first3=S. J.|last4=Vellanoweth|first4=R. L.|last5=Farris|first5=G. J.|last6=Schwebel|first6=S. L.|title=The Nicoleños in Los Angeles: Documenting the Fate of the Lone Woman's Community|journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology|date=2016|volume=36|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missions were undergoing secularization in the 1830s and there was no Franciscan priest at Mission San Gabriel from mid-1835 through spring of 1836 to receive any Nicoleños brought to the mainland. In late November 1835, the [[schooner]] ''Peor es Nada'', commanded by Charles Hubbard, left southern California to remove the remaining people living on San Nicolas. Upon arriving at the island, Hubbard's party, which included Isaac Sparks, gathered the Indians on the beach and brought them aboard. Juana Maria, however, was not among them by the time a strong storm arose, and the ''Peor es Nada'''s crew, realizing the imminent danger of being wrecked by the surf and rocks, panicked and sailed toward the mainland, leaving her behind. A more romantic version tells of Juana Maria diving overboard after realizing her younger brother had been left behind, although archaeologist Steven J. Schwartz notes, "The story of her jumping overboard does not show up until the 1880s ... By then the [[Victorian era]] is well underway, and literature takes on a flowery, even romantic flavor."&lt;ref name="Robinson2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marooned: 18 years of solitude |author=Robinson, Joe |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-os-island15jun15,1,1983496,full.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 15, 2004 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is recorded by Juana Maria's eventual rescuer, [[George Nidever]], who heard it from a hunter who had been on the ''Peor es Nada''; however, Nidever makes it clear he may be misremembering what he heard.&lt;ref name="Nidever"&gt;Nidever, G.; Ellison, W.

=== Discovery ===
According to Emma Hardacre, there are differing accounts as to the discovery of the Lone Woman.  The first being that Father [[José González Rubio]] of the Santa Barbara Mission offered a man named Carl Dittman $100 to find her.  The second and what appears to be the original account from [[George Nidever]] states Father [[José González Rubio]] paid one Thomas Jeffries $200 to find Juana Maria, though he was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, the tales Jeffries told upon returning managed to capture the imagination of [[George Nidever]], a Santa Barbara fur trapper, who launched several expeditions of his own. His first two attempts failed to find her, but on his third attempt in the autumn of 1853, one of Nidever's men, Carl Dittman, discovered human footprints on the beach and pieces of seal blubber which had been left out to dry.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2005"&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=Garcelon |editor1-last=D.

It was believed that she also lived in a nearby cave.

Afterwards, Juana Maria was taken to the Santa Barbara Mission, but was only able to communicate with the three or four remaining members of her tribe. The local [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] Indians could not understand her, so the mission sent for a group of [[Tongva people|Tongva]] who had formerly lived on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]], but they were unsuccessful as well. Four words and two songs recorded from Juana Maria suggest she spoke one of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages]] native to Southern California, but it is not clear to which branch it is related. A [[University of California, Los Angeles]] study by linguist [[Pamela Munro]] focusing on the words and songs suggests that her language was most similar to those of the [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]s of Northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] and of the [[Juaneño]]s near [[San Juan Capistrano]].&lt;ref name="Munro1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munro |first1=P. |editor1-first=W.

This evidence, when taken as a whole, suggests that Juana Maria was a native Nicoleño.

=== Life at Santa Barbara Mission ===
[[File:Juana Maria plaque.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A plaque commemorating Juana Maria at [[Santa Barbara Mission]] cemetery, placed there by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] in 1928.]]
Juana Maria was reportedly fascinated and ecstatic upon arrival, marveling at the sight of horses, along with European clothing and food. She was allowed to stay with Nidever, who described her as a woman of "medium height, but rather thick ... She must have been about 50 years old, but she was still strong and active. Her face was pleasing as she was continually smiling. Her teeth were entire but worn to the gums."&lt;ref name="Nidever"/&gt;

Juana Maria apparently enjoyed visits by curious Santa Barbara residents, singing and dancing for her audiences. One of the songs Juana Maria sang is popularly called the "Toki Toki" song. Knowledge of this song came from a [[Ventureño language|Ventureño]] man named Malquiares, an otter hunter who had joined Nidever's expedition to the island and who had heard Juana Maria sing it.&lt;ref name="Hudson1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hudson |first1=T. |year=1981 |title=Recently discovered accounts concerning the "Lone Woman" of San Nicolas Island |journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology |publisher=University of California, Merced |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=187–199 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/42p65979 |issn=0191-3557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malquiares later recited the words to his friend Fernando Kitsepawit Librado (1839–1915). The song's words are as follows:

{{poemquote|
Toki Toki yahamimena (×3)

Toki Toki ... (continue as above)
}}

Librado recited the words to a [[Cruzeño language|Cruzeño]] Indian named Aravio Talawiyashwit, who translated them as "I live contented because I can see the day when I want to get out of this island;" however, given the lack of any other information on Juana Maria's language, this translation's accuracy is dubious, or perhaps was an intuitive guess.&lt;ref name="Hudson1981"/&gt; Anthropologist and linguist [[John Peabody Harrington]] recorded Librado singing the song on a wax cylinder in 1913.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HUDSON|first=TRAVIS|date=1981|title=Recently Discovered Accounts Concerning The "Lone Woman" of San Nicolas Island|jstor=27825079|journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology|volume=3|issue=2|pages=187–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following text was published by an anonymous writer in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]'s ''Daily Democratic State Journal'' on October 13, 1853:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild woman who was found on the island of San Nicolas about 70 miles from the coast, west of Santa Barbara, is now at the latter place and is looked upon as a curiosity. It is stated she has been some 18 to 20 years alone on the island. She existed on shell fish and the fat of the seal, and dressed in the skins and feathers of wild ducks, which she sewed together with sinews of the seal. She cannot speak any known language, is good-looking and about middle age. She seems to be contented in her new home among the good people of Santa Barbara.&lt;ref name="Heizer1961"&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Heizer |editor1-first=R. F. |editor1-link=Robert Heizer |editor2-last=Elsasser |editor2-first=A.

=== Death ===
Just seven weeks after arriving on the mainland, Juana Maria died of dysentery in [[Garey, California]]. Nidever claimed her fondness for green corn, vegetables and fresh fruit after years of little such nutrient-laden food caused the severe and ultimately fatal illness.&lt;ref name="Nidever"/&gt; Before she died, Father Sanchez baptized and christened her with the Spanish name Juana Maria.&lt;ref name="Hardacre1880"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardacre |first1=E. C. |year=1880 |title=Eighteen years alone: A tale of the Pacific |journal=Scribner's Monthly: an Illustrated Magazine for the People |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=657–663 |publisher=Scribner |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1880sep-00657?View=PDF |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in an unmarked grave on the Nidever family plot at the Santa Barbara Mission cemetery. Father González Rubio made the following entry in the Mission's Book of Burials: "On October 19, 1853 I gave ecclesiastical burial in the cemetery to the remains of Juana Maria, the Indian woman brought from San Nicolas Island and, since there was no one who could understand her language, she was baptized conditionally by Fr. Sanchez."&lt;ref name="Heizer1961"/&gt; In 1928, a plaque commemorating her was placed at the site by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].

Juana Maria's water basket, clothing and various artifacts, including bone needles which had been brought back from the island, were part of the collections of the [[California Academy of Sciences]], but were destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire. Her cormorant feather dress was apparently sent to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], but it appears to have been lost.

== Archaeological finds ==
In 1939, archaeologists discovered Juana Maria's whale-bone hut on the northernmost end of San Nicolas, the highest point of the island. The location of the hut exactly matched the descriptions left by Nidever.&lt;ref name="Hudson1981"/&gt; In 2012, archaeologist Steven J. Schwartz reported finding a site that may have been Juana Maria's cave.&lt;ref name="Chawkins2012"&gt;{{cite news |title='Island of the Blue Dolphins' woman's cave believed found |author=Chawkins, Steve |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/29/local/la-me-lone-woman-cave-20121027 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 29, 2012 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, University of Oregon archaeologist [[Jon M. Erlandson|Jon Erlandson]] found two Nicoleño-style redwood boxes eroding from a sea cliff, covered by a whale rib and associated with several asphaltum-coated woven water bottles, and threatened with destruction from winter storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erlandson|first1=Jon M.|last2=Thomas-Barnett|first2=Lisa|last3=Vellanoweth|first3=René L.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Steven J.|last5=Muhs|first5=Daniel R.|title=From the                            : A Unique Nineteenth-Century Cache Feature From San Nicolas Island, California|journal=The Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology|date=January 2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1080/15564894.2013.766913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located on the northwest coast of San Nicolas, where Juana Maria is believed to have spent much of her time. The boxes, salvaged by Erlandson, René Vellanoweth, Lisa Thomas-Barnett, and Troy Davis, contained more than 200 artifacts, including bird-bone pendants, [[abalone]] shell dishes and fish hooks, [[soapstone]] ornaments, sandstone abraders, [[red ochre]], a Nicoleño harpoon tip,  glass projectile points and metal artifacts, and several Native Alaskan toggling harpoon tips. In 2012, Navy archaeologist Steven Schwartz, working with Vellanoweth and his students from California State University, Los Angeles, found and uncovered the buried remnants of the long-lost Indian Cave, where Juana Maria may also have lived. Archaeological research at the cave has been halted, however, at the request of the [[Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians|Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians]], which claims cultural affiliation with the island's ancient residents.&lt;ref name="SAHAGUN2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-cave-artifacts-20150305-story.html|title=With island dig halted, Lone Woman still a stinging mystery|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 5, 2015|first=Louis|last=Sahagun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[Scott O'Dell]]'s ''[[Island of the Blue Dolphins]]'' was largely based on Juana Maria's story. The novel's protagonist, Karana, endures many of the trials that Juana Maria must have faced while alone on San Nicolas. In the 1964 film version of the novel, American actress [[Celia Kaye]] played Karana.

(Alonzo Rodriguez, 16th century, Museo Regionale di [[Messina]]).]]
The '''kiss of peace''' is an ancient traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] [[greeting]], sometimes also called the "holy kiss", "brother kiss" (among men), or "sister kiss" (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that [[peace]] be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain [[ritualized]] or formalized uses long established in [[liturgy]]. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal [[kiss]]es) to serve equivalent purposes; they include [[handshake]]s, [[gesture]]s, and [[hug]]s, any of which may be called a '''sign of peace'''. 

==Sources==
It was the widespread custom in the ancient western [[Mediterranean]] for men to greet each other with a [[kiss]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; That was also the custom in ancient [[Judea]] and practiced also by Christians.

However, the [[New Testament]]'s references to a [[Sacred|holy]] kiss ({{lang-gr|εν αγιω φιληματι}}, ''en philemati hagio'') and kiss of [[love]] (''en philemati [[agapē]]s'') transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:

* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|16:16|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|16:20|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|13:12|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν ἁγίῳ φιλήματι}}).
* [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|I Thessalonians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Thessalonians|5:26|NIV}} — "Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς πάντας ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ}}).
* [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Peter|5:14|NIV}} — "Greet one another with a kiss of love" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσπάσασθε ἀλλήλους ἐν φιλήματι ἀγάπης}}).

It has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the [[Eucharist]] the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call "a sign of peace", which was already part of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]], occurring after the [[Lord's Prayer]] in the [[Roman Rite]] and the rites directly derived from it. [[St. Augustine]], for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: {{Quotation|Then, after the consecration of the Holy Sacrifice of God, because He wished us also to be His sacrifice, a fact which was made clear when the Holy Sacrifice was first instituted, and because that Sacrifice is a sign of what we are,  behold,  when the Sacrifice is finished, we say the Lord's Prayer which  you have received and recited. After this, the 'Peace be with you’ is said, and the Christians embrace one another with the holy kiss. This is a sign of peace; as the lips indicate, let  peace be made in your conscience, that is, when your lips  draw near to those of your brother, do not let your heart  withdraw from his. Hence, these are great and powerful sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;SERMON 227, ''The Fathers of the Church'',(1959), Roy Joseph Deferrari, Genera editor, ''Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons'', vol. 38, p. 197. [https://archive.org/details/fathersofthechur009512mbp] See also: Sermon 227 in ''The Works of Saint Augustine: A New Translation for the 21st Century'', (1993), Vol. 6, part, 3, p. 255. {{ISBN|1-56548-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the "kiss of peace" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his ''Paschale carmen'' (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, "And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?"&lt;ref&gt;For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, "Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal," in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. F. Mormando (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum of Boston College, 1999), pp.179-190.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''kiss of peace''' was known in Greek from an early date as ''eirḗnē'' ({{lang|grc|εἰρήνη}}) ("peace", which became ''pax'' in Latin and peace in English).&lt;ref name=CathEncl&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] - [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm Kiss]&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting [[shalom]]; and the greeting "Peace be with you" is similarly a translation of the Hebrew [[shalom aleichem]]. In the [[Gospels]], both greetings were used by [[Jesus]] - e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|24:36|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||John|20:21|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|20:26|NIV}}. The Latin term translated as "sign of peace" is simply ''pax'' ("peace"), not ''signum pacis'' ("sign of peace") nor ''osculum pacis'' ("kiss of peace"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, "Let us offer each other the sign of peace", is in Latin: ''Offerte vobis pacem'' ("Offer each other peace" or "Offer each other the peace").

From an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men.&lt;ref name=CathEncl /&gt;

==In the Church==
The practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,&lt;ref&gt;Book of Common Prayer, 1979; &lt;/ref&gt;[[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]]; some liturgical mainline [[Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]]; and [[Spiritual Christian]], where it is often called the '''kiss of peace''', '''sign of peace''', '''Holy kiss''' or simply '''peace''' or '''pax''';  It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and [[Apostolic Christian]].

==Contemporary practices==

=== Catholic Church ===
In the [[Catholic Church]], the term now used is not "the kiss of peace", but "the sign of peace" or "the rite of peace". The ''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' states: "There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament."&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 82&lt;/ref&gt; The priest says or sings: "The peace of the Lord be with you always", to which the people respond: "And with your spirit." Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, "if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'"&lt;ref name=RM&gt;Roman Missal, Order of Mass, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Rite]], it is placed after the [[Pater Noster]] and before the [[Fractio panis (liturgy)|Fractio Panis]]. Even within the Catholic Church, there are [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]] (the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:23–24}} about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of [[Justin Martyr]] in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where [[Saint Augustine]] understood it as related to the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6e6LZrH1WXgC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Irwin+%22sign+of+peace%22+Augustine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kklVPP9LsiV7AbZwIGIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Irwin%20%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20Augustine&amp;f=false Kevin W. Irwin, ''Responses to 101 Questions on the Mass'' (Paulist Press 1999)] {{ISBN|978-0-80913888-3}}, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tridentine Mass]] form of the Roman Rite, the sign of peace is given at [[Solemn Mass]]es alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting. If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words "Pax tecum" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the [[deacon]], who in turn gives it to the [[subdeacon]], who gives the sign to any other clergy present in [[choir dress]].

In the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that "the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister".&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The manner prescribed is as follows: "It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful."&lt;ref name=VD&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html Redemptionis Sacramentum], 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are considered abuses by the [[Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship|Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments]]:&lt;ref name=XD&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/text-of-vatican-document-on-sign-of-peace-at-mass/ Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments. ''The Ritual Expression of the Gift of Peace at Mass''], 6c&lt;/ref&gt;
*introducing a "song of peace" to accompany the rite;
*the faithful moving from their places to exchange the sign of peace;
*the priest leaving the altar to give the sign of peace to some of the faithful;
*expressing other sentiments, e.g. expressing congratulations, best wishes or condolences among those present at a [[wedding]], [[funeral]] or other ceremony.

The gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local [[episcopal conference]]. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as [[India]] and [[Thailand]], a bow is prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S31TA-yPDGwC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22sign+of+peace%22+handshake+bow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SWglVKyKDoHN7QbhxoHABA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20handshake%20bow&amp;f=false Peter J. Elliott, ''Liturgical Question Box'' (Ignatius Press 1998)] {{ISBN|978-0-89870677-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than "familiar and profane gestures of greeting".&lt;ref name=VD/&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, "Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--" and the people conclude the sentence, "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided." At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries "The doors! The doors!"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: "Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity."

In the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions.  Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests.  Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.

Another example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people "Peace be with all", and their reply: "And with your Spirit". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.

=== Anglicanism ===
In the Anglican church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to "offer one another a sign of peace". However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead.

=== Protestantism ===
Different [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] churches have readopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a ''holy kiss'') or literally (in that members kiss one another). This practice is particularly important among many [[Anabaptist]] sects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Kundanlal Dholakia''' (10 August 1920&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=India Who's who|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW9mAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=INFA Publications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;-8 March 2011&lt;ref name=x/&gt;) was a politician from [[Gujarat]]. He was born in [[Calcutta]] to Jashwantray and Jiviben.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; He started his career as lawyer and was president of Kutch District Bar Association for year 1965-66.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; He married Harsuta.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;  He was member of eartwhile Bombay Assembly from 1957 to 1960 and Gujarat Assembly from 1960-62 as a member of pre-Indira Congress party from [[Bhuj]]. In 1962 elections as candidate of Congress from Bhuj, he lost to independent candidate Gulabshankar Amritlal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.in/gujarat/assembly-constituencies/bhuj.html Bhuj -Elected Candidates]&lt;/ref&gt; After split of Congress in 1969 he became associated with [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)]] and was elected as a member of Gujarat Legislative Assembly for 1975-80 again from Bhuj. He was the speaker of Gujarat Assembly from June 1975 to March 1977 and then from April 1977 to June 1980. He worked actively during the earthquake and drought in Kutch during 1956. In 2009, he was awarded Gujarat Pratibha Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Ex-speaker-Kundanlal-Dholakia-passes-away/articleshow/7660150.cms Ex-speaker Kundanlal Dholakia passes away - The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-ex-speaker-gets-gujarati-pratibha-award-1236046 Ex-speaker gets Gujarati Pratibha Award | Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
His other major contribution was as a historian, he penned down history of [[Kutch]] in books - ‘Shruti ane Smruti: Kutch’ and  ‘Kutch na antarango’ both wonderful book on Kutch’s recent history. His major contribution to contemporary history of [[Gujarat]] was his book ‘Samayne sathvare Gujarat.’ This is most probably the only book that narrates Gujarat’s political history between 1952-2009 in continuing chapters. Dholakia’s this book was first published in 1991. Though, Dholakia was from Congress party, but he didn’t rescue himself from writing something against Congress Chief Ministers of Gujarat while penning down contemporary history. After every few years he would add another chapters on recent political affairs. Thus the subsequent editions with added chapters were published in 1994, 2005 and finally in 2010.&lt;ref name=x&gt;{{cite news|title=Gujarat loses its most active contemporary historian|url=http://deshgujarat.com/2011/03/08/gujarat-loses-its-most-active-contemporary-historian/|accessdate=30 June 2016|agency=Desh Gujarat}}&lt;/ref&gt; One has to take note that as a historian, he was active right till his death at age of 90 in 2011 and his last writings were published just a year ago in 2010.&lt;ref name=x/&gt;

== Bulgarian ==
{{main|Bulgarian language}}
Bulgarian is the country's only official language. It's spoken by the vast majority of the Bulgarian population and used at all levels of society. It is a European language, a member of the Slavic linguistic group. Its closest relative is the [[Macedonian language]] and the difference between the two are on dialectal level.

Bulgarian is written with [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], which also has been exported to other languages, notably [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].

== Minority languages ==
'''Turkish'''
{{main|Turks in Bulgaria}}
The [[Turks in Bulgaria|Turks]] constitute the largest minority group in the country. The Turks in Bulgaria are descendants of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] settlers who came from [[Anatolia]] across the narrows of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus]] following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, as well as Bulgarian converts to Islam who became Turkified during the centuries of Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Jonathan. ''The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-communist Europe'', p. 238. M.E. Sharpe, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7656-0528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Crampton. "A concise history of Bulgaria", p. 36. Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roma'''
{{main|Romani people in Bulgaria}}
The [[Romani people in Bulgaria|Romani]] constitute the second largest minority group in the country. The Romani in Bulgaria are descendants of [[Romani people|Romani]] nomadic migrants who came from [[India]] across the narrows of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus]], in the late 13th century&lt;ref name="tomova"&gt;Tomova, ''Ethnic Dimensions of poverty in Bulgaria'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and also during the five centuries of Ottoman occupation.&lt;ref name="tomova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marushiakova et al., ''Gypsies in the Ottoman Empire: a contribution to the history of the Balkans'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;


Other minority languages spoken are [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]].

== Foreign languages ==
According to a Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=SPECIAL EUROBAROMETER 386 Europeans and their Languages |publisher=ec.europa.eu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English language|English]] was the most commonly known foreign language in Bulgaria (25% claimed workable knowledge of it), followed by [[Russian language|Russian]] (23%), and German (8%).

In the 2012 Eurobarometer survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the situation was different, with 25% of people saying they know [[English language|English]] well enough in order to be able to have a conversation, and only 23% answering [[Russian language|Russian]] (a decrease of 12 points). This is because many of the people who learned [[Russian language|Russian]] at school are from an older generation and some are now deceased or as time has elapsed, have forgotten how to speak the language. When asked which two languages, other than their mother tongue, would be the most useful for children to learn in their future, an overwhelming majority of respondents said [[English language|English]] (90%), with [[German language|German]] coming second (36%), and [[Russian language|Russian]] third (14%).&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title=Special Eurobarometer 386 - Europeans and their Languages |publisher=EC |date=June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Italy}}
{{Italian language|state=expanded}}
There are approximately thirty-four native living spoken languages and related dialects in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/IT|title=Italy|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are indigenous evolutions of [[Vulgar Latin]], and are therefore classified as [[Romance languages]]. Although they are sometimes referred to as [[regional languages]], there is no uniformity within any Italian region, and speakers from one locale within a region are typically aware of the features distinguishing their local tongue from the one of other places nearby. The official and most widely spoken language across the country is [[Italian language|Standard Italian]], a direct descendant of [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]].

Almost all the Romance languages native to Italy, with the notable exception of [[Italian language|Italian]], are often colloquially referred to as "dialects", although for some of them the term may coexist with other labels like "minority languages" or "vernaculars".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Loporcaro|2009}}; {{harvcolnb|Marcato|2007}}; {{harvcolnb|Posner|1996}}; {{harvcolnb|Repetti|2000|pp=1–2}}; {{harvcolnb|Cravens|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the term "[[dialect]]" to refer to the '''languages of Italy''' may erroneously imply that the languages spoken in Italy are actual "dialects" of Standard Italian in the prevailing linguistic sense of "[[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] or variations of a [[language]]".&lt;ref name="Cravens 2014"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Cravens|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the case regarding the longstanding languages of Italy, as they are not varieties of Italian. Most of the local Romance languages of Italy predate Italian and evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]], independently of what would become the national language, long before the fairly recent spread of Italian throughout Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Tullio, de Mauro (2014). ''Storia linguistica dell'Italia repubblicana: dal 1946 ai nostri giorni''. Editori Laterza, EAN: 9788858113622&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Standard Italian is itself either a continuation of, or a dialect heavily based on, [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]. The indigenous local Romance tongues of Italy are therefore classified as separate languages that evolved independently from Latin, rather than "dialects" or variations of the Italian language.&lt;ref name=maiden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|date=March 7, 2006|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=dialects%20of%20italy|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |last= Andreose | first = Alvise |last2=Renzi |first2=Lorenzo | contribution = Geography and distribution of the Romance Languages in Europe| editor-last = Maiden | editor-first = Martin |editor2-last= Smith | editor2-first = John Charles |editor3-last= Ledgeway | editor3-first = Adam |title=The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages | volume = Vol. 2, Contexts| pages =302-308 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge | year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, with the spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, local varieties of Italian have also developed throughout the peninsula, influenced to varying extents by the underlying local languages, most noticeably at the phonological level; though regional boundaries seldom correspond to isoglosses distinguishing these varieties, these variations on Italians are commonly referred to as [[Regional Italian]] (''italiano regionale'').

There are several minority languages that belong to other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] branches, such as [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]), [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]] ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), the [[Slavomolisano dialect]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Slavic languages|Slavic]]), and [[Griko dialect|Griko]] ([[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]]). Other non-indigenous languages are spoken by a substantial percentage of the population due to [[immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm |title=Legge 482 |publisher=Camera.it |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|I do not see how a government law can possibly verify the above statements, will remove soon|date=October 2015}}

Italy is a signatory of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], but has not ratified the treaty, and therefore its provisions protecting [[regional language]]s do not apply in the country.&lt;ref name="coe1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/148/signatures |title=Chart of signatures and ratifications of Treaty 148 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=17 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017135911/http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/148/signatures|archive-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter does not, however, establish at what point differences in expression result in a separate language, deeming it an "often controversial issue", and citing the necessity to take into account, other than purely linguistic criteria, also "psychological, sociological and political considerations".&lt;ref name="coe2"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dc/files/themes/langues_minoritaire/Definition_en.asp |title=What is a regional or minority language? |year= |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by the Italian state===
The following [[minority language]]s are officially recognized as "historical language minorities" by the Law no. 482/1999: [[Arberesh language|Albanian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[French language|French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Occitan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (Legge 15 Dicembre 1999, n. 482, Art. 2, comma 1).&lt;ref name="parl"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm |title=Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche storiche |year= |publisher=Italian parliament |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of those languages to the exclusion of numerous others is a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref name="Cravens 2014"/&gt; Some interpretations of said law also state that the phrasing would seem to imply a further distinction, considering only some groups (namely Albanians, Catalans, [[Germanic peoples]] indigenous to Italy, Greeks, Slovenes and Croats) to be national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/lezioni/f_lv2.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516005113/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/lezioni/f_lv2.htm|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parl"/&gt; Nonetheless, the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], signed and ratified by Italy in 1997, applies to all the groups mentioned by the 1999 national law, with the addition of the [[Romani people|Romani]].

The original Italian Constitution does not explicitly express that Italian is the official national language. Since the constitution was penned there have been some laws and articles written on the procedures of criminal cases passed that explicitly state that Italian should be used:

*'''Statute of the Trentino-South Tyrol''', (constitutional law of the northern region of Italy around Trento)&amp;nbsp;– "[...] {{lang|it|[la lingua] italiana [...] è la lingua ufficiale dello Stato.}}" (Statuto Speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Art. 99, "[...] [the language] Italian [...] is the official language of the State.")
*'''Code for civil procedure'''&amp;nbsp;– "{{lang|it|In tutto il processo è prescritto l'uso della lingua italiana.}} (Codice di procedura civile, Art. 122, "In all procedures, it is required that the Italian language is used.")
*'''Code for criminal procedure'''&amp;nbsp;– "{{lang|it|Gli atti del procedimento penale sono compiuti in lingua italiana.}}" (Codice di procedura penale, Art. 109 [169-3; 63, 201 att.], "The acts of the criminal proceedings are carried out in the Italian language.")
*'''Article 1 of law 482/1999'''&amp;nbsp;– "La lingua ufficiale della Repubblica è l'italiano." (Legge 482/1999, Art. 1 Comma 1, "The official language of the Republic is Italian.")

==Conservation status==
[[File:Frequency_of_Dialect_Use_in_Italy_(2015).svg|thumb|300px|Frequency of use of regional languages in Italy, based on ISTAT data from 2015.]]
According to the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]], there are 31 endangered languages in Italy.&lt;ref name="unescoatlas"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php |title=Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |year= |publisher=UNESCO's Endangered Languages Programme |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of endangerment is classified in different categories ranging from 'safe' (safe languages are not included in the atlas) to 'extinct' (when there are no speakers left).&lt;ref name="unescoatlas2"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00139 |title=Degrees of endangerment |year= |publisher=UNESCO's Endangered Languages Programme |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
All living languages indigenous to Italy are part of the [[Indo-European language]] family. The source is the [[SIL International|SIL]]'s [[Ethnologue]] unless otherwise stated.&lt;ref name="ethnologue-ita"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_country.asp?name=IT |title=Languages of Italy |year= |publisher=SIL |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language classification can be a controversial issue, when a classification is contested by academic sources, this is reported in the 'notes' column.

They can be divided into Romance languages and non-Romance languages.

====Sardinian language====
[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] is a distinct language group with significant phonological and lexical differences among its varieties. ''Ethnologue'', not without controversy, even goes as far as considering Sardinian to be four separate languages, all being included along with Corsican and the Corso-Sardinian varieties in a hypothetical subgroup ([[Southern Romance languages|Southern Romance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/southern-11|title=Ethnologue report for Southern Romance|publisher=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which has gained little support from linguists. UNESCO, while seeming to share the same opinion of Ethnologue by calling Gallurese and Sassarese alternately "Sardinian",&lt;ref name="unescoatlas"/&gt; considers them to be dialects of Corsican rather than Sardinian on the other hand.&lt;ref name="unescoatlas"/&gt; As is not infrequently the case in such controversies, the linguistic landscape of Sardinia is in principle most accurately described as being, for the most part, a [[dialect continuum]].

==Geographic distribution==

===Northern Italy===
The Northern Italian languages are conventionally defined as those Romance languages spoken north of the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]], which runs through the northern [[Apennine Mountains]] just to the north of [[Tuscany]]; however, the dialects of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Franco-Provençal]] spoken in the extreme northwest of Italy (e.g. the [[Valdôtain]] in the [[Aosta Valley]]) are generally excluded. The classification of these languages is difficult and not agreed-upon, due both to the variations among the languages and to the fact that they share [[isogloss]]es of various sorts with both the [[Italo-Romance languages]] to the south and the [[Gallo-Romance languages]] to the northwest.

{{Northern Italy regional languages labelled map|float=none}}

One common classification divides these languages into four groups:
*The Italian [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], including [[Ladin language|Ladin]] and [[Friulan]]
*The poorly researched [[Istriot language]]
*The [[Venetian language]] (sometimes grouped with the majority Gallo-Italian languages)
*The [[Gallo-Italian languages]], including all the rest (although with some doubt regarding the position of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]])

Any such classification runs into the basic problem that there is a [[dialect continuum]] throughout northern Italy, with a continuous transition of spoken dialects between e.g. Venetian and Ladin, or Venetian and [[Emilio-Romagnolo]] (usually considered Gallo-Italian).

All of these languages are considered innovative relative to the Romance languages as a whole, with some of the Gallo-Italian languages having phonological changes nearly as extreme as standard French (usually considered the most phonologically innovative of the Romance languages).  This distinguishes them significantly from standard Italian, which is extremely conservative in its [[phonology]] (and notably conservative in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Geoffrey, PhD thesis 1982 (University of Sydney), published as ''The Linguistic Unity of Northern Italy and Rhaetia: Historical Grammar of the Padanian Language.'' 2 vols. Sydney: Beta Crucis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardised written forms==
Although "[al]most all Italian dialects were being written in the Middle Ages, for administrative, religious, and often artistic purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |last= Andreose | first = Alvise |last2=Renzi |first2=Lorenzo | contribution = Geography and distribution of the Romance Languages in Europe| editor-last = Maiden | editor-first = Martin |editor2-last= Smith | editor2-first = John Charles |editor3-last= Ledgeway | editor3-first = Adam |title=The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages | volume = Vol. 2, Contexts| page =303 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge | year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; use of local language gave way to stylized Tuscan, eventually labeled Italian. Local languages are still occasionally written, but only the following regional languages of Italy have a [[Koiné language|standardised written form]]. This may be widely accepted or used alongside more traditional written forms:

[[Image:LocationÅland.svg|thumb|The Åland province of Finland, highlighted in red]]

'''[[Åland Islands|Åland]]''', an autonomous region of [[Finland]], has the largest [[Finland-Swedes|Swedish-speaking]] majority in Finland, with about 88% of the province, or about 25,500 people, speaking [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as their first language (specifically the [[Åland Swedish]] dialect). Swedish is also the sole official language of the province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1991/19911144 Självstyrelselag för Åland 16.8.1991/1144 - 36 §]. Retrieved 2010-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] also has a presence, although it is small; only about 5% of Ålanders are Finnish-speaking.

The ten most spoken languages in 2016 (with a total population of 29,214):&lt;ref name="asub"&gt;[http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vaerak/statfin_vaerak_pxt_010.px/ Population by language 31 December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish: 25,592 (87.60%)
* Finnish: 1,367 (4.68%)
* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: 383 (1.31%)
* [[Latvian language|Latvian]]: 354 (1.21%)
* [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: 204 (0.70%)
* [[Russian language|Russian]]: 145 (0.50%)
* [[Thai language|Thai]]: 144 (0.49%)
* [[English language|English]]: 124 (0.42%)
* [[German language|German]]: 93 (0.32%)
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: 78 (0.27%)

While the number of Swedish-speakers grew from 24,169 in 2000 to 25,592 in 2016, their percentage has dropped from 93.7% in 2000 to 87.6% in 2014. For Finnish, the percentage and number of speakers has been about same (from 1,238 to 1,367; from 4.8% to 4.7%). The percentage of speakers of other languages grew from 1.5% in 2000 to 7.7% in 2016.&lt;ref name="asub" /&gt;

'''Micha Josef Berdyczewski''' ({{lang-he-n|מיכה יוסף ברדיצ'בסקי}}), or '''Mikhah Yosef Bin-Gorion''' (August 7, 1865 – November 18, 1921) (surname also written ''Berdichevsky''), was a [[Little Russia]]n-born writer of Hebrew, a journalist, and a scholar. He appealed for the [[Jews]] to change their way of thinking, freeing themselves from dogmas ruling the [[Jewish]] religion, tradition and history, but is also known for his work with pre-modern [[Jew]]ish [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s. He wrote in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[German language|German]] and has been described as "the first Hebrew writer living in [[Berlin]] to be revered in the world of [[German language|German]] letters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/kiev/treasures/berdyczewski.html Micha Josef Berdyczewski -- Gelman Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Berdichevski.jpg|thumb|150px]]
Micha Josef Berdyczewski was born in 1865 in the town [[Medzhybizh]] in western [[Ukraine]], to a family of [[Hasidic]] [[Rabbi]]s. His father was the town Rabbi. In his youth he began to read works from the [[Jewish Enlightenment]], and their influence is noticeable in his works. Berdyczewski was forced to divorce his first wife following her family's objection to his involvement with [[secular]] [[literature]]. He then moved to the [[Volozhin Yeshiva]], but there too, his pursuit of unconventional literature stirred anger and objection.

One of his earliest publications was about this period of his life—an article titled "Hetzitz V'nifga" (הציץ ונפגע in Hebrew—literally "peeked and got hurt", meaning "gone to heresy"), published in 1888 in the newspaper ''[[Ha-Melitz]]''. Most of his works from this period were polemic, and his emotional style became his trademark throughout his writing career.

In 1890 he went to [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], studied at the universities of [[Berlin]], [[Breslau]] and [[Bern]], and completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree&lt;!-- not "PhD" at that time and place --&gt;. In this period Berdyczewski studied the works of the great German [[philosophers]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Aschheim, S. E. (1992). ''The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany 1890–1990''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cms8TKJcbVgC].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and was deeply influenced by them. In the ten years until his return to [[Ukraine]] he published many articles and stories in Hebrew journals. Up to 1900, the year in which he married Rahel Ramberg, Berdyczewski had published ten books.

Upon his return to Ukraine, Berdyczewski encountered the harsh reality of the Jewish life in the [[Pale of Settlement]], and subsequently the subject of many of his stories is the deterioration of the traditional way of life.

After a short stay in [[Warsaw]], Berdyczewski returned to Germany in 1911, where he lived until his death in 1921. He is buried in the Jewish Cemetery in [[Weißensee Cemetery|Weißensee]], Berlin.

==Literary career==
Berdyczewski adopted the surname Bin-Gorion, first used to sign a collection of his works that he published in Berlin in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;"Berdyczewski" (ברדיצ'בסקי), in [http://www.ynet.co.il "ynet" on-line Hebrew encyclopedia].&lt;/ref&gt; The name Bin-Gorion is also inscribed on his tombstone. His last years were spent in intensive writing and research, collecting Jewish [[legend]]s and [[Folklore|folktales]] and publishing in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and [[German language|German]]. After his death, his wife and their son [[Emanuel Bin-Gorion]] translated some of his works into German, among them ''Die Sagen der Juden'' ("The Legends of the Jews", 1935) and ''Der Born Judas'' ("The Well of Judah"), published in six volumes.

Berdyczewski's popularity among the Jews of his age is attributed to his success in expressing their ambivalent attitude towards the traditional Jewish world, and to the secular European culture.

==Commemoration==
The [[Israel]]i [[moshav]] [[Sdot Micha]], founded in 1955, was named after him.

The '''Nadahup languages''', also known as '''Makú''' (Macú) or ''Vaupés–Japurá'', form a small [[language family]] in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], and [[Venezuela]]. The name ''[[Maku people (disambiguation)|Maku]]'' is pejorative, being derived from an Arawakan word meaning "without speech". ''Nadahup'' is an acronym of the constituent languages.&lt;ref&gt;Epps. P. A Grammar of Hup. Mouton de Gruyter. 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-11-019588-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nadahup family should not be confused with several other languages which go by the name ''Maku,'' including the [[Maku language of Roraima]]. There are proposals linking this unclassified language with Nadahup, but also with other languages.

==Languages==

Nadahup consists of about four languages, based on mutual intelligibility. Nadeb and Kuyawi, Hup and Yahup, and Nukak and Kakwa, however, share 90% of their vocabulary and are mutually intelligible, and so are separate languages only in a [[sociolinguistic]] sense. These four branches are not close: Although the family was first suggested in 1906, only 300 cognates have been found, which include pronouns but no other grammatical forms.

Nadëb may be the most divergent; of the other languages, there is disagreement on the placement of [[Nukak|Nïkâk]]. Martins (1999) propose two classifications, pending further research:

;Martins, proposal A
{{clade
|label1=Nadahup&amp;nbsp;
|1={{clade
|1=[[Nadëb language|Nadëb]] (also known as Kaburi; plus Kuyawi dialect)
|label2=&amp;nbsp;Vaupés&amp;nbsp;
|2={{clade
|1=[[Nïkâk language|Nïkâk]] (also known as Nukak, plus dialect [[Cacua language|Kakwa]]) 
|2=[[Dâw language|Dâw]] (also known as Kuri-Dou, pejorative Kamã)
|3=[[Hup language|Hup]] (also known as  Jupdá; plus dialect Yuhup/Yahup) 
}}
}}
}}

;Martins, proposal B
{{clade
|label1=Nadahup&amp;nbsp;
|1={{clade
|1=[[Nadëb language|Nadëb]] (with Kuyawi dialect)
|label2=&amp;nbsp;Daw–Hup&amp;nbsp;
|2={{clade
|1=[[Dâw language|Dâw]] 
|2=[[Hup language|Hup]] (with Yuhup dialect) 
}}
|3=[[Nïkâk language|Nïkâk]] (with Kakwa dialect) 
}}
}}

However, Epps considers Hup and Yahup to be distinct languages, and maintains that the inclusion of the poorly attested Nukak and Kakwa has not been demonstrated and is in fact highly dubious:&lt;ref&gt;Patience Epps, ''The Vaupés Melting Pot: Tucanoan Influence on Hup.'' In Aikhenvald &amp; Dixon, ''Grammars in contact: a cross-linguistic typology,'' 2006:130&lt;/ref&gt;

;Epps
{{clade
|label1=Nadahup&amp;nbsp;
|1={{clade
|1=[[Nadëb language|Nadëb]] (with Kuyawi dialect)
|label2=&amp;nbsp;Vaupés&amp;nbsp;
|2={{clade
|1=[[Dâw language|Dâw]] 
|2={{clade
|1=[[Hup language|Hup]]  
|2=[[Yuhup language|Yuhup]]  
}}
}}
}}
}}

==Typology==
Dâw and Hup—especially Hup—have undergone grammatical restructuring under [[Tucano language|Tucano]] influence. They have lost prefixes but acquired suffixes from [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] verb roots. They also have heavily monosyllabic roots, as can be seen by the reduction of Portuguese [[loan word]]s to their stressed syllable, as in Dâw ''yẽl’'' "money", from Portuguese ''dinheiru.'' Nadëb and Nïkâk, on the other hand, have polysyllabic roots. Nïkâk allows a single prefix per word, whereas Nadëb, which lies outside the Vaupés [[language area]], is heavily prefixing and [[polysynthetic]]: Up to nine prefixes per word (which is highly unusual for the Amazon), with [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] of nouns, prepositions, and adverbs.

==Genetic relations==

Rivet (from 1920), Kaufman (1994) and Pozzobon (1997) include [[Puinave]] within the family. However, many of the claimed cognate sets are spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Patience Epps, 2008. ''A Grammar of Hup''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henley, Mattéi-Müller and Reid (1996) present evidence that the [[Hodï language]] (also known as Yuwana) is related.

Puinavean forms part of a hypothetical [[Macro-Puinavean]] family along with the [[Arutani–Sape languages|Arutani–Sape]] families and the [[Maku language of Roraima]].

[[Macro-Puinavean languages|Macro-Puinavean]] is included in [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s larger ''Macro-Tucanoan'' stock, but this is generally rejected. Another larger grouping is [[Morris Swadesh]]'s ''Macro-Makú''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1804">{{Sound change}}

'''Paragoge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|dʒ|i}}; from {{lang-grc-gre|παραγωγή}}), is the addition of a sound to the end of a word. Often caused by [[nativization]], it is a type of [[epenthesis]], most commonly [[epenthetic vowel|vocalic epenthesis]].

Paragoge is particularly common in [[Brazilian Portuguese]], not only in loanwords but also in word derivation. It is also present in most accents of Brazilians who speak foreign languages such as [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249870576_Paragoge_and_degree_of_foreign_accent_in_Brazilian_English Paragoge and degree of foreign accent in Brazilian English]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages have undergone paragoge as a [[sound change]], and modern forms are longer than the historical forms they are derived from. Italian ''sono'' 'I am', from Latin ''sum'', is an example. Sometimes, as above, the paragogic vowel is an [[echo vowel]].

==In loanwords==
Some languages add a sound to the end of a [[loanword]] when it would otherwise end in a forbidden sound. Similarly, some languages add a sound to the end of a loanword to make it [[declension|declinable]].

===Examples===
*English ''[[computer]]'' → [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''kompjūter'''s''''';
*English ''rack'' → [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''räkk'''i''';
*English ''gal'' → [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{nihongo|ギャル}} (''[[gyaru|gyar'''u''']]'');
*[[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] {{lang|ota|{{nq|راقى}}}} (''[[rakı]]'') &gt; [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ''[[rakia|raki'''a''']]''.

It is [[High German]] in vocabulary (with some Danish concepts and loan translations), but it has Danish and Low Saxon grammar and syntax.{{cn|date=February 2014}} It originated in the 19th century and was still vibrant in the 1950s, but it is now on the verge of extinction. 

Petuh was named after partout card (Year pass) on the ferries on the [[Flensburg Fjord]]. It was known by the ''petuhtants'', mostly older women who met on the excursion boats and in the cafes along the fjord.

'''Philippe Thoby-Marcelin''' (1904–1975), was a [[Haiti]]an [[poet]], [[novelist]], [[journalist]], [[folklorist]] and [[politician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CBBlYUeSIw0C&amp;pg=PA434&amp;lpg=PA434&amp;dq=Philippe+Thoby-Marcelin+poet+novelist#v=onepage&amp;q=Philippe%20Thoby-Marcelin%20poet%20novelist&amp;f=false |title=American Babel: Literatures of the United States from Abnaki to Zuni |accessdate=30 May 2014|isbn=9780674006614 |author1=Shell |first1=Marc |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Philippe Thoby-Marcelin was born December 11, 1904 in [[Port-au-Prince]]. He and his younger brother, Pierre Marcelin (1908-?), worked together on the writing of several novels about rural Haiti, highlighting the themes of peasant life and Haitian folklore. 

Philippe went to high school in Port-au-Prince and finished his education in [[Paris]] where he studied law. While there, he became acquainted with [[Valéry Larbaud]], who arranged to have some of his poems published in ''La revue européenne'', a monthly literary journal that was published from 1923 to 1931. Back in Haiti, he began his career as general secretary at the Ministry of Public Works. Like most Haitian intellectuals, he was opposed to the [[United States occupation of Haiti|American occupation of Haiti]], which had been established in 1915.

In 1927, together with [[Jacques Roumain]], [[Carl Brouard]], [[Émile Roumer]] and Normil Sylvain (1900-1929), he helped create ''La Revue Indigène'', a literary journal in which they published their poems. They idea was to honor the indigenous Haitian literary and artistic material, and return the culture to its pre-occupational state. His first novel ''Canapé-Vert'', was published in 1944. 

In 1946, he participated in the founding of the short-lived [[Popular Socialist Party (Haiti)|Popular Socialist Party]] (PSP), together with {{ill|Anthony Lespès|fr}}. That same year he published his second novel, ''La Bête de Musseau'', translated as ''The Beast of the Haitian Hills''. In 1948, when the PSP was declared illegal by President [[Dumarsais Estimé]], he moved to the United States, where he worked as a translator for the [[Pan-American Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ile-en-ile.org/thoby-marcelin/ Biography @ "Île en Île"]&lt;/ref&gt;

His third novel, ''Le Crayon de Dieu'', appeared in 1952. His last novel, ''Tous les Hommes sont Fous'' was published in 1972 and translated into English by his wife, Eva.

He died at his home in Cazenovia, near [[Syracuse, New York]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/17/archives/thobymarcelin-70-haitian-novelist.html New York Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quantal theory of speech''' is a [[phonetic]] answer to one of the fundamental questions of [[phonology]], specifically: if each language community is free to arbitrarily select a system of [[phonemes]] or segments, then why are the [[phoneme]] inventories of different languages so similar?   For example, almost all languages have the stop consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, and almost all have the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/.  Other phonemes differ considerably among languages, but not nearly as much as they would if each language were free to choose arbitrarily.

Proposed by [[Ken Stevens]] at [[MIT]], quantal theory formalizes the intuition that some speech sounds are easier to produce than others.  Sounds that are easier to reliably produce, in the formal way described below, are more common among the languages of the world; those that are harder to reliably produce are less common.

==The Quantal Nature of Speech==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Quantal theory of speech schematic.png|thumb|right|Schematic of a nonlinear articulatory-acoustic relationship, visually depicting the claim that any nonlinear function has some regions with high slope (region II), and other regions of lower slope (regions I and III).  The quantal theory of speech posits that few languages put a phonological boundary in the middle of region I, while many languages put a phonological boundary in the middle of region II.]] --&gt;

Let Y=f(X), where X is any particular articulatory parameter (tongue tip position, for example), and Y is any particular perceptual parameter (perceived frequency of the peak in the acoustic spectrum, for example).  Like any nonlinear relation, f(X) has regions of low slope (|df/dX| small) and regions of high slope (|df/dX| large).  Values of Y drawn from a high-slope region are unstable, in the sense that a small change in X causes a large change in Y; values of Y drawn from a low-slope region are conversely stable, in that they are little perturbed by large changes in X.  Stevens proposed in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KYeAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|author=K.N. Stevens|title=The quantal nature of speech: evidence from articulatory-acoustic data|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the stability of low-slope regions makes them more likely to be chosen as discrete linguistic units (phonemes) by the languages of the world, and that the distinction between any pair of phonemes tends similarly to occur across an unstable high-slope boundary region.  Examples include

===Consonant Place of Articulation===

* Alveolar versus palatal.  The hard palate is horizontal for up to 1&amp;nbsp;cm behind the teeth, before suddenly opening upward in a feature known as the alveolar ridge.  By moving the tongue a few millimeters before or behind the alveolar ridge, therefore, it is possible to dramatically change the acoustic spectrum, resulting in the distinction between "sip" and "ship".&lt;ref name="AIP encomium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asa.aip.org/encomia/gold/stevens.html|title=Acoustical Society of America Gold Medal Award, 1995: Kenneth N. Stevens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Palatal versus retroflex.  The tongue tip is flexible about 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm below its tip, permitting the tongue tip to fold back on itself. If the tongue tip is close to the palate when this action is performed, the air cavity under the tongue is suddenly lengthened thereby from 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 4&amp;nbsp;cm, resulting in the change from "chip" to "trip," or from "you" to "rue."

===Consonant Manner===

* Plosive versus fricative versus glide.  Producing turbulence in the vocal tract requires a very careful adjustment: the minimum constriction cross-section must be typically less than 1.5mm, but greater than 0mm.  If the tongue (for example) closes all the way against the palate, then releases again, the result is a plosive (as in "tip").  If the tongue closes most of the way, but doesn't pass the magic 1.5mm boundary, the result is a glide (as in "yip"). If the tongue reaches a minimum constriction width between 0 and 1.5mm, the resulting sound is a fricative (as in "ship").  Despite the high degree of control required, most languages maintain a three-way contrast between glides, fricatives, and plosives, because of the large acoustic difference so achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asadl.org/jasa/resource/1/jasman/v50/i4B/p1180_s1?isAuthorized=no|author=K.N. Stevens|title="Airflow and Turbulence Noise for Fricative and Stop Consonants: Static Considerations," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 50(4):1180-1192|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plosive versus nasal.  If the passage between your mouth and nose is opened by even 1mm during the /b/ closure of "bug," the word becomes "mug."  Further opening of the soft palate (2mm, 5mm, even 20mm) has almost no effect on the acoustics; most languages distinguish /b/ from /m/, but few (if any?) distinguish different degrees of soft palate opening.
* Strident versus nonstrident.  When a fricative is produced, the turbulent jet of air can either be pointed against an obstacle (e.g., in the word "sin," the jet is directed against the lower teeth), or pointed directly out of the mouth (as in the word "thin").  A jet directed against an obstacle makes a lot more noise (sound power is typically ten times greater), therefore many languages use this distinction to enhance an otherwise tiny place of articulation difference.&lt;ref name="K.N. Stevens 1987"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zDVAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|author=K.N. Stevens|title="Relational Properties as Perceptual Correlates of Phonetic Features," Proc. Eleventh Int. Conf. Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS) 4:352-356|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

* Lehiste&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asadl.org/jasa/resource/1/jasman/v33/i3/p268_s1?isAuthorized=no|author=I. Lehiste and G.E. Peterson|title="Transitions, Glides, and Diphthongs," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 33(3):268-277|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that when the peak frequencies in a vowel spectrum (the so-called "formants") are closer together than about half an octave, listeners respond as if the two peaks were merged into a single peak.  Many vowel distinctions straddle this half-octave threshold, e.g., the first two formants of "bought" are closer than half an octave, while those of "but" are not; the second and third formants of "bit" are closer than half an octave, while those of "bet" are not.&lt;ref name="K.N. Stevens 1987"/&gt;

==Enhancement Features==

Quantal theory is supported by a theory of language change, developed in collaboration with Jay Keyser, which postulates the existence of redundant or enhancement features.&lt;ref name="Enhancement features"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/414843?uid=3738904&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102503668607|author=K.N. Stevens and S.J. Keyser|title="Primary Features and their Enhancement in Consonants," Language 65(1):81-106|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is quite common, in language, to find a pair of phonemes that
differ in two features simultaneously.  In English, for example,
"thin" and "sin" differ in both the place of articulation of the
fricative (teeth versus alveolar ridge), and in its loudness
(nonstrident versus strident).  Similarly, "tell" and "dell" differ in
both the voicing of the initial consonant, and in its aspiration (the
/t/ in "tell" is immediately followed by a puff of air, like a short
/h/ between the plosive and the vowel).  In many cases, native
speakers have strong and mistaken intuition about the relative
importance of the two distinctions, e.g., speakers of English believe
that "thin" versus "sin" is a place of articulation difference, even
though the loudness difference is more perceptible.  Stevens, Keyser
and Kawasaki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000906745|author=K.N. Stevens and S.J. Keyser and H. Kawasaki|title="Toward a Phonetic and Phonological Theory of Redundant Features," in "Invariance and Variability in Speech Processes," Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 426-463|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that such
redundant features evolve as an enhancement&lt;ref name="Enhancement features" /&gt; of an otherwise weak acoustic
distinction, in order to improve the robustness of the language's
phonological system.

'''Romance verbs''' refers to the [[verb]]s of the [[Romance languages]]. In the transition from [[Latin]] to the Romance languages, verbs went through many [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Syntax|syntactic]], and [[Semantics|semantic]] changes. Most of the distinctions present in classical Latin continued to be made, but [[synthetic language|synthetic]] forms were often replaced with [[compound verb|analytic]] ones. Other verb forms changed meaning, and new forms also appeared.

==Morphological changes==
=== Comparison of conjugations ===

The following tables present a comparison of the conjugation of the regular verb ''amare'' "to love" in Classical Latin, and [[Vulgar Latin]] (reconstructed, with stress marked), and five modern Romance languages.

{{efn|name=seven|The [[future tense|future indicative tense]] of the modern languages does not derive from the Latin form (which tended to be confounded with the preterite due to sound changes in Vulgar Latin), but rather from an infinitive + ''habeō'' periphrasis, later [[grammaticalisation|reanalysed]] as a simple tense. The [[conditional tense]] was formed similarly from the imperfect of ''habeō''.}}
{{efn|name=eight|Fell into disuse in modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], now found only in old literary texts. Nowadays largely replaced by the [[Compound verb|compound forms]] ''tinha amado" or ''havia amado'' (had loved).}}
}}

Note that the Vulgar Latin reconstructions are believed to have regularized word stress within each tense (except the present) and that the [[nasal vowel]]s (marked with {{angbr|˜}}) were probably commonly realized as their non-nasal counterparts. Word-final {{angbr|e}} probably converged on {{IPAslink|ə}}.

===Copula===
{{main|Romance copula}}

While the [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] became completely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] in Romance, the active voice has been morphologically preserved to a greater or lesser extent. The tables below compare the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of the Latin verbs ''sum'' and ''sto'' in the active voice with that of the Romance copulae, their descendants. For simplicity, only the first person singular is listed for [[finite verb|finite forms]]. Note that certain forms in romance languages come from the [[suppletion|suppletive]] verb ''sedeo'' (to be seated) instead of ''sum'', e.g. subjunctive present: ''sedea'' &gt; sia, sea, seja... (medieval Galician-Portuguese, for instance, had double forms in the whole conjugation: sou/sejo, era/sia, fui/sevi, fora/severa, fosse/sevesse...)

#The [[future tense|future indicative tense]] does not derive from the Latin form (which tended to be confounded with the preterite due to sound changes in Vulgar Latin), but rather from an infinitive + HABEO periphrasis, later [[grammaticalisation|reanalysed]] as a simple tense.
#Formally identical to the [[Future perfect|future perfect indicative]] except in the first person singular. The two paradigms merged in Vulgar Latin.
&lt;/small&gt;

==Semantic changes==

In spite of the remarkable continuity of form, several Latin tenses have changed meaning, especially subjunctives.
* The '''supine''' became a [[Participle|past participle]] in all Romance languages.
* The '''pluperfect indicative''' became a [[conditional mood|conditional]] in Sicilian, and an imperfect [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] in Spanish.
* The '''pluperfect subjunctive''' developed into an imperfect subjunctive in all languages except [[Romansh language|Romansh]], where it became a conditional, and Romanian, where it became a [[pluperfect|pluperfect indicative]].
* The '''future perfect indicative''' became a future subjunctive in Old Spanish, Portuguese, and [[Galician language|Galician]].

The Latin '''imperfect subjunctive''' underwent a change in syntactic status, becoming a personal [[infinitive]] in Portuguese and Galician.&lt;ref name=will&gt;Williams (1962); Wireback (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative hypothesis traces the personal infinitive back to the Latin infinitive, not to a conjugated verb form.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer (1968); Osborne (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periphrases==

In many cases, the empty cells in the tables above exist as distinct [[compound verb]]s in the modern languages. Thus, the main tense and mood distinctions in classical Latin are still made in most modern Romance languages, though some are now expressed through compound rather than simple verbs. Some examples, from Romanian:

* '''Perfect indicative''': ''am fost, ai fost, a fost, am fost, ați fost, au fost'';
* '''Future indicative''': ''voi fi, vei fi, va fi, vom fi, veți fi, vor fi'';
* '''Future perfect indicative''': ''voi fi fost, vei fi fost, va fi fost, vom fi fost, veți fi fost, vor fi fost''.

New forms also developed, such as the conditional, which in most Romance languages started out as a periphrasis, but later became a simple tense. In Romanian, the conditional is still periphrastic: ''aș fi, ai fi, ar fi, am fi, ați fi, ar fi''.

The '''rule of the octave''' is a way of [[harmonization|harmonizing]] each note of the [[diatonic scale]], reflecting common practice, and has its origin in the practice of [[thorough bass]], or basso continuo. The rule of the octave also formed the cornerstone of the "regole" (rules) of [[partimento]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Furno/regoleP2.htm|title=Scale Steps|website=faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of the octave was first mentioned in the 17th century in treatises for thorough bass written for [[lute]]-like instruments.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} There is normally a different harmonization for ascending and descending [[bass line]]s, and, although called a rule, there are several variants with different chords. Different versions for the major and minor scales are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/aboutParti/ruleOfTheOctave.htm|title=Regola dell'ottava|website=faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example for the major scale by John Hiles:&lt;ref&gt;Hiles, John (1882).

[[File:Screenplay example.svg|right|thumb|250px|A page of a screenplay]]

A '''screenplay writer''' (also called '''screenwriter''' for short), '''scriptwriter''' or '''scenarist''', is a writer who practices the craft of [[screenwriting]], writing [[screenplay]]s on which [[mass media]], such as [[film]]s, [[television program]]s and [[video games]], are based.

==Profession==
Screenwriting is a [[freelance]] profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good [[storytelling]] abilities and [[imagination]]. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a [[spec script]]. What separates a [[professional]] screenwriter from an [[amateur]] screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a [[talent agent|talent agency]]. Also, professional screenwriters do not often work for free, but amateur screenwriters will often work for free and are considered "writers in training." Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.

There are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the [[film industry]], but it often takes years of trial-and-error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In ''Writing Screenplays that Sell'', Michael Hague writes, "Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the [[Great American Novel]] was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen."&lt;ref name=Hauge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauge|first=Michael|title=Writing Screenplays That Sell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film industry==
Every screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea, and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts, with the intention of selling them and having them produced.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Brooks|title=Creativity and integrity: Marketing the "in development" screenplay|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=17 April 2009|volume=26|issue=5|pages=421–444|doi=10.1002/mar.20281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the script is based on an existing property, such as a book or person's life story, which is adapted by the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html Biopic &amp; Book Adaptation - http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the time, a film project gets initiated by a screenwriter. The initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; They are referred to as "exclusive" assignments or "pitched" assignments. Screenwriters who often pitch new projects, whether original or an adaptation, often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful. When word is put out about a project a [[film studio]], [[production company]], or producer wants done, they are referred to as "open" assignments. Open assignments are more competitive. If screenwriters are competing for an open assignment, more-established writers usually win the assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment.

==Script doctoring==
Many screenwriters also work as full or part-time [[script doctor]]s, attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a [[film director|director]] or [[movie studio|studio]]. For instance, studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak.

Script-doctoring can be quite lucrative, especially for the better-known writers. [[David Mamet]] and [[John Sayles]], for instance, fund the movies that they direct themselves, usually from their own screenplays, by writing and doctoring scripts for others. In fact, some writers make very profitable careers out of being the ninth or tenth writer to work on a piece, and they often work on projects that never see exposure to an audience of any size. Many up-and-coming screenwriters also [[ghostwrite]] projects and allow more-established screenwriters to take public credit for the project to increase the chances of it getting picked up.

==Development process==
After a screenwriter finishes a project, he or she pairs with an industry-based representative, such as a [[film producer|producer]], director, [[literary agent]], entertainment lawyer, or entertainment executive. The partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project. Once the script is sold, the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt;

A screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized, which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; As more films are produced independently (outside the studio system), many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests, screenplay contests, and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers. Many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects.

==Production involvement==
Screenwriters are rarely involved in the development of a film. Sometimes they come on as advisors, or if they are established,  as a producer. Some screenwriters also direct. Although many scripts are sold each year, many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and [[TV industry]]. When a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a [[film studio]], [[production company]], TV network, or producer, he or she often has to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects "chosen" and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.

==Union==
Most professional screenwriters in the U.S. are [[unionized]] and are represented by the [[Writers Guild of America]]. Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding [[WGA screenwriting credit system|writing credit]] for projects under its jurisdiction.  The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">'''Situation theory''' provides the mathematical foundations to [[situation semantics]], and was developed by writers such as [[Jon Barwise]] and [[Keith Devlin]] in the 1980s. Due to certain foundational problems, the mathematics was framed in a [[non-well-founded set theory]]. One could think of the relation of situation theory to situation semantics as like that of [[type theory]] to [[Montague semantics]].

Types in the theory are defined by applying two forms of type abstraction, starting with an initial collection of basic types.

Basic types
*TIM: the type of a temporal location
*LOC: the type of a spatial location
*IND: the type of an individual
*RELn: the type of an n-place relation
*SIT: the type of a situation
*INF: the type of an infon
*TYP: the type of a type
*PAR: the type of a parameter
*POL: the type of a polarity (i.e. 0 or 1)

Infons are made of basic types.
For instance: If l is a location, then l is of type LOC, and the infon
&lt;&lt;of-type, l, LOC, 1&gt;&gt;
is a fact.

The '''two-gospel hypothesis''' is that the [[Gospel of Matthew]] was written before the [[Gospel of Luke]], and that both were written earlier than the [[Gospel of Mark]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Thomas (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlWveEVuGscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels''], Kregel Academic, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a proposed solution to the [[Synoptic Problem]], which concerns the pattern of similarities and differences between the three [[Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. The hypothesis, following an original proposal by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and expanded by [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] (it was once called the Griesbach hypothesis), was introduced in its current form by William Farmer in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;William Farmer, ''The Synoptic Problem: A Critical Analysis'', New York: Macmillan, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is the most serious alternative to the [[two-source hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt; Its main advantages over the two-source hypothesis include the fact that it relies not just on internal evidence, that it does not require lost sources like the [[Q document]], and that it is supported by the view of the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. Unlike the two-source hypothesis, the two-gospel hypothesis concludes that the traditional accounts of the gospels (order and date of publication, as well as authorship) are accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Beck&lt;/ref&gt; A further development of the Augustinian and Griesbach hypotheses is found in the hypothesis of [[Eta Linnemann]], followed by [[F. David Farnell]], that the "two Gospels" were required by the "two witnesses" rule of Deuteronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Thomas Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels 2002 p255, and p322 "Farnell 's third axiom notes, quoting Linnemann, that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of Deuteronomy 19:15b: "[O]n the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.""&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Almost all of Mark's content is found in Matthew, and much of Mark is similarly found in Luke. Additionally, Matthew and Luke have a large amount of material in common that is not found in Mark.]]

The hypothesis states that Matthew was written first, while Christianity was still centered in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], to calm the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|hostility between Jews and Christians]]. After Matthew, as the [[Early centers of Christianity|church expanded]] beyond the [[Holy Land]], Luke was written as a gospel to the [[Gentiles]]. But since neither [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] (nor his patron [[Saint Paul|Paul]]) were eyewitnesses of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] gave public testimonies that validated Luke’s gospel. These public speeches were transcribed into [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark’s]] gospel and distributed immediately thereafter, as recorded by the early [[Church father]] [[Irenaeus]]. Paul then allowed Luke’s gospel to be published.&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal suggests that Matthew was written by the apostle Matthew, probably in the 40s AD. At the time, the church had yet to extend outside of Jerusalem. The primary political problem within the church community was caused by the fact that Jewish authorities were outright hostile to Jesus and his followers. Matthew wrote his account in order to show that Jesus was actually the fulfillment of what Jewish [[scripture]] had [[prophesy|prophesied]]. It has been long recognized that Matthew is the most “Jewish” of the gospels. It, for example, heavily references Jewish scripture and Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] was martyred, as recorded in the [[Book of Acts]], the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] scattered beyond [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] into Gentile (mostly [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek]] but also [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]]) towns. There they began preaching, and a large number of [[Pagan]]s in [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] quickly became Christians. By the mid 50s, Paul, who [[Conversion of Paul|converted]] and claimed the title of "Apostle to the Gentiles" began to realize the need for a [[gospel]] to the Gentiles. This gospel would have to [[Antinomianism#Biblical law in Christianity|deemphasize the Mosaic Law]] and [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|recent Jewish history]] in order to appeal to Greeks and [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. Paul commissioned his associate, Luke, who used Matthew, as well as other sources. The first verses of Luke’s gospel reference the fact that “many have undertaken to draw up an account” of the testimony of the actual eyewitnesses, and, as such, he has “carefully investigated everything from the beginning” in order to “write an orderly account”. Once the gospel had been written, Paul delayed its publication. He decided that he needed Peter’s public testimony as to its accuracy, since neither Paul nor Luke had known Jesus before his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]].&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul asked Peter, who was the leader of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], to testify that Luke's account was accurate. According to early church sources, Peter gave a series of speeches to senior Roman army officers. Due to the commonality between Mark and Luke, these speeches would have constituted Peter’s public “seal of approval” upon Luke’s gospel. These church sources suggest that Peter was ambivalent when Mark asked him if he could write down the words of the speeches. However, since the [[Roman army|Roman officers]] who heard the speeches liked them, they asked for copies, and so Mark made fifty copies of Peter’s speeches. These copies began circulating, and became Mark’s gospel. Only after the speeches by Peter were made (and Mark’s transcriptions began circulating) did Paul feel confident enough to publish Luke’s gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Beck&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-gospel hypothesis assumes that Peter made sure that his speeches agreed with both Matthew and (the still unpublished) Luke. Since Matthew was the primary source for Luke, and Matthew’s gospel (the only published gospel at the time) would have been well known to Peter, he mostly would have preached on the contents of Matthew. Knowing Matthew better than Luke, Peter was more likely to mention details found in Matthew and not Luke than vice versa. This would explain why there are more details found in Mark and Matthew but not Luke than there are details found in Mark and Luke but not Matthew. It also explains why Mark is so much shorter than Matthew and Luke, is more anecdotal and emotional, is less polished, and why only it begins immediately with [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus’ public ministry]]. Peter was giving public speeches as to what he saw, and never intended his speeches to become a full gospel. This was directly asserted by the early church historians, and explains why there are so few commentaries on Mark (as opposed to Matthew, Luke and John) until a relatively late date. It appears to have been considered the least important gospel in the early church.&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal and external evidence==

Much of the evidence for the two-gospel hypothesis comes from the gospels themselves ("internal evidence"), while some of the evidence is found in the testimony of the early church ("external evidence"). The early church didn't just testify as to who wrote the gospels, in what order, and when they wrote them, it also testified on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of each gospel.  For example, early church documents claim that Mark's Gospel was created after Mark made fifty copies of a series of speeches that Peter had given in [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]]. The external evidence (mainly the testimony of the early church) is the main difference between the two hypotheses. The two-gospel hypothesis does not dismiss the views of the early church, and makes assumptions based on both the internal and external evidence. The two-source hypothesis, in contrast, is based on the internal evidence for [[Marcan priority]].&lt;ref&gt;Beck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasted with the two-source hypothesis==

Approximately 25% of Matthew and 25% of Luke are identical, but are not found in Mark. This has been explained in the two-source hypothesis as coming from the hypothetical Q document, although by the two-gospel hypothesis, this material was copied by Luke from Matthew, but not testified to by Mark because Peter had not seen it. The two-source hypothesis also assumes that the information unique to Matthew (“M”) and Luke (“L”) came from unknown sources. The two-gospel hypothesis, in contrast, assumes “M” to be mostly Matthew’s testimony and “L” to be the eyewitness accounts mentioned in the first verses of Luke’s gospel. In addition, it gives a specific reason for the fact that Mark has more in common with Matthew than it does with Luke.
[[File:Synoptic problem Griesbach hypothesis.png|thumb|right|250px|The Griesbach hypothesis suggests that the Gospel of Matthew was written first. The Gospel of Luke was written using Matthew as a source. Then the Gospel of Mark was written using both Matthew and Luke.]]

By the 1960s, scholars considered the two-source hypothesis to be the unquestioned solution to the synoptic problem. By the 1990s, however, the consensus had ended, and some scholars claimed that the two-source hypothesis had even been disproven. Subsequently, the two-gospel hypothesis has emerged as the most serious challenger to the two-source hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Beck&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-gospel theory is more of a conjecture than the two-source hypothesis because, unlike that theory, it depends on the unreliable accounts of the early church. Since the two-source hypothesis does not accept the conjecture of the early church, it follows from internal evidence (such as the shortness of Mark) and logic (e.g. ‘why would Mark write a shorter version of a gospel in existence?’)&lt;ref&gt;Black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared to the Griesbach hypothesis==

The Griesbach hypothesis is similar to the two-gospel hypothesis. However, unlike the two-gospel hypothesis, the Griesbach hypothesis is principally a [[literary criticism|literary]] hypothesis. What came to be labeled the Griesbach Hypothesis was already anticipated by the British scholar Henry Owen (1716–1795), in a piece he published in 1764, and by Friedrich Andreas Stroth (1750–1785) in an article he published anonymously in 1781. Johann Jakob Griesbach (January 4, 1745 – March 24, 1812), to whom this source hypothesis was first accredited, alluded to his conclusion that Matthew wrote the first of the canonical gospels and that Luke, not Mark, made first use of Matthew in composing the second of the canonical gospels in an address celebrating the Easter season at the University of Jena in 1783. Later, for similar Whitsun programs at Jena (1789–1790), Griesbach published a much more detailed "Demonstration that the Whole Gospel of Mark is Excerpted from the Narratives of Matthew &amp; Luke."

Griesbach's theory was, therefore, one of direct literary dependence between and among the gospels of Matthew, Luke and Mark, or what German scholars came to call a "utilization hypothesis." According to Griesbach, the historical order of the gospels was, first, Matthew; second Luke, making use of Matthew and other non-Matthaean tradition; and third, Mark, making use of both Matthew and Luke. In proposing this hypothesis, Griesbach maintained Matthaean priority, as had Augustine before him, along with every other scholar in the church prior to the late eighteenth century. Griesbach's main support for his thesis lies in passages where Matthew and Luke agree over and against Mark (e.g. Matthew 26:68; Luke 22:64; Mark 14:65), the so-called Minor Agreements.

== Criticism ==

Many generic arguments in favor of [[Markan Priority]] and/or [[Two-source hypothesis]] also work as arguments against the two-gospel hypothesis. While it is impossible to list all arguments in favor and against the theory, some notable arguments are as follows.

* If Luke had access to the final version of Matthew (as opposed to both drawing independently on other sources), why are there so many significant differences between Luke and Matthew on issues such as Jesus' genealogy, circumstances of birth, and events following resurrection? While Luke and Matthew do share a lot of text which is not present in Mark, almost all of it is confined to teachings and parables. Construction of the gospels in accordance with the two-gospel hypothesis would require Luke to rewrite major parts of Matthew's narrative – even though Matthew was presumably an eyewitness who lived in Jerusalem and was surrounded by other eyewitnesses, and Luke was neither.
* "The argument from omission": why would Mark and Peter omit such remarkable and miraculous events as virgin birth of Jesus and particularly his appearance to apostles following resurrection? Both Matthew and Luke explicitly attest that Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples, including Peter, after his resurrection, and it seems incredible that Peter would not testify to that fact in his public speeches. And why is [[Sermon on the Mount]] completely omitted?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark-prior.html|title=The Priority of Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwar.org/controlsynopticproblem.pdf|title=The Synoptic Problem}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Many scholars (and particularly most Jewish scholars) hold that the concept of virgin birth in Christianity originated with mistranslation of [[Isaiah 7:14]] into Greek, and therefore that authors of Matthew and Luke were [[Gentile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twenty-six reasons why Jews don't believe in Jesus|author=Asher Norman|pages=91–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be reconciled with the traditional Biblical chronology that dates both gospels no earlier than 75 AD and attributes "the Gospel of Matthew" to an unknown author, but it's in clear contradiction with the position of the two-gospel hypothesis that Matthew was ''the'' [[Saint Matthew]], and, therefore, a Jew.

== Variants ==

A related theory has Luke drawing not directly from Matthew, but from a common source, seen as a proto-Matthew. This was advanced in the nineteenth century by [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|Wilhelm de Wette]] and [[Friedrich Bleek]], and more recently revived by Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.wardpowers.info/POM.htm | title=The Progressive Publication of Matthew: An Explanation of the Writing of the Synoptic Gospels | last=Powers | first=B. Ward | year=2010 | isbn=0805448489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthaean priority is also a cornerstone of the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], which, however, has Luke drawing from Mark rather than vice versa.

The '''United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad''' ('''UKLO''') is a [[linguistics]] competition for primary and secondary school students in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="theyorker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/campusnews/10970|title=Olympic flame burns for young linguists -  The Yorker|publisher=theyorker.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="all-languages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-languages.org.uk/news/news_list/uk_linguistics_olympiad|title=UK Linguistics Olympiad|publisher=all-languages.org.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition is divided into four levels: Breakthrough, Foundation, Intermediate and Advanced, collectively known as 'Round 1', with roughly 16 top-scoring entrants at Advanced level eligible for a follow-on round, called 'Round 2' and selection for participation in the [[International Linguistics Olympiad]], one of the [[international science olympiad]]s. In 2009, teams from two schools competed in a pilot competition, with the winners taking part in the international contest as guests of the All-Ireland Linguistics Olympiad. In 2010, an independent olympiad was created and has taken place every year since.

== History ==

Problem-solving competitions in linguistics for secondary school students have been taking place around the world since the 1960s. In Russia, the Moscow and St Petersburg Linguistic Olympiads are credited with inspiring hundreds of young talented scholars to choose linguistics as an academic major and profession. Currently there are national contests within Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. There is also an International Linguistics Olympiad in which students from many countries compete, which began in 2003, and was first hosted by Bulgaria.

In 2009, two UK schools, the [[Manchester Grammar School]] and [[Downlands Community School]], took part as guests in the Irish competition, and the winning team represented the UK at the International Olympiad. This triggered the foundation of a permanent committee for the UK Linguistics Olympiad, and the creation of a consortium of olympiads held in English-speaking countries, ELCLO, as a means for pooling resources with [[NACLO]], AILO and [[Australian Computational and Linguistics Olympiad|OzCLO]], the American, Irish and Australian Linguistics Olympiads respectively. The UKLO committee is chaired by Dick Hudson, with Neil Sheldon serving as vice-chair.

In 2010, 560 students from 28 schools entered, 223 at Foundation, and 337 at Advanced level. In 2011,  1165 entries were received from 49 schools, 349 at Foundation, and 816 at Advanced level. 2012 saw the introduction of the Intermediate level, with 1912 entries from 300 schools, 432 at Foundation, 498 at Intermediate and 982 at Advanced level. 2013 saw total entries number 2878, with 1069 at Foundation, 643 at Intermediate and 1166 at Advanced level. In 2015, a new, lowest entry level was introduced, called Breakthrough, with 96 entrants. By 2018, the numbers had increased to 220 in Breakthrough, 1042 at Foundation, 970 at Intermediate and 1650 at Advanced.

The Olympiad has sponsorship and support from various organisations including the British Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/457 |title=British Academy Sponsorship |accessdate=28 November 2013 |date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linguistics Association of Great Britain, The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]], The Philological Society, Routes into Languages,&lt;ref name="routesintolanguages"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/cymru/news/2359|title=UK Linguistics Olympiad registration for 2012 &amp;#124; Routes Into Languages|publisher=routesintolanguages.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, [[Sheffield University]] and The School of Philosophy, Psychology &amp; Language Sciences, [[Edinburgh University]].

The UK has sent a delegation to the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) every year since 2009, and has competed in 10 olympiads. They have sent 60 participants in 15 teams, selected through UKLO. In competition, teams from the UK have brought home 27 medals (10 gold, 6 silver and 11 bronze), 3 team trophies (1 gold and 2 bronze), 1 first-place team cup, 3 best solution prizes, and 12 honourable mentions. In addition, the UK has sent 4 Repeat Medalists and 2 Dream Teams to the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioling.org/results/UK/ |title=The UK at the IOL: Results |accessdate=28 October 2013 |date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK Linguistics Olympiad was the host for the 2013 IOL, held at the Manchester Grammar School and chaired by Neil Sheldon. The competition in Manchester was featured on an edition of BBC Radio Four's Word of Mouth programme centring on language games.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b038c7bs/Word_of_Mouth_Language_Games|title=BBC iPlayer - Word of Mouth: Language Games|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==

The competition is divided into two rounds. Round 1 is open to all secondary school pupils, while Round 2 is invitation only.

10 linguistic data problems are posed in each year's Round 1 papers, with the Breakthrough paper being 1-3, Foundation 2-5, Intermediate 4-7, and Advanced 6-10. The intention is that each problem is harder than the previous. At Breakthrough, Foundation and Intermediate levels, participants may enter either individually or as part of a group of 2-4 students, and timings and conditions can be decided by schools. At the Advanced level, the competition must take the format of an individual, two and a half hour test sat under controlled conditions.

Roughly 16 of the top scorers from the Advanced paper are invited to participate in Round 2, which takes the form of a residential training weekend at a host university,&lt;ref name="york"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/language/news/events/uklo-2012/|title=uklo 2012 - Language and Linguistic Science, The University of York|publisher=york.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smuc.ac.uk/news/news/school-of-communication-culture-and-creative-arts/2013/03/st-marys-hosts-the-finals-of-the-uk-linguistics-olympiad/|title=St Mary’s Hosts the Finals of the UK Linguistics Olympiad|publisher=smuc.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a three-hour test posing five more problems. Eight competitors in two teams from Round 2 are invited to participate in the International Linguistics Olympiad and represent the UK, with selection being based mostly on performance in the Round 2 paper, but past performances at IOL and Round 2 are taken into account, as is performance in the training throughout the weekend.

== IOL Teams ==

Since 2009, the UK has sent teams annually to the IOL.

[[File:Yatate IMG 0429.jpg|thumb|Ink box and [[pen]] compartment of an Edo-era yatate.]]
'''''Yatate''''' (矢立) are small personal smoking-pipe-shaped writing sets from medieval [[Japan]] which provided a carrying box for the ink cotton, and a shaft for a brush (and possibly a letter opener).

==Usage==
''Yatate'' literally means "[[quiver]]" ("''ya-tate''"). The name comes from the practice of early ''[[Samurai#Etymology of samurai and related words|bushi]]'' who kept ink stones inside their quivers.

Japanese writing was traditionally done using the writing set inspired from [[China]]: an ''inking stone'', a small stick of solid ink ([[Sumi ink|sumi]]) (which is turned to usable liquid [[ink]] by grinding on the inking stone and watering), and [[Ink brush|brushes]]. The complete set was easily portable and took time to prepare the materials for writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stutler.cc/pens/yatate/ ''What is a Yatate ?'' -- Tokyo Fountain pen scene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pentrace.net/east/yatate/index.html The Japanese Yatate] (Russ Stutler) (At Pentrace East)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yatate IMG 6564.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Yatate]]
During the [[Kamakura Shogunate|Kamakura era]] (1185–1333), the idea of ink-saturated cotton was developed. By touching a calligraphy brush to the cotton, one could ink the bristles with reduced risk of dripping or spilling ink. By enclosing the cotton in a little box ("''sumi tsubo''"), a writing set was made convenient and portable.

The first ''yatate'' were long boxes, with the ink compartment in the axis of the [[pen]]. The "smoking pipe" shape was designed to increase the quantity of available ink. In the late Edo era, another design was developed, with the ink box attached to the pen shaft by a chain; the ink box was used as a ''[[netsuke]]'' to fix the ''yatate'' to the belt, while other ''yatate'' are simply put in the belt like a fan.

As only members of the [[samurai]] caste were permitted to carry ''[[katana]]'', some ''yatate'' were designed to be used for self-defense.  Some late ''yatate'' were made of a special [[alloy]] of [[gold]] and [[copper]] called ''[[shakudo]]'', specifically designed to turn purple-black over time, and give the ''yatate'' its [[Patina|finish]].
