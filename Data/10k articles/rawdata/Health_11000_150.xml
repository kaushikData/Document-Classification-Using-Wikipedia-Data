      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15074">'''Advanced oxidation processes''' (abbreviation: '''AOPs'''), in a broad sense, are a set of chemical treatment procedures designed to remove organic (and sometimes inorganic) materials in [[water]] and [[wastewater]] by [[oxidation]] through reactions with [[hydroxyl radicals]] (·OH).&lt;ref name="glaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glaze|first=William|author2=Kang, Joon-Wun|author3= Chapin, Douglas H.|title=The Chemistry of Water Treatment Processes Involving Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide and Ultraviolet Radiation.|journal=Ozone: Science &amp; Engineering |year=1987|volume=9|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1080/01919518708552148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world applications of [[wastewater treatment]], however, this term usually refers more specifically to a subset of such chemical processes that employ [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and/or UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Water Research Institute|title=Treatment Technologies for Removal of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) from Drinking Water: Chapter III Advanced Oxidation Processes|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such type of process is  called [[in situ oxidation|in situ chemical oxidation]].

==Description==
AOPs rely on in-situ production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH). These reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and can virtually oxidize any compound present in the water matrix, often at a diffusion controlled reaction speed. Consequently, ·OH reacts unselectively once formed and contaminants will be quickly and efficiently fragmented and converted into small inorganic molecules. Hydroxyl radicals are produced with the help of one or more primary oxidants (e.g. [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[oxygen]]) and/or energy sources (e.g. [[ultraviolet]] light) or catalysts (e.g. [[titanium dioxide]]). Precise, pre-programmed dosages, sequences and combinations of these reagents are applied in order to obtain a maximum •OH yield. In general, when applied in properly tuned conditions, AOPs can reduce the concentration of contaminants from several-hundreds [[Parts per million|ppm]] to less than 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and therefore significantly bring [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Total organic carbon|TOC]] down, which earned it the credit of “water treatment processes of the 21st century”.&lt;ref name="munter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munter|first=Rein|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes–Current Status and Prospects.|journal=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Chemistry|year=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOP procedure is particularly useful for cleaning biologically toxic or non-degradable materials such as [[aromatics]], [[pesticides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Misra|first=N.N.|title=The contribution of non-thermal and advanced oxidation technologies towards dissipation of pesticide residues|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=2|pages=229–244|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2015.06.005|year=2015|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=schfsehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[petroleum]] constituents, and [[volatile organic compound]]s in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Enric Brillasa |author2=Eva Mur |author3=Roser Sauleda |author4=Laura Sànchez |author5=José Peral |author6=Xavier Domènech |author7=Juan Casado |title=Aniline mineralization by AOP's: anodic oxidation, photocatalysis, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |date=March 1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1016/S0926-3373(97)00059-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TF6-3VN03K2-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d557b71411fdce56af991813ef191bf7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, AOPs can be used to treat effluent of secondary treated wastewater which is then called [[tertiary treatment]].&lt;ref name="audenaert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.T.M.

A goal of the wastewater purification by means of AOP procedures is the reduction of the chemical contaminants and the toxicity to such an extent that the cleaned wastewater may be reintroduced into receiving streams or, at least, into a conventional [[sewage treatment]].

Although oxidation processes involving ·OH have been in use since late 19th century (such as in Fenton reagent, which, however, was an analytical reagent at that time), the utilization of such oxidative species in water treatment did not receive adequate attention until Glaze et al.&lt;ref name="glaze"/&gt;  suggested the possible generation of ·OH “in sufficient quantity to affect water purification” and defined the term “Advanced Oxidation Processes” for the first time in 1987. AOPs still have not been put into commercial use on a large scale (especially in developing countries) even up to today mostly because of the relatively high costs. Nevertheless, its high oxidative capability and efficiency make AOPs a popular technique in tertiary treatment in which the most recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants are to be eliminated. The increasing interest in water reuse and more stringent regulations regarding water pollution are currently accelerating the implementation of AOPs at full-scale.
There are roughly 500 commercialized AOPs installations around the world at present, mostly in [[Europe]] and [[the United States]]. Other countries like [[China]] are showing increasing interests in AOPs.

==Chemical principles==
Generally speaking, chemistry in AOPs could be essentially divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazille |first=Félicien |title=Advanced Oxidation Processes {{!}} SSWM. Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management |url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528100827/http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Formation of ·OH;
# Initial attacks on target molecules by ·OH and their breakdown to fragments;
# Subsequent attacks by ·OH until ultimate [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].
The mechanism of ·OH production (Part 1) highly depends on the sort of AOP technique that is used. For example, ozonation, UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and photocatalytic oxidation rely on different mechanisms of ·OH generation:
*UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="audenaert" /&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → 2·OH ''(homolytic bond cleavage of the O-O bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to formation of 2·OH radicals)''

:HO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;· → ·OH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*Photocatalytic oxidation with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="beltran" /&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(irradiation of the photocatalytic surface leads to an excited [[electron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and electron gap (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)''
:Ti(IV) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(water adsorbs onto the catalyst surface)''
:Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}}  Ti(IV)-·OH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''the highly reactive electron gap will react with water''
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''

Currently there is no consensus on the detailed mechanisms in Part 3, but researchers have cast light on the processes of initial attacks in Part 2. In essence, ·OH is a radical species and should behave like a highly reactive electrophile. Thus two type of initial attacks are supposed to be [[Hydrogen Abstraction]] and [[Addition reaction|Addition]]. The following scheme, adopted from a technical handbook and later refined, describes a possible mechanism of the oxidation of [[benzene]] by ·OH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solarchem Environmental System|title=The UV/Oxidation Handbook|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Mechanism of OH with benzene.png|800px|Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals]]

''Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals''

The first and second steps are electrophilic addition that breaks the aromatic ring in benzene (A) and forms two hydroxyl groups (–OH) in intermediate C. Later an ·OH grabs a hydrogen atom in one of the hydroxyl groups, producing a radical species (D) that is prone to undergo rearrangement to form a more stable radical (E). E, on the other hand, is readily attacked by ·OH and eventually forms 2,4-hexadiene-1,6-dione (F).
As long as there are sufficient ·OH radicals, subsequent attacks on compound F will continue until the fragments are all converted into small and stable molecules like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the end, but such processes may still be subject to a myriad of possible and partially unknown mechanisms.

==Advantages==
AOPs hold several advantages that are unparalleled in the field of water treatment:
*They can effectively eliminate organic compounds in aqueous phase, rather than collecting or transferring pollutants into another phase.
*Due to the remarkable reactivity of ·OH, it virtually reacts with almost every aqueous pollutant without discriminating. AOPs are therefore applicable in many, if not all, scenarios where many organic contaminants must be removed at the same time.
*Some [[heavy metals]] can also be removed in forms of precipitated M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.
*In some AOPs designs, [[disinfection]] can also be achieved, which makes these AOPs an integrated solution to some water quality problems.
*Since the complete reduction product of ·OH is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, AOPs theoretically do not introduce any new hazardous substances into the water.

==Current shortcomings==
It should be realised that AOPs are not perfect and have several drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes|url=http://neopuretech.com/advanced-oxidation-processes/|publisher=Neopure Technologies|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most prominently, the cost of AOPs is fairly high, since a continuous input of expensive chemical reagents is required to maintain the operation of most AOP systems. As a result of their very nature, AOPs require hydroxyl radicals and other reagents proportional to the quantity of contaminants to be removed.
*Some techniques require pre-treatment of wastewater to ensure reliable performance, which could be potentially costly and technically demanding. For instance, presence of [[bicarbonate]] ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can appreciably reduce the concentration of ·OH due to [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging processes]] that yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a much less reactive species, ·CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="munter"/&gt; As a result, bicarbonate must be wiped out from the system or AOPs are compromised.
*It is not cost effective to use solely AOPs to handle a large amount of wastewater; instead, AOPs should be deployed in the final stage after [[primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] have successfully removed a large proportion of contaminants.

==Future ==
Since AOPs were first defined in 1987, the field has witnessed a rapid development both in theory and in application. So far, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, and Fenton, photo-Fenton and Electro-Fenton systems have received extensive scrutiny. However, there are still many research needs on these existing AOPs.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

Recent trends are the development of new, modified AOPs that are efficient and economical. In fact, there has been some studies that offer constructive solutions. For instance, [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with non-metallic elements could possibly enhance the [[photocatalytic]] activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Tracy L|author2=Yates, John T|title=Surface science studies of the photoactivation of TiO2–new photochemical processes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2006|volume=106|issue=10|pages=4428–4453|doi=10.1021/cr050172k|pmid=17031993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementation of ultrasonic treatment could promote the production of hydroxyl radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berberidou|first=C|author2=Poulios I.|author3= Xekoukoulotakis, N.

'''Calvary Wakefield Hospital''' (previously '''Wakefield Hospital''') is a private [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] hospital founded in 1883 in [[Adelaide, Australia]].&lt;ref name="selfabout"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.calvarywakefield.org.au/about.html |title=About Calvary Wakefield Hospital |publisher=Little Company of Mary Health Care |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides [[acute care]] with [[Inpatient#Outpatients and inpatients|inpatient and outpatient]] facilities. It also provides [[dentistry|dental care]] and [[plastic surgery|plastic]] and [[reconstructive surgery]] to patients. It is one of four private hospitals in South Australia under the Calvary name.

Since its 2006 acquisition from [[Ramsay Health Care]], the hospital has been one of the Little Company of Mary (LCM) Health Care providers overseen by the international [[religious institute]] [[Sisters of the Little Company of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/605/166.php |title=Calvary completes Adelaide hospital acquisitions |publisher=Catholic News |date=29 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203204040/http://www.cathnews.com/news/605/166.php |archivedate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its acquisition, the 180-bed hospital was called Wakefield Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cathnews.com/news/603/doc/28lcmb.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203427/http://cathnews.com/news/603/doc/28lcmb.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Adelaide hospitals acquired by LCM Health Care/Calvary Health Care Adelaide |publisher=Catholic News |accessdate=8 December 2008}} &lt;/ref&gt; According to LCM Health Care, it "is the oldest private hospital in South Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcmhealthcare.org.au/servicesmap.php?page=/servicesmappages/wakefield |title=Calvary Wakefield Hospital |publisher=Little Company of Mary Health Care |accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Company of Mary Health Care (Australia) is developing a replacement for Calvary Wakefield Hospital through Commercial &amp; General developers and [[John Holland Group|John Holland]] construction. The new hospital in [[Angas Street, Adelaide]], will be next to the [[South Australia Police]] headquarters, and is due to open in early 2019 with 250+ beds, a 220-space carpark and a 350-space carpark developed by Commercial &amp; General  nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/work-to-start-on-300-million-new-calvary-city-hospital-to-replace-wakefield/news-story/cf7658279c7fe7718978dc1c4cd67b23 Paul Starick, (28 May 2016), Work to start on $300 million new Calvary city hospital to replace Wakefield, ''Sunday Mail'' (SA)].

'''Canine transmissible venereal tumors''' (CTVTs), also called '''transmissible venereal tumors''' (TVTs), '''canine transmissible venereal sarcoma''' (CTVS), '''sticker tumors''' and '''infectious sarcoma''' is a [[histiocytic]] [[tumor]] of [[Canine reproduction#Canine sexual anatomy and development|the external genitalia of the dog]] and other canines, and is transmitted from animal to animal during [[sexual behavior of dogs|mating]]. It is one of only three known [[transmissible cancer]]s in [[mammal]]s; the others are [[devil facial tumor disease]], a cancer which occurs in [[Tasmanian devil]]s, and [[contagious reticulum cell sarcoma]] of the [[Syrian hamster]].

The tumor cells are themselves the infectious agents, and the tumors that form are not genetically related to the host dog.&lt;ref name="livescience" /&gt; Although the genome of a CTVT is derived from a [[canid]] (probably a dog, [[wolf]] or [[coyote]]), it is now essentially living as a unicellular, asexually reproducing (but [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted]]) [[pathogen]].&lt;ref name="rebbeck"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rebbeck CA, Thomas R, Breen M, Leroi AM, Burt A | year=2009 | title=Origins and Evolution of a Transmissible Cancer | journal=Evolution | volume=63 | issue=9 | pages=2340–2349 | url= |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00724.x | pmid=19453727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence analysis of the genome suggests it diverged from canids over 6,000 years ago; possibly much earlier.&lt;ref name="rebbeck" /&gt; The most recent estimates of its time of origin place date it to about 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Strakova2015&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2015.03.005|pmid=25867244|title=The cancer which survived: Insights from the genome of an 11000 year-old cancer|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=30|pages=49–55|year=2015|last1=Strakova|first1=Andrea|last2=Murchison|first2=Elizabeth P}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[most recent common ancestor]] of ''extant'' tumors is more recent: it probably originated 200 to 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Contagious Canine Cancer Spread by Parasites |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-08-10 |url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/060810_dog_cancer.html |accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murgia_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murgia |first=C |author2=[[Jonathan K.

Canine TVTs were initially described by Russian [[veterinarian]] M.A. Novinsky (1841–1914) in 1876, when he demonstrated that the tumor could be transplanted from one dog to another by infecting them with tumor cells.&lt;ref name=Martins_2005&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mello Martins, M.I. |author2=de Souza, F. Ferreira |author3=Gobello, C. |year=2005|title=Canine transmissible venereal tumor: Etiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment|website=Recent Advances in Small Animal Reproduction|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Concannon/gobello2/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Canine transmissible venereal tumors are [[histiocytic]] [[tumor]]s that may be transmitted among dogs through [[canine tying|coitus]], licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an [[allograft]] came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is [[aneuploid]] but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a [[long interspersed nuclear element]] (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and can be used as a diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.&lt;ref name="Murgia_2006" /&gt;

The CTVT cells have fewer [[chromosome]]s than normal cells. Dog cells normally have 78 chromosomes; The cancer cells contain 57–64 chromosomes&lt;ref name=Martins_2005/&gt; that are very different in appearance from normal dog chromosomes.  All dog chromosomes except [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]] are [[acrocentric chromosome|acrocentric]], having a [[centromere]] very near to the end of the chromosome, while many of the CTVT chromosomes are metacentric or submetacentric, having a centromere nearer to the middle.&lt;ref name=Hasler&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasler A, Weber W |title=Theriogenology question of the month. Transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=216 |issue=10 |pages=1557–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10825939}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no evidence that the tumor is caused by a [[virus]] or virus-like organism. The infectious agent of canine transmissible venereal tumor is the cancer cell itself and the tumor is clonal in origin. All tumor cells of this type of cancer share extremely similar genetic code, often if not always unrelated to the [[DNA]] of their host.  Specifically, the [[Retrotransposon#LINEs|LINE-1]] element in the tumor cells is in a different location than in normal canine DNA.&lt;ref name="Murgia_2006" /&gt;  This demonstrates that the tumors do not arise from separate [[cancerous]] transformation in individual animals. Rather, the malignant tumor cells from one dog are transferred to another.&lt;ref name="Murgia_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dingli D, Nowak MA.  Cancer biology: infectious tumour cells. Nature. 2006 Sep 7;443(7107):35–6. B).&lt;/ref&gt;

Canine transmissible venereal tumors are most commonly seen in sexually active dogs  in [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climates.  The disease is spread when dogs mate, and it can even be transmitted to [[Canidae|other canine species]], such as [[fox]]es and coyotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukaratirwa S, Gruys E |title=Canine transmissible venereal tumour: cytogenetic origin, immunophenotype, and immunobiology.

The tumor does not often [[metastasis|metastasize]] (occurring in about less than 5 percent of cases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumor: Introduction |website=The Merck Veterinary Manual |date=2006 |url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/112500.htm |accessdate=2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arif 593–595"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arif|first=Syed Abdul|date=|orig-year=2017|title=Clinco-pathological study on metastatic form of Canine Veneral Tumor (TVT) and its therapeutic management|url=http://www.chemijournal.com/archives/?year=2017&amp;vol=5&amp;issue=3&amp;part=I&amp;ArticleId=576|journal=International Journal of Chemical Studies|volume=5|issue=3|pages=593–595|issn=2349-8528|doi=10.22271/chemi.2017.v5.i3i.08}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in puppies and [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] dogs.  Metastasis occurs to regional [[lymph nodes]],&lt;ref name="Arif 593–595"/&gt; but can also be seen in the [[skin]], [[brain]], [[eye]], [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[testicle]], rectum and [[muscle]].&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogers K, Walker M, Dillon H |title=Transmissible venereal tumor: a retrospective study of 29 cases |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=463–70 |year=1998 |pmid=9826280|doi=10.5326/15473317-34-6-463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[biopsy]] is necessary for diagnosis.

The success of this single cell lineage, believed to be the longest continually propagated cell lineage in the world, can be attributed to the tumor’s mode of transmission in a specific host system. Although direct contact is generally not a highly efficient mode of transfer, CTVTs take advantage of the [[popular sire effect]] of domestic dogs. A single male can produce dozens of litters over his lifetime, allowing the tumor to affect many more females than it could if a monogamous species were the host. Understanding the epidemiology of CTVTs is hoped to provide insights for populations that may experience CTVT exposure and
information about disease prevalence. Canine transmissible venereal tumors are more often found in temperate climates where there are large populations of stray dogs, but little is known about the details of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16901777|year=2006|last1=Vonholdt|first1=B.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Surgical diseases and surgery of the dog (1906) (14784705963).jpg|thumb|Illustration of venereal granulomata on a dog's penis.]]
In male [[dogs]], the tumor affects the [[Dog penis|penis]] and [[foreskin]]. In female dogs, it affects the [[vulva]]. Rarely, the mouth or nose are affected.&lt;ref name=Morrison_1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats|edition=1st|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=978-0-683-06105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tumor often has a [[cauliflower]]-like appearance.  Signs of genital TVT include a discharge from the prepuce and in some cases [[urinary retention]], from blockage of the [[urethra]].&lt;ref name=Hasler/&gt;  Signs of a nasal TVT include nasal [[fistula]]e, [[nosebleed]]s and other nasal discharge, facial [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], and enlargement of the submandibular [[lymph nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Papazoglou L, Koutinas A, Plevraki A, Tontis D |title=Primary intranasal transmissible venereal tumour in the dog: a retrospective study of six spontaneous cases |journal=Journal of Veterinary Medicine A |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=391–400 |year=2001 |pmid=11599677 |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0442.2001.00361.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Surgery may be difficult due to the location of these tumors. Surgery alone often leads to recurrence. [[Chemotherapy]] is very effective for TVTs. The [[prognosis]] for complete [[remission (medicine)|remission]] with chemotherapy is excellent.&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine |edition=4th |publisher=W.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26585">'''Cofactor engineering''', A
 subset of [[metabolic engineering]], is defined as the manipulation of the use of [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in an  organism’s [[metabolic pathways]].  In cofactor engineering, the concentrations of cofactors are changed in order to maximize or minimize metabolic fluxes.  This type of engineering can be used to optimize the production of a [[metabolite]] product or to increase the efficiency of a [[metabolic network]].  The use of engineering single celled organisms to create lucrative chemicals from cheap raw materials is growing, and cofactor engineering can play a crucial role in maximizing production. The field has gained more popularity in the past decade and has several practical applications in chemical manufacturing, bioengineering and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref name=ABE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab|first=Michael|author2=Keith Tyro |author3=Gregory Stephanopoulos |title=Metabolic Engineering|journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology|year=2005|volume=100|issue=763|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/b136411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Cofactor (biochemistry)|Cofactors]] are non-[[protein]] compounds that bind to proteins and are required for the proteins normal [[catalytic]] functionality. Cofactors can be considered “helper molecules” in biological activity, and often affect the functionality of enzymes. Cofactors can be both organic and inorganic compounds.   Some examples of inorganic cofactors are iron or magnesium, and some examples of organic cofactors include [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[coenzyme A]]. Organic cofactors are more specifically known as [[coenzymes]], and many enzymes require the addition of coenzymes to assume normal catalytic function in a metabolic reaction.  The coenzymes bind to the active site of an enzyme to promote catalysis.  By engineering cofactors and coenzymes, a naturally occurring metabolic reaction can be manipulated to optimize the output of a metabolic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollak|first=N|author2=C Dolle |author3=M Ziegler |title=The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides - small molecules with a multitude of functions|pmid=17295611|pmc=1798440|doi=10.1042/BJ20061638|journal=Biochemistry|year=2006|issue=2|pages=205–218|volume=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heux&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heux|first=Stephanie|author2=Remy Cachon |author3=Sylvie Dequin |title=Cofactor engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Expression of a H2O-forming NADH oxidase and impact on redox metabolism|journal=Metabolic Engineering|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=303–314|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2005.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vadali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vadali|first=Ravishankar|author2=George Bennett|title=Cofactor engineering of intracellular CoA/acetyl-CoA and its effect on metabolic flux redistribution in Escherichia coli|journal=Metabolic Engineering|date=April 2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2004.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cofactors were discovered   by [[Arthur Harden]] and [[William John Young|William Young]] in 1906, when they found that the rate of [[alcoholic fermentation]] in  unboiled [[yeast]] extracts increased when boiled yeast extract was added.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Harden and William John Young. "The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast-Juice". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character,'' Vol. 77, No. 519 (Apr. 12, 1906), pp. 405-420 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/80032  JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years after, [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]] identified the cofactor in the boiled extract as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.   Other cofactors, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and coenzyme A, were discovered later in the 1900s. The mechanism of [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] activity was discovered when, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] determined in 1936 that [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; functioned as an [[electron acceptor]]. Well after these initial discoveries, scientists began to realize that the manipulation of  cofactor concentrations could be used as tools for the improvement of [[metabolic pathways]].&lt;ref name=ABE /&gt;

An important group of organic [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] is the family of [[molecules]] referred to as [[vitamins]]. [[Vitamin B12]] (cobalamin), for example, plays a crucial role in the human body, while [[coenzyme B12]], its derivative, is found in the [[metabolism]]s of every type of cell in our bodies. Its presence affects the synthesis and regulation of cellular [[DNA]] as well as taking part in [[fatty acid synthesis]] and energy production.  Cofactors are required by many important [[metabolic pathways]], and it is possible for the concentrations of a single type of cofactor to affect the fluxes of many different pathways .

[[Minerals]] and metallic ions that organisms uptake through their diet provide prime examples of [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] cofactors. For instance Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is needed to assist the [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase]] as it converts [[carbon dioxide]] and water to [[bicarbonate]] and protons. A widely recognized mineral that acts as a cofactor is iron, which is essential for the proper function of [[hemoglobin]], the oxygen transporting protein found in [[red blood cells]].  This example in particular highlights the importance of cofactors in animal [[metabolism]].

==Significance==
Cofactor engineering is significant in the manipulation of [[metabolic pathways]]. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that occur in an organism. [[Metabolic engineering]] is the subject of altering the fluxes within a metabolic pathway.  In metabolic engineering, a metabolic pathway can be directly altered by changing the functionality of the [[enzymes]] involved in the pathway. Cofactor engineering, offers a distinct approach, and some advantages, to altering a metabolic pathway. Instead of changing the enzymes used in a pathway, the cofactors can be changed. This may give metabolic engineers an advantage due to certain properties of cofactors and how they can be modified.

Metabolic pathways can be used by metabolic engineers to create a desired product. By modifying the types of cofactors used and the times at which they are used, the outcome of the metabolic network can change. To create a greater production of a product, metabolic engineers have the ability to supply the network with whichever cofactor is best suited for that specific process. This leads to the optimization of networks to give a higher production of desired products. Also, changing the cofactors used in a network may be an ingenious solution to a complicated problem.  A network that is present in the cell, but is often unused, may have a desirable product.  Instead of engineering a completely new set of pathways to produce the product, cofactor engineering can be applied.  By replacing enzymes to use cofactors readily available in a cell, the typically unused network is no longer cofactor-limited, and production may be increased.

In addition to modifying the yield of metabolic networks, changing the cofactors used in a network can reduce operation costs when trying to form a desired product. NADH and NADPH are two extremely common cellular cofactors, differing only by the presence of a phosphate group. However, this phosphate group makes NADPH much less stable than NADH, and therefore more expensive to synthesize. Thus, it is advantageous to try and use NADH is some cellular networks because it is often cheaper, more readily available, and accomplishes the same task as NADPH.

== Tools and processes ==
Cofactor engineering most often deals with the manipulation of [[microorganisms]] such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and as such requires the use of [[recombinant DNA]] techniques.  These techniques utilize small circular segments of [[DNA]] called [[plasmids]], which can be introduced and incorporated by microorganisms such as ''Escherichia coli''.  These plasmids are specifically designed in labs to  be easily incorporated, and affect the expression of various [[protein]], [[metabolites]] and [[enzymes]].  For instance, a particular plasmid may cause a change in an enzyme's [[amino acid]] sequence, which could increase its affinity for a particular [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].

Microorganisms require a medium to grow in, and one commonly used for cultures of ''Escherichia coli'' is Luria-Bertani (LB) broth.  This medium is often supplemented with [[glucose]] and will often contain additional [[molecules]] designed to facilitate optimal culture growth.  Pre-cultures may then be grown in shake flasks.  These are simply plugged [[Erlenmeyer flasks]] which are left on an orbital shaker machine, which revolves at very high [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]. This process aerates the culture, which is necessary for optimal growth.  Once the pre-cultures are ready, the plasmids needed by specific experiments are added to each culture separately, and then each culture is transferred to a bio-reactor.  Bio-reactors are systems which allow cultures to grow in a controlled environment. This leaves the introduced plasmids as the only independent variable. The required temperature, [[pH]], metabolite concentrations, and various other environmental factors can be maintained by the bio-reactor ensuring identical growth conditions for each culture.

Once samples are allowed to grow in the reactor for a specified period, they can be removed and studied to determine whether the intended alterations to the organism are evident.  Since cofactor engineering most often deals with [[metabolic pathways]], these organisms are often studied but introducing specific tagged [[fluorescent]] [[metabolites]] and documenting their progression through various pathways.  In other cases results are more obvious and easily observable, such as with the decreased [[ethanol]] production of [[yeast]] referred to below.

==Applications==

===Changing an Enzyme's Cofactor From NADPH to NADH===
[[Biocatalysts]] are required for the production of [[chiral]] building blocks needed in pharmaceuticals and other chemicals used by society. Many such biocatalysts require [[NADPH]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]. NADPH, a cofactor quite similar to NADH, is both more expensive and less stable than its counterpart [[NADH]]. For these reasons, manufacturers would prefer that the biocatalysts they use in their production lines accept NADH over NADPH. Cofactor engineering has recently been successful in altering enzymes to prefer NADH as a cofactor instead of NADPH. In 2010, a group of scientists performed cofactor engineering on the [[enzyme]] Gre2p, an NADPH-preferring [[dehydrogenase]] found in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. Gre2p reduces the compound diketone 2,5-hexanedione into the chiral building blocks (5S)-hydroxy-2-hexanone and (2S,5S)-hexanediol. The scientists determined that Asn9 ([[Asparagine]], position 9) was an important [[amino acid]] the active site of Gre2p. Specifically, Asn9 binds to the 3’-hydroxyl group and the 2’-oxygen atom of adenyl ribose [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]]. Through direct [[mutagenesis]], the scientists exchanged the Asn9 for both Asp ([[Aspartic Acid]]) and Glu ([[Glutamic Acid]]). This change caused Gre2p to have a decreased dependency on NADPH, and an increased affinity for NADH.  This resulted in increased Gre2p activity when using NADH. It was observed that substituting Asn9 with Glu produced a greater effect than changing Asn9 to Asp.  Asn contains a polar uncharged side chain, while both Asp and Glu contain a polar charged side chain. The increased effect of Glu is caused by the extra carbon in its side chain that brings it closer to adenyl ribose moiety. This allows for stronger [[hydrogen bonding]] between the 2’- and 3’- ribose [[hydroxyl]] groups and the side chain [[carboxyl]] group. The maximum velocity of the reaction doubled, while using NADH, when Asn9 was substituted with Glu. With these results, the scientists successfully engineered Gre2p to prefer NADH over NADPH and increased the speed of 2,5-hexanedione reduction. This will allow chemical companies to decrease their manufacturing costs by using NADH instead of NADPH at least for this particular reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katzberg|first=Michael |author2=Nadia Skorupa-Parachin |author3=Marie-Francoise Gorwa-Grauslund |author4=Martin Bertau|title=Engineering Cofactor Preference of Ketone Reducing Biocatalysts: A Mutagenesis Study on a γ-Diketone Reductase from the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|year=2010|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1735–1758|doi=10.3390/ijms11041735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing a Network's Cofactor Preference===
An alternative example of changing an enzyme’s preference for cofactors is to change NADH dependent reaction to NADPH dependent reactions. In this example, the enzymes themselves are not changed, but instead different enzymes are selected that accomplish the same reaction with the use of a different cofactor. An engineered pathway was created to make [[1-butanol]] from [[Acetyl-CoA]] by changing enzymes in the metabolic pathway of [[Synechococcus|S. elongatus]]. The [[Clostridium]] genus is known to produce 1-butanol, providing a pathway that could be inserted in S. elongatus. This pathway synthesizes 1-butanol using the reverse β-oxidation pathway. The enzymes involved in this newly engineered pathway were NADH specific, which was problematic for replicating the pathway in S. elongatus as cyanobacteria produce much more NADPH than NADH.

The research group then identified enzymes that utilize NADPH or both NADPH and NADH by [[bioprospecting]]. Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) was found to be a suitable replacement for hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (Hbd). To replace AdhE2, the researchers found that NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (YqhD) from E. coli to be effective for the pathway. Furthermore, the researchers needed a dehydrogenase to replace the aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity of AdhE2. CoA-acylating butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (Bldh) from C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was found to be a good suit. Together, PhaB, Bldh, YqhD can replace Hbd and AdhE2, respectively, to change the cofactor preference of 3-ketobutyryl-CoA reduction from using NADH to using NADPH. The authors then constructed various combinations of the different enzymes (of those found in the reverse oxidation pathway and the NADPH utilizing enzymes) by overexpressing different genes in cultures of S. elongatus PCC 7942. In order to do so, they constructed [[plasmids]] containing the genes corresponding to the enzymes and combined them into the genome of S. elongates. After enzyme assays, the strain of cyanobacteria expressing the NADPH utilizing enzymes produced the greatest amount of 1-butanol (29.9&amp;nbsp;mg/L), exceeding that of strains that did not consist of the NADPH utilizing enzymes by four times. Overall, 1-butanol was produced in S. elongatus using a pathway from another organism. This pathway was modified in order to match the preferred reducing cofactor for the cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Drives Direct Photosynthetic Production of 1-butanol in Cyanobacteria|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/6018.short|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=11 December 2012|author=Ethan Lan|author2=James Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying Metabolite Flux with Cofactor Equilibrium===
In cofactor engineering, a metabolic pathway is altered by changing the concentrations of specific cofactors that are produced either in that particular pathway or in a separate pathway. For example, an hypothetical organism could have two arbitrary pathways called A and B where some enzymes in both A and B utilize the same cofactors.  If scientists wanted to decrease the output of pathway A, they may first consider directly engineering the enzymes involved in A, perhaps to decrease a particular [[Active site|active site's]] affinity for its [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].  In some cases however, the enzymes in A may be difficult to engineer for various reasons, or it may be impossible to engineer them without dangerously affecting some third metabolic pathway C, which utilizes the same enzymes.  As a separate option, scientists could increase the flux of B, which may be easier to engineer.  This in turn could "tie up" the cofactors needed by A, which would slow [[enzymatic activity]], decreasing output in A. This is one hypothetical example of how cofactor engineering can be used, but there are many other unique cases where scientists use cofactors as a way of altering metabolic pathways. A major advantage to cofactor engineering is that scientists can use it to successfully alter metabolic pathways that are difficult to engineer by means of ordinary metabolic engineering.  This is achieved by targeting more easily engineered enzymes in separate pathways, which use the same cofactors.  Since many cofactors are used by different enzymes in multiple pathways, cofactor engineering may be an efficient, cost effective alternative to current methods of metabolic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San|first=Ka-Yiu |author2=George N.

{{See also|Yeast in winemaking}}
[[Yeast]] are commonly used in the beer and wine industry because they are capable of efficiently producing [[ethanol]] through the [[metabolic pathway]] [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in the absence of oxygen.  Fermentation requires the enzyme [[glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (GPDH) which depends on the cofactor [[NADH]].  This pathway involves the conversion of [[glucose]] to both ethanol and [[glycerol]], both of which use NADH as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].  Scientists engineered ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' to overproduce GPDH, which shifted the cells [[metabolic flux]] away from ethanol and toward glycerol, by limiting NADH availability in the ethanol production portion of the pathway.  The opposite effect was achieved by influencing a separate pathway in the cell, the [[Glutamate]] Synthesis pathway.   Inactivating the expression of the enzyme [[glutamate dehydrogenase]], which is [[NADPH]] dependent, and over expressing the enzymes [[glutamine synthetase]] and [[glutamate synthetase]], which rely on NADH as a cofactor shifted the cofactor balance in glutamate synthesis pathway. The pathway is now dependent on NADH rather than NADPH, which decreases NADH availability in the fermentation pathway.  This in turn causes increased ethanol production and decreased [[glycerol]] production. This method of manipulating [[metabolic flux]]es could be visualized much like global fuel markets, where the increased production of ethanol for use in the automotive industry would decrease its availability in the food industry.  Essentially, producing more engines which run on ethanol could result in decreased consumption of processed sweets, which contain [[high fructose corn syrup]].  This engineering of cofactors is applicable to the beer and wine industry since it allows for the  regulation of ethanol levels in alcoholic beverages. Advancements in the wine industry have caused a steady increase in ethanol content, so winemakers in particular would be interested in the possibility of reducing the ethanol levels of some of their wines.&lt;ref name=Heux/&gt;

===Citric acid cycle===
[[Coenzyme A]] (CoA) and [[acetyl-CoA]] are two intermediate [[metabolites]], most notably found in the [[Citric Acid Cycle]], which participate in over 100 different reactions in the [[metabolism]] of microorganisms.   Recent experiments have shown that over expression of the [[enzyme]] [[pantothenate kinase]] and supplementation of [[pantothenic acid]] in the CoA biosynthesis pathway have allowed adjustments of both CoA and acetyl-CoA fluxes. This increased concentration of cofactors resulted in an increased carbon flux in the [[isoamyl acetate]] synthesis pathway, increase the production efficiency of isoamyl acetate. Isoamyl acetate is used industrially for artificial flavoring and for testing the effectiveness of [[respirators]]. In addition to the production of isoamyl acetate, the manipulation of CoA biosynthesis during the [[pyruvate]] [[hydrogenase]] reaction also causes an increase in the production of both [[succinate]] and [[lycopene]], each of which have beneficial effects on the human body. An increase in succinate concentration, which is used as a [[catalyst]], may lead to an increase in the speed of the Citric Acid Cycle, and consequently  an individual's [[metabolism]].  Increasing lycopene concentrations, has been shown to decrease the risk of [[prostate cancer]].  The potential rewards of repeating such feat of cofactor engineering and successfully incorporating them into industry practices are innumerable.&lt;ref name=Vadali/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giovannucci|first=Edward|author2=Alberto Ascherio |author3=Eric Rimm |author4=Meir Stampfer |author5=Graham Colditz |author6=Walter Willett |title=Intake of Carotenoids and Retino in Relation to Risk of Prostate Cancer|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|date=May 1995|volume=87|issue=23|pages=1767–1776|doi=10.1093/jnci/87.23.1767 |pmid=7473833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potera|first=Carol|title=Making Succinate More Successful|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=December 2005|issue=12|pages=A832-A835|doi=10.1289/ehp.113-a832|volume=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper manufacturing===
Many important [[industrial enzymes]] use cofactors to catalyze reactions. By using cofactors to manipulate [[metabolic pathways]], it is possible to reduce material cost, eliminate steps in production, reduce production time, decrease pollution, and increase overall production efficiency.  One case that demonstrates several of these manufacturing benefits involves the genetic engineering of [[aspen]] trees. In the paper production process, manufacturing plants must break down [[lignin]], a biochemical compound that gives a tree trunk its stiffness, in order to form the pulp used throughout the rest of production. The chemical pulping process requires the manufacturing plant to use a significant amount of energy, as well as many expensive and toxic chemicals.  A group of genetic engineers, through '''cofactor engineering''', engineered a genetically superior [[aspen]] tree that produced less lignin. These genetically engineered trees have allowed for paper mills to reduce their costs, pollution, and manufacturing time.&lt;ref name=ABE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Laszlo|author2=Ilona Peszlen |author3=Perry Peralta |author4=Bohumil Kasal |author5=Laigeng Li |title=Mechanical Properties of Genetically Engineered Young Aspen with Modified Lignin Content and/or Structure|journal=Wood and Fiber Science|year=2010|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These services consider those with a variety of hearing levels and experiences with deafness focusing on their [[psychological well-being]]. The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has identified that specialized services and knowledge of the Deaf increases successful mental health services to this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nad.org/issues/health-care/mental-health-services | title=Mental Health Services| date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/mental-health-developmental-disabilities-and-substance-abuse/deaf-and-hard-hearing-mental|title=NCDHHS: Deaf and Hard of Hearing Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services|website=www.ncdhhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina, and Alabama have specialized Deaf mental health services.

There are multiple [[models of deafness]]; Deaf mental health focuses on a cultural model in that people who are deaf view themselves as part of a socio-cultural linguistic community, rather than people with a medical deficit or disability. Accordingly, providing deaf mental heath care to people of the Deaf community requires services from clinicians, doctors, and interpreters who are trained with this perspective and the inclusion of deaf professionals in this system of health care. 

==Deaf children language development==
Early access to language in deaf children is important for normal development of language. Deprivation of language can negatively affect mental health and in severe cases can cause mental health syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|last2=Levin|first2=Leonard L.|last3=Anderson|first3=Melissa L.|date=2017|title=Language Deprivation Syndrome: A Possible Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Sociocultural Origins|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5469702/|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|volume=52|issue=6|pages=761–776|doi=10.1007/s00127-017-1351-7|issn=0933-7954|pmc=5469702|pmid=28204923|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to auditory and visual language is important, and availability differs based on each child's abilities.

Many states have deaf schools and institutions that provide appropriate language models along with mental health services for their students and those in the surrounding Deaf communities. The [[Lexington School for the Deaf]] in [[Queens, New York]] provides a variety of educational and social services for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexnyc.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=350012&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=759819|title=Mission Statements &amp; Basic Tenets – About Us – Lexington School &amp; Center for the Deaf|website=www.lexnyc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas School for the Deaf]] in Austin, Texas also provides a focus on mental health for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://texasdeafed.org/topics/mental-health-for-deaf-youth|title=Texas Initiative for Mental Health for Deaf Youth {{!}} Crossroads|website=texasdeafed.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf children in mainstream schools may be more neglected in the classroom than their hearing peers. It is also more common for deaf children to have a harder time making friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunes|first=Terezinha|last2=Pretzlik|first2=Ursula|last3=Olsson|first3=Jenny|date=2001|title=Deaf children's social relationships in mainstream schools|url=|journal=Deafness &amp; Education International|volume=3|issue=3|pages=123–136|doi=10.1179/146431501790560972|issn=1464-3154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can occur frequently among children who are deaf or hard of hearing, which can lead to negative mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akram|first=B|last2=Nawaz|first2=J|last3=Rafi|first3=J|last4=Akram|first4=A|date=2018|title=Social exclusion, mental health and suicidal ideation among adults with hearing loss: protective and risk factors|url=http://www.jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/8601.pdf|journal=Development|volume=2|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and access==
For a deaf person, obtaining access to proper medical treatment is challenging and they face a variety of obstacles in communication and access. This can include the way in which medical professionals initiate patient's various health exams without prior modification suitable for deaf individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-17|title=Mental health of deaf people|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673611611434|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=379|issue=9820|pages=1037–1044|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61143-4|pmid=22423884|issn=0140-6736|last1=Fellinger|first1=Johannes|last2=Holzinger|first2=Daniel|last3=Pollard|first3=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication challenges and lack of doctor awareness of the culture and language of the deaf can lead deaf patients to avoid making medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=90f07d82-8f9d-472a-9f7b-99a4de8ee092@sdc-v-sessmgr06|title=Primary care for deaf people with mental health problems|last=Levine|first=Jack|date=May 8, 2014|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the amount of professionals who are trained in [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and have experience with [[Deaf culture]] increase positive mental health outcomes for deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=d2f28c89-6f6a-4fbb-aabb-9f6ae4875e4c@sessionmgr4008|title=Mental Health Services for People Who Are Deaf|last=Vernon|first=McCay|last2=Leigh|first2=Irene|date=2007|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=d2f28c89-6f6a-4fbb-aabb-9f6ae4875e4c@sessionmgr4008|title=Individuals with Hearing Loss in Arkansas and Mental Health Service: Evaluating Accessibility.|last=Pettis|first=Christy Linn|date=2014|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and deafness==
Age-related hearing loss gradually occurs in many people as they get older, typically affecting those over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss|title=Age-Related Hearing Loss|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of hearing loss can lead to feelings of embarrassment and isolation due to the fact that those affected may no longer be able to hear family, friends, or simple everyday sounds. Those with hearing loss are less likely to want to engage in social activities due to frustration over not being able to hear. A study conducted by the National Council of Aging (NCOA) showed that a large portion of elders with hearing loss who were studied, reported symptoms of lasting depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/52532-How-hearing-loss-can-impact-mental-health#about-author-lisa-packer|title=How hearing loss can impact mental health|date=2015-09-17|work=Healthy Hearing|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of exclusion from social and employment opportunities due to higher rates of miscommunication, making deaf adults more susceptible to mental illnesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Studies have found that when a person becomes deaf at an older age, it has a less extreme impact on their mental health than it does when hearing loss begins at an earlier age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tambs|first=Kristian|date=September-October 2004|title=Moderate Effects of Hearing Loss on Mental Health and Subjective Well-Being: Results From the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study|url=|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=66|issue=5|pages=776–782|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those who were either born deaf or lost their hearing at a younger age and then age as a deaf person face some particularly difficult challenges. When a non-deaf person ages, isolationist tendencies are generally increased. This increase is even more drastic for deaf people. Furthermore, many technological advancements that are heavily dependent on auditory communication also present challenges to deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Sherry|last2=Roberson|first2=Len|date=October 2013|title=Social Connectedness of Deaf Retirees|url=|journal=Educational Gerontology|volume=39|pages=750–760|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge of professionals==
The type and onset of deafness may cause different types of language disfluencies, diagnoses, and treatments of clients who are deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crump|first=Charlene|last2=Hamerdinger|first2=Stephen|date=2017|title=Understanding Etiology of Hearing Loss as a Contributor to Language Dysfluency and its Impact on Assessment and Treatment of People who are Deaf in Mental Health Settings|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|volume=53|issue=8|pages=922–928|doi=10.1007/s10597-017-0120-0|pmid=28229314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural knowledge, language skills (e.g., fluency in ASL or access to trained interpreters), and other social-cultural factors are part of the deaf mental health access model. Lack of knowledge about Deaf culture and sign language among mental health professionals can make it difficult for deaf people to access appropriate services.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

==ASL interpreting and training for mental health==
[[File:Sign language interpreter.jpg|thumb|Sign language interpreter]]
The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has eight recommendations for qualifications of interpreters working in mental health settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nad.org/issues/health-care/mental-health-services/position-statement-mental-health-interpreting-services-peo | title=Position Statement on Mental Health Interpreting Services with People who are Deaf| date=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Fluency in American Sign Language
# Fluency in English and register choices
# Culturally competent
# Attending a comprehensive training curriculum for mental health interpreting
# Mentoring with experienced mental health interpreters (at least 50 hours)
# Individual or group supervision and peer consultation
# High standards of ethical practice
# Knowledge of relevant ethical literature or decision-making models in interpreting

Specific knowledge and training in mental health contexts is necessary for adequate sign language interpreting for mental health clients. Accordingly, the State of Alabama requires "Certification of mental health interpreters for persons who are deaf" for interpreters to work in mental health contexts, and this certification must be renewed yearly by either: a) working 40 hours in clinical settings; b) attending 40 hours of training; or c) a combination of work in clinical settings and training equaling 40 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.neo.registeredsite.com/2/1/4/12973412/assets/580-3-24.pdf|title=Chapter 580-3-24 Certification of Mental Health Interpreters for Persons who are Deaf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide the opportunity for education and training, the Alabama Department of Mental Health's Office of Deaf Services established the Alabama's Mental Health Interpreter Training Project.

With 23,075 votes, Jones finished in a strong third place in the primary.&lt;ref name="TXRepPrimSOS"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 30, 2012 |url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Texas]] |accessdate=January 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republican primary, Wentworth spent $727,568. Campbell spent about $175,000. And Jones, who had the backing of Texans for Lawsuit Reform’s political action committee, spent $1,754,310.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Reeve.

[[File:Единая медицинская информационно-аналитическая система.JPG|thumb|right|260px|EMIAS terminals]]
United Medical Information and Analytical System of Moscow ("EMIAS") is a complex information system that automatises the booking of hospital visits and work of medical professionals in Moscow city. The system includes online appointment services, [[Electronic Health Record]]  management, and [[Electronic prescribing]]  based on "Cloud" technology. EMIAS is the digital system designed to increase the quality and access of medical services in public health clinics. The project was designed and is being implemented as part of the «Digital city» program in execution with the Moscow Government's order from April 7, 2014 (as Moscow government amended on 21.05.2013 № 22-PP).

==Aims==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Moscow.svg|120px|thumb|left|upright|Government of Moscow]] 
The main goal of EMIAS is to make free medical services more available, superior, and convenient for citizens. This is accomplished by making medical information more accessible to medical professionals thereby saving valuable time on paperwork, scheduling, and in gathering medical information. EMIAS offers the leaders of medical institutions and the leaders within the medical sector, a smart and authentic analysis tool that will result in the effective management of Moscow's health care systems.

== General information ==
The project is developed and being implemented as part of “Digital city” program by Moscow IT department. As of October 1, 2013, 557 public health facilities including female counselling centers and dental clinics got involved in EMIAS. Furthermore, EMIAS is organizing and uniting information between outpatient and inpatient facilities.

EMIAS is one of the biggest electronic medical systems in Europe involving over &lt;big&gt;600&lt;/big&gt; medical institutions and &lt;big&gt;23 000&lt;/big&gt; medical workers. About &lt;big&gt;7.7 million&lt;/big&gt; people are currently using the system and over &lt;big&gt;114 000 000&lt;/big&gt; transactions have been made within the &lt;big&gt;first&lt;/big&gt; year of the system’s launch.

The system allows managing flows of patients, contains outpatient card integrated in the system, and provides an opportunity to manage consolidated managerial accounting and personalized list of medical help. Besides that, the system contains information about availability of the medical institutions and various doctors. EMIAS allows managing medical registers to resolve medical organizing questions concerning different categories of people, having specific diseases.

EMIAS is being implemented in three steps. The first step is switching the registration process to be completely electronic at public clinics and hospitals. This will allow people to schedule a visit to a doctor remotely. The second step of implementation is creating medical records and using electronic prescriptions for each patient which will be consolidated and shared throughout the public medical sector. The third step will be in uniting the public medical sector with the private medical sector through the sharing of medical records and the introduction of EMIAS services.

'''Edith Hinkley Quimby''' (July 10, 1891 – October 11, 1982) was an American medical researcher and physicist, best known as one of the founders of [[nuclear medicine]]. Her work involved developing diagnostic and therapeutic applications of [[X-ray]]s. One of her main concerns was protecting both those handling the radioactive material and making sure that those being treated were given the lowest dose necessary.

== Early life and education ==
She was born on July 10, 1891 in [[Rockford, Illinois]]. In 1912, she graduated from [[Whitman College]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. After a brief stint teaching [[high school]] in Nyssa, Oregon, she was awarded a 1914 fellowship for her [[master's degree]] studies at the [[University of California]] which she earned in 1916. {{sfn|Yount|1999|pp=177-178}}

== Career and legacy ==
In 1919 she moved to [[New York City]], where she took a job at the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases]] as assistant physicist to [[Gioacchino Failla]], which was very rare for a woman in her time; she became an associate physicist there in 1932.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/obituaries/edith-quimby-dies-radiation-expert.html|title=EDITH QUIMBY DIES; RADIATION EXPERT|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1982-10-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her working relationship with Failla continued for another forty years. In 1919 she joined the [[Center for Radiological Research]], remaining at Columbia's medical school until 1978. Her research at Memorial Hospital delved into safe doses of medicinal radiation, observing the energy emitted by potential materials for [[nuclear medicine]] as well as the amount of radiation absorbed by the body from different sources. She also studied the potential of synthesised radioactive materials for treating cancer and in other medical research applications.

In 1941 she joined the faculty of [[Cornell University Medical College]] as an [[assistant professor]] of [[radiology]]. The next year, she became an associate professor of [[radiation physics]] at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at In [[Columbia University]]. She was promoted to [[full professor]] in 1954 and retired in 1960.{{sfn|Yount|1999|pp=177-178}}

Quimby received many awards for her work throughout her career and participated in several scientific societies. In 1940, she was the first women to received the [[Henry Harrington Janeway#The Janeway Medal and Lectures|Janeway Meda]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l from [[American Radium Society]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following year, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Radiological Society of North America]], for work which "placed every radiologist in her debt.". She was elected president of the [[American Radium Society]] in 1954. In 1963, the [[American College of Radiology]] honoured her with its Gold Medal. She was one of the first members of the [[American Association of Physicists in Medicine]].{{sfn|Yount|1999|pp=177-178}}

== Research ==
In 1962 she released a paper titled 'Late Radiation Effects in Roentgen Therapy for Hyperthyroidism' where she suggested ceasing all Roentgen therapy ([[Radiation therapy|Radiation Therapy]]) until we had a better idea of how this kind of treatment affected patients in the long term.

== Personal life ==
She was one of three children of Arthur S. Hinkley, a farmer and architect, and Harriet Hinkley, She married [[Shirley Leon Quimby]], in 1915.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''efficiency of conversion of ingested food to unit of body substance''' (ECI, also termed "growth efficiency") is an index measure of food fuel efficiency in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Aryal |first=Achyut |last2=Guan |first2=Li-Ching |last3=Xu |first3=Wei |title=Influences of secondary metabolites on the performance of lepidopterous larvae |publisher=Forestry Nepal |date=2008-09-20 |url=http://www.forestrynepal.org/images/Creatonotos_transiens.pdf |accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECI is a rough scale of how much of the food [[ingestion|ingested]] is converted into growth in the animal's [[mass]]. It can be used to compare the growth efficiency as measured by the weight gain of different animals from consuming a given quantity of food relative to its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1810336,00.html |last=Peterson |first= Mark |periodical=TIME |title=Eating Bugs |publication-date= 2008-05-29 |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECI effectively represents efficiencies of both [[digestion]] (approximate digestibility or AD) and [[metabolism|metabolic efficiency]], or how well digested food is converted to mass (efficiency of conversion of digested food or ECD). The formula for the efficiency of food fuel is thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hollowtop.com/finl_html/conversion.htm |last=Lindroth |first= Richard L. |periodical=The Food Insects Newsletter |volume= 6, No. 1 |title=Insect Food Conversion Efficiencies |publication-date= March 1993 |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ECI=AD \times ECD\!&lt;/math&gt;

These concepts are also very closely related to the [[feed conversion ratio]] (FCR) and feed efficiency.

Worldwide, two to three million people are estimated to be permanently disabled because of [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name="WHO_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=WHO|title=Leprosy disabilities: magnitude of the problem |journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record |volume=70 |issue=38 |pages=269–75 |year=1995 |pmid=7577430}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has the greatest number of cases, with [[Brazil]] second and [[Indonesia]] third.

In 1999, the world [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Hansen's disease was estimated to be 640,000. In 2000, 738,284 cases were identified.&lt;ref name=Hawaii&gt;{{cite news |title=Last Days Of A Leper Colony |newspaper=CBC News |date=March 22, 2003 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/22/health/main545392.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) listed 91 countries in which Hansen's disease is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]. India, [[Myanmar]] and [[Nepal]] contained 70% of cases. India reports over 50% of the world's leprosy cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surgery grants for leprosy sufferers in India |newspaper=Times of India |date=February 2, 2009 |url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/surgery-grants-for-leprosy-sufferers-in-india}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 763,917 new cases were detected worldwide, and in that year the WHO listed [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Nepal]] as having 90% of Hansen's disease cases.

According to recent figures from the WHO, new cases detected worldwide have decreased by approximately 107,000 cases (or 21%) from 2003 to 2004. This decreasing trend has been consistent for the past three years. In addition, the global registered prevalence of HD was 286,063 cases; 407,791 new cases were detected during 2004.

In the United States, Hansen's disease is tracked by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), with a total of 92 cases being reported in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/leprosy_ti.html CDC Leprosy Fact Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, pockets of high prevalence continue in certain areas such as [[Brazil]], [[South Asia]] (India, [[Nepal]]), some parts of Africa ([[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]]) and the western Pacific.

== Risk groups ==
At highest risk are those living in endemic areas with poor conditions such as inadequate bedding, contaminated water and insufficient diet, or other diseases (such as [[HIV]]) that compromise immune function. Recent research suggests that there is a defect in cell-mediated immunity that causes susceptibility to the disease. Less than ten percent of the world's population is actually capable of acquiring the disease.&lt;ref name="What is Leprosy"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Leprosy? |publisher=The Leprosy Mission Canada |url=http://www.leprosy.ca/Page.aspx?pid=245 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215045130/http://www.leprosy.ca/Page.aspx?pid=245 |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region of [[DNA]] responsible for this variability is also involved in [[Parkinson disease]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} giving rise to current speculation that the two disorders may be linked in some way at the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level. In addition, men are twice as likely to contract leprosy as women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} According to The Leprosy Mission Canada, most people—about 95% of the population—are naturally immune.&lt;ref name="What is Leprosy"/&gt;

== Disease burden ==
Although annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]—the number of new leprosy cases occurring each year—is important as a measure of transmission, it is difficult to measure in leprosy due to its long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after onset of the disease and the lack of laboratory tools to detect leprosy in its very early stages. Instead, the registered [[prevalence]] is used. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden as it reflects the number of active leprosy cases diagnosed with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.&lt;ref name=WHO_1985&gt;{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization.|title=Epidemiology of leprosy in relation to control. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser |volume=716 |pages=1–60 |year=1985 |pmid=3925646 |isbn= 978-92-4-120716-4 |location= Geneva |oclc= 12095109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New case detection is another indicator of the disease that is usually reported by countries on an annual basis. It includes cases diagnosed with onset of disease in the year in question (true incidence) and a large proportion of cases with onset in previous years (termed a backlog prevalence of undetected cases).

Endemic countries also report the number of new cases with established disabilities at the time of detection, as an indicator of the backlog prevalence. Determination of the time of onset of the disease is generally unreliable, is very labor-intensive and is seldom done in recording these statistics.

As reported to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by 115 countries and territories in 2006, and published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record, the global registered [[prevalence]] of leprosy at the beginning of the year was 219,826 cases.&lt;ref name=WHO_2006&gt;{{cite journal | title = Global leprosy situation, 2006 | journal = Weekly Epidemiological Record |date=August 2006 | volume = 81 | pages =309–16  |pmid=16903018 | url=http://www.who.int/lep/resources/wer8132.pdf|format=PDF | issue = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; New-case detection during the previous year (2005 - the last year for which full country information is available) was 296,499. The reason for the annual detections being higher than the prevalence at the end of the year can be explained by the fact that a proportion of new cases complete their treatment within the year and, therefore, no longer remain on the registers. The global detection of new cases continues to show a sharp decline, falling by 110,000 cases (27%) during 2005 compared with the previous year.

[[#tableWorldwide|Table 1]] shows that global annual detection has been declining since 2001. The African region reported an 8.7% decline in the number of new cases compared with 2004. The comparable figure for the Americas was 20.1%, for South-East Asia 32%, and for the Eastern Mediterranean 7.6%. The Western Pacific area, however, showed a 14.8% increase during the same period.

[[#tableToReachElimination|Table 2]] shows the leprosy situation in the four major countries that have yet to achieve the goal of elimination at the national level. It should be noted that: a) Elimination is defined as a prevalence of less than 1 case per 10,000 population; b) Madagascar reached elimination at the national level in September 2006; c) Nepal detection reported from mid-November 2004 to mid-November 2005; and d) D.R. Congo officially reported to WHO in 2008 that it had reached elimination by the end of 2007, at the national level.

==South America==
===Argentina===
In 2013, there were 550 cases, of which 277 were considered as new cases. Between 350 and 400 cases of leprosy are diagnosed every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1731889-buenos-aires-el-lugar-con-mas-casos-de-lepra-en-el-pais Todavía hay lepra: registraron 550 casos en el país La Nación - Buenos Aires, el lugar con más casos de lepra en el país]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 the law 11,359 ordered compulsory quarantine for the leper, that law was abolished by the law 22,964 in 1983, that ordered compulsory quarantine for the leper only if they refuse medical indications and involve some risk for the healthy population.

Five [[leper colony|leper colonies]] were built:

* ''Pedro L. Baliña'', [[Posadas, Misiones|Posadas]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], opened on February 6, 1938.
* ''José J. Puente'', [[San Francisco del Chañar]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], opened on March 18, 1939.
* ''Maximiliano Aberastury'', Isla del Cerrito, [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], opened on March 30, 1939.
* ''Baldomero Sommer'', [[General Rodríguez Partido|General Rodríguez]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], opened on November 21, 1941.
* ''Enrique Fidanza'', [[Diamante, Entre Ríos|Diamante]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] opened on March 28, 1948.

Only the ''Baldomero Sommer'' continues serving as a leper colony.

===Brazil===
Leprosy is a serious public health problem in Brazil, between 2001 and 2013 over 500,000 cases were reported and in 2015 alone over 25,000 cases were diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005364 Multibacillary leprosy by population groups in Brazil: Lessons from an observational study]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
===People's Republic of China===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The People's Republic of China has many leprosy recovered patients who have been isolated from the rest of society. In the 1950s the Chinese Communist government created "Recovered Villages" in rural remote mountaintops for the recovered patients. Although leprosy is now curable with the advent of the multi-drug treatment, the villagers remain because they have been stigmatized by the outside world. Health NGOs such as Joy in Action have arisen in China to especially focus on improving the conditions of "Recovered Villages".

===Portugal===
The [[Hospital-Colónia Rovisco Pais]] (the Rovisco Pais Hospital-Colony) was founded in Portugal in 1947 as a national center for the treatment of leprosy. It was renamed in 2007 as the Centro de Medicina de Reabilitação da Região Centro-Rovisco Pais. It still retains a leprosy service in which 25 ex patients live. Between 1988 and 2003 102 patients were treated in Portugal for leprosy.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Medeiros S, Catorze MG, Vieira MR |title=Hansen's disease in Portugal: multibacillary patients treated between 1988 and 2003 |journal=J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18713227 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2008.02941.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sanatorio de Fontilles]] (Fontilles Sanatorium) in Spain was founded in 1902 and admitted its first patient in 1909. In 2002, the Sanatorio had 68 in-patients in the Sanatorium, and more than 150 receiving out-patient treatment. A small number of cases continue to be reported.&lt;ref name="Pardal-Fernández2007"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pardal-Fernández JM, Rodríguez-Vázquez M, Fernández-Aragón G, Iñíguez-De Onzoño L, García-Muñozguren S |title=[Leprosy and severe neuropathy in two native Spaniards] |language=Spanish |journal=Rev Neurol |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=734–8 |year=2007 |pmid=18075988 |url=http://www.revneurol.com/LinkOut/formMedLine.asp?Refer=2007340&amp;Revista=RevNeurol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919030414/http://www.revneurol.com/LinkOut/formMedLine.asp?Refer=2007340&amp;Revista=RevNeurol |archivedate=2016-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Leprosy was almost eradicated in most of Europe by 1700 but sometime after 1850 leprosy was re introduced into East [[Prussia]] by [[Lithuania]]n rural workers immigrating from the Russian empire. The first leprosarium was founded in 1899 in Memel (now [[Klaipėda]] in Lithuania). Legislation was introduced in 1900 and 1904 requiring patients to be isolated and not allowed to work with others.

The last confirmed case of Leprosy being transmitted within the UK was in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010608 |pmid=27142858 |pmc=4861109 |title=Leprosy in England and Wales 1953–2012: Surveillance and challenges in low incidence countries |journal=BMJ Open |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=e010608 |year=2016 |last1=Fulton |first1=Nicholas |last2=Anderson |first2=Laura F |last3=Watson |first3=John M |last4=Abubakar |first4=Ibrahim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 &amp; 2012, an average of 139 cases/year of leprosy were diagnosed (&amp; notified) in the UK, none of which are believed to have been acquired within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010608 |pmid=27142858 |pmc=4861109 |title=Leprosy in England and Wales 1953–2012: Surveillance and challenges in low incidence countries |journal=BMJ Open |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=e010608 |year=2016 |last1=Fulton |first1=Nicholas |last2=Anderson |first2=Laura F |last3=Watson |first3=John M |last4=Abubakar |first4=Ibrahim }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's national referral service for leprosy is run by Prof. Diana Lockwood, the UK's only Leprologist, at the [[Hospital for Tropical Diseases]], London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lepra.org.uk/faqs/diana-lockwood{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
{{Main|Leprosy in Malta}}

The first documented case of leprosy (''erga corpore morbi leprae'') in Malta in a Gozitan woman (Garita Xejbais) was in 1492 but it is certain that it was present on the island before this time.&lt;ref name="Buttigieg2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buttigieg GG, Savona-Ventura C, Stafrace KM |title=History of leprosy in Malta |journal=Malta Med J. |volume=4 |pages=34–38 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded case was in 1630 in a Dominican friar. A report in 1687 recorded five cases. A further three cases were reported in 1808. Between 1839 and 1858 an additional seven cases were recorded. In 1890 a population survey recorded a total of 69 cases. A later survey in 1957 identified 151 people infected with leprosy.

In June 1972 an eradication programme was started. The project was based on the work of Enno Freerksen, Director of the Borsal Institute in [[Hamburg]]. Dr Freerksen's earlier trial had used rifampacin, izoniazid, dapsone and prothionamide. The Malta project used rifampacin, dapsone and clofamazine. The project formally concluded in 1999 having treated about 300 patients.

===Romania===
The last leper colony in Europe is at [[Tichileşti]], Romania. Until 1991 patients were not allowed to leave the colony. At this colony patients get food, a place to sleep, clothes and medical attention. Some live in long pavilions and others in houses with vegetable and flower gardens. There are two churches in the colony - [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Baptist]] - and a farm where the colony grows its own corn.

==North America==
===Canada===
There were cases of leprosy in Atlantic Canada at the end of the nineteenth century, beginning in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=William Brenton|title=Medicine in New Brunswick : a history of the practice of medicine&amp;hellip;from prior to the arrival of the white man in America to the early part of the twentieth century|year=1974|publisher=The New Brunswick Medical Society|location=Moncton|page=32|chapter=Leprosy in New Brunswick |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patients were first housed on Sheldrake Island in the [[Miramichi River]] and later transferred to [[Tracadie–Sheila|Tracadie]].  Catholic nuns (the ''religieuses hospitalières de Saint-Joseph'', RHSJ) came to take care of the sick.  They opened the first French-language hospital in [[New Brunswick]] and many more followed.  Many hospitals opened by the RHSJ nuns are still in use today.  The last hospital to house lepers in Tracadie was demolished in 1991.  Its [[lazaretto]] section had been closed since 1965.  In a century of existence, it had housed not only [[Acadian]] victims of the disease, but people from all over Canada as well as sick immigrants from Iceland, Russia and China, among other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/rhsjnda/Page20.html |title=R.H.S.J.

[[Cape Breton Island]] also suffered an outbreak, in the [[Lake Ainslie]] region.  Nine people were affected, but it died out soon after 1882.  Another outbreak of twenty cases occurred in the [[Lake O'Law]] region around 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|1974|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the first definite reference to the disease was in Florida in 1758. In 2004, there were 131 total cases of the disease in the United States.  Of the 131 cases, two-thirds were male.  Also out of the 131 cases, 25 (19%) were of individuals who were born in the country.  Mexico (18.3%), Micronesia (11.5%), Brazil (9.2%), and the Philippines (7.6%) were the next leading countries where those with the disease were originally born. A total of 20 cases were found to be white, not of Hispanic origin. As of October, 2005, 3,604 patients on the United States registry were currently receiving care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-09843-2_20 |chapter=Leprosy |title=Bacterial Infections of Humans |pages=415–438 |year=2009 |last1=Frankel |first1=Richard I |last2=Scollard |first2=David M |isbn=978-0-387-09842-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disease is tracked by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), with a total of 166 new cases reported in the US in 2005.  Most (100 or 60%) of these new cases were reported in California, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas.&lt;ref name="hrsa.gov"&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15992">{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}The '''excommunication of Margaret McBride''' occurred following the sanctioning by the American [[Religious sisters|religious sister]] in November 2009 of an abortion at a Roman Catholic hospital in Phoenix. It was lifted in December 2011. Her decision and her subsequent excommunication aroused controversy in the areas of [[medical ethics]] and [[Catholic theology]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-05-18-nun-abortion_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |title=Hospital nun rebuked for allowing abortion in Phoenix |work=USA Today |date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=10658003 |title=Phoenix hospital nun rebuked for allowing abortion |date=May 15, 2010 |work=ABCNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clancy |first=Michael |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/05/15/20100515phoenix-catholic-nun-abortion.html |title=Nun at St. Joseph's Hospital rebuked over abortion to save woman |work=The Arizona Republic |date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?ID=12405 |title=Arizona Nun Excommunicated for Approving Emergency Abortion |work=Ms. Magazine |date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Margaret McBride==
Sr. Margaret Mary McBride, R.S.M., is a [[Sisters of Mercy|Sister of Mercy]].&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-05-19|work=National Public Radio|title=Nun Excommunicated for Allowing Abortion|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126985072|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her [[Bachelor of Science]] in nursing and her Master of Public Administration from the [[University of San Francisco]]. She has served as a board member of several organizations, including Hospice of the Valley, Catholic Charities, Mercy Housing Southwest, and Southwest Catholic Health Network.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjosephs-phx.org/Who_We_Are/208291 |title=Sr. Margaret Mary McBride |publisher=St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center |accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision and excommunication==
McBride was an administrator and member of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|ethics committee]] at [[St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center]], which is owned by [[Catholic Healthcare West]](Dignity Health).&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;  On 27 November 2009, the committee was consulted on the case of a 27-year-old woman who was eleven weeks pregnant with her fifth child and suffering from [[pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral.com"/&gt; Her doctors stated that the woman's chance of dying if the pregnancy was allowed to continue was "close to 100 percent".&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-05-19|work=National Public Radio|title=Nun Excommunicated for Allowing Abortion|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126985072|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McBride joined the ethics committee in approving the decision to terminate the pregnancy through an induced abortion.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; The abortion took place and the mother survived.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;

Afterwards, the abortion came to the attention of Bishop [[Thomas J. Olmsted]], the bishop of the Catholic [[Diocese of Phoenix]]. Olmsted spoke to McBride privately and she confirmed her participation in the procurement of the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courageouspriest.com/nun-the-abortion-was-a-morally-good-act Nun, “The Abortion Was a Morally Good Act”]&lt;/ref&gt; Olmsted informed her that in allowing the abortion, she had incurred a ''[[latae sententiae]]'', or automatic, excommunication. McBride was subsequently reassigned from her post as vice president of mission integration at the hospital.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

In May 2010, the incident came to the attention of the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' newspaper, which asked the hospital and the bishop for comments. Both the bishop and the hospital provided answers to the newspaper's request, and on 15 May 2010 the two statements were published online.&lt;ref name="Statements from the Diocese of Phoenix and St. Joseph's"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Statements from the Diocese of Phoenix and St. Joseph's |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2010/05/14/20100514stjoseph0515bishop.html |publisher=The Arizona Republic |date=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Olmsted announced that the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix]] was severing its affiliation with the hospital, after months of discussion had failed to obtain from the hospital management a promise not to perform abortions in the future. "If we are presented with a situation in which a pregnancy threatens a woman's life, our first priority is to save both patients. If that is not possible, we will always save the life we can save, and that is what we did in this case," said hospital president Linda Hunt. "Morally, ethically, and legally, we simply cannot stand by and let someone die whose life we might be able to save."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/ariz-hospital-loses-catholic-status-over-surgery/ |agency=Associated Press |last=Myers |first=Amanda Lee |title=Ariz. hospital loses Catholic status over surgery |date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to good standing==
In December 2011, a statement from St. Joseph's Hospital was emailed to the Catholic News Service announcing that McBride is no longer excommunicated and is in good standing with the Sisters of Mercy. She serves as the vice president for organizational outreach at the medical center. Neither the archdiocese nor the hospital provided further comment on her situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Kevin |title=McBride un-excommunicated |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/mcbride-un-excommunicated |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=America Magazine |date=14 December 2011 |language=en |quote=In a Dec. 8 statement, the hospital said Sister Margaret has since "met the requirements for reinstatement with the church and she is no longer excommunicated. She continues to be a member in good standing with the Sisters of Mercy and is a valued member of the St. Joseph's executive team."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The incident rapidly became a touchstone in the [[culture wars]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marty |first1=Robin |title=Are Catholic Hospitals Safe for Pregnant Women? - Rewire.News |url=https://rewire.news/article/2010/05/18/when-catholic-care-isnt-care/ |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=Rewire.News |date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital's spokesperson explained that while the hospital follows the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, these directives do not answer all questions.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral.com"/&gt; McBride's supporters have argued that the abortion was licit under the terms of Directive 47 of the "Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services", issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.&lt;ref name="Directives"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethical and Religious Directives |url=http://www.usccb.org/about/doctrine/ethical-and-religious-directives/ |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |accessdate=17 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who reject this argument note that Directive 47 (which refers to "operations, treatments, and medications that have as their direct purpose the cure of a proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman") applies only in the case of the death of the unborn child as an unintended consequence, according to the "[[principle of double effect]]", while the preceding Directive 45 in the same document explicitly states "Abortion (that is, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted. Every procedure whose sole immediate effect is the termination of pregnancy before viability is an abortion, which, in its moral context, includes the interval between conception and implantation of the embryo. Catholic health care institutions are not to provide abortion services, even based upon the principle of material cooperation."&lt;ref name="Directives"/&gt; 

In explanation of how McBride excommunicated herself through her actions, Father John Ehrich, medical ethics director for the diocese, issued a statement that stated "The unborn child can never be thought of as a pathology or an illness. That is, the child is not that which threatens the life of the mother, rather it is the pathology or illness (cancer, premature rupture of membranes, hypertension, preeclampsia, etc.) which threatens the mother's life." Since "no physician can predict what will happen with 100 percent accuracy", Ehrich wrote, "What we should not do ... is lower risks associated with pregnancy by aborting children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nun excommunicated, loses hospital post over decision on abortion {{!}} Archdiocese of Baltimore |url=https://www.archbalt.org/nun-excommunicated-loses-hospital-post-over-decision-on-abortion/ |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=The Catholic Review |agency=Archdiocese of Baltimore |date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, critics condemned the decision and suggested that it reflected larger trends. [[Jacob M. Appel]], a leading American [[bioethicist]], questioned "if women are safe in Catholic hospitals" following Olmsted's announcement. Appel wrote that, "Like many Catholic hospitals, St. Joseph's has long had two conflicting policies regarding maternal-fetal conflict on its books. One directive states that abortion is never permitted, even to save the life of the mother, while the other notes that 'operations, treatments and medications that have as their direct purpose the cure of a proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman are permitted...even if they will result in the death of the unborn child....Until this recent incident, pregnant women could safely assume that Catholic hospitals would follow both the law and widespread standards of medical ethics in allowing the second directive to trump the first. Suddenly, that time-honored understanding appears to be in jeopardy."&lt;ref name="irishcentral.com"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Patrick |title=Safety of women in Catholic hospitals questioned by top bioethicist |url=https://www.irishcentral.com/news/safety-of-women-in-catholic-hospitals-questioned-by-top-bioethicist-94688044-237696791 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=IrishCentral.com |date=23 May 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholics for Choice]], an independent [[pro-choice]] organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/31/catholic-us-healthcare-abortion | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Becky | last=Garrison | title=Playing Catholic politics with US healthcare | date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also expressed concerns regarding the decision. Its president, Jon O'Brien, said, "While not all the facts are available, it is clear that the Vatican's hard line on abortion led to this terrible situation. Sadly, we see situations like this time after time, both here in the US and abroad. The Vatican's outright ban on all abortions is insensitive and reflects an unwillingness to acknowledge the reality of women's lives, including the difficult decisions that often have to be made during a pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O’Brien |first1=Jon |title="Excommunication" of Nun in Arizona Very Troubling |url=http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/excommunication-of-nun-in-arizona-very-troubling/ |website=Catholics For Choice |accessdate=17 July 2018 |date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Thomas Doyle, a well-known canon lawyer, noted that the bishop "clearly had other alternatives than to declare her excommunicated." Doyle argued that this case highlights a "gross inequity" in how the church chooses to handle scandal. He noted that no priests have been excommunicated for sexual abuse, suggesting a double standard within the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nun Excommunicated For Allowing Abortion |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126985072 |author= Barbara Bradley Hagerty |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=National Public Radio |date=19 May 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although this is now no longer the case, since pedophile priest [[Jose Mercau]] was excommunicated by [[Pope Francis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/09/pope-francis-excommunicate-priest_n_6122766.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109230706/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/09/pope-francis-excommunicate-priest_n_6122766.html# |archive-date=2014-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Inés San Martín |url=http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2014/11/06/pope-defrocks-argentine-priest-on-sexual-abuse-charges/ |title=Pope defrocks Argentine priest on sexual abuse charges |publisher=Cruxnow.com |date=2014-11-06 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Among those defending the excommunication were the Catholic Physicians Guild of Phoenix led by William H. Brophy. Brophy wrote that "an action which is in and of itself wrong, in that it lacks goodness as discerned by the light of human reason, is never justified by circumstances or intended end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gilbert |first1=Kathleen |title=Catholic Doctors Support Ariz. Bishop’s Rebuke of Nun over Abortion |url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/catholic-doctors-support-ariz-bishops-rebuke-of-nun-over-abortion |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=LifeSiteNews |date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theologian Michael Liccone stated, "The Church does not condemn '[[indirect abortion]]': abortion that is a foreseen but unintended side effect of a medical procedure designed to preserve the mother's life," saying that McBride, considered an ethics expert at the hospital, had explained her decision by telling Olmsted that she saw the abortion in this scenario as indirect. Liccone said that Olmsted's decision to say that McBride had excommunicated herself, rather than to excommunicate her ''[[ferendae sententiae]]'' "by his own juridical act", raised questions.&lt;ref name=Liccone&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-05-21|work=First Things|title=Excommunicating Intentions|url=https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2010/05/excommunicating-intentions|last=Liccone|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Jensen criticized accounts trying to justify the Phoenix case as based upon an incoherent account of intention. He did not believe the principle of double effect applied, saying the doctors intended to kill via [[dilation and curettage]]. "This cutting is a kind of violent harm to the baby.  The harm is not distinct from the cutting but is precisely that cutting insofar as it relates to the baby....This cutting is a cause that the doctor must include within the means he chooses" ("A Critique of Tollefsen on the Phoenix Case," The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly, Summer 2014, 293).

'''Functional chewing gum''' is the name given to types of [[chewing gum]] which [[functional food|impart some practical function]] instead of, or in addition to, the usual enjoyment provided by a traditional chewing gum as a [[confectionery]] product. Examples of this include [[nicotine gum]] which is used to aid [[smoking cessation]] &amp; so-called [[Think Gum]] which designers say they believe may enhance mental functioning. It could be argued that most gum (at least the mint varieties) provides some function in that they can improve [[bad breath]], but such an effect is so widespread that the term 'functional' is almost always applied to gum with some additional function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5289717/Functional-gum-it-s-often.html|title=Functional gum: it's often still in search of a home within the store, but functional gum is oh-so-much more than merely a fad.(market research)(Industry Overview)|publisher=Goliath}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical uses for 'functional chewing gum' include a reported reduction in the duration of post-operative [[ileus]] following abdominal and specifically gastrointestinal surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald JE, Ahmed I.

'''Gordon syndrome''' (GS), or distal [[arthrogryposis]] type 3, is a rare, [[autosomal dominant disorder]] characterized by [[cleft palate]] and congenital contractures of the hands and feet.

==Symptoms==
Gordon syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as the distal arthrogryposes. These disorders typically involve stiffness and impaired mobility of certain joints of the lower arms and legs (distal extremities) including the knees, elbows, wrists, and/or ankles. These joints tend to be permanently fixed in a bent or flexed position (contractures). Gordon syndrome is characterized by the permanent fixation of several fingers in a flexed position (camptodactyly), abnormal bending inward of the foot (clubfoot or talipes), and, less frequently, incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Gordon syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

==Genetics==
While some reports suggest Gordon syndrome may be inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, most agree that it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced expressivity and incomplete penetrance in females.

In autosomal dominant inheritance, having only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. When an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene.

If a condition shows variable or reduced expressivity, it means that there can be a range in the nature and severity of signs and symptoms among affected individuals. Incomplete penetrance means that a portion of the individuals who carry the mutated copy of the disease-causing gene will not have any features of the condition.

'''Javier Lozano Barragán''' (born 26 January 1933) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] Cardinal and president Emeritus of the [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]] in the Roman Catholic Church.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Toluca]], [[State of México]], Lozano Barragán trained as a priest in [[Zamora, Michoacán]], and at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome, where he earned a doctorate in theology and was ordained in 1955.
{{Ordination
| consecrated by       = [[Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada|Ernesto Card. Corripio y Ahumada]] ([[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Mexico]])
| date of consecration = 15 August 1979
}}
==Bishop==
In 1979, Lozano Barragán was appointed auxiliary Bishop of [[Mexico City]], then Bishop of [[Zacatecas]] in 1984. He went to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in 1996 as President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers, and was named [[Archbishop]] ad personam.

==Cardinalate==
Bishop Lozano Barragán was elevated to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''[[San Michele Arcangelo]]'' by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 21 October 2003.

Lozano Barragán was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 2005|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[Papal conclave, 2005|2005 papal conclave]] that selected [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

On 18 April 2009, Pope Benedict accepted the resignation of Cardinal Lozano Barragán for reasons of age and appointed [[Zygmunt Zimowski]] to the post.

Having served 10 years as a cardinal-deacon, he was promoted to [[Cardinal Priest]] of [[Santa Dorotea]] by [[Pope Francis]] on 12 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2014/documents/ns_lit_doc_20140612_optatio-diaconis-cardinalibus_it.html|title=Assegnazione del titolo presbiterale ad alcuni cardinali diaconi creati nel consistoro del 21 ottobre 2003|language=Italian|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
===Abortion===
Cardinal Barragán has expressed strong opposition to abortion, especially with regards to the [[RU-486]] pill, which has abortive effects on the [[conceptus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/politica/2009/12/02/visualizza_new.html_1623094495.html Card. Barragan : Ru486 e' un crimine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Paul II===
Cardinal Lozano Barragán was among the first to promote the [[canonization]] of Pope [[John Paul II]] after his death in April 2005, claiming that the 1990 recovery of a boy with terminal leukemia, whom the Pope blessed, is a miracle attributable to John Paul.

===AIDS and contraception===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2006 it was reported that Cardinal Lozano Barragán was preparing a report for Pope Benedict which might state that using condoms is the [[lesser of two evils principle|lesser of two evils]] when one of the people is infected with AIDS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-15838?l=english Vatican clarifies its condoms-AIDS study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222124608/http://www.zenit.org/article-15838?l=english |date=22 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story was later downplayed when the cardinal declared that he did not have the authority to give definitive doctrinal directives. Moreover, in 2009, Pope Benedict XVI argued that the spread of AIDS "cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html  Benedict XVI, Interview during his fight to Africa, 17 March 2009] and [http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/17/Pope_Condoms_no_help_in_AIDS_fight/UPI-30161237315686/ Pope: Condoms no help in AIDS fight]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euthanasia===
Cardinal Lozano Barragán has publicly intervened in high-profile euthanasia cases, notably with [[Terri Schiavo]] and [[Eluana Englaro]], which he unabashedly described as murders.

===Homosexuals and transsexuals===
In December 2009 a website published a statement by Cardinal Lozano Barragán in which he said that, while the Church regarded homosexuality as an insult to God, this did not justify discrimination against gay and transsexual people. The cardinal quoted [[Saint Paul]]'s Letter to the Romans&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|1:26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that homosexuals and transsexuals will never enter the kingdom of heaven. He later clarified that this did not mean that no individual homosexual can be saved, since existence of grave fault requires not only grave matter but also full knowledge and consent, and since being homosexual is often due not to personal fault but to education and environment.&lt;ref name=ZENIT&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-27740?l=english Cardinal: Statement on gays was misrepresented] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208012418/http://www.zenit.org/article-27740?l=english |date=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saying that people are not born homosexual, he attributed homosexuality to reasons such as education and failure to develop one's identity during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h5kwXHE_zqvKJp92adJjWeXxZmyg Agence France Press: Gays 'will never go to heaven': cardinal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holy See Press Office]] spokesman Fr [[Federico Lombardi]], S.J. said the website should not be considered an authority on Catholic thinking "on complex and delicate issues such as homosexuality". For the teaching of the Catholic Church on the matter, Lombardi referred to [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357–2359], which states that, while "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered", those who have homosexual tendencies "must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity" and "every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided".&lt;ref name="ZENIT" /&gt;

Alaska, Delaware, Montana, and Wyoming lack medical schools (Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho participate in a regional campus model with the University of Washington School of Medicine known as WWAMI Medical Education which allows 4 years of medical school to occur in each state). Regional campus models have allowed smaller states to gain access to clinical experiences at larger hospitals that their states lack.  Additionally, the regional campus model allows medical students to gain valuable rural experiences which are often lacking with medical schools situated in larger metropolitan areas.

'''Mechanobiology''' is an emerging field of science at the interface of biology and engineering that focuses on how physical forces and changes in the mechanical properties of cells and tissues contribute to development, cell differentiation, [[physiology]], and disease.&lt;ref name="ICMM"/&gt;  A major challenge in the field is understanding [[mechanotransduction]]—the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals.
 
While medicine has typically looked for the genetic and biochemical basis of disease, advances in mechanobiology suggest that changes in cell mechanics, [[extracellular matrix]] structure, or mechanotransduction may contribute to the development of many diseases, including [[atherosclerosis]], [[fibrosis]], [[asthma]], [[osteoporosis]], [[heart failure]], and [[cancer]].  There is also a strong mechanical basis for many generalized medical disabilities, such as lower back pain, foot and postural injury, deformity, and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].

The effectiveness of many of the mechanical therapies already in clinical use shows how important physical forces can be in physiological control. For example, [[pulmonary surfactant]] promotes lung development in premature infants; modifying the tidal volumes of mechanical ventilators reduces morbidity and death in patients with acute lung injury; expandable [[stents]] physically prevent coronary artery constriction; tissue expanders increase the skin area available for reconstructive surgery;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buganza Tepole | first1 = A | last2 = Ploch | first2 = CJ | last3 = Wong | first3 = J | last4 = Gosain | first4 = AK | last5 = Kuhl | first5 = E | year = 2011 | title = Growing skin - A computational model for skin expansion in reconstructive surgery | url = | journal = J.

Solids | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 2177–2190 | doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2011.05.004| pmc = 3212404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and surgical tension application devices are used for bone fracture healing, orthodontics, cosmetic breast expansion and closure of non-healing wounds. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation may also lead to development of improved medical devices, [[biomaterials]], and engineered tissues for tissue repair and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 2003 | title = Mechanobiology and diseases of mechanotransduction | doi = 10.1080/07853890310016333 | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 564–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stretch-activated [[ion channels]], [[caveolae]], [[integrins]], [[cadherins]], growth factor receptors, myosin motors, [[cytoskeletal]] filaments, [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], extracellular matrix, and numerous other molecular structures and signaling molecules have been shown to contribute to cellular mechanotransduction.  In addition, [[endogenous]] cell-generated traction forces contribute significantly to these responses by modulating tensional prestress within cells, tissues, and organs that govern their mechanical stability, as well as mechanical signal transmission from the macroscale to the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 1997 | title = Tensegrity: the architectural basis of cellular mechanotransduction | url = | journal = Annu.

It is claimed all cells are mechanosensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kung|first1=C|title=A possible unifying principle for mechanosensation.|journal=Nature|date=4 August 2005|volume=436|issue=7051|pages=647–54|pmid=16079835|doi=10.1038/nature03896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively cells respond to perturbations to their local mechanical environment resulting in tissue-level observations. For example, at the tissue-level an artery will either thicken or thin in response to changes in blood pressure above or below the healthy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayenga|first1=HN|last2=Hu|first2=JJ|last3=Meyer|first3=CA|last4=Wilson|first4=E|last5=Hein|first5=TW|last6=Kuo|first6=L|last7=Humphrey|first7=JD|title=Differential progressive remodeling of coronary and cerebral arteries and arterioles in an aortic coarctation model of hypertension.|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|date=2012|volume=3|pages=420|pmid=23162468|doi=10.3389/fphys.2012.00420|pmc=3495262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=JD|title=Mechanisms of arterial remodeling in hypertension: coupled roles of wall shear and intramural stress.|journal=Hypertension|date=August 2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=195–200|pmid=18541735|doi=10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.103440|pmc=2753501}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, in the case of increased blood pressure ([[Hypertension]]) individual arterial cells experience greater circumferential stress (or tension). In order to alleviate this tension, they produce growth factors, which in turn stimulates proliferation. The net result is increased arterial wall thickness but the stress levels in the artery are restored to the normal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorne|first1=BC|last2=Hayenga|first2=HN|last3=Humphrey|first3=JD|last4=Peirce|first4=SM|title=Toward a multi-scale computational model of arterial adaptation in hypertension: verification of a multi-cell agent based model.|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|date=2011|volume=2|pages=20|pmid=21720536|doi=10.3389/fphys.2011.00020|pmc=3118494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using mankind as a macroscopic example, in closed chain function, ground reactive forces, a dynamic architecture and a dynamic equilibrium of forces around joint axes impact the posture to produce tissue stress.  This tissue stress can be both beneficial or harmful. Since gravity, hard, unyielding ground surfaces and other factors such as activity level, body weight and health state impact each of us differently there is no one plan of care that will work for every individual.  This results in a lifetime of adaptation of tissues via Wolff's and Davis' Laws of Bone and Soft Tissue respectively that can unless compensated and/or corrected lead to breakdown, injury and reduced quality of life on a case to case basis.

As a further example, the foot has an inherited functional shape which when used will remodel and adapt in predictable manners. Theoretically programs can be establishing for prevention, performance enhancement and quality of life upgrading in addition to the treatment of pathology and pain. These interventions, some day, will cause positive remodeling of bone and soft tissue that will extend and possibly improve the mechanobiological timeline of mankind.

'''''Medivac''''', an [[Australia]]n [[television drama series]], ran on [[Network Ten]] from 1996 to 1998. There were 48 episodes produced. ''Medivac'' is an abbreviation of the term ''medical evacuation''. The series was also known as '''Adrenaline Junkies''' overseas.

Medivac was set in the emergency department of [[Brisbane]]'s fictional Bethlehem West Hospital, where a dedicated medical team work in the demanding world of emergency medicine. The team specialises in the evacuation of disaster areas, journeying by helicopter to remote areas inaccessible by ambulance. They also work in the city streets and the suburbs involving themselves with the patients, their families and the police.

[[File:Swiss Army (20230697973).jpg|thumb|Swiss Military chocolate]]

'''Military chocolate''' ({{lang-de|Militärschokolade}}; {{lang-fr|chocolat militaire}}; {{lang-it|cioccolato militare}}; {{lang-rm|tschigulatta da militar}}) is a food component of the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Themenpaket 3: Schweizer Schokoladepioniere|trans-title=|periodical=verkehrshaus.ch|publisher=verkehrshaus.ch – Schuldienst|url=https://www.verkehrshaus.ch/sites/default/files/documents/sb_schokoladen-pioniere_paket3.pdf|deadurl=|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-08|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Pädagogische Hochschule Luzern|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=3|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Militärschokolade Napolitains.jpg|thumb|Military chocolate [[Napolitains]]]]
The military chocolate had the official designation "emergency rations" (Notportion or ration de secours or razione di soccorso or raziun da reserva) in the Swiss army. It was black dark chocolate packed in two white cardboard boxes, which were covered with a transparent plastic film. They were about the size of a cigarette box. The two cardboard boxes were connected but could easily be separated by a perforation. This military chocolate was produced by several companies, e.g. from [[Villars-Maitre-Chocolatier]] or Chocolat Stella.
For decades the military chocolate has been part of the basic rations for Swiss soldiers. In addition to the [[Military Biscuit]], it is popular for schoolchildren who receive them from soldiers. The military chocolate thus achieved a certain cult status.

In the course of time, a chocolate board of 50 g was introduced into a red paper package and a milk chocolate bar of 50 g in red plastic packaging. This was more popular than the emergency portions, but not available in the same quantity.
This led to the rumor that this chocolate was only for officers. This gave rise to the unofficial designation "officer chocolate".
The "Offiziersschokolade" has now replaced the emergency ration. The emergency rations are no longer part of the official military rations. As of May 1, 2005, Stella's earlier black chocolate was taken out of service. The manufacturer in [[Ticino]], however, continues to produce them in the original recipe and sells them to civilian customers.
Current military chocolate also contains [[Rice Krispies]] or [[corn flakes]]. In addition to the chocolate bars, the military chocolate is available for promotion purposes in the form of a [[napolitain]] of 5 g. The Swiss army obtains their military chocolate from various manufacturers, which are [[UTZ Certified]], among others from the Chocolat Stella or the [[Chocolat Frey]].

==Protected brand==
Since 2013 the protection of the brand "Swiss Army"  is to be enforced on behalf of Parliament. In April 2016 the Handelsgericht Bern prohibited a chocolate manufacturer from using the brand name "Swiss Army" without a corresponding license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/standard/Swiss-ArmySchokolade-muss-sich-umbenennen/story/24821787 Tagesanzeiger online vom 15. April 2016: ''«Swiss Army»-Schokolade muss sich umbenennen.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milton Hyland Erickson''' (5 December 1901 – 25 March 1980) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]] specializing in medical [[hypnosis]] and [[family therapy]]. He was founding president of the [[American Society for Clinical Hypnosis]] and a fellow of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]], and the [[American Psychopathological Association]]. He is noted for his approach to the [[unconscious mind]] as creative and solution-generating. He is also noted for influencing [[brief therapy]], [[strategic family therapy]], [[family systems therapy]], [[solution focused brief therapy]], and [[neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg E. Gorton, M.D. (2005) "Milton Hyland Erickson, 1901–1980." ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 162:1255&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal history ==
Erickson was largely [[autodidact|self-taught]], and his biography was noted down by Sidney Rosen in the book ''My Voice Will Go With You''. Erickson identified many of his earliest personal experiences as hypnotic or autohypnotic.

Erickson grew up in [[Lowell, Wisconsin]], in a modest farming family and intended to become a farmer like his father. He was a late developer and was both dyslexic and color blind. He overcame his [[dyslexia]] and had many other inspirations via a series of spontaneous autohypnotic "flashes of light" or "creative moments", as described in the paper ''Autohypnotic Experiences of Milton H. Erickson''.&lt;ref&gt;"Autohypnotic Experiences of Milton H. Erickson'" (Milton H. Erickson and Ernest L. Rossi), ''The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis'', July. 1977 20, 36-54, reprinted in ''Collected Papers Volume 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, he contracted [[polio]] and was so severely paralysed that the doctors believed he would die.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He began to recall "body memories" of the muscular activity of his own body. By concentrating on th.eIn his account, by memories, he slowmusclegan to regain control of parts of his body to the point where he was eventually able to talk and use his arms. Still unable to walk, he decided to train his body further by embarking - alone - on a thousand-mile canoe trip with only a few dollars. After this grueling trip, he was able to walk with a cane. This experience may have contributed to Erickson's technique of using "ordeals" in a therapeutic context (see below).

Erickson was an avid medical student, and he was so curious about, and engaged with, psychiatry that he obtained a psychology degree while he was still studying medicine.

Much later, in his fifties, he developed [[post-polio syndrome]], characterized by pain and muscle weakness caused by the chronic over-use of partially paralyzed muscles. The condition left him even more severely paralyzed, but, having been through the experience once before, he now had a strategy for recovering some use of his muscles which he employed again. After this second recovery, he was obliged to use a wheelchair and suffered chronic pain. 

In the early 1950s, anthropologist/cyberneticist [[Gregory Bateson]] involved Erickson as a consultant as part of his extensive research on communication. The two had met earlier, after Bateson and [[Margaret Mead]] had called upon him to analyse the films Mead had made of trance states in Bali. Through Bateson, Erickson met [[Jay Haley]], [[Richard Bandler]] and [[John Grinder]], amongst others, and had a profound influence on them all. They went on to write several books about him.

In 1973, Jay Haley published ''Uncommon Therapy'', which for the first time brought Erickson and his approaches to the attention of those outside the clinical hypnosis community. Erickson's fame and reputation spread rapidly, and so many people wished to meet him that he began holding teaching seminars, which continued until his death.

Milton H. Erickson died in March 1980, aged 78, leaving four sons, four daughters, and a lasting legacy to the worlds of psychology, psychiatry, psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, pedagogics and communications.

==Hypnosis==
Erickson is noted for his often unconventional approach to [[psychotherapy]], as described in the book ''Uncommon Therapy'' by [[Jay Haley]] and the book ''Hypnotherapy: An Exploratory Casebook,'' by Milton H. Erickson and Ernest L. Rossi (1979, New York: Irvington Publishers, Inc.). He developed an extensive use of therapeutic metaphor and [[narrative|story]] as well as hypnosis and coined the term ''[[brief therapy]]'' for his method of addressing therapeutic change in relatively few sessions.

Beginning in the 1950s, Erickson's use of interventions influenced [[strategic therapy]] and [[family systems therapy]] of practitioners including [[Virginia Satir]] and [[Jay Haley]]. He was noted for his ability to "utilize" anything about a patient to help them change, including their beliefs, favorite words, cultural background, personal history, or even their neurotic habits.

Through conceptualizing the unconscious as highly separate from the conscious mind, with its own awareness, interests, responses, and learnings, he taught that the unconscious mind was creative, solution-generating, and often positive.

He was an important influence on [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), which was in part based upon his working methods.&lt;ref&gt;Gorton, Gregg E (2005). Milton Hyland Erickson ''The American Journal of Psychiatry''. Washington. Vol.162, Iss. 7;  pg. 1255, 1 pgs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trance and the unconscious mind===
{{Neuro-linguistic programming|expanded=developers}}
Erickson believed that the unconscious mind was always listening and that, whether or not the patient was in trance, suggestions could be made which would have a hypnotic influence, as long as those suggestions found resonance at the unconscious level. The patient could be aware of this or could be completely oblivious that something was happening. Erickson would see if the patient would respond to one or another kind of indirect suggestion and allow the unconscious mind to participate actively in the therapeutic process. In this way, what seemed like a normal conversation might induce a hypnotic trance, or a therapeutic change in the subject. According to Weitzenhoffer, "[Erickson's] conception of the ''unconscious'' is definitely not the one held by Freud."&lt;ref name="Weitzenhoffer 1976"&gt;Andre M. Weitzenhoffer (1976) Introduction/forward in ''Hypnotic Realities'' Erickson &amp; Rossi&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson was an irrepressible practical joker,&lt;ref&gt;Rosen (1982), ''My Voice Will Go With You'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not uncommon for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Rossi (1981), ''Experiencing Hypnosis''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office near the end of his life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died."  Erickson smiled and said: "You tell him that dying is the ''last'' thing I intend to do."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Erickson also believed that it was even appropriate for the therapist to go into trance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I go into trances so that I will be more sensitive to the intonations and inflections of my patients' speech. And to enable me to hear better, see better.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erickson maintained that trance is a common, everyday occurrence. For example, when waiting for buses and trains, reading or listening, or even being involved in strenuous physical exercise, it's quite normal to become immersed in the activity and go into a trance state, removed from any other irrelevant stimuli. These states are so common and familiar that most people do not consciously recognise them as hypnotic phenomena.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The same situation is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated with a question or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze off to the right or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Rossi: ''Two-Level Communication and the Microdynamics of Trance and Suggestion'', The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, 1976 Reprinted in Collected Papers Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because Erickson expected trance states to occur naturally and frequently, he was prepared to exploit them therapeutically, even when the patient was not present with him in the consulting room. He also discovered many techniques for increasing the likelihood that a trance state would occur. He developed both verbal and non-verbal techniques and pioneered the idea that the common experiences of wonderment, engrossment and confusion are, in fact, just kinds of trance.

Clearly, there are a great many kinds of trance. Many people are familiar with the idea of a "deep" trance, and earlier in his career Erickson was a pioneer in researching the unique and remarkable phenomena that are associated with that state, spending many hours at a time with individual test subjects, deepening the trance.

That a trance may be "light" or "deep" suggests a one-dimensional continuum of trance depth, but Erickson would often work with multiple trances in the same patient, for example, suggesting that the hypnotised patient behave "as if awake", thereby blurring the line between the hypnotic and awake state.

Erickson believed there are multiple states that may be utilized. This resonates with [[Charles Tart]]'s idea (put forward in the book ''Waking Up'') that all states of consciousness are trances and that what we call "normal" waking consciousness is just a "consensus trance". [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]] also makes central use of the idea of changing state, without it explicitly being a hypnotic phenomenon.

=== Indirect techniques ===
Where classical hypnosis is authoritative and direct and often encounters resistance in the subject, Erickson's approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect.&lt;ref&gt;Lankton &amp; Lankton, ''The Answer Within'' 1983/2008, Crown Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where a classical hypnotist might say "You are going into a trance", an Ericksonian hypnotist would be more likely to say "you can ''comfortably learn'' how to go into a trance". In this way, he provides an opportunity for the subject to accept the suggestions they are most comfortable with, at their own pace, and with an awareness of the benefits. The subject knows they are not being hustled and takes full ownership of, and participates in, their transformation.  Because the induction takes place during the course of a normal conversation, Ericksonian hypnosis is often known as Covert or Conversational Hypnosis.

Erickson maintained that it was not possible consciously to instruct the unconscious mind, and that authoritarian suggestions were likely to be met with resistance. The unconscious mind responds to openings, opportunities, metaphors, symbols, and contradictions. Effective hypnotic suggestion, then, should be "artfully vague", leaving space for the subject to fill in the gaps with their own unconscious understandings - even if they do not consciously grasp what is happening. The skilled hypnotherapist constructs these gaps of meaning in a way most suited to the individual subject - in a way which is most likely to produce the desired change.

For example, the authoritative "You will stop smoking" is likely to find less leverage on the unconscious level than "You can become a non-smoker". The first is a direct command, to be obeyed or ignored (and notice that it draws attention to the act of smoking); the second is an opening, an invitation to possible lasting change, without pressure, and is less likely to raise resistance.

[[Richard Bandler]] and [[John Grinder]] identified this kind of "artful vagueness" as a central characteristic of their '[[Milton Model]]', a systematic attempt to codify Erickson's hypnotic language patterns.

=== Confusion technique ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;In all my techniques, almost all, there is a confusion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Erickson &amp; Rossi - ''Hypnotic Realities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A confused person has their conscious mind busy and occupied, and is very much inclined to draw upon unconscious learnings to make sense of things. A confused person is in a trance of their own making - and therefore goes readily into that trance without resistance. Confusion might be created by ambiguous words, complex or endless sentences, pattern interruption or a myriad of other techniques to incite [[transderivational search]]es.

Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], who coined the term "hypnotism", claimed that focused attention was essential for creating hypnotic trances; indeed, his thesis was that hypnosis was in essence a state of extreme focus. But it can be difficult for people racked by pain, fear or suspicion to focus on anything at all. Thus other techniques for inducing trance become important, or as Erickson explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... long and frequent use of the confusion technique has many times effected exceedingly rapid hypnotic inductions under unfavourable conditions such as acute pain of terminal malignant disease and in persons interested but hostile, aggressive, and resistant...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Handshake induction ===
Among Erickson's best-known innovations is the hypnotic handshake induction, which is a type of confusion technique. The induction is done by the hypnotist going to shake hands with the subject, then interrupting the flow of the handshake in some way, such as by grabbing the subject's wrist instead. If the handshake continues to develop in a way which is out-of-keeping with expectations, a simple, non-verbal trance is created, which may then be reinforced or utilized by the hypnotist. All these responses happen naturally and automatically without telling the subject to consciously focus on an idea.

Richard Bandler told people that Erickson had taught him this handshake technique.  However, it is clear that Bandler embedded some parts in it that were, in fact, impossible for Erickson such as "gradually lessening the pressure with his right hand", which of course was impossible for Erickson since he was almost completely paralysed in his right hand. Bandler talks about this in one of his videos Creating Therapeutic Change.{{Dubious|Talk Bandler and Handshake Induction|reason=Contradicts quotation from Erikson below|date=April 2014}}

This induction works because shaking hands is one of the actions learned and operated as a single "chunk" of behavior; tying shoelaces is another classic example. If the behavior is diverted or frozen midway, the person literally has no mental space for this - he is stopped in the middle of unconsciously executing a behavior that hasn't got a "middle". The mind responds by suspending itself in trance until either something happens to give a new direction, or it "snaps out". A skilled hypnotist can often use that momentary confusion and suspension of normal processes to induce trance quickly and easily.

The various descriptions of Erickson's hypnotic handshake, including his own very detailed accounts, indicate that a certain amount of improvisation is involved, and that watching and acting upon the subject's responses is the key to a successful outcome.

Erickson described the routine as follows:
:*Initiation: When I begin by shaking hands, I do so normally. The "hypnotic touch" then begins when I let loose. The letting loose becomes transformed from a firm grip into a gentle touch by the thumb, a lingering drawing away of the little finger, a faint brushing of the subject's hand with the middle finger - just enough vague sensation to attract the attention. As the subject gives attention to the touch of your thumb, you shift to a touch with your little finger. As your subject's attention follows that, you shift to a touch with your middle finger and then again to the thumb.
:*This arousal of attention is merely an arousal without constituting a stimulus for a response.
:*The subject's withdrawal from the handshake is arrested by this attention arousal, which establishes a waiting set, and expectancy.
:*Then almost, but not quite simultaneously (to ensure separate neural recognition), you touch the undersurface of the hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward push. This is followed by a similar utterly slight downward touch, and then I sever contact so gently that the subject does not know exactly when - and the subject's hand is left going neither up nor down, but [[cataleptic]].
:*Termination: If you don't want your subject to know what you are doing, you simply distract their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, "What did you say? I got absentminded there for a moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.
:*Utilisation: Any utilisation leads to increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as a continuation of extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them to look at their hand, which I touch and say "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for [[anesthesia|anaesthesia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Richard Bandler]] was a keen proponent of the handshake induction, and developed his own variant, which is commonly taught in [[Neuro-linguistic Programming|NLP]] workshops.

Any habitual pattern which is interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance. The handshake is a particularly good pattern to interrupt because the formality of a handshake is a widely understood set of social rules. Since everyone knows that it would be impolite to comment on the quality of a handshake, regardless of how strange it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (known as a [[transderivational search]], a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pattern.

=== Resistance ===
Erickson recognised that many people were intimidated by hypnosis and the therapeutic process, and took care to respect the special resistances of the individual patient. In the therapeutic process he said that "you always give the patient every opportunity to resist". Here are some more relevant quotes pertaining to resistance:

:Whatever the behaviour offered by the subjects, it should be accepted and utilized to develop further responsive behaviour. Any attempt to "correct" or alter the subjects' behaviour, or to force them to do things they are not interested in, militates against trance induction and certainly deep trance experience.

If the patient can be led to accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With resistant patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, because they know that they are allowed to respond however they wish.

:Many times, the apparently active resistance encountered in subjects is no more than an unconscious measure of testing the hypnotist's willingness to meet them halfway instead of trying to force them to act entirely in accord with his ideas.

Although the idea of working with resistance is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let ''some'' of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow ''all'' of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.

== Ericksonian therapy ==
Erickson is most famous as a hypnotherapist, but his extensive research into and experience with hypnosis led him to develop an effective therapeutic technique. Many of these techniques are not explicitly hypnotic, but they are extensions of hypnotic strategies and language patterns. Erickson recognised that resistance to trance resembles resistance to change, and developed his therapeutic approach with that awareness.

Haley identified several strategies, which appeared repeatedly in Erickson's therapeutic approach.

* Encouraging Resistance - For Erickson, the classic therapeutic request to "tell me everything about..." was both aggressive and disrespectful, instead he would ask the resistant patient to '''withhold''' information and only to tell what they were really ready to reveal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I usually say, "There are a number of things that you don't want me to know about, that you don't want to tell me. There are a lot of things about yourself that you don't want to discuss, therefore let's discuss those that you '''are''' willing to discuss." She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she '''did''' come to discuss things. And therefore she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it's always "Well, this is all right to talk about." And before she's finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item - "Well, this really isn't so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters." Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Transcription of Interview with Erickson quoted in ''Uncommon Therapy'' by Jay Haley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some people might react to a direction by thinking "why should I?" or "You can't make me", called a ''polarity response'' because it motivates the subject to consider the polar opposite of the suggestion. The conscious mind recognizes negation in speech ("Don't do X") but according to Erickson, the unconscious mind pays more attention to the "X" than the injunction "Don't do". Erickson thus used this as the basis for suggestions that deliberately played on negation and tonally marked the important wording, to provide that whatever the client did, it was beneficial: "You don't have to ''go into a trance'', so you can ''easily wonder'' about what you notice no faster than ''you feel ready'' to become aware that ''your hand is slowly rising''....."

* Providing a Worse Alternative (The 'Double Bind') - Example: "Do you want to go into a trance now, or later?" The '[[double bind]]' is a way of overloading the subject with two options, the acceptance of either of which represents acceptance of a therapeutic suggestion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My first well-remembered intentional use of the double bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf out of the barn to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance on the part of the calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn.&lt;ref&gt;''Varieties of Double Bind'' Erickson &amp; Rossi, The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, January 1975.&lt;br/&gt; Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' Volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Communicating by Metaphor - This is explored extensively in Sydney Rosen's ''My Voice Will Go With You'', but an example is given in the first chapter of David Gordon's book ''Phoenix'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was returning from high school one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past a group of us into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, "Giddy-up." Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. ''I'' didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was '''supposed''' to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, "So '''that's''' how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" I said, "About four miles from here." "How did you know you should come '''here?'''" I said, "I didn't know. The '''horse''' knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erickson's metaphorical strategies can be compared with the [[teaching tales]] of the [[Sufis]] (those of for example the [[Nasreddin]]) and the [[Zen]] tradition of [[Koan]]s, each also designed to act on the unconscious mind.

* Encouraging a Relapse - To bypass simple short-lived "obedience" which tends to lead to lapses in the absence of the therapist, Erickson would occasionally arrange for his patients to ''fail'' in their attempts to improve, for example by overreaching. Failure is part of life, and in that fragile time where the patient is learning to live, think and behave differently, a random failure can be catastrophic. Deliberately causing a relapse allowed Erickson to control the variables of that failure, and to cast it in a positive therapeutic light for the patient.
* Encouraging a Response by Frustrating It - This paradoxical approach acts directly on the patient's own resistance to change. Obese patients are asked to ''gain'' weight, or in a family therapy session, a stubbornly silent family member is ignored until the frustration obliges them to blurt out some desperate truth. Once again, this approach has its roots in Erickson's hypnotic language patterns of the form "I don't want you to go into a trance yet".

Compare this with "Prescribing the Symptom" (below).

* Utilizing Space and Position - Hypnosis and therapy are experienced subjectively by the patient, and any part of their total experience can be used to reinforce an idea. The physical position or even the posture of the patient can be a significant part of the subjective experience. Manipulating these factors can contribute to a therapeutic transformation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I send someone out of the room - for example, the mother and child - I carefully move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Erickson quoted in ''Uncommon Therapy'' by Jay Haley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may be directly compared with [[Fritz Perls]]' use of an "empty chair" as a context for imagined interactions (where the client was often invited to occupy the chair and thus take on the role of the person imagined to be sitting there); [[Bert Hellinger]]'s approach, which requires the client to arrange family members (played by volunteers) in a row or pattern which matches the client's internal understanding, and then to reorganise the row; and [[Virginia Satir]]'s work with tableaux and posture.

* Emphasizing the Positive - Erickson claimed that his sensory "disabilities" (dyslexia, colour blindness, being tone-deaf) helped him to focus on aspects of communication and behavior which most other people overlooked. This is a typical example of emphasizing the positive.

Erickson would often compliment the patient for a symptom, and would even encourage it, in very specific ways. In one amusing example, a woman whose in-laws caused her nauseous feelings in the gut every time they visited unexpectedly was "taught" to vomit spectacularly whenever the visits were especially inconvenient. Naturally the in-laws would always sympathetically help her clean up the vomit. Fairly soon, the annoying relatives started calling in advance before turning up, to see if she were "well enough" to see them.

The subject of dozens of songs, "emphasizing the positive" is a well known self-help strategy, and can be compared with "positive reformulation" in [[Gestalt Therapy]].

* Prescribing the Symptom and Amplifying a Deviation - Very typically, Erickson would instruct his patients to actively and consciously perform the symptom that was bothering them (see the nailbiting example under [[#Resistance]]), usually with some minor or trivial deviation from the original symptom. In many cases, the deviation could be amplified and used as a "wedge" to transform the whole behaviour.
&lt;blockquote&gt;INTERVIEWER: Suppose someone called you and said there was a kid, nineteen or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, but all of a sudden this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.&lt;br&gt;
ERICKSON: Well, if the kid came in to see me, the first thing I would do would be to want to examine the cross. And I would want to improve it in a very minor way. As soon as I got the slightest minor change in it, the way would be open for a larger change. And  pretty soon I could deal with the advantages of a different cross - he ought to have at least two. He ought to have at least three so he could make a choice each day of which one. It's pretty hard to express a psychotic pattern of behavior over an ever-increasing number of crosses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Seeding Ideas - Erickson would often ensure that the patients had been exposed to an idea, often in a metaphorical form (hidden from the conscious mind) in advance of utilizing it for a therapeutic purpose. He called this "seeding ideas", and it can be observed to occur at many levels both coarse and fine grained, in many of his case histories. In a simple example, the question "Have you ever been in a trance ''before''?" seeds the idea that a trance is imminent - the presupposition inherent in the word ''before'' is "not now, but later".
* Avoiding Self-Exploration - In common with most [[brief therapy]] practitioners, Erickson was entirely uninterested in analysing the patient's early psychological development. Occasionally in his case histories, he will briefly discuss the patient's background, but only as much as it pertains to the ''resources'' available to the patient in the present.
&lt;blockquote&gt;INTERVIEWER: You don't feel that exploring the past is particularly relevant? I'm always trying to get clear in my mind how much of the past I need to consider when doing brief therapy.&lt;br&gt;
ERICKSON: You know, I had one patient this last July who had four or five years of psychoanalysis and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, "How much attention did you give to the past?" I said, "You know, I completely forgot about that." That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start at the top of your head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?"&lt;br&gt;
INTERVIEWER: Why did you ask that?&lt;br&gt;
ERICKSON: So that she knew I was really interested.&lt;br&gt;
INTERVIEWER: So that you could join her in this?&lt;br&gt;
ERICKSON: No, so that she knew I was ''really interested''.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Erickson transcribed in ''Uncommon Therapy'' by Jay Haley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shocks and ordeals ===
Erickson is famous for pioneering indirect techniques, but his shock therapy tends to get less attention. Erickson was prepared to use psychological shocks and ordeals in order to achieve given results:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the old gentleman asked if he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could probably scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me that nothing could be worse than his fear of an elevator.&lt;br&gt;
The elevators in that particular building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and thought it would be fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and I had him walk in and out of the elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, I told the girl to close the door and said, "Let's go up."&lt;br&gt;
She went up one story and stopped in between floors. The gentleman started to yell, "What's wrong!" I said, "The elevator operator wants to kiss you." Shocked, the gentleman said, "But I'm a married man!" The girl said, "I don't mind that." She walked toward him, and he stepped back and said, "You start the elevator." So she started it. She went up to about the fourth floor and stopped it again between floors. She said, "I just have a craving for a kiss." He said, "You go about your business." He wanted that elevator moving, not standing still. She replied, "Well, let's go down and start all over again," and she began to take the elevator down. He said, "Not down, up!" since he didn't want to go through ''that'' all over again.&lt;br&gt;
She started up and then stopped the elevator between floors and said, "Do you promise you'll ride down in my elevator with me when you're through work?" He said, "I'll promise anything if you promise not to kiss me." He went up in the elevator, relieved and without fear - of the elevator - and could ride one from then on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Controversy ==
Erickson's work on hypnotism was controversial during his lifetime and has remained so to the present day.  Some of his central presuppositions have been questioned by other researchers and the opaque nature of his explanations has led to a variety of competing interpretations of his approach.

A friend and colleague of Erickson, the hypnosis researcher [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|André Weitzenhoffer]], a prolific and well-respected author in the field of hypnosis himself, has extensively criticised the ideas and influence of Erickson in various writings, such as his textbook ''The Practice of Hypnotism''. Weitzenhoffer displays a clear, and explicitly stated, bias against Ericksonian Hypnosis in his book, in favor of what he terms the semi-traditional, scientific, approach.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzenhoffer, Andre M. (2000). The Practice of Hypnotism&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson|Jeffrey Masson]] dedicated a whole sub-section of his book [[Against Therapy]] to criticism of Milton Erickson.&lt;ref&gt;Masson, Jeffrey  (1988).  Against Therapy: Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing, pp. 268-279&lt;/ref&gt;  Masson questions the accuracy of Erickson's case reports.  Regarding Erickson's report of a female patient who was allegedly hypnotised to have spontaneous orgasms throughout the day, Masson writes, "The whole thing is tinged with fantasy and has a feeling of unreality about it." &lt;ref name="Masson, Jeffrey 1988 p. 276"&gt;Masson, Jeffrey  (1988).  Against Therapy: Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Masson was particularly concerned by Erickson's own reports of cases in which he acted in a manner he felt might be construed as sexually inappropriate.  He even goes so far as to suggest that Erickson may have obtained "sexual pleasure" from cases like the following, where he reports asking a young female client to gradually strip naked in his office, allegedly as a psychotherapeutic exercise. It is to note, however, that Mrs Erickson was present in the room. Furthermore, Erickson presents the case as illustrating the power of shock therapy against inhibitions and rigidities of character, claiming his technique has freed the patient from her incapacity to marry her fiancé.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now you need to know how to undress and go to bed in the presence of a man.  So start undressing."  Slowly, in an almost automatic fashion, she undressed.  I had her show me her right breast, her left breast, her right nipple, her left nipple.  Her belly button.  Her genital area.  Her knees.  Her gluteal [buttock] regions.  I asked her to point where she would like to have her husband kiss her.  I had her turn around [naked].  I had her dress slowly.  She dressed.  I dismissed her.&lt;ref name="Masson, Jeffrey 1988 p. 276"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Masson also notes that Erickson, as a psychiatrist in the Arizona State Hospital, was an enthusiastic advocate of the use of restraints, a subject which he delivered a well-attended talk on, and frequently had patients confined by straitjackets.  Masson cites various instances of Erickson's behaviour toward psychiatric patients which he considers "cruel, crude jokes".  Referring to Erickson's authoritarian approach as "prison-camp therapy" and "therapist-as-boss", Masson concludes, "It is not surprising that Erickson succumbed to the opportunity to abuse his patients, as the examples quoted make clear."&lt;ref&gt;Masson, Jeffrey  (1988).  Against Therapy: Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing, pp. 2278-279&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-professed "skeptical hypnotist" Alex Tsander cited Masson's concerns in his 2005 book ''Beyond Erickson: A Fresh Look at "The Emperor of Hypnosis"'', the title of which alludes to Charcot's characterisation in the previous century as "The Emperor of the Neuroses". Tsander re-evaluates a swathe of Erickson's accounts of his therapeutic approaches and lecture demonstrations in the context of scientific literature on hypnotism and his own experience in giving live demonstrations of hypnotic technique. Emphasising social-psychological perspectives, Tsander introduces an "interpretive filter" with which he re-evaluates Erickson's own accounts of his demonstrations and introduces prosaic explanations for occurrences that both Erickson and other authors tend to portray as remarkable.

== Influence on others ==
Erickson's friend, and sometime collaborator, [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|Andre Weitzenhoffer]], a well-known hypnosis researcher himself, has repeatedly raised concerns over the nature of Erickson's legacy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of today's Ericksonians consist of individuals who have never known Erickson, even less been directly trained by him.  Today, and for some time now, much of the teaching of the Ericksonian approach is and has been done by individuals who have acquired their knowledge second and third hand. [...] Some of those who did spend time with Erickson, like Jeffrey Zeig, Ernest Rossi, and [[Bill O'Hanlon|William O'Hanlon]] have tried, I believe, to present and preserve as much as they could what they believed and have understood Erickson's thought and methods to be.  They have succeeded to do so to a fair degree.  Others, like Richard Bandler and John Grinder have on the other hand, offered a much adulterated, and at times fanciful, version of what they perceived Erickson as saying and doing guided by their personal theorizing. [...] Further distortions have resulted outside of the United States due to translation problems as well as for other reasons.  More and more the Ericksonians have become a heterogeneous group of practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzenhoffer, A., The Practice of Hypnotism, 2000: 592-593.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of his first students and developers of his work was [[Jay Haley]]. Other important followers include Stephen Gilligan, [[Jeffrey K. Zeig]], [http://www.billohanlon.com Bill O'Hanlon], Michele Ritterman and [[Stephen R. Lankton]].

Erickson was [[Modeling (NLP)|modeled]] (see [[Methods of neuro-linguistic programming#Milton model|Milton model]]) by [[Richard Bandler]] and [[John Grinder]], the co-founders of [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP). As a result of the success of their research Erickson contributed the foreword to their book ''Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D.''.&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sphere of business coaching and training, he influenced the methods that behaviour training companies use in communicating with clients and training participants.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Tenshin [[Reb Anderson]] of the Zen tradition has referred to Erickson as a "Magician/Healer." &lt;ref&gt;[http://rebtalks.proper.com/2012-07-12%20Yoga%20Room%20-%20Facing%20Change%20and%20Realizing%20Peace.mp3 Facing Change and Realizing Peace, 7-12-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stacey Mitchell''' (1990 – 18 December 2006) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born girl living in [[Australia]] who was murdered at the age of 16, on 18 December 2006, by [[lesbian]] couple Jessica Stasinowsky (born 1985) and Valerie Parashumti (born 1987). She was bludgeoned with a concrete block and [[Strangling|strangled]] with a chain. Her corpse was found in a [[Waste container|wheelie bin]] shortly afterwards. Stasinowsky and Parashumti had known Mitchell for three days, and claimed they murdered her because they found her irritating.&lt;ref name="bbcasia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7282776.stm |title=Jail for Australian kiss killers |publisher=BBC News |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Stacey Mitchell was born in [[Dorset]], [[England]], but emigrated to [[Australia]] at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7148237.stm |title=Women kill 'irritating' teenager |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, she ran away from her family home and stayed with 19-year-old Parashumti and 21-year-old Stasinowsky.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/07/internationalcrime.australia |title=Vampire-obsessed couple jailed for life for 'sexually perverse' murder |work=The Guardian |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parashumti was accused by Stasinowsky of flirting with Mitchell. She planned to kill Mitchell to prove to Stasinowsky she was not attracted to her. The three of them spent the evening drinking [[whisky]] before Parashumti hit Mitchell over the back of the head with a concrete block. Stasinowsky then [[Strangling|strangled]] her with a dog chain. As she lay dying, the two women kissed over her body and filmed her on a [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Earlier attempts to kill Mitchell by Stasinowsky included putting broken glass in her drink and spilling oil on the bathroom floor.&lt;ref name="giggles" /&gt;

==Trial==
The two women were tried at the [[Perth]] Supreme Court. During the trial they "smiled, giggled and whispered at each other".&lt;ref name="giggles"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alana |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/lesbian-murderers-giggle-at-details/story-e6frfkp9-1111115399635 |title=Lesbian murderers giggle at details |publisher=News.com.au |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parashumti's lawyer stated that she had a severe [[personality disorder]] and had grown up with an abusive father. She had also had an obsession with the vampire sub-culture, and a penchant for drinking people's blood since the age of 10.&lt;ref name="bbcasia" /&gt; Parashumti's father had previously been in prison for beating his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=DEADLY WOMEN {{!}} Fatal Attraction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQKgR_OLHF0|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both women pleaded guilty, and revealed that after Mitchell's death, they had visited a hardware store to look for a [[chainsaw]] and some [[spade]]s.&lt;ref name="perthnow1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/why-stacey-was-murdered/story-e6frg13u-1111114947413|title=Why Stacey was murdered|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, both women were sentenced to strict security [[life imprisonment]], with a 24-year minimum term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-03-07/women-jailed-for-24-years-for-murdering-teenage/1065590|title=Women jailed for 24 years for murdering teenage friend|date=7 March 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stasinowsky subsequently appealed her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cardy |first=Todd |url=http://www.news.com.au/news/killer-appeals-24-year-term/story-fna7dq6e-1111115919771 |title=Jessica Stasinowsky appeals 24-year murder sentence |publisher=News.com.au |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appeal was unanimously rejected by the [[Western Australia|WA]] Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/sadistic-killers-sentence-upheld/news-story/dd80ee37ee3a848681d55d41df8a87ef|title=Sadistic killer's sentence upheld|work=NewsComAu|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ross John Haynes, who also lived with them, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for being an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]]. Although he had been fully aware of the plan to kill Mitchell, he agreed to go to his bedroom and listen to music.&lt;ref name="perthnow1"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==

It was discovered in 2009 that the two women were continuing their relationship in prison, reportedly spending up to 90 minutes together on weekdays, and seven hours a day on weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/vampire-killers-to-be-split-vow/story-e6frg12c-1111118111984|title=Vampire killers to be split: vow|newspaper=NewsComAu|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/security-check-for-greenough/news-story/a37414f54670823301b852aa7229e85a|title=Security check for Greenough|newspaper=NewsComAu|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parashumti was consequently moved to a separate prison.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Housemate killer's old charges dropped|url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/22157905/housemate-killers-old-charges-dropped/|accessdate = 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to maintain contact by sending letters, using fellow inmate [[Catherine Birnie]] as a go-between.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/killers-love-letter-discovered-ng-ya-228250|title=Killer's love letter discovered|date=7 December 2009|work=The West Australian|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, three prison officers were injured, following their intervention in a fight involving Parashumti and another inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/prison-officers-injured-in-lesbian-killer-fight-20121113-29a0q.html|title=Prison officers injured in lesbian killer fight|newspaper=WA Today|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Parashumti attempted to escape from prison, but failed to leave the grounds. It was reported she would consequently face a police charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Escape bid killer left in same prison|url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/17463926/escape-bid-killer-left-in-same-prison/|accessdate = 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7616">'''Occupational cancer''' is cancer caused by [[occupational hazard]]s. Several cancers have been directly tied to occupational hazards, including [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]], [[mesothelioma]], and others.

==Common occupational hazards implicated in cancer==
Occupational exposure to chemicals, dusts, radiation, and certain industrial processes have been tied to occupational cancer. Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, also called [[Carcinogens]], may cause [[mutation]]s that allow cells to grow out of control, causing cancer. Carcinogens in the workplace may include chemicals like [[aniline]]s, [[chromate]]s, [[dinitrotoluene]]s, [[arsenic]] and inorganic arsenic compounds, [[beryllium]] and beryllium compounds, [[cadmium]] compounds, and [[nickel]] compounds.&lt;ref name="Carcinogens"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/npotocca.html |title = Carcinogen List |date = 2 May 2012 |accessdate = 5 January 2014 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dusts that can cause cancer leather or wood dusts, [[asbestos]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@nho/documents/document/occupationandcancerpdf.pdf|title = Occupation and Cancer|date = January 2016|access-date = 12 February 2016|website = American Cancer Society|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; crystalline forms of [[silica]], [[coal tar]] pitch volatiles, [[coke oven]] emissions, [[diesel exhaust]] and environmental [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name="Carcinogens" /&gt; [[sunlight]]; [[Radon|radon gas]]; and industrial, medical, or other exposure to ionizing radiation can all cause cancer in the workplace. Industrial processes associated with cancer include aluminum production; iron and steel founding; and underground mining with exposure to uranium or radon. [[Shift work]], which can disturb the [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] rhythm, has also been identified as a risk factor for some forms of cancer, in particular for breast cancer. &lt;ref name="pmid19605423"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fritschi L | title = Shift work and cancer | journal = BMJ | volume = 339 | issue = | pages = b2653 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19605423 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2653|issn = 0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20962033"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens RG, Hansen J, Costa G, Haus E, Kauppinen T, Aronson KJ, Castaño-Vinyals G, Davis S, Frings-Dresen MH, Fritschi L, Kogevinas M, Kogi K, Lie JA, Lowden A, Peplonska B, Pesch B, Pukkala E, Schernhammer E, Travis RC, Vermeulen R, Zheng T, Cogliano V, Straif K|display-authors = 6 | title = Considerations of circadian impact for defining 'shift work' in cancer studies: IARC Working Group Report | journal = Occup Environ Med | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–62 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20962033 |issn = 1351-0711| doi = 10.1136/oem.2009.053512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16084719"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Megdal SP, Kroenke CH, Laden F, Pukkala E, Schernhammer ES | title = Night work and breast cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Eur.

* Personal characteristics such as age, sex, and race
* Family history of cancer
* Diet and personal habits such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption
* The presence of certain medical conditions or past medical treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or some immune-system suppressing drugs.
* Exposure to cancer-causing agents in the environment (for example, sunlight, radon gas, air pollution, and infectious agents)

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 48,000 cancers are diagnosed yearly in the US that come from occupational causes; this represents approximately 4-10% of total cancer in the United States.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/default.html |title = Occupational Cancer |date = 2 May 2012 |accessdate = 5 January 2014 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 19% of cancers globally are attributed to environmental exposures (including work-related exposures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental and occupational cancers|url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs350/en/|website = World Health Organization|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Many occupational cancers are preventable. Personal protective gear, workplace controls, and worker education can prevent exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. Tobacco smoking has also been shown to increase the risk of work-related cancers; decreasing or abstaining from smoking can decrease cancer risk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Agencies like the [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] have developed safety standards and limits for chemical and radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''Personal practice model (PPM)''' is a [[social work]] tool for understanding and linking theories to each other and to the practical tasks of social work.

Mullen&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1983"&gt;Mullen, E. J. (1983). Personal practice models in clinical social work. In A. Rosenblatt &amp; D. Waldfogel (Eds.), Handbook of clinical social work. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the PPM  as “the art and science of social work”, or more prosaically, “an explicit conceptual scheme that expresses a worker's view of practice”.  A worker should develop a PPM pragmatically over their entire career by reflecting on, and the absorption of, a variety of sources.  They are an important basis for the delivery of good practice and the evaluation of such.  Bowles, Collingridge, Curry and Valentine  &lt;ref&gt;Bowles, W., Collingridge, M., Curry, S. and Valentine, B. (2006). Ethical Practice in Social Work:An Applied Approach. Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; stress the importance of deriving the guidelines for good practice from a text such as the [[Australian Association of Social Workers]] Code of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Association of Social Workers (2000). Code of Ethics.  Canberra: Australian Association of Social Workers.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name implies, they are fundamentally personal and idiosyncratic, and to be effective, they must be rationally constructed, by a self-conscious worker.  Fook &lt;ref&gt;Fook, J. (2002). Social Work: Critical Theory and Practice. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the need to maintain “a broader vision of the mission of social work” to transcend  everyday workplace distractions.

Mullen proposes that a PPM should be constructed from both theory and research.

He first detailed the process for using research findings for PPM development in his 1978 publication&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, E.J. (1978). Construction of personal models for effective practice: A method for utilizing research findings to guide social interventions. Journal of Social Service Research, 2(1), 45-63.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes a systematic process for reviewing research findings "--- to facilitate individual student and practitioner use of research findings to construct personal working models of social intervention. The methodology is composed of five interrelated steps: (a) identification of substantive findings concerning intervention variables and their effects on clients; (b) identification of the quality and limitations of the evidence; (c) development of summary generalizations; (d) deduction of practice guidelines; and (e) specification of an evaluation plan to monitor the outcomes when practice guidelines are implemented with individual client systems. Social interventions are conceptualized as open systems whose effects on clients are a function of environmental, organizational, intervenor, technological, and focus components in interaction with client qualities. A systems framework serves the heuristic purpose of structuring the research utilization process." p.&amp;nbsp;45

Mullen presents a detailed description with examples of how theories can be used in PPM in his 1981 and 1988 publications&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1988 pp. 503-533"&gt;Mullen, E. J. (1988). Constructing Personal Practice Modes. In R. M. Grinnell, Jr. (Ed.), Social work research and evaluation, 3rd ed. pp. 503-533. Itasca, Ill.: F.E.  Peacock Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1981 pp. 606-632"&gt;Mullen, E. J. (1981). Development of personal intervention models. In R. M. Grinnell, Jr. (Ed.), Social work research and evaluation, 1st ed., pp. 606-632. Itasca, Ill.: F.E.  Peacock Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mullen&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1988 pp. 503-533"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1981 pp. 606-632"/&gt; describes the dimensions and sub-dimension of a PPM, outlined below.  A PPM should include all elements of social work theory, linking what Payne &lt;ref name=payne&gt;Payne, M. (2005). '' Modern Social Work Theory''. Hampshire: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; describes as the three tiers; models of practice, explanatory theory and world perspectives.

==Dimensions of the model==

===Social Welfare and the Profession===
This requires a practitioner to have an understanding of the concept of [[social welfare]], and the role of social work within this concept as well as any specialisations of social work.

===Social Work===
A practitioner needs to understand the missions and objectives of social work, as well as philosophies that underpin it.

===Clients===
A PPM needs to explain how the model centres around clients, and conceptualisation of the clients that is in line with the philosophies of social work.

===Practitioner===
The use of self is fundamental to social work, and a practitioner needs to be self-conscious, and know what parts of themselves to use in practice, and which to leave out.

===Relationship===
The relationship between client and practitioner is the most crucial workspace in social work, and the context that the relationship occurs is therefore a vital part of a PPM.  A practitioner needs to consider which elements of a relationship are important, and which may be contrary to the notion of social work.

===Agency===
The strengths and shortfalls of an agency can greatly help or hamper the social work process, and a worker needs to be aware of these to maximise the agency's benefit to the client.

===Technique===
The technique a social worker uses is defined by all the preceding dimensions.  The processes that a social worker uses needs to be consistent with the orienting theories that form their conception of social work.

===Monitoring and Evaluation===
{{main|Monitoring and Evaluation}}

To maintain a validity with a PPM, social workers need a systemic plan that takes into account the relevance and effectiveness of practice.

==Strengths and weaknesses of the concept==

Payne &lt;ref name=payne/&gt; identified that an eclectic approach to theory has the benefits of increasing a workers effectiveness, but that this should not come at the expense of being “internally inconsistent or debas(ing) the full theory.”  Mullen&lt;ref name="Mullen, E. J. 1983"/&gt; offers several criticisms of PPMs, that they are duplicative, time consuming and overly subjective.  He offers responses to these three points, firstly in refuting the claim that they simply duplicate existing General Practice Models (GPM).  A PPM allows for development and tweaking of GPMs, making them more relevant to individual practice.  He concedes that they can be time consuming, but mostly in their inception, and that maintaining and developing them is much easier.  As for the subjectivity of a PPM, workers need to be aware of this, and critically engaged with GPMs to bring esoteric theory and research into contact with everyday practice.

Last Revised: 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; is the closeness of the agreement between the results of successive [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] carried 
out under the same conditions of measurement. &lt;ref name=GUM&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the measurements are taken by a single person or [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time. A less-than-perfect test–retest reliability causes '''test–retest variability'''. Such [[statistical variability|variability]] can be caused by, for example, [[intra-individual variability]] and [[intra-observer variability]]. A measurement may be said to be ''repeatable'' when this variation is smaller than a pre-determined acceptance criterion.

Test–retest variability is practically used, for example, in [[medical monitoring]] of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined "critical difference", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments.&lt;ref name=Fraser1989&gt;{{Cite journal

*the same experimental tools
*the same observer
*the same measuring instrument, used under the same conditions
*the same location
*repetition over a short period of time.
*same objectives
Repeatability methods were developed by Bland and Altman (1986).&lt;ref&gt;http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[correlation]] between separate administrations of the test is high (e.g. 0.7 or higher as in [[Internal consistency|this Cronbach's alpha-internal consistency-table]]&lt;ref&gt;George, D., &amp; Mallery, P. (2003). SPSS for Windows step by step: A simple guide and reference. 11.0 update (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;), then it has good test–retest reliability.

The repeatability coefficient is a precision measure which represents the value below which the [[absolute difference]] between two repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%.

The [[standard deviation]] under repeatability conditions is part of [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] and [[accuracy]].

==Attribute agreement analysis for defect databases==
An attribute agreement analysis is designed to simultaneously evaluate the impact of repeatability and [[reproducibility]] on accuracy. It allows the analyst to examine the responses from multiple reviewers as they look at several scenarios multiple times. It produces statistics that evaluate the ability of the appraisers to agree with themselves (repeatability), with each other ([[reproducibility]]), and with a known master or correct value (overall accuracy) for each characteristic – over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/measurement-systems-analysis-msa-gage-rr/attribute-agreement-analysis-defect-databases/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological testing==

Because the same test is administered twice and every test is parallel with itself, differences between scores on the test and scores on the retest should be due solely to measurement error. This sort of argument is quite probably true for many physical measurements. However, this argument is often inappropriate for psychological measurement, because it is often impossible to consider the second administration of a test a parallel measure to the first.&lt;ref name=David&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidshofer|first=Kevin R. Murphy, Charles O.|title=Psychological testing : principles and applications|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-189172-3|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second administration of a psychological test might yield systematically different scores than the first administration due to the following reasons:&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

# The attribute that is being measured may change between the first test and the retest. For example, a reading test that is administered in September to a third grade class may yield different results when retaken in June. One would expect some change in children's reading ability over that span of time, a low test–retest correlation might reflect real changes in the attribute itself.
# The experience of taking the test itself can change a person's true score. For example, completing an anxiety inventory could serve to increase a person's level of anxiety.
# [[Carryover effect]], particularly if the interval between test and retest is short. When retested, people may remember their original answer, which could affect answers on the second administration.

{{psychology sidebar}}
A '''self-report inventory''' is a type of [[psychological test]] in which a person fills out a survey or [[questionnaire]] with or without the help of an investigator. Self-report inventories often ask direct questions about personal interests, values, [[symptoms]], [[behaviors]], and traits or [[personality types]]. Inventories are different from tests in that there is no objectively correct answer; responses are based on opinions and subjective perceptions. Most self-report inventories are brief and can be taken or administered within five to 15 minutes, although some, such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), can take several hours to fully complete.  They are popular because they can be inexpensive to give and to score, and their scores can often show good [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]].

There are three major approaches to developing self-report inventories: theory-guided, [[factor analysis]], and criterion-keyed.  Theory-guided inventories are constructed around a theory of personality or a prototype of a construct.  Factor analysis uses statistical methods to organize groups of related items into subscales. Criterion-keyed inventories include questions that have been shown to statistically discriminate between a comparison group and a criterion group, such as people with clinical diagnoses of depression versus a control group.

Items could use any of several formats: a [[Likert scale|Likert scale with ranked options]], true-false, or forced choice, although other formats such as sentence completion or visual analog scales are possible. True-false involves questions that the individual denotes as either being true or false about themselves.  Forced-choice is a set of statements that require the individual to choose one as being most representative of themselves.

If the inventory includes items from different factors or constructs, the items can be mixed together or kept in groups. Sometimes the way people answer the item will change depending on the context offered by the neighboring items.

==Personality inventories==
'''Self-report personality inventories''' 
* '''Personality assessment tests''' that include questions dealing with situations, symptoms, and feelings. Test-takers-are asked to indicate how well each item describes themselves or how much they agree with each item.&lt;ref name="Gregory2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Gregory|title=Psychological Testing: History, Principles, and Applications|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Gregory-Psychological-Testing-History-Principles-and-Applications-7th-Edition/PGM332874.html|edition=7th|year=2013|publisher=Pearson/A and B|isbn=978-0205959259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honesty of response may be the major problem with the self-report personality tests. Test questions are often transparent, and people can usually figure out how to respond to make themselves appear to possess whatever qualities they think the organization wants. In addition, people may falsify good responses, be biased towards their positive characteristics, or falsify bad, stressing negative characteristics, in order to obtain their preferred outcome.&lt;ref name="Lambert2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Elizabeth Lambert|title=Identifying Faking on Self-report Personality Inventories: Relative Merits of Traditional Lie Scales, New Lie Scales, Response Patterns, and Response Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pq1CnwEACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Queen's University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of self-report inventories for assessing anger and aggression have been published.&lt;ref name="BellackHersen2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=Philip H.|last2=Weisser|first2=Charles E.|last3=Balleweg|first3=Bernard J.|editor=Alan S. Bellack and Michel Hersen|title=Handbook of Clinical Behavior Therapy with Adults|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCWSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA605|year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-2427-0|page=605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
The biggest problem with self-report inventories is that patients may exaggerate symptoms in order to make their situation seem worse, or they may under-report the severity or frequency of symptoms in order to minimize their problems. For this reason, self-report inventories are more often used primarily for measuring levels of traits, or for symptom severity and change. Inventories should not be used in isolation to diagnose a mental disorder. They should be verified by other assessment data. Clinical discretion is advised for all self-report inventories.&lt;ref name="SegalHersen2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segal|first1=Daniel L. |last2=Hersen|first2=Michel |title=Diagnostic Interviewing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfDRjsei03kC&amp;pg=PA209|edition=4th|year=2009|publisher=Springer |location=USA|isbn=978-1-4419-1319-7|page=209|chapter=10. Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the [[social desirability bias]], which can cause over-reporting of socially desirable and under-reporting of socially undesirable behaviors.

Many personality tests, such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]] or the [[MBTI]] add questions that are designed to make it difficult for a person to exaggerate traits and symptoms. However, these tests suffer from the inherent problems associated with personality theory and testing, in that personality is a fluid concept that can be difficult to define.

The '''Social Interaction Anxiety Scale''' ('''SIAS''') is a self-report scale that measures distress when meeting and talking with others &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattick|first1=R.P.|last2=Clarke|first2=J.C.|title=Development and validation of measures of social phobia scrutiny fear and social interaction anxiety|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=1998|volume=36|issue=4|pages=455–470|pmid=9670605|doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(97)10031-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is widely used in clinical settings and among [[social anxiety]] researchers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of the Psychometric Properties of Two Short Forms of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale|url = http://asm.sagepub.com/content/21/3/312|journal = Assessment|date = 2014-06-01|issn = 1073-1911|pmid = 24497625|pages = 312–323|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1073191114521279|first = Allura L.

==Question breakdown, scoring and interpretation==
Questions of the SIAS assess a clients' fear of interacting in social situations, gauge emotional aspects of the anxiety response, and do not refer to social apprehensiveness or concern about others' opinions in a general sense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though related, social interaction anxiety is different from social phobia which is defined as anxiety surrounding fear of being scrutinized in a social situation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The scale contains 20 items.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Safren|first1=S.A.|last2=Turk|first2=C.L.|last3=Heimerg|first3=R.G.|title=Factor structure of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=1998|volume=36|issue=4|pages=443–453|pmid=9670604|doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(98)00032-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client rates how much each item relates to them on a 5-point scale as follows:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''0 points''': Not at all characteristic of me
* '''1 point''': Slightly characteristic of me
* '''2 points''': Moderately characteristic of me
* '''3 points''':  Very characteristic of me
* '''4 points''':  Extremely characteristic of me

The point values of the chosen answer choices are then summed to produce a total measure score.

Sample items include "I worry about not knowing what to say in social situations" or "I am tense mixing in a group".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Clinical use==
The SIAS measures social interaction anxiety, which refers to distress when meeting and talking with other people, whether they be friends, members of the opposite sex, or strangers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main concerns include fears of being inarticulate, sounding boring, sounding stupid, not knowing what to say or how to respond, and being ignored.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scale specifically assesses anxiety experienced while interacting with others, not social phobia, which is more specifically fear of scrutiny when performing a task or being observed by others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The SIAS is similar to the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), a measure that mores specifically assesses social phobia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, though the measure is not created to measure social phobia specifically, those with social phobia score high on the SIAS as social phobia and social interaction anxiety are related.

The measure is able to discriminate between a normal population and a population that experiences social interaction anxiety, giving it substantial clinical utility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Validation of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale across the anxiety disorder|journal = Psychological Assessment|pages = 21–27|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/1040-3590.9.1.21|first = Elissa J.|last = Brown|first2 = Julia|last2 = Turovsky|first3 = Richard G.|last3 = Heimberg|first4 = Harlan R.|last4 = Juster|first5 = et|last5 = al|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in clinics as a self-report screening tool in order to see if clients possess any social interaction anxiety. The SIAS discriminates between social anxiety and general anxiety as it has low associations with trait anxiety (a level of stress associated with an individual personality) and general distress.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|pages = 249–264|volume = 20|issue = 3|doi = 10.1023/a:1023067302227|first = Augustine|last = Osman|first2 = Peter M.|last2 = Gutierrez|first3 = Francisco X.|last3 = Barrios|first4 = Beverly A.|last4 = Kopper|first5 = Christine E.|last5 = Chiros|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond identifying those who experience social anxiety of some form, the scale can discriminate within the [[social anxiety]] class as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients with [[Social Phobia|social phobia]] score higher on the SIAS than other patients with another anxiety disorder, such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or no disorder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, patients with [[panic disorder]] and [[agoraphobia]] score higher than patients with [[specific phobia]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Reliability and validity==
The SIAS has a [[normal distribution]] of scores, with those that experience social interaction anxiety scoring high, supporting the view that the scale identifies general fear regarding social interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Reliability===
Evaluated through [[Cronbach's alpha]], the SIAS demonstrates high levels of [[internal consistency]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Short Forms of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00223891.2012.660291|journal = Journal of Personality Assessment|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0022-3891|pmid = 22369684|pages = 310–320|volume = 94|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/00223891.2012.660291|first = Thomas A.|last = Fergus|first2 = David P.|last2 = Valentiner|first3 = Patrick B.|last3 = McGrath|first4 = Stephanie L.|last4 = Gier-Lonsway|first5 = Hyun-Soo|last5 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Assessment of anxiety in social interaction and being observed by others: The social interaction anxiety scale and the social phobia scale|last = Heimberg|first = Richard G|date = 1992|journal = Behavior therapy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that different items on the test are correlated. In addition, the scale has high test-retest reliability, as it continues to correctly identify social anxiety and phobia after a period of time has passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Validity===
The scale has high [[discriminant validity]];&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; not only is it able to discriminate between those with social phobia and healthy volunteers,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; but also between several different types of social phobia and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The SIAS is significantly correlated with the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), consistent with the observation that social interaction fears and social phobia scrutiny fears co-exist,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; although they are still two different sets of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is strongly related to other related measures of social anxiety and social phobia,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; including the [[Liebowitz social anxiety scale|Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale]] (LSAS),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mini Social Phobia Inventory (mini-SPIN),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale (FPES),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the Interaction Anxiousness Scale.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, there are moderate to high correlations between the SIAS and other scales testing [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[locus of control]], which are all related to social anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, the SIAS responds to change and improvement in symptoms due to treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Limitations==
Although the SIAS is used widely in clinical psychology, it is not without its limitations. Because the scale is self-report subjects are able to falsify responses in order to be socially desirable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, most items of the scale are scored in the same direction, allowing room for [[response bias]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also difficult to discriminate between the fears of someone who experiences [[social anxiety]] and the more general worries of a patient with [[generalized anxiety disorder]], as patients who suffer from both disorders score higher on the SIAS than those with just social phobias.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The SIAS is highly correlated with the SPS, suggesting that subjects from the community may not discriminate between the types of situations assessed in the two scales.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, this limitation is not present among undergraduates or patients with [[Social Phobia|social phobia]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The SIAS has not been adequately assessed among an African American population, which is necessary as some concerns addressed in the SIAS may be more related to perceived scrutiny associated with being a member of a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychometric properties of the social phobia and social interaction anxiety scales: Evidence of construct equivalence in an African American sample|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0887618514000966|journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders|pages = 633–643|volume = 28|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.07.003|pmid = 25124500|first = Michele M.|last = Carter|first2 = Tracy|last2 = Sbrocco|first3 = Dickson|last3 = Tang|first4 = Frances M.|last4 = Rekrut|first5 = Caitlin|last5 = Condit|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''State Revolving Fund''' (SRF) is a fund administered by a [[U.S. state]] for the purpose of providing low-interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure (e.g., [[sewage treatment]], [[stormwater]] management facilities, [[drinking water]] treatment), as well as for the implementation of [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]] pollution control and [[estuary]] protection projects. A SRF receives its initial capital from federal grants and state contributions. It then emits [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] that are guaranteed by the initial capital. It then "revolves" through the repayment of principal and the payment of interest on outstanding loans. There are currently two SRFs, the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]] created in 1987 under the [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 601, {{USC|33|1381}} ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Drinking Water State Revolving Fund]] created in 1997 under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, Section 1452, {{USC|42|300j-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the implementation of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program, following passage of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA underwent a process of evaluating the adequacy of state public water systems. The agency’s goal was to devolve primacy for drinking water quality management to states that were prepared to accept the responsibility, and to use the new funds provided by Congress in EPA’s budget to give states financial support.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=17 Transcript] (see pages 17-19).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World ''''' is a 2001 [[nonfiction book]] by journalist [[Michael Pollan]]. Pollan presents case studies that mirror four types of human desires that are reflected in the way that we [[Artificial selection|selectively grow]], breed, and genetically engineer our plants. The [[tulip]], beauty; [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], intoxication; the [[apple]], sweetness; and the [[potato]], control.

The stories range from the true story of [[Johnny Appleseed]] to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated [[List of cannabis strains|marijuana hybrids]] in [[Amsterdam]] to the paradigm-shifting possibilities of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] potatoes. Pollan also discusses the limitations of [[monoculture]] agriculture: specifically, the adoption in Ireland of a single breed of potato (the [[Irish Lumper]]) made the Irish vulnerable to a fungus to which it had no resistance, resulting in the [[Irish Potato Famine]]. The Peruvians from whom the Irish had gotten the potato grew hundreds of varieties, so their exposure to any given pest was slight.

The Ride to Conquer Cancer was created in 2008 as a "mega-event" fundraiser in support of The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario. It is an annual charity fundraiser held in various locations across Canada and Australia. It is organized as a non-competitive cycling event that sees thousands of riders travel over 200 kilometres (120 mi) over two days. It was first held in the Toronto area in 2008 and raised $14 million for the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Following the success of the first Ride, the event spread to Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver beginning in 2009, and to Brisbane in 2011. In 2017, a new Canadian Ride to Conquer Canada record of $20.5 million was raised. Over the 11-year history of the Ride over $175 million has been raised in Ontario and over $390 million across Canada. It has been the number one Peer-to-Peer fundraising brand in Canada for four consecutive years. Differing from other fundraisers, the event focused on having a relatively small number of participants raise considerably more money in support of cancer research. Each participant is required to raise a minimum of $2,500 in order to ride.

==Organization==
The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre has 12 site groups and 26 specialty clinics, and more than 3,000 staff who see over 400,000 patient visits every year. 850,000 square feet of clinical space house 202 inpatient beds, 16 linear accelerators, a state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance-guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) suite, and two Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion units, making it one of the largest comprehensive cancer treatment facilities in the world and the largest radiation treatment centre in Canada.
Princess Margaret sees over 1,000 patients every day and has the capacity to deliver diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up care to close to 200,000 patients and their families every year. In 2016, we saw 17,751 new patients. Among the services provided this past year, we delivered 6,031 cancer surgeries, as well as 37,754 system therapy visits, 91,517 radiation visits, and 428 stem cell transplants.
Through ongoing research, education and innovation, Princess Margaret continues to be on the frontiers of medical, surgical and radiation oncology, embracing the latest technology and international best-practices and setting standards for patient care.

===Ontario===
The Ontario Ride starts in either Toronto or Niagara Falls. All Riders will meet in Hamilton on the Saturday for the night and then ride to Niagara Falls Sunday morning all together. The 2019 Ride, June 8-9, is highly anticipated due to its ongoing success and new Ride options. There is now a Virtual Ride Option and One Day Ride Option with two starting locations (Toronto Exhibition Centre and Niagara Falls). The 2018 Ride was the 11-year anniversary raising an incredible $18.3 million and garnered a lot of attention from past, present and future Riders. In 2017, 5,042 Riders raised a record-breaking $20.5 Million for Princess Margaret. In 2016, it raised $17.5 million with 4253 Riders. In 2014, 5,212 riders raised $20 million in support of The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

===British Columbia===
The British Columbia Ride originates in [[Vancouver]], and crosses into the United States to finish in [[Seattle]].  Nearly 2,642 Riders raised $10.4 million in 2013 in support of the B.C.

'''''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions''''' (1899), by [[Thorstein Veblen]], is a treatise on economics and a detailed, social critique of [[conspicuous consumption]], as a function of [[social class]] and of [[consumerism]], derived from the [[social stratification]] of people and the [[division of labour]], which are the social institutions of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] period (9th – 15th centuries) that have continued to the [[Modern history|modern era]].

That the contemporary [[Feudal land tenure|lords of the manor]], the businessmen who own the [[means of production]], have employed themselves in the economically unproductive practices of conspicuous consumption and [[conspicuous leisure]], which are useless activities that contribute neither to the economy nor to the material production of the useful goods and services required for the functioning of society; while it is the [[middle class]] and the [[working class]] who are usefully employed in the industrialised, productive occupations that support the whole of society.

Conducted in the late 19th century, Veblen's socio-economic analyses of the [[business cycle]]s and the consequent [[price]] politics of the U.S. economy, and of the emergent division of labour, by [[technocracy|technocratic]] speciality – [[scientist]], [[engineer]], [[Industrial technology|technologist]], ''et al.'' – proved to be accurate, sociological predictions of the economic structure of an industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Third Edition (1987) p. 970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
'''''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions''''' (1899) presents the evolutionary development of human institutions (social and economic) that shape society, such as how the citizens earn their livelihoods, wherein [[technology]] and the [[industrial arts]] are the creative forces of economic production. That such production of goods and services was not merely the means of meeting the [[materialism|material]] needs of society, but of earning profits for the owners of the [[means of production]]. That the industrial production system required the workers (men and women) to be diligent, efficient, and co-operative, whilst the owners (businessmen and businesswomen) concerned themselves with making money and with the public display of their accumulated wealth; and that such behaviours ([[conspicuous consumption]] and [[conspicuous leisure]]) survived from the predatory, barbarian past of the [[Tribe|tribal stage]] of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Encyclopædia Britannica", 15th Edition. Volume 12, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociology and economics applied by Veblen show the dynamic, intellectual influences of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Herbert Spencer]];&lt;ref name = "Ritzer 2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritzer|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, his theories of socio-economics emphasize evolution and development as characteristics of human institutions.&lt;ref name = "Gross 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Veblen criticised contemporary (19th-century) economic theories as intellectually static and [[Hedonism|hedonistic]], and said that economists should take account of how people behave, socially and culturally, rather than rely upon the abstractions of theoretic deduction to explain the economic behaviours of society.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritzer|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[neoclassical economics]] define people as [[rational agent]]s who seek [[utility]] and maximal pleasure from their economic activities, Veblen perceived people as irrational, economic agents who pursue [[social status]] and the [[Reputation|prestige]] inherent to a place in society ([[Class (social)|class]] and [[social stratification|economic stratum]]) with little regard to their own happiness. That conspicuous consumption did not constitute social progress, because American economic development was unduly influenced by the static economics of the British aristocracy; therefore, conspicuous consumption was an un-American activity contrary to the country's dynamic culture of [[individualism]].&lt;ref name = "Gross 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published as '''''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions''''' (1899), the book arose from three articles that Veblen published in the ''American Journal of Sociology'': (i) “The Beginning of Ownership” (ii) “The Barbarian Status of Women”, and (iii) “The Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labour” (1898–99),&lt;ref name = "Fine 1994 160_161"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fine|1994|pp=160–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which presented the major themes of economics and sociology that he later developed in works such as: ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904), about how incompatible are the pursuit of profit and the making of useful goods; and ''The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts'' (1914), about the fundamental conflict between the human predisposition to useful production and the societal institutions that waste the useful products of human effort.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' 15th Edition. Volume 12, pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vernon 1974 53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernon|1974|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' is a socio-economic treatise that resulted from Veblen's observation and perception of the United States as a society of rapidly developing economic and social institutions.&lt;ref name = "Gross 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of his reportage about the sociology and economics of the [[Consumerism|consumer society]] that is the U.S., especially disliked the [[Satire|satiric]] tone of his literary style, and said that Thorstein Veblen's cultural perspective had been negatively influenced by his boyhood in a [[Norwegian American]] community, of practical, thrifty, and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] people who endured anti-immigrant prejudices in the course of integration to American society.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Encyclopædia Britannica", 15th Edition. Volume 12, pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fredrickson 1959"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fredrickson|1959}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The stratified society
In the late 19th century, ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions'' (1899) established that the economic life of a [[Modern history|modern society]] is based upon the [[social stratification]] of tribal and [[Feudalism|feudal]] societies, rather than upon [[Meritocracy|merit]], that is to say, upon social and economic [[utility]]. Thorstein Veblen's [[Anthropology|anthropological]] examples indicate that many economic behaviours of contemporary society derive from corresponding tribal-society behaviors, wherein men and women practiced the [[division of labour]] according to their [[status group]]; high-status people practiced [[hunting]] and [[war]]fare, which are economically unproductive occupations, whilst low-status people practiced farming and manufacturing, which are economically productive occupations.

;(i) Occupation
In a stratified society, the division of labour inherent to the [[barbarian]] culture of conquest, [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] featured labour-intensive occupations for the conquered people, and light-labour occupations for the conquerors, who thus became ''the leisure class''. Moreover, it was socially unimportant that low-status, productive occupations (tinker, tailor, chandler) were of greater economic value to society than were high-status, unproductive occupations (the [[Military officer|profession of arms]], the [[clergy]], [[banking]], etc.); nonetheless, for the sake of social cohesion, the leisure class occasionally performed productive work that contributed to the functioning of society, yet, such work was more symbolic participation in the economy, than it was practical economic production.

;(ii) Economic utility
In exercising political control, the leisure class retained their high social-status by direct and indirect coercion, by reserving for themselves the profession of arms, and so withheld weapons and military skills from the lower social classes. Such a division of labour (economic utility) rendered the lower classes dependent upon the leisure class, and so established, justified, and perpetuated the role of the leisure class as the defenders of society against natural and supernatural enemies, because the clergy also belonged to the leisure class.

In the event, contemporary society did not psychologically supersede the tribal-stage division of labour, but merely evolved different forms of said division-of-labour-by-status. During the [[Middle Ages|Mediæval period]] (5th c. – 15th c.) only [[Feudal land tenure|land-owning noblemen]] had the right to hunt and to bear arms as soldiers; status and income were parallel. Likewise, in contemporary society, skilled labourers of the [[working class]] usually are paid an income, in [[wages]], that is inferior to the income paid, in [[salary]], to the educated [[Middle class#Professional-managerial class|professionals]] whose economic importance (as [[Engineering|engineers]], [[management|managers]], [[marketing|salesmen]], [[human resources|personnel clerks]], ''et al.'') is indirectly productive for the whole of society; income and status are parallel.

;(iii) Pecuniary emulation
To attain, retain, and gain greater [[social status]] within their [[social class]], low-status people emulate the respected, high-status members of their socio-economic class, by [[consumerism|consuming]] over-priced [[brand]]s of goods and services perceived to be products of better quality, and thus of a higher social-class. In striving for greater social status, people buy high-status products (goods and services) which they cannot afford, despite the availability of affordable products that are perceived as of lower quality and lesser social-prestige, and thus of a lower social-class. In a consumer society, the businessman was the latest member of the leisure class, a barbarian who used his prowess (business acumen) and competitive skills (marketing) to increase [[Profit (economics)|profits]], by manipulating the supply and the demand among the social classes and their strata, for the same products at different prices.

;Contemporary practices of barbarian-tribe consumerism:

* '''The subjugation of women''': Because women were spoils of war captured by raiding barbarians, in contemporary society, the unemployed [[housewife]] is an economic trophy that attests to a man's socio-economic prowess. In having a wife without an independent economic life (a profession, a trade, a job) a man can display her unemployed status as a form of his [[conspicuous leisure]] and as an object of his [[conspicuous consumption]].
* '''The popularity of sport''': In the case of [[American football]], practicing the sport is socially and psychologically advantageous to community cohesion; yet, in itself, sport is an economic side effect of conspicuous leisure that wastes material resources.
* '''Devout observances''': Organised religion is a type of conspicuous leisure (wasted time) and of conspicuous consumption (wasted resources); a social activity of no economic consequence, because a church is an unproductive use of land and resources, and clergy (men and women) do unproductive work.
* '''Social formalities''': In contemporary society, social manners are remnants of the barbarian's formal, social practice of "paying respect" to one's [[Power (social and political)|socially powerful]] betters. In itself, [[etiquette]] has little value (practical or economic), but is of much [[Cultural hegemony|cultural]] value in identifying, establishing, and enforcing ''distinctions of place'' (social stratum) within a social class; thus the practice of "Hail to the chief!" establishes a place for everyone, and establishes everyone in his and her place.

==Thematic overview==
;Socially-conspicuous economic behaviours
In the late 19th century, with ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions'' (1899), Thorstein Veblen introduced the concepts of “conspicuous consumption” and of “conspicuous leisure” to the nascent, academic discipline of [[sociology]]. [[Conspicuous consumption]] is the application of money and material resources towards the display of a higher social-status (e.g. silver flatware, custom-made clothes, an over-sized house); and [[conspicuous leisure]] is the application of extended time to the pursuit of pleasure (physical and intellectual), such as sport and the [[fine art]]s. Therefore, such physical and [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] pursuits display the freedom of the rich man and woman from having to work in an economically productive occupation.&lt;ref name = "Chao Schor 1998 ?"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chao|Schor|1998|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, from the conspicuous consumption of necessary, useful goods (food, shelter, clothing, etc.) that satisfied the requirements of physical survival, there emerged the conspicuous consumption of "[[Veblen good]]s", which, as defined by the pecuniary canons of taste of the leisure class, are consumer goods valued for being expensive to make, sell, and buy; ownership of Veblen goods communicates a superior socio-economic status, either of [[Class (social)|class]] or of [[social stratification|stratum]], or both.

;The theses of ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' across its fourteen chapters

*'''Chapter I: Introductory'''
The modern industrial society developed from the barbarian tribal society, which featured a leisure class supported by subordinated working classes employed in economically productive occupations. The leisure class is composed of people exempted from manual work and from practicing economically productive occupations, because they belong to the leisure class.

*'''Chapter II: Pecuniary Emulation'''
“The emergence of a leisure class coincides with the beginning of ownership” initially based upon [[marriage]] as a form of ownership – of women and their property – as evidence of prowess. As such, the material consumption of the leisure class has little to do with either comfort or subsistence, and much to do with [[Reputation|social esteem]] from the community, and thus with [[self-respect]].

[[File:JuengeresMathildenkreuz.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The pecuniary canons of taste of the leisure class ascribe monetary and [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] value to an ''objet d'art'', such as ''The Cross of Mathilde'' (ca. AD 1000), which realises conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption in one object.]]

*'''Chapter III: Conspicuous Leisure'''
Among the lower social-classes, a man’s reputation as a diligent, efficient, and productive worker is the highest form of pecuniary emulation of the leisure class available to him in society. Yet, among the social strata of the leisure class, manual labour is perceived as a sign of social and economic weakness; thus, the defining, social characteristics of the leisure class are the “exemption from useful employment” and the practice of conspicuous leisure as a “non-productive consumption of time”.

*'''Chapter IV: Conspicuous Consumption'''
Theoretically, the consumption of luxury products (goods and services) is limited to the leisure class, because the working classes have other, more important, things and activities on which to spend their limited income, their [[wages]]. Yet, such is not the case, because the lower classes consume expensive alcoholic beverages and narcotic drugs. In doing so, the working classes seek to emulate the standards of life and play of the leisure class, because they are the people "at the head of the social structure in point of reputability". In that emulation of the leisure class, [[Etiquette|social manners]] are a result of the non-productive, consumption of time by the upper social classes; thus the social utility of [[conspicuous consumption]] and of [[conspicuous leisure]] lies in their wastefulness of time and resources.

*'''Chapter V: The Pecuniary Standard of Living'''
In a society of industrialised production (of goods and services), the habitual consumption of products establishes a person's standard of living; therefore, it is more difficult to do without products than it is to continually add products to one's way of life. Moreover, upon achieving self-preservation (food and shelter), "the needs of conspicuous waste" determine the economic and industrial improvements of society.

*'''Chapter VI: Pecuniary Canons of Taste'''
To the leisure class, a material object becomes a product of conspicuous consumption when it is integrated to “the canon of honorific waste”, by being regarded either as beautiful or worthy of possession for itself. Consequently, to the lower classes, possessing such an object becomes an exercise in the pecuniary emulation of the leisure class. Therefore, an ''objet d’art'' made of precious metal and gemstones is a more popular possession than is an object of art made of equally beautiful, but less expensive materials, because a high price can masquerade as beauty that appeals to the sense of social prestige of the possessor-consumer.

*'''Chapter VII: Dress as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture'''
In a consumer society, the function of clothes is to define the wearer as a man or a woman who belongs to a given social class, not for protection from the environment. Clothing also indicates that the wearer’s livelihood does not depend upon economically productive labour, such as farming and manufacturing, which activities require protective clothing. Moreover, the symbolic function of clothes indicates that the wearer belongs to the leisure class, and can afford to buy new clothes when the fashion changes.

*'''Chapter VIII: Industrial Exemption and Conservatism'''
A society develops through the establishment of institutions (social, governmental, economic, etc.) modified only in accordance with ideas from the past, in order to maintain societal stability. Politically, the leisure class maintain their societal dominance, by retaining out-dated aspects of the political economy; thus, their opposition to socio-economic [[progressivism]] to the degree that they consider political [[conservatism]] and political [[Reactionary|reaction]] as honorific features of the leisure class.

*'''Chapter IX: The Conservation of Archaic Traits'''
The existence of the leisure class influences the behaviour of the individual man and woman, by way of social ambition. To [[Social mobility|rise in society]], a person from a lower class emulates the characteristics of the desired upper class; he or she assumes the habits of economic consumption and social attitudes (archaic traits of demeanour in speech, dress, and manners). In pursuit of social advancement, and concomitant social prestige, the man and the woman who rid themselves of [[Ethics|scruple and honesty]] will more readily rise into a stratum of the leisure class.

*'''Chapter X: Modern Survivals of Prowess'''
As owners of the [[means of production]], the leisure class benefit from, but do not work in, the industrial community, and do not materially contribute to the commonweal (the welfare of the public) but do consume the goods and services produced by the working classes. As such, the individual success (social and economic) of a person derives from his or her astuteness and ferocity, which are character traits nurtured by the pecuniary culture of the consumer society.

The belief in the concept of “luck” ([[Fortuna]]) is one reason why people gamble; likewise follows the belief that luck is a part of achieving socio-economic success, rather than the likelier reason of social connections derived from a person's social class and social stratum. Within the social strata of the leisure class, the belief in luck is greater in the matter of sport (wherein physical prowess does matter) because of personal pride, and the concomitant social prestige; hence, gambling is a display of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure. Nonetheless, gambling (the belief in luck) is a social practice common to every social class of society.

*'''Chapter XII: Devout Observances'''
The existence, function, and practice of religion in a socially-stratified society, is a form of abstract conspicuous consumption for and among the members of the person’s community, of devotion to the value system that justifies the existence of his or her social class. As such, attending church services, participating in religious rites, and paying tithes, are a form of conspicuous leisure.

*'''Chapter XIII: Survivals of the Non-invidious Interest'''
The clergy and the women who are members of the leisure class function as objects of vicarious leisure, thus, it is morally impossible for them to work and productively contribute to society. As such, maintaining a high social-class is more important for a woman of the leisure class, than it is for a man of the leisure class. Women, therefore, are the greatest indicators of a man’s socio-economic standing in his respective community. In a consumer society, how a woman spends her time and what activities she does with her time communicate the social standing of her husband, her family, and her social class.

*'''Chapter XIV: The Higher Learning as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture'''
Education (academic, technical, religious) is a form of conspicuous leisure, because it does not directly contribute to the economy of society. Therefore, high-status, ceremonial symbols of book-learning, such as the gown and mortar-board-cap of the university graduate educated in abstract subjects (science, mathematics, philosophy, etc.) are greatly respected, whereas certificates, low-status, ceremonial symbols of practical schooling (technology, manufacturing, etc.) are not greatly respected to the same degree, because the contemporary university is a leisure-class institution.

==Literary style==
In ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'' (1899), Thorstein Veblen used idiosyncratic and satirical language to present the consumerist [[mores]] of modern American society; about the impracticality of [[etiquette]], as a form of [[conspicuous leisure]], Veblen said that:

{{Quotation|A better illustration [of conspicuous leisure], or at least a more unmistakable one, is afforded by a certain King of France who was said to have lost his life in the observance of good form. In the absence of the functionary whose office it was to shift his master's seat, the King sat uncomplaining before the fire, and suffered his royal person to be toasted beyond recovery. But, in so doing, he saved his Most Christian Majesty from menial contamination.|Thorstein Veblen, ''The Theory of the Leisure Class,'' p. 33&lt;ref name = "Veblen 1934, p. 33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1934|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, Veblen used objective language in ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904), which analyses the business-cycle behaviours of businessmen; yet, in the Introduction to the 1967 edition of ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'', the economist [[Robert Lekachman]] said that Thorstein Veblen was a misanthrope, that:

{{Quotation |As a child, Veblen was a notorious tease, and an inveterate inventor of malicious nicknames. As an adult, Veblen developed this aptitude into the abusive category and the cutting analogy. In this volume [''The Theory of the Leisure Class''] the most striking categories are four in number: [i] Conspicuous Consumption, [ii] Vicarious Consumption, [iii] Conspicuous Leisure, and [iv] Conspicuous Waste. It is amazing what a very large proportion of social activity, higher education, devout observance, and upper-class consumer goods seemed to fit snugly into one, or another, of these classifications.|Robert Lekachman, Introduction to ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' (1967 ed.)}}

Concurring with Lekachman, the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], in his Introduction to the 1973 edition, said that ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' is Veblen's intellectual put-down of American society. That Veblen spoke satirically in order to soften the negative implications of his socio-economic analyses of the U.S., which are more psychologically threatening to the American ego and ''status quo'', than the negative implications of Karl Marx's analyses. That, unlike Marx, who recognised capitalism as superior to feudalism in providing products (goods and services) for mass consumption, Veblen did not recognise that distinction, because capitalism was economic barbarism, and that goods and services produced for [[conspicuous consumption]] are fundamentally worthless.

==Critical opinions==
;The 19th century
The publishing success of ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions'' (1899) derived from the fidelity, accuracy, and veracity of Thorstein Veblen's reportage of the social and economic behavior of American society; yet, some contemporaries considered that Veblen's intellectualism made him an [[iconoclast]] who was "more than a little mad".&lt;ref name = "Chase 1934"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, despite the success (financial, academic, social) accrued to him by the book, another contemporary social scientist told Veblen that the sociology of gross [[consumerism]] cataloged in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' had much "fluttered the dovecotes of the East", especially in the [[Ivy League]] academic [[The Establishment|Establishment]].&lt;ref name="Heilbroner 2000 228"/&gt;

In the contemporary (19th-century) book review '"The Theory of the Leisure Class" (September 1899), John Cummings wrote:

{{Quotation|As a contribution to the general theory of sociology, Dr. Veblen's ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' requires no other commendation for its scholarly performance than that which a casual reading of the work readily inspires. Its highly original character makes any abridgement of it exceedingly difficult and inadequate, and such an abridgement cannot be even attempted here . . . The following pages, however, are devoted to a discussion of certain points of view in which the author seems, to the writer [Cummings], to have taken an incomplete survey of the facts, or to have allowed his interpretation of facts to be influenced by personal animus.|John Cummings, "The Theory of the Leisure Class", ''The Journal of Political Economy'', September – 1899, p. 425.&lt;ref name = "Cummings 1899 425"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cummings|1899|p=425}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two-part book review "An Opportunity for American Fiction" (April–May 1899), the critic [[William Dean Howells]] made Veblen's treatise the [[handbook]] of sociology and economics for the American [[intelligentsia]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name = "Heilbroner 2000 228"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbroner|2000|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He reviewed first the economics and then the social satire in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions''; and reported that class anxiety impels American society to wasteful consumerism, especially the pursuit of social [[Reputation|prestige]] by owning consumer goods. That, despite social classes being alike in most [[Social stratification|stratified societies]], the novelty of the American social-class system was that the leisure class had only recently appeared in U.S. history.&lt;ref name = "Howells 1899"&gt;{{Harvnb|Howells|1899}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howells concluded the book review by calling upon a novelist to translate into fiction the message reported by the social-scientist Veblen, because a [[novel of manners]] was an opportunity for American fiction to accessibly communicate the satire in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'':

{{Quotation| It would be easy to burlesque [the American leisure class], but to burlesque it would be intolerable, and the witness [Veblen] who did this would be bearing false testimony where the whole truth and nothing but the truth is desirable. A democracy, the proudest, the most sincere, the most ardent that history has ever known, has evolved here a leisure class which has all the distinguishing traits of a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patriciate]], and which by the chemistry of intermarriage with European aristocracies is rapidly acquiring antiquity. Is not this a phenomenon worthy the highest fiction? Mr. Veblen has brought to its study the methods and habits of scientific inquiry. To translate these into dramatic terms would form the unequalled triumph of the novelist who had the seeing eye and the thinking mind, not to mention the feeling heart. That such a thing has not been done hitherto is all the stranger, because fiction, in other countries, has always employed itself with the leisure class, with the [[aristocracy]]; and our own leisure class now offers not only as high an opportunity as any which fiction has elsewhere enjoyed, but by its ultimation in the English leisure class, it invites the American imagination abroad on conditions of unparalleled advantage.|William Dean Howells, "An Opportunity for American Fiction"''Literature: An International Gazette of Criticism'', No. 17, 5 May 1899. pp. 361–62.}}

;The 20th century
Twenty years later, in the book review “Professor Veblen” (1919), about the author and the thesis of ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' (1899) the American [[intellectual]] and journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] asked:

{{Quotation |Do I enjoy a decent bath because I know that John Smith cannot afford one – or because I delight in being clean? Do I admire Beethoven's ''Fifth Symphony'' because it is incomprehensible to Congressmen and Methodists – or because I genuinely love music? Do I prefer [[terrapin]] ''à la'' Maryland to fried liver, because plowhands must put up with the liver – or because the terrapin is intrinsically a more charming dose? |Henry Louis Mencken, "Professor Veblen", ''Prejudices'': First Series, 1919.&lt;ref name = "Mencken 1919"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mencken|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the review "Dr. Thorstein Veblen Gets the Crown of Deadly Nightshade" (1919), ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' was featured as The Dullest Book of the Month, wherein the satirist [[Robert Charles Benchley|Robert Benchley]] said and asked:

[[File:Thornstein Veblen 1.jpg|thumbnail|right|385px|In ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions'' (1899), Thorstein Veblen said that the U.S. was imitating the socially static monarchy of the United Kingdom.]]

{{Quotation |The Doctor has made one big mistake, however. He has presupposed, in writing this book, the existence of a class with much more leisure than any class in the world ever possessed – for, has he not counted on a certain number of readers?|Robert Benchley, "Dr. Thorstein Veblen Gets the Crown of Deadly Nightshade",''Vanity Fair'' magazine, 1919.&lt;ref name = "Benchley 1919"&gt;{{Harvnb|Benchley|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Assessments – professional and personal
Thirty years later, during which time the academic establishment of the US slowly accepted the socioeconomic facts reported in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'', Veblen was vindicated as a social scientist, by the two [[Middletown studies]] (''Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture'' [1929] and ''Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts'' [1937]) which presented [[empirical]] evidence that working-class families practiced [[conspicuous consumption]] and did without necessities (adequate food and clothing, etc.) in order to present and maintain the public appearance of being in a higher social-class.

In the Introduction to the 1934 edition of the book, the economist [[Stuart Chase]] said that the [[Great Depression]] (ca. 1929–41) had vindicated Veblen as an economist, because ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' had unified "the outstanding economists of the world."&lt;ref name = "Chase1934"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|1934|p. xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Foreword to the 1953 edition, the sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] said that Veblen was "the best critic of America that America has ever produced".&lt;ref name = "Mills 1953"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Introduction to the 1973 edition of the book, the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] addressed the author as subject, and said that Veblen was a man of his time, and that ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' – published in 1899 – reflected Veblen's 19th-century [[Weltanschauung|world view]]. That in his person and personality, the social scientist Thorstein Veblen was neglectful of his grooming and tended to be disheveled; that he suffered social intolerance for being an intellectual and an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] in a society of [[religion|superstitious]] and [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] people, and so tended to curtness with less intelligent folk.&lt;ref name = "John Kenneth Galbraith 1973"&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Contemporary advocates of the 18th-century school of [[classical economics]] (free markets and individual pursuit of self-interest ) have presented opinions against the cultural relevance of the socioeconomic theories of Thorstein Veblen ([[conspicuous consumption]] and [[conspicuous leisure]], etc.) and for their relegation to the margin of modern economics.&lt;ref name = "James 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the arguments are Veblen's dismissal of the [[rational expectations|rational-expectation]] theories that predominate classical economics, and that the American leisure-class risk becoming irrelevant to the economy if they do not work.&lt;ref name = "Landsburg 2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Landsburg|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of economics [[Robert Heilbroner]] said that Veblen's social and economic theories were valid for the American [[Gilded Age]] (ca. 1870–1900) of gross materialism and political corruption, in the late 19th century, but are invalid for the economy of the 21st-century world, because ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' is historically specific to U.S. society, in general, and to the society of Chicago, in particular;&lt;ref name = "Heilbroner 2000 ?"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heilbroner|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus, in the essay "No Rest for the Wealthy" (2009), the financial journalist Daniel Gross said:

{{Quotation|In the book, Veblen – whom C. Wright Mills called "the best critic of America that America has ever produced" – dissected the habits and mores of a privileged group that was exempt from industrial toil and distinguished by lavish expenditures. His famous phrase "conspicuous consumption" referred to spending that satisfies no need other than to build prestige, a cultural signifier intended to intimidate and impress. In this age of repossessed yachts, half-finished McMansions and broken-down leveraged buyouts, Veblen proves that a 110-year-old sociological vivisection of the financial overclass can still be ''au courant''. Yet, while Veblen frequently reads as still 100 percent right on the foibles of the rich, when it comes to an actual theory of the contemporary leisure class, he now comes off as about 90 percent wrong.|Daniel Gross, "No Rest for the Wealthy", ''The New York Times'', 5 July 2009.&lt;ref name = "Gross 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet, the "economy-as-organism" theory of [[Butterfly Economics]] have vindicated Thorstein Veblen as an insightful and foresighted economist, because his empirical observations have been re-stated by contemporary economists, such as [[Robert H. Frank]], who applied socioeconomic analyses to the economy of the 21st century. The analytical application of the conspicuous-consumption construct to the business and economic functions of [[advertising]] explains why the lower social-classes do not experience social [[upward mobility]] in their societies, despite being the productive classes of their economies. About the limited social-utility and economic non-productivity of the business social-class, the American business entrepreneur [[Warren Buffett]] said that non-productive financial activities, such as [[day trading]] (speculative buying-and-selling of financial securities) and [[arbitrage]] (manipulation of price-differentials among markets) have vindicated ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'' (1899), because such activities only produce capital, but do not produce useful goods and services for people.&lt;ref name = "James 2009, p. 62"&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2009|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toiletpapier (Gobran111).jpg|thumb|right|A roll of toilet paper.]]
[[File:Klopapierrolle mit Halter.jpg|thumb|right|Toilet paper and toilet paper holder.]]

'''Toilet paper''' is a [[tissue paper]] product people primarily use to clean the [[human anus|anus]] and surrounding area of [[feces|fecal material]] after [[defecation]] and to clean the [[Perineum|perineal area]] of [[urine]] after [[urination]] and other [[Body fluid|bodily fluid]] releases. It also acts as a layer of protection for the hands during these processes. It is sold as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a [[paperboard]] core for storage in a dispenser near a toilet. Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in [[septic tank]]s, whereas some other bathroom and [[facial tissue]]s are not. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of [[Ply (layer)|plies]] (layers of thickness), from one-ply all the way up to six-ply, with more back-to-back plies granting greater strength and absorbency.

The use of paper for [[hygiene]] has been recorded in [[China]] in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass-produced in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt; Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883.

Although [[paper]] had been known as a wrapping and padding material in [[History of China|China]] since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; the first documented use of toilet paper in human history dates back to the 6th century AD, in early medieval China.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In 589 AD the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote about the use of toilet paper:

{{quote|Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from the [[Five Classics]] or the names of sages, I dare not use for [[toilet]] purposes.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt;}}

During the later [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD), an Arab traveller to China in the year 851 AD remarked:

{{quote|...they [the Chinese] do not [[Anal cleansing#Water|wash themselves with water]] when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt;}}

During the early 14th century, it was recorded that in modern-day [[Zhejiang]] province alone there was an annual manufacturing of toilet paper amounting to ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper each.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt; During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), it was recorded in 1393 that an annual supply of 720,000 sheets of toilet paper (two by three feet in size) were produced for the general use of the imperial court at the capital of [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt; From the records of the Imperial Bureau of Supplies of that same year, it was also recorded that for the [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s imperial family alone, there were 15,000 sheets of special soft-fabric toilet paper made, and each sheet of toilet paper was even [[perfume]]d.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 123"/&gt;

Elsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with [[wool]], [[lace]] or [[hemp]], while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into [[river]]s, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, [[leaf|leaves]], [[grass]], [[hay]], [[Rock (geology)|stones]], [[sand]], [[moss]], [[water]], [[snow]], [[fern]]s, [[husk|plant husk]]s, [[peel (fruit)|fruit skins]], [[animal shell|seashell]]s, or [[corncob]]s, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In [[Ancient Rome]], a [[xylospongium|sponge on a stick]]{{cn|date=September 2016}} was commonly used, and, after use, placed back in a pail of [[vinegar]]. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b). These are all cited in the classic ''Biblical and Talmudic Medicine'' by the German physician Julius Preuss (Eng. trans. Sanhedrin Press, 1978).

The "play" is composed of nothing but toilet paper, and the scripts for ''Hamlet'', ''inter al.'', are toilet paper.]]

The 16th-century [[French language|French]] satirical writer [[François Rabelais]], in Chapter XIII of Book 1 of his [[novel sequence]] ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', has his character Gargantua investigate a great number of ways of cleansing oneself after defecating. Gargantua dismisses the use of paper as ineffective, rhyming that: "Who his foul tail with paper wipes, Shall at his ballocks leave some chips." (Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s 1653 English translation). He concludes that "the neck of a goose, that is well downed" provides an optimum cleansing medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=François Rabelais |title=Gargantua and Pantagruel |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rabelais/francois/r11g/book1.13.html |publisher=eBooks@Adelaide |location=The University of Adelaide, Australia |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of publishing by the eighteenth century led to the use of newspapers and cheap editions of popular books for cleansing. [[Lord Chesterfield]], in a letter to his son in 1747, told of a man who purchased

{{quote|a common edition of Horace, of which he tore off gradually a couple of pages, carried them with him to that necessary place, read them first, and then sent them down as a sacrifice to Cloacina; thus was so much time fairly gained ....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quoted in Maxted|first1=Ian|title=Sic transit gloria cloacarum|url=http://www.ephemera-society.org.uk/articles/cloacopapyrology.html|website=Website of The Ephemera Society |publisher=The Ephemera Society|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In many parts of the world, especially where toilet paper or the necessary plumbing for disposal may be unavailable or unaffordable, toilet paper is not used. Also, in many parts of the world such as India, people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews-messenger.com/article/20120221/NEWS01/202210308/Teen-takes-mission-trip-India|quote='In most of India, they don't use toilet paper.

===As a commodity===
[[File:Papier hygiénique Le Troubadour.JPG|thumb|left| "''Le Troubadour''" (French)—1960s package of toilet paper]]
[[Joseph Gayetty]] is widely credited with being the inventor of modern commercially available toilet paper in the [[United States]].  Gayetty's paper, first introduced in 1857, was available as late as the 1920s. Gayetty's Medicated Paper was sold in packages of flat sheets, watermarked with the inventor's name. Original advertisements for the product used the tagline "The greatest necessity of the age! Gayetty's medicated paper for the water-closet."

Seth Wheeler of [[Albany, New York]], obtained the earliest United States patents for toilet paper and dispensers, the types of which eventually were in common use in that country, in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;The first of note is for the idea of perforating commercial papers (25 July 1871, #117355), the application for which includes an illustration of a perforated roll of paper. On 13 February 1883 he was granted patent #272369, which presented a roll of perforated wrapping or toilet paper supported in the center with a tube. Wheeler also had patents for mounted brackets that held the rolls. See also Joseph Nathan Kane, "Famous First Facts: A Record of First Happenings, Discoveries and Inventions in the United States" (H. W. Wilson: 1964), p. 434; Harper's Magazine, volume. Q, 1941-1943 (Harper's Magazine Co.:1941), p. 181; Jules Heller, "Paper Making" (Watson-Guptill:1978), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacturing of this product had a long period of refinement, considering that as late as the 1930s, a selling point of the Northern Tissue company was that their toilet paper was "splinter free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=Now Splinter Free: How Marketing Broke Taboos|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/now-splinter-free-how-marketing-broke-taboos-1.4149558|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=Under the Influence|agency=Pirate Radio|publisher=CBC Radio One|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moist toilet paper, called [[wet wipes]], was first introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Andrex]] in the 1990s, and in the [[United States]] by [[Kimberly-Clark]] in 2001. It has been promoted as being a better method of cleaning than dry toilet paper after defecation, and may be useful for women during [[menstruation]]. It was promoted as a flushable product but it has been implicated in the creation of [[fatberg]]s. By 2016, some municipalities had begun education campaigns advising people not to flush used wet wipes.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Matt|title=Are Wet Wipes Wrecking the World's Sewers?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/are-wet-wipes-wrecking-the-worlds-sewers/504098/|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

More than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the U.S. alone. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per capita per year.&lt;ref name="NYT0127"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/science/earth/26charmin.html "Mr. Whipple Left It Out: Soft Is Rough on Forests"] by Leslie Kaufman, ''The New York Times'', 25 February 2009, Retrieved 26 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

==Description==
Toilet paper is available in several types of paper, a variety of patterns, decorations, and textures, and it may be moistened or perfumed, although fragrances sometimes cause problems for users who are allergic to perfumes. The average measures of a modern roll of toilet paper is c. 10&amp;nbsp;cm (3{{sfrac|15|16}}&amp;nbsp;in.) wide, and 12&amp;nbsp;cm (4{{sfrac|23|32}}&amp;nbsp;in.) in diameter, and weighs about 227&amp;nbsp;grams (8&amp;nbsp;oz.).&lt;ref name="Toilet paper fun facts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.toiletpaperhistory.net/toilet-paper-facts/toilet-paper-fun-facts/ | title = Toilet paper fun facts | publisher = ToiletPaperHistory.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative method of packing the sheets uses interleaved sheets in boxes, or in bulk for use in dispensers. "Hard" single ply paper has been used as well as soft multi-ply.

===Size===
Manufactured toilet paper sheet in the United States was sized 4{{sfrac|1|2}}" × 4{{sfrac|1|2}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.toiletpaperworld.com/is-my-toilet-paper-shrinking/|title=Is My Toilet Paper Shrinking?|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999 the size of a sheet has been shrinking; Kimberly-Clark reduced the length of a sheet to 4.1".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phlmetropolis.com/2011/03/the-incredible-shrinking-toilet-paper.php|title=The Incredible Shrinking Toilet Paper Roll|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott, in 2006, reduced the length of their product to 3.7". The width of sheets was later reduced giving a general sheet size of 3.7" long and 4.1" wide. Larger sizes remain available.

===Materials===
Toilet paper products vary greatly in the distinguishing technical factors, such as size, weight, roughness, softness, chemical residues, "finger-breakthrough" resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require or demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.

Quality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/minor-british-institutions-izal-toilet-paper-1727294.html|title=Minor British Institutions: Izal toilet paper|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger. Premium toilet paper may have lotion and wax and has two to four plies of very finely pulped paper. If it is marketed as "luxury", it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with [[aloe]] or other perfumes.

In order to advance decomposition of the paper in [[septic tank]]s or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres).  Compaction of toilet paper in drain lines, such as in a clog, prevents fiber dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.

A German quip says that the toilet paper of [[Nazi Germany]] was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' instead, because the paper was softer.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Anthony and Fisher, David ''The Fall of Berlin'' London: Pimlico, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color and design===
Colored toilet paper in colors such as pink, [[Lavender (color)|lavender]], light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one's bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s. Up until 2004, [[Scott Paper Company|Scott]] was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink. However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/10653941/The-unpalatable-truth-the-colour-has-drained-from-our-bathrooms.html|title=The unpalatable truth: the colour has drained from our bathrooms?|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand. Colored toilet paper remains commonly available in some European countries.

An unintended problem with the design of the laminated construction of the sheets in a roll is that, on occasion whilst un-rolling, separation occurs between laminations rather than at the intended interface. Perforations then become misaligned and sheets cannot be torn off cleanly. The problem is resolved by careful un-winding of one or more laminations until the perforations re-align.

==Installation==
[[File:Toilet tissue roll on seat.jpg|thumb|Toilet paper is also used for spreading on seat before sitting]]
===Dispensers===
{{main|Toilet roll holder}}
A toilet roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. There are at least seven types of holders:
# A horizontal piece of wire mounted on a hinge, hanging from a door or wall.
# A horizontal axle recessed in the wall.
# A vertical axle recessed in the wall
# A horizontal axle mounted on a freestanding frame.
# A freestanding vertical pole on a base.
# A wall mounted dispensing unit, usually containing more than one roll. This is used in the commercial / away-from-home marketplace.
# A wall mounted dispensing unit with tissue interfolded in a "S" type leave so the user can extract the tissue one sheet at a time.

Some commercial or institutional toilet paper is wrapped around a cylinder to many times the thickness of a standard toilet paper roll.

===Orientation===
{{main|Toilet paper orientation}}
There are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[wall]]: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' or ''under'' the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of [[United States|American]] consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer ''over''.

===Decoration===
{{main|Hotel toilet paper folding}}
''Toilegami'' refers to toilet paper [[origami]]. Like table napkins, some fancy Japanese hotels fold the first squares of toilet paper on its dispenser to be presented in a fashionable way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.origami-resource-center.com/toilet-paper-origami.html | title = Toilet Paper Origami | work = Origami Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational use===
{{main|Toilet papering}}
In the United States, toilet paper has been the primary tool in a prank known as "TP-ing" (pronounced Teepeeing). TP-ing, or "toilet papering", is often favored by adolescents and is the act of throwing rolls of toilet paper over cars, trees, houses and gardens, causing the toilet paper to unfurl and cover the property, creating an inconvenient mess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypilot.com/2002-09-07/news/export33250_1_tp-trees-bandits|title=Hey kids, TPing is not a crime!|work=tribunedigital-dailypilot|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children and cats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=FENWICK ELLIOTT|first1=ANNABEL|title=Hilarious video shows cat unraveling entire roll of toilet paper – then dutifully re-rolling it back up again|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2597369/Hilarious-video-shows-cat-unraveling-entire-roll-toilet-paper-dutifully-rolling-again.html|accessdate=28 March 2018|publisher=Daily Mail|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have taken to unrolling an entire roll of toilet paper by spinning it until it completely unravels on the floor, or as a game by children wadding up one end, putting it in the toilet bowl without tearing it and then using the flushing of the toilet to pull new paper into the toilet, with the objective of flushing the entire roll down the toilet section at a time without the toilet paper breaking. Special toilet paper insert holders with an oblong shape were invented to prevent continuous unrolling without tearing to discourage this practice.

Toilet paper pranks include musical toilet paper holders and inserts that are activated by the unrolling of the toilet paper and will loudly play an embarrassing song calling attention to the person defecating.

Other gags include custom toilet paper printed with jokes, stories or politician's images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaye|first1=Ben|title=Donald Trump’s shitty tweets printed on toilet paper|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/08/someone-finally-made-toilet-paper-with-trumps-tweets-printed-on-it/|accessdate=28 March 2018|publisher=Consequence of Sound|date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==

[[Alexander Balankin]] and coauthors have studied the behavior of toilet paper under [[tensile stress]]{{sfn|Balankin|Susarrey Huerta|Bravo|2001}}{{sfn|Balankin|Susarrey Huerta|Urriolagoitia Calderón|Hernández|2002}} and during [[wetting]] and [[burning]].{{sfn|Balankin|Matamoros|2002}}

Toilet paper has been used in [[physics education]] to demonstrate the concepts of [[torque]], [[moment of inertia]], and [[angular momentum]];{{sfn|Harkay|2006}}{{sfn| Goodwin|1985}}{{sfn|Walker|1975}} and the [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|energy]].{{sfn|Ehrlich|1997}}

==Environmental considerations==
{{see|environmental impact of paper}}
One tree produces about {{convert|100|lb}} of toilet paper and about 83 million rolls are produced per day.&lt;ref name="Toilet paper fun facts"/&gt; Global toilet paper production consumes 27,000 trees daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/thegreenguide/2010/04/27000-trees-a-day-used-for-toilet-tissue.html |title=Toilet paper wipes out 27,000 trees a day - National Geographic's Green Guide |publisher=Blogs.nationalgeographic.com |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=26 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219201640/http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/thegreenguide/2010/04/27000-trees-a-day-used-for-toilet-tissue.html |archivedate=19 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States alone. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per capita a year. The average American uses {{convert|50|lb}} of tissue paper per year which is 50% more than the average of other Western countries or Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.simpleecology.com/eco/soft-tissue-paper.html | title =Soft Tissue Paper is Hard on the Environment | work = Simple Ecology | date = 22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher use in the United States may be explained by the fact that other countries people use bidets or spray hoses to clean themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/euro-style-personal-hygiene-with-the-bidet/index.html | title =Euro-style Personal Hygiene With the Bidet | work = hgtv.com | date = 27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of trees are [[logging|harvested]] in North and South America leaving [[ecological footprint]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://members.greenpeace.org/blog/greenpeaceusa_blog/2009/02/26/destroying_forest_to_make_toilet_paper_i | title = Destroying forests to make toilet paper is "worse than driving Hummers" | work = Green Peace | date = 26 February 2009 | last = Lindsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of many Western countries sometimes use toilet paper for industrial purposes such as oil filters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frantzoil.com/TOILETPAPER.html |title=Toilet paper Oil Filters |publisher=Frantzoil.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=26 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322220957/http://www.frantzoil.com/TOILETPAPER.html |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may distort the use statistics.

{{As of|2009}}, between 22% and 48% of the toilet paper used in the United States comes from [[tree farm]]s in the U.S. and South America, with most of the rest coming from [[second growth forest]]s, and only a small percentage coming from [[virgin forest]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT0127" /&gt;

===Solutions===

Toilet paper of many brands is now made from recycled paper. However, paper such as newspaper is recycled, despite it containing [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], an [[endocrine disruptor]]. Many others sell toilet paper crafted out of [[bagasse]], a byproduct of [[sugarcane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/maia-james/recycled-toilet-paper_b_2822188.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14632">The '''United States Cochrane Center (USCC)''' was one of the 14 centers on the world that facilitated the work of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]].
The USCC was the reference center for all 50 US states and US territories, protectorates, and districts: the [[District of Columbia]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the US [[Virgin Islands]]. The USCC was also the reference Center for the following countries: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guam]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The USCC discontinued on February 7, 2018.

==Historical overview==

In the United States, there have been four Cochrane Centers since the start of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 1993.  The Baltimore Cochrane Center was launched soon after the launch of the Collaboration, officially in 1994, with [[Kay Dickersin]] as Director.  The San Francisco Cochrane Center was launched soon thereafter, in 1996, with [[Lisa Bero]] and [[Drummond Rennie]] as Co-Directors. The San Antonio Cochrane Center launched in 1994, with [[Cynthia Mulrow]] as Director, and the New England Cochrane Center launched in 1996 with Joseph Lau and Alexia Anczack-Bouckoms as co-Directors. In 1998, Kay Dickersin moved to [[Brown University]] in Providence, Rhode Island, and with the move the Baltimore Cochrane Center was renamed the New England Cochrane Center, Providence Office.

The US centers had variable luck with obtaining sufficient infrastructure funding, and The San Antonio Cochrane Center closed in 2000. In December 2002, the remaining three centers (the New England Cochrane Center at Boston, the New England Cochrane Center at Providence, and the San Francisco Cochrane Center) merged to form a single registered entity with three offices, the US Cochrane Center (the USCC).  The Providence office became the first point of contact for the work of The Cochrane Collaboration in the United States and assumed responsibility for fulfilling the core Center functions.

In 2005, Kay Dickersin returned to Baltimore, to take up a post at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and the USCC moved with her. The New England Cochrane Center Boston Office closed in February, 2008. In approximately 2006, Drummond Rennie moved out of the area, leaving his post as SF Branch Director, and [[Lisa Bero]] became the Center Director.

In June 2014, the San Francisco Branch of the United States (US) Cochrane Center changed its name to the West Coast Branch of the US Cochrane Center, and because of Lisa Bero’s emigration to Australia, a new Branch Director was announced, Mark Helfand located at [[Oregon Health and Science University]].

On February 7, 2018, the USCC closed its doors. 

==Main Tasks==
# Supporting Cochrane entities with a coordinating base in the US or one of the countries serviced by the Center. These include: Review Groups, Fields, and Methods Groups.
# Supporting new Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs), Fields, and Methods Groups who want to register with the Collaboration.
# Supporting individuals who seek information about and participation in the work of the Collaboration.

==Offices==

===The USCC Main Office in Baltimore===
The USCC main office in Baltimore was responsible for providing training and support for review authors, trials search coordinators (TSCs), review group coordinators (RGCs), editors, handsearchers, consumers, healthcare providers, policy makers, and others. In addition the main office of the USCC worked with international colleagues to provide training and support for others in the Collaboration who were responsible for training.

===CENTRAL===
Each Cochrane Center is responsible for a unique function within the Cochrane Collaboration.  For twelve years (1994 to 2005) the Baltimore Cochrane Center, and subsequently NECC@P, was responsible for coordinating CENTRAL, The Cochrane Collaboration’s central register of controlled clinical trials. CENTRAL was designed for use by members of the Collaboration’s review groups and others performing systematic reviews. CENTRAL serves both as a repository for trial reports identified by members of the Collaboration and as a source of trial reports from which Review Groups build their specialized registers. In late 1992, work began on development of a register of reports of controlled trials for use in conducting systematic reviews. The first meeting was held and the eligibility criteria were decided at the Cochrane Workshop on “Building a Register of RCTs” at [[Green College, Oxford#Green College|Green College, Oxford, United Kingdom]], November 8, 1992 and was attended by [[Iain Chalmers]], Carol Lefebrvre and Kay Dickersin, among others.&lt;ref name="DickersinManheimer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Dickersin| first1 = K| last2=Manheimer| first2=E| last3=Wieland| first3=S| last4=Robinson| first4=KA| last5=Lefebvre| first5=C| last6=McDonald| first6=S|title = Development of the Cochrane Collaboration’s CENTRAL Register of controlled clinical trials| journal = Eval Health Prof| volume = 25| issue = 1| pages = 38–64| date = 2002| pmid=11868444| doi=10.1177/016327870202500104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions and eligibility criteria were decided then that continue to be used to this day.&lt;ref name="CochraneHandbookChapter"&gt;{{cite web| last=Higgins| first=JPT| last2=Green| first2=S| title=The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interviews, Version 5.1.0| publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration| date=March 2011| url=http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_6/6_2_1_2_the_cochrane_central_register_of_controlled_trials.htm| accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the individuals interested in and key to the developments leading to international registers of randomized controlled trials were also leaders in the Cochrane Collaboration,&lt;ref name="DickersinRennie"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Dickersin| first1 = K| last2=Rennie|first2=D|title = Registering clinical trials| journal = JAMA| volume = 290| issue = 4| pages = 516–523| date = 2003| url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196997| pmid=12876095| doi=10.1001/jama.290.4.516}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger and more centralized group was felt to be a better location for a common resource. Accordingly, the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]] and specifically the [[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] were approached about a partnership. The National Institutes of Health convened a meeting in December 1993 to consider the importance of registers of controlled trials for the promotion of evidence-based health care.&lt;ref name="Harlan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harlan| first = WR| title = Creating an NIH clinical trials registry: a user-friendly approach to health care| journal = JAMA| volume = 271| issue = 22| pages = 1729| date = 1994| url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=373978 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1994.03510460021008| pmid = 8196103}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of that meeting was an agreement by National Library of Medicine to retag existing MEDLINE records of reports of RCTs and CCTs, identified by Cochrane collaborators and not already tagged as such, with the publication types (PTs) RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL (RCT[PT]) and CONTROLLED-CLINICAL-TRIAL (CCT[PT]).

The USCC conducted the “MEDLINE Retagging Project” from 1994-2005 by submitting to [[MEDLINE]] all CCTs and RCTs it had identified that were not yet tagged RCT/PT or CCT/PT in MEDLINE.&lt;ref name="DickersinManheimer"/&gt; It identified these publications in two ways:  (1) collecting on a quarterly basis all CCT and RCT reports newly identified via handsearching by the approximately 50 Cochrane review groups,&lt;ref name="Ault"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ault A|title= Climbing a Medical Everest |journal=Science |volume=300 |pages= 2024–25 |date=2003 |doi=10.1126/science.300.5628.2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CochraneHandbook"&gt;{{cite web| last=Higgins| first=JPT| last2=Green| first2=S| title=Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interviews, Version 5.1.0| publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration| date=March 2011| url=http://handbook.cochrane.org/front_page.htm| accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) identifying all CCTs and RCTs not already identified as such on MEDLINE using electronic search methods.  CENTRAL was then created using two sources of information about published trial reports, periodic download of all records in MEDLINE tagged as RCT|PT and CCT|PT and submission of non-MEDLINE eligible citations (e.g., conference abstracts identified through handsearching) by the centers and review groups.

After 1994, when the new publication type tags were initiated, reports of trials missed by NLM’s MEDLINE indexing grew smaller with each year and the NLM decided not to fund the retagging Program after 2005. For the 1994-2005 time period, CENTRAL was funded mainly by the National Library of Medicine, and also by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation|The Packard Foundation]], and the European Union Biomedical and Health Research Programmes I and II.

Some trials are still missed by the MEDLINE indexers however,&lt;ref name="Wieland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Wieland| first1 = LS| last2=Robinson| first2=KA| last3=Dickersin| first3=K| title = Understanding why evidence from randomized clinical trials may not be retrieved from Medline: comparison of indexed and non-indexed records| journal = BMJ| volume = 344|pages = d7501| date = 2012| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7501| pmid = 22214757| doi = 10.1136/bmj.d7501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and searches of other electronic bibliographic databases are required, so the effort to make CENTRAL a comprehensive database of studies possibly eligible for Cochrane reviews continues. Since 2005, development of CENTRAL has been conducted by Cochrane and John Wiley and Sons, publishers of The Cochrane Library.

===US Cochrane West===
The West Coast Affiliate Center operates out of [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] and [[University of California, San Francisco]]. It develops guidance for systematic reviews of complex interventions and realist reviews of health policies.

===The Caribbean Branch of the USCC (CBUSCC)===
The CBUSCC is the reference center for English-speaking Caribbean territories. Its development extends the services available to Cochrane contributors already working in the Caribbean region and also supports new authors.

The '''United States Secretary of Health and Human Services''' is the head of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], concerned with health matters. The Secretary is a member of the [[President of the United States|President's]] [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]. The office was formerly Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

In 1980, the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services, and its education functions and [[Rehabilitation Services Administration]] were transferred to the new [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fwu4iZpmCNMC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=979,+the+Department+of+Health,+Education,+and+Welfare+was+renamed+the+Department+of+Health+and+Human+Services,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4wQN8pYw-w&amp;sig=powqUl1rqZmQRhVagNPTr4xD_g4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1nK7o-fvRAhVEKiYKHe17BPIQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=979,%20the%20Department%20of%20Health,%20Education,%20and%20Welfare%20was%20renamed%20the%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services,&amp;f=false|title=Foundations of Education: History and theory of teaching children and youths with visual impairments |last=Holbrook |first=M.

==Duties==
[[File:Flag of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.png|thumb|left|upright|The flag of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the predecessor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.]]
The duties of the secretary revolve around human conditions and concerns in the [[United States]]. This includes advising the [[President of the United States|president]] on matters of [[health]], [[Social security|welfare]], and income security programs. The Secretary strives to administer the Department of Health and Human Services to carry out approved programs and make the public aware of the objectives of the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President's Cabinet|url=http://bensguide.gpo.gov/9-12/government/national/cabinet.html|publisher=Ben's Guide|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the program doubled once this affiliation with UW was established. Dr. [[Edward J. Fisher]] served as the new school's first dean until 1975. Fisher had been dean of the College of Optometry for 19 years beforehand, and from 1969 to 1970 he served as the 23rd President of the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the first Canadian to serve in that capacity.

Classes and administrative offices were originally based in the Math and Computer building and the Biology 1 buildings at the University in Waterloo. A clinic was established in the old post office at 35 King Street North. In 1973, the Optometry building was built in its present location on the north side of Columbia Street, where lecture halls and clinic facilities are made available in one place.

The [[Doctor of Optometry]] (OD) degree has been a four-year program since the 1950s at the College of Optometry of Ontario, where a Grade 13 high school education was sufficient for admission. Since then, the program has remained four years in length, but the curriculum has changed remarkably. Because of this, the prerequisite level of education has also changed: first from a minimum of one year of university science education, then a minimum of two years, now a minimum of three years of full-time study in a science degree program. 

Currently, a minimum of 3 years of full time study in a science degree program are required for admission into the 4 year professional program. However, most students choose to finish their undergraduate degree before entering Optometry school. There are several prerequisite courses, encompassing subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, calculus, psychology and ethics that are required to be considered for admission.

== Programs ==
The four-year [[Doctor of Optometry]] (OD) program provides preparation for the practice of optometry, with both classroom instruction and hands-on clinical experience. In order to practice optometry, graduates from the OD program must pass both the written and oral Canadian Board Exams, as well as writing the jurisprudence licensing exam for their home province. Classes cover topics such as general medicine, optics, pharmacology, ocular disease, visual perception, practice management and more. Extensive clinical experience is provided starting in first year of the intensive program. The fourth year of the program is entirely clinical, consisting of 3 consecutive terms of clinical rotations: ocular disease externship, private practice experience and rotation through UW's speciality clinics.

Graduate studies in Vision Science (MSc, PhD) are available at the School of Optometry and Vision Science. The MSc program was established in 1972 and the PhD program began in 1980. Both are open to graduates from optometry and from other undergraduate programs. The programs are designed to further knowledge in specific aspects of vision, and often this involves integration with the other sciences. A combined Doctor of Optometry–Master of Science in Vision Science option exists as well; this is typically a five-year program.

The School of Optometry also offers ACOE accredited residencies in areas such as binocular vision, low vision, cornea/contact lenses and ocular health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School of Optometry and Vision Science Residencies |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/news/school-optometry-vision-science-residencies-receive |website=School of Optometry and Vision Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residencies are available for licence OD's who wish to advance their clinical knowledge in a specialty practice area.

The International Optometric Bridging Program (IOBP) is a new program designed for optometrists trained outside Canada and the USA, to help learning the language, academic, and clinical skills needed to practise in Canada. After an initial assessment of credentials, applicants undergo a month-long orientation program and a year-long academic program. This is designed to adequately prepare internationally trained optometrists for the Canadian Standard Assessment in Optometry, the national Board exam required to practise optometry in Canada.

Annually, a Continuing Education (CE) program is offered to practising ODs which provides approximately 20 or more certified hours of CE credit.

== Admission to the Doctor of Optometry Program ==
In 2005, eighty students were admitted to the program; in 2006, that number has increased to 85. Currently the entering class size is limited to 90 students. Due to the fact that UW is the only English speaking School of Optometry in Canada, admissions tend to be quite competitive. 

In past years, the average cGPA of the entering class has been 87% (range 80-96) There are 19 pre-requisite courses and labs, all of which must be completed by the term prior to commencing the optometry program. Pre-requisites include: 2 terms of general biology with labs, 1 term of microbiology, 2 terms of physiology, 1 term of general chemistry with lab, 1 term of biochemistry, 1 term of organic chemistry, 2 terms of physics with labs, 1 term of calculus, 1 term of statistics, and 1 term each of introductory psychology, English and ethics. 

Applicants are required to write the OAT by August 31st of the year prior to admission. The average Total Science OAT score of successful applicants has been 370 (90th percentile or above). A detailed online application with references must be completed during the fall of the year prior to admission. Applicants are expected to have experience job shadowing an optometrist in addition to community involvement, extracurriculars and volunteering. After an initial review of the candidates, the admissions committee selects applicants for an interview. The interview is held in January at the School of Optometry. The 90 successful candidates are notified via email by the end of March with the admissions decision.

== Clinics ==
The School also operates the University of Waterloo Optometry Clinics which are open to staff, students, and faculty of the University of Waterloo and the general public. The clinics are staffed by interns, residents, and graduates of the School operating under the supervision of faculty or other licensed optometrists, allowing optometry students to gain patient care experience as well as providing vision care services to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Optometry Clinics|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-clinics/about-optometry-clinics|website=University of Waterloo Optometry Clinics|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speciality clinics include ocular health, contact lens, low vision, binocular vision, paediatrics, sports vision and more.

The main clinic operates from the School of Optometry's building on the University of Waterloo's main campus, with a smaller clinic providing basic services also located at the [[University of Waterloo Health Sciences Campus|Health Sciences Campus]] in downtown [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Sciences Optometry Clinic|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-clinics/services-we-offer/health-sciences-optometry-clinic|website=University of Waterloo Optometry Clinics|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and Graduate Studies ==
[[Vision science]] is a cross-discipline study encompassing biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, psychology, and medicine, in both laboratory and clinical settings.  The areas of research at the School [http://www.optometry.uwaterloo.ca/graduate/fields.html] have been defined as:
* Biomedical Ocular Research
* Contact Lenses
* Low Vision Rehabilitation
* Optometric Education and Practice
* Vision &amp; Ophthalmic Standards
* Visual Development &amp; Refractive Correction

The Optometry building is equipped with research laboratories supported by metal, wood, electronic and optical workshops, a vision science library centre, histology and live-animal housing facilities.  Researchers also have controlled access to clinic data and subjects.

The School boasts two centres of research excellence:
* the Centre for Sight Enhancement (Low Vision Services) - services and research for blind and visually impaired individuals
* the Centre for Contact Lens Research - researching various types of contact lenses and solutions, and their effects on the eye

Cumulative total of the entire country: 1,590 cases. (Current as of Aug. 28, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[https://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/mapviewer/ USGS Disease Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:West Nile virus (WNV) Neuroinvasive Disease Incidence 9-2012.png|thumb|300px|U.S. West Nile virus (WNV) neuroinvasive disease incidence. Current 9-4-2012]]

The [[West Nile virus]] quickly spread across the [[United States]] after the first reported cases in [[Queens, New York]] in 1999. The virus is believed to have entered in an infected bird or mosquito, although there is no clear evidence. The disease spread quickly through infected birds. [[Mosquito]]es spread the disease to mammals. It was mainly noted in horses but also appeared in a number of other species. The first human cases usually followed within three months of the first appearance of infected birds in the area except where cold weather interrupted the mosquito [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. Since the virus has become widely established in the U.S., an average of 130 deaths a year occurred. 

Differences in surveillance and reporting between health departments and generally increased surveillance as the disease spread cause some problems in direct comparison of the number of cases and the mortality rate.  The reported number of infected in 2009 was 720, but the estimated total number of infected the same year was {{formatnum:54000}}.&lt;ref name=mmwr-59-25&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5235a5.htm "West Nile Virus Activity – United States, 2009"] (MMWR 59(25), July 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The true mortality rate is thought to be much lower because most cases are so mild they go undiagnosed. Some estimates put severe cases at only 1% of all cases. It is believed that the elderly or people with weak immune systems are most vulnerable to serious illness or death if bitten by a mosquito infected by West Nile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicaldaily.com/west-nile-virus-more-dangerous-elderly-and-reason-may-lie-speed-their-immune-system-344410&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Most but not all mild cases go undiagnosed. In addition, some more severe but non-neuroinvasive cases are not reported to the CDC. Some mild cases are discovered during blood donation screening. 1,039 West Nile-tainted blood donations were discovered between 2003 and mid-2005. 30 cases of West Nile from blood transfusion were known, the majority from 2002 before blood screening was instituted. 

In the first ten years since the virus arrived in the U.S., over 1,100 deaths occurred with human cases reported from every U.S. state except Maine, Alaska and Hawaii. (Animal cases have been occasionally found in Maine and in Puerto Rico.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/Mapsactivity/surv&amp;control08Maps.htm West Nile activity maps], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, there was a widespread outbreak with the highest death toll and second-highest total case numbers. Maine and Puerto Rico reported one case each, the first time the disease was reported in those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Nile Virus|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery in the United States==
In August 1999, Dr. [[Deborah Asnis]], an infectious disease specialist at [[Flushing Hospital Medical Center]] in [[Queens]], noticed two male patients who were suffering from similar, unusual symptoms. The two patients, aged 60 and 75 respectively, were exhibiting sudden paralysis in their arms and legs, as well as disorientation and high fevers.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Roberts |title=Dr. Deborah Asnis, Who Sounded Alert on West Nile Virus Outbreak, Dies at 59 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/nyregion/dr-deborah-asnis-who-helped-uncover-west-nile-outbreak-in-new-york-dies-at-59.html?_r=0 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2015-09-15 |accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Colker |title=Deborah Asnis dies at 59; helped detect West Nile virus in U.S. |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-deborah-asnis-20150921-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2015-09-21 |accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lab testing also showed elevated numbers of [[white blood cell]]s within the spinal fluid of both males.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Neither of the patients were responding to antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Possible early hypothesizes included [[botulism]], [[viral encephalitis]], [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], or [[meningitis]], but none of these illnesses exactly matched the symptoms.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Asnis decided to pursue a more concrete diagnosis by contacting authorities and other colleagues.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Dr. Asnis contacted Dr. [[Marcelle Layton]], the [[New York City Department of Health]]'s chief [[epidemiologist]], on Monday, August 23, 1999, to report her patients' symptoms.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Layton advised Asnis to send samples of the patients' blood and spinal fluid to the [[New York State Department of Health]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] for further analysis.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; By Friday, August 27, 1999, just four days after Asnis had contacted Layton, two additional patients had been identified in Queens.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The number rose to eight by Sunday, August 29, at Flushing Hospital Medical Center and other hospitals in Queens.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; All of the early patients resided within a few miles of one another. They were also frequent gardeners in the evenings.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;
 
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (C.D.C.) initially identified the mystery illness as [[St. Louis encephalitis]] on September 3, 1999.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The city of New York began widespread spraying for mosquitos later that same day.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; However, laboratory testing continued to determine a definitive cause of the symptoms.

The U.S. federal government revised its diagnosis from St. Louis encephalitis to [[West Nile virus]] on September 27, 1999, citing research by Dr. Duane J. Gubler, a C.D.C. expert on [[arborviruses]], as well as several bird deaths in the [[Bronx]], located to the north of Queens.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Dr. Deborah Asnis was credited by health experts with the early identification of West Nile virus in the United States.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Her actions likely prevented a more widespread outbreak.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; In their 2003 book, "The New Killer Diseases: How the Alarming Evolution of Germs Threatens Us All," authors Elinor Levy and Mark Fischetti praised Dr. Asnis' response to the symptoms, writing that, "Asnis did something other doctors might not have bothered to do."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; They elaborated that, "One of the worst problems with our disease-detection system is that many doctors never report cases of strange symptoms, either because they are unsure of the disease they are facing, they're ignorant of the reporting requirement, or they simply never get around to it. Deborah Asnis was highly conscientious."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

== Recent cases ==
During the years between 1999 and 2010, an estimate of 3 million people have been infected in the United States. Highest incidence rates are observed in states of the central great plains, with [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]] and [[North Dakota]] leading in incidence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=L.R.|last1=Petersen|first2=P.J.|last2=Carson|author3=et al.|title=Estimared cumulative incidence of West Nile Virus infection in US adults, 1999–2010|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Carson2/publication/225068417_Estimated_cumulative_incidence_of_West_Nile_virus_infection_in_US_adults_1999-2010/links/54904d8e0cf214269f266581.pdf|publisher=Epidemiol. Infect. 2012 November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 West Nile virus outbreak in [[Texas]], USA, 1,868 cases were reported. Male patients, persons &gt;65 years of age, and minorities were at highest risk for neuroinvasive disease. At total of 1,868 cases including 844 (45%) WNND (West Nile neuroinvasive disease) cases and 89 deaths (case-fatality rate 5%). Dates of onset ranged from May 1, 2012, through December 6, 2012. The outbreak peaked during week 33 (mid-August) with 225 reported cases, which is historically the same peak for all reported WNV cases in Texas during 2002–2011. The median time from date of symptom onset to date of official report to TxDSHS was 27 days (range 6–274 days). Of the 254 counties in Texas, 135 (53%) reported a WNV case. The overall incidence rate for the state was 7.8 cases per 100,000 population. Almost half of the cases were reported from the northeastern quadrant of the state, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex (902 [48%] cases): Dallas (396 [21%]), Tarrant (259 [14%]), Collin (64 [3%]), and Denton (183 [10%]) counties. These 4 counties had a combined incidence rate of 16 cases per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=KO|last1=Murray|first2=D|last2=Ruktanonchai|first3=D|last3=Hesalroad|first4=E|last4=Fonken|first5=MS|last5=Nolan|title=West Nile Virus, Texas, USA, 2012|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/11/13-0768_article|publisher=Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Dr. '''William Sidney ("Sid") Gilchrist''', (1901–1970), born in [[Pictou, Nova Scotia]], Canada, spent 38 years as a medical missionary in [[Angola]] (formerly [[Portuguese West Africa]]).

==Biography==
Sid Gilchrist was the youngest of five children. His ancestry was Scottish and Presbyterian, and he graduated in medicine from [[Dalhousie University]].

Two years before he completed his medical studies, Sidney Gilchrist married Frances Harriet Killam of Halifax. When he completed his medical studies they volunteered to go abroad as medical missionaries. In 1928 they were appointed to Angola by the Board of Overseas Missions of the [[United Church of Canada]].

Before proceeding to the vast Portuguese colony on the west coast of Africa, the Gilchrists spent a year in Portugal, studying both Portuguese and the African languages spoken in Angola. During this time Dr. Gilchrist earned a Diploma in Tropical Medicine at the University of Lisbon. The Gilchrists arrived in Angola in 1930 and began their work in a part of the world where there was one doctor for every 100,000 people, where the average life expectancy was 30 years, and where 50% of infants died during the first year of life.

The Gilchrists were stationed at [[Camundongo]], Angola, from 1930 to 1940, a term interrupted by a two-year furlough in 1935 and 1936. Dr. Gilchrist established a leprosy clinic in Camundongo, and he spent a great deal of time walking or bicycling to out-patient clinics and to native villages to treat sufferers who were unable or unwilling to visit the clinics.

When World War II began, he obtained a leave of absence from the Mission Board, enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]], and was attached to the North Nova Scotia Regiment. He remained with the Regiment, first in Nova Scotia and then in England, until 1943, when he was transferred to a field ambulance section and sent to North Africa. In the Mediterranean Theatre, first in North Africa and then in Italy, Dr. Gilchrist was called on both to treat wounded troops in the front lines and to combat disease. With his experience in tropical medicine, he performed especially valuable service in helping to reduce the rate of malaria and dysentery among allied troops in Italy. Dr. Gilchrist was discharged with the rank of Major in May, 1945. Two months later, in recognition of his wartime service, he was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]].

In 1947, the Gilchrists returned to Angola, this time to [[Dondi]]. Medical facilities here were more complete than those at Camundongo, and in addition to a well-equipped hospital, there were two schools; but the shortage of doctors at Dondi was just as acute. Dr. Gilchrist was faced with the task of running the hospital, the leper clinics, the village sanitation programs and the medical assistants' training program by himself.

Dr. Gilchrist's next mission station was at [[Bailundo]], where he headed a mission to concentrate on [[preventive medicine]]. Within two years of his arrival, a new health-care centre and a maternity centre had been built. Further, he established an extensive system that served more than seventy villages with tuberculosis clinics, malaria surveys, maternity conferences, and training courses for midwives and medical assistants. The emphasis was always on prevention, and Dr. Gilchrist distributed an enormous amount of health-care literature.

By the early 1960s, the Gilchrists had come to consider Angola their home. Even though a Nova Scotia flag flew over the door of Dr. Gilchrist's office, he felt that, spiritually, he belonged to Africa. His writings show a deep love for all things African. He was a student of the customs and languages of many African peoples, spoke fluent Portuguese and Umbundu, and he developed a deep appreciation for the African landscape and all the creatures that lived on it.

Dr. Gilchrist died with his wife and daughter on June 14, 1970, in an automobile accident near [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. The couple had nine children, three of whom died in infancy and are buried in Africa. Their daughter Betty, a missionary like her parents, died with them in the automobile accident. Five sons survive, as of this entry.

Sidney Gilchrist's desire to help educate Angolan students in medicine was realized after his death, in the foundation of the Angola Memorial Scholarship Fund ([http://angolamsf.org]), which has contributed to the educational needs of Angolan students, whether within Angola, enrolled in foreign universities, or in refugee camp schools in Namibia during the [[Angolan Civil War]], for the past thirty-five years.

'''Una Winifred Atwell''' (27 February or 27 April 1910 or 1914&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;There is some uncertainty over her date and year of birth. Many sources suggest 27 February 1914, but there is a strong suggestion that her birthday was 27 April. Most sources give her year of birth as 1914, but her gravestone states that she died at the age of 73, suggesting that she was born in 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; – 28 February 1983) was a Trinidadian pianist who enjoyed great popularity in Britain and Australia from the 1950s with a series of [[boogie-woogie]] and [[ragtime]] hits, selling over 20 million records.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;"Atwell, Winifred", in David Dabydeen, John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Black British History'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first black person to have a number-one hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and is still the only female instrumentalist to do so.&lt;ref name=Guinness&gt;{{cite book

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Atwell was born in [[Tunapuna]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. She and her parents lived in Jubilee Street. Her family owned a pharmacy and she trained as a pharmacist herself and was expected to join the family business. She played the piano from a young age and achieved considerable popularity locally. She played for American servicemen at the Air Force base (which is now the [[Piarco International Airport|main airport]]). 

It was while playing at the Servicemen's Club at [[Piarco]] that someone bet her that she could not play something in the [[boogie-woogie]] style that was popular back home in the United States. She went away and wrote "Piarco Boogie", which was later renamed "Five Finger Boogie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=winifred-atwell-p295249/biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rpm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45-rpm.org.uk/dirw/winifreda.htm |title=Winifred Atwell |publisher=45-rpm.org.uk |date=27 February 1914 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving Trinidad===
Atwell left Trinidad in the early 1940s and travelled to the United States to study with [[Alexander Borovsky]] and, in 1946, moved to London, where she had gained a place at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. She became the first female pianist to be awarded the academy's highest grading for musicianship. To support her studies, she played rags at London clubs and theatres. These modest beginnings in variety would one day see her topping the bill at the [[London Palladium]]. She said later, "I starved in a garret to get onto concert stages."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Life in the UK===
Atwell attracted attention with an unscheduled appearance at the Casino Theatre, where she substituted for an ill star. She caught the eye of entrepreneur [[Bernard Delfont]], who put her on a long-term contract. She released three discs that were well received. The third, "Jezebel", went to the top of the bestseller lists.{{Which|date=June 2011}} It was her fourth disc that catapulted her to huge popularity in the UK. A complex arrangement called "Cross Hands Boogie" was released to show her virtuoso rhythmic technique, but it was the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], a 1900s tune written by George Botsford called "[[Black and White Rag]]", that was to become a radio standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Winifred-Atwell.html |title=Winifred Atwell Biography |publisher=OLDIES.com |date=27 April 1914 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwell was championed by popular disc jockey [[Jack Jackson (British radio)|Jack Jackson]], who introduced her to Decca promotions manager [[Hugh Mendl]], who launched his career as a staff producer at Decca producing Atwell's recordings.

"Black And White Rag" started a craze for her [[honky-tonk]] style of playing. The rag was originally performed on a concert grand for the occasion, but Atwell felt it did not sound right, and so got her husband to buy a [[Tack piano|honky tonk]] piano for 30 shillings, which would then be used for the released version of the song.

Atwell's husband, former stage comedian Lew Levisohn, was vital in shaping her career as a variety star. The two had met in 1946, and married soon after. They were inseparable up to Levisohn's death in Hong Kong in December 1977; they had no children. He had cannily made the choice, for stage purposes, of her playing first a concert grand, then a beaten-up old upright piano. The latter was purchased from a [[Battersea]] junk shop for 50 shillings. This became famous as "my other piano". It would later feature all over the world, from [[Las Vegas]] to the [[Sydney Opera House]], travelling over half a million miles by air throughout Atwell's concert career. While contributing to a posthumous [[BBC]] radio appreciation of Atwell's career, [[Richard Stilgoe]] revealed that he was now the owner of the famous "other piano".

When Atwell first came to Britain, she initially earned only a few pounds a week. By the mid-1950s, this had shot up to over $10,000. By 1952, her popularity had spread internationally.&lt;ref name="comlu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winifredatwell.comlu.com/1_4_About-Winnie.html |title=About Winnie " Winifred Atwell Tribute – Winifred Atwell Tribute |publisher=Winifredatwell.comlu.com |date=13 January 1982 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hands were insured with [[Lloyd's of London]] for £40,000 (the policy stipulating that she was never to wash dishes).&lt;ref name="comlu1"/&gt; She signed a record contract with [[Decca Records|Decca]], and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She was by far the biggest selling pianist of her time.&lt;ref name="rpm1"/&gt; Her 1954 hit "[[Let's Have Another Party]]" was the first piano [[instrumental]] to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref name=Guinness/&gt; 

She is the only holder of two gold and two silver discs for piano music in Britain, and was the first black artist in the UK to sell a million records.&lt;ref name="comlu1"/&gt; Millions of copies of her sheet music were sold, and she went on to record her best-known hits, including "Let's Have a Party", "Flirtation Waltz", "Poor People of Paris" (which reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1956),&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

Her signature "Black and White Rag" became famous again in the 1970s as the theme of the [[BBC]] snooker programme ''[[Pot Black]]'',&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; which also enjoyed great popularity in Australia when screened on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] network. It was during this period that she discovered [[Matt Monro]] and persuaded Decca to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mattmonro.org.uk/bio.shtml |title=A warm welcome to Matt Monro – an internet tribute |publisher=Mattmonro.org.uk |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/155023/Matt-Monro-Tragedy-of-the-singing-bus-driver |title=Home of the Daily and Sunday Express &amp;#124; Express Yourself: Matt Monro: Tragedy of the singing bus driver |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwell's peak was the second half of the 1950s, during which her concerts drew standing room only crowds in Europe and Australasia. She played three [[Royal Variety Performance]]s, appeared in every capital city in Europe, and played for over twenty million people.{{cn|date=May 2018}} At a private party for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], she was called back for an encore by the monarch herself, who requested "[[Roll Out the Barrel]]". She became a firm television favourite. She had her own series in Britain. The first of these was ''Bernard Delfont Presents The Winifred Atwell Show''. It ran for ten episodes on the new ITV network from 21 April to 23 June 1956, and the BBC picked up the series the following year. On a third triumphal tour of Australia, she recorded her own Australian television series, screened in 1960–1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/3337 |title=Films &amp; TV programmes: The Winifred Atwell Show |website=[[British Film Institute]] |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career earned her a fortune, and would have extended further to the US but for issues of race. Her breakthrough appearance was to have been on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1956, but on arrival in America she was confronted with problems of selling the show in the south with a British-sounding black woman. The appearance was never recorded.&lt;ref name=Billboard/&gt;

In 1955, Atwell arrived in Australia and was greeted as an international celebrity. Her tour broke box-office records on the Tivoli circuit, bringing in £600,000 in box office receipts. She was paid AUS$5,000 a week (the equivalent of around $50,000 today), making her the highest paid star from a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth country]] to visit Australia up to that time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

She toured Australia many times and took on Australian guitarist Jimmy Doyle as her musical director in the 1960s. In 1962 she made a nationwide tour of Britain, with "The Winifred Atwell Show". She was accompanied by the Cy Bevan Group, who were with her then current radio series "Pianorama". From Monday, 17 September 1962, for one week only, she gave twice nightly performances at the [[Brighton Hippodrome]].  Also appearing with her on the same bill was [[Ronnie Carroll]], a radio and television recording star. However, her popularity in Australia led to her settling in Sydney in the 1970s. She became an Australian citizen two years before her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3600307?lookfor=winifred&amp;offset=4&amp;max=1012 |title=Portrait of Winifred Atwell [8&amp;#93; [picture&amp;#93; &amp;#124; National Library of Australia |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Emerson]] noted her influence on his playing in an interview: "I've always been into ragtime. In England—and I'm sure [[Rick Wakeman]] would concur—we loved Winifred Atwell, a fantastic honky-tonk and ragtime player."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fortner|first=Stephen|title=Keith Emerson Interviewed by You|magazine=Keyboard|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwell was also a skilled interpreter of classical music. On 1 and 2 December 1954, at London's [[Kingsway Hall]], she made one of the first stereo classical recordings in the UK, with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Stanford Robinson]], of a major repertoire work, the "[[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A-minor, Op. 16]]", by [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]. The two-channel version (engineered by Decca's Roy Wallace) appears not to have been released, but a transfer of the Decca LP (mono) LF1206 has been produced and issued by Pristine Audio as an available download.  Another Decca recording by Atwell is [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]]'s band, which contained an arrangement in the slow section in the [[Glenn Miller]] style.

===Later life===
Atwell bought an apartment on the beach front in the Flightdeck at Collaroy in Sydney, as jumping-off bases for her worldwide performance commitments.  She was a member of the Moby Dick Surfer's Club at Whale Beach where she performed regularly in support of the surf club. Enjoying the affection of the public, she was nevertheless keenly aware of prejudice and injustice and was outspoken about racism in Australia. She always donated her services in a charity concert on Sundays, the proceeds going to orphanages and needy children. She spoke out against the third world conditions endured by [[Australian Aborigine]]s, which made headlines during an outback tour of the country in 1962. Dismissing racism as a factor in her own life, she said she felt she was "spoiled very much by the public." She left her estate to the Australian [[Guide Dogs for the Blind]] and a small amount to her goddaughter. However a cousin of Lew Levisohn contested Atwell's will and is reported to have been granted $30,000 from her estate.

Atwell also created headlines in the 1960s with her dieting (slimming from sixteen to twelve [[Stone (unit)|stone]] on what would today be called a [[High-protein diet|protein diet]]).

In 1978, she appeared on Australian TV's ''[[This Is Your Life#Australian version|This Is Your Life]]'' and was admired by the younger generation in Australia in the 1970s.  She played her "other" piano at the end of the show with a few bars from "Black and White Rag" after the piano being in retirement for many years.

Though a dynamic stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, retiring and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, she was well read and, unlike many in the world of professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised [[cricket]] (she backed England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winifredatwell.comlu.com/1_6_Meeting-Winifred-Atwell.html |title=Meeting Winifred Atwell " Winifred Atwell Tribute – Winifred Atwell Tribute |publisher=Winifredatwell.comlu.com |date=20 June 1981 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.

Atwell often returned to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she bought a house in [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|Saint Augustine]], a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned into the [[Pan Pipers Music School]] by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded ''Ivory and Steel'', an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger [[Anthony Williams (musician)|Anthony Williams]]), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell's sense of loss following her husband's death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot.

Atwell suffered a stroke in 1980. She officially retired on ''[[The Mike Walsh Show]]'', then Australia's highest rating television [[Variety show|variety programme]], in 1981. She categorically stated that she would retire and not return as a public performer, and that she had had an excellent career. Her last TV performance was "Choo Choo Samba" followed with a medley of "Black and White Rag" and "Twelfth Street Rag". Her only non-private performances from this point were as an organist in her parish church at [[Narrabeen, New South Wales|Narrabeen]]. In 1983, following an electrical fire that destroyed her Narrabeen home, she suffered a heart attack and died while staying with friends in [[Seaforth, New South Wales|Seaforth]]. She is buried beside husband Lew Levisohn in South Gundurimba Private Cemetery in northern [[New South Wales]], just outside [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]].

==Awards==
In 1969 she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago's national award, the [[Hummingbird Medal|Gold Hummingbird Medal]], for her achievements in music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepresident.tt/trinidad-and-tobago/national-awards-database/ National Awards Database], The Office of the President, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workplace health promotion''' is the combined efforts of [[employer]]s, [[employee]]s, and society to improve the mental and physical [[health]] and [[well-being]] of people at work.&lt;ref name="lux"&gt;Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace health promotion in the European Union. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The term workplace health promotion denotes a comprehensive analysis and design of human and organizational work levels with the strategic aim of developing and improving health resources in an enterprise.

The [[World Health Organization]] has prioritized the workplace as a setting for health promotion because of the large potential audience and influence on all spheres of a person's life.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;http://www.who.int/occupational_health/topics/workplace/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The Luxembourg Declaration provides that health and well-being of employees at work can be achieved through a combination of:
* Improving the organization and the working environment
* Promoting active [[Participation (decision making)|participation]]
* Encouraging personal development.&lt;ref name="lux" /&gt;

Workplace health promotion combines alleviation of health [[risk factor]]s with enhancement of health strengthening factors and seeks to further develop protection factors and health potentials.&lt;ref name="lux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burton, J"&gt;Burton, Joan. "WHO health workplace framework and model" (PDF). http://www.who.int/.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace health promotion is complementary to the discipline of [[occupational safety and health]], which consists of protecting workers from hazards.

Successful workplace health promotion strategies include the principles of participation, project management, integration, and comprehensiveness:
* Participation: all staff must be included in all program stages
* Project management: programs must be oriented toward the problem-solving cycle
* Integration: programs must be incorporated into company management practices and workplace health-promotion strategies should influence corporate planning
* Comprehensiveness: programs must incorporate interdisciplinary individual-directed and environment-directed health strategies.&lt;ref name="Chu, C"&gt;Chu, Cordia; Bruecker, Gregor; Harris, Neil; Stitzel, Andrea; Gan, Xingfa; Gu, Xueqi; Dwyer, Sophie (2000). “Health-promoting workplaces--international settings development.” Health Promotion International, 15.2, 155-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
A report by the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] notes growing evidence that significant cost savings can be made by implementing workplace health promotion strategies, and over 90% of [[United States]] workplaces with greater than 50 employees have health promotion programs in place.&lt;ref&gt;Hassard, J (2012). “Motivation for employers to carry out workplace health promotion.” European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. Retrieved 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldana, SG"&gt;Aldana, Steven G. (2001). Financial impact of health promotion programs: a comprehensive review of the literature.” American Journal of Health Promotion, 15.5, 296-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies to promote health in the workplace ==
Strategies for workplace health promotion need to be inclusive to account for diversity in the workforce, and behavioral economics is a key tool for implementing workplace health programs.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Towers (2011). "Employee Engagement and Health Plan Management.” Towers Watson. Retrieved 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] includes five strategic guidelines for workplace health promotion in its [[Healthy People]] 2010 initiative. These include:
* Health education, focused on skill development and lifestyle behavior change along with information dissemination and awareness building.
* Supportive social and physical environments, reflecting the organization’s expectations regarding health behaviors and implementing policies promoting healthy behaviors. 
* Integration of the worksite program into the organization’s benefits, human resources infrastructure, and environmental health and safety initiatives.
* Links between health promotion and related programs like employee assistance.
* Screenings followed by counseling and education on how to best use medical services for necessary follow-up.&lt;ref name="Goetzel, RZ"&gt;Goetzel, Ron Z.; Henke, Rachel M.; Tabrizi, Maryam; Pelletier, Kenneth; Loeppke, Ron; Ballard, David W.; Grossmeier, Jessica; Anderson, David R.; Yach, Derek; Kelly, Rebecca K.; McCalister, Tre; Serxner, Seth; Selecky, Christobal; Shallenberger, Leba G.; Fries, James F.; Baase, Catherine; Isaac, Firky; Crighton, Andrew K.; Wald, Peter; Exum, Ellen; Shurney, Dexter; Metz, Douglas R. (2014). “Do Workplace Health Promotion (Wellness) Programs Work?” Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 56.9, 927-934.&lt;/ref&gt;
More generally, workplace health promotion efforts are implemented at three functional levels, including: 
* Level I: awareness programs such as newsletters, health fairs, and educational classes that may or may not directly improve individual health or influence behavioral change.
* Level II: lifestyle modification programs of 8 to 12 weeks duration that are available to employees on an ongoing basis and directly influence health outcomes.
* Level III: the creation of a work environment that assists employees in sustaining healthy lifestyles and behaviors, such as workplace cafeterias offering healthy food choices or the provision of workplace exercise facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gebhardt, Deborah L.; Crump, Carolyn E. (1990). “Employee Fitness and Wellness Programs in the Workplace.” American Psychologist, 45.2, 262-272.&lt;/ref&gt;
In most instances physical activity interventions conform to Level II of this framework and may also include elements from Level III. Incentive-based Fitness Rewards Programs (FRPs) aim to influence employee behaviors and thereby conform to Level I.

== Physical activity interventions ==
Approximately half of all current workplace health promotion programs are based on physical activity interventions given the relative ease by which employers can advocate such efforts to employees.&lt;ref&gt;Batt, Mark (2009). “Physical activity interventions in the workplace: the rationale and future direction for workplace wellness.” British Journal of Sports Medicine, 43, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Employer-sponsored activity interventions in the form of team sports originated as early as the 17th century in the [[United Kingdom]], however, most 21st century interventions rely on employer sponsorship of employee access to health and fitness facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mcgillivray, David (2005). “Fitter, Happier, More Productive: Governing Working Bodies Through Wellness.” Culture and Organization, 11.2, 125-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Employee convenience to sponsored fitness facilities strongly influences program participation, and facilities located near employee locations of residence hold lower time costs, receive increased use, and yield better program and health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Abraham, J"&gt;Abraham, Jean; Feldman, Roger; Nyman, John; Barleen, Nathan (2011). “What Factors Influence Participation in an Exercise-Focused, Employer-Based Wellness Program.” Inquiry, 48, 221-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Women frequently demonstrate lower participation in workplace exercise programs than men, and young, single individuals are often more predisposed to pursue employer-sponsored physical activity initiatives.&lt;ref name="Erickson, J"&gt;Erickson, Jill; Gillespie, Catherine (2000). Reasons Women Discontinued Participation in an Exercise and Wellness Program.” Physical Educator, 57.1, 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, exercise-based workplace health promotion programs struggle to attract those who would benefit the most from such fitness efforts, including aging, sedentary, blue-collar, female, or less-educated employees.&lt;ref name="Pohjonen, T"&gt;Pohjonen, Tiina; Ranta, Riika (2001). “Effects of Worksite Physical Exercise Intervention on Physical Fitness, Perceived Health Status, and Work Ability among Home Care Workers: Five-Year Follow-up.” Preventive Medicine, 32.6, 465-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sedentary nature of many modern workplaces increases negative metabolic risk factors such as high [[body mass index]] (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. Breaking up long periods of sedentary time is shown to improve these risks.&lt;ref name="Carr, LJ"&gt;Carr, Lucas J.; Walaska, Kristen A.; Marcus, Bess H. (2012). “Feasibility of a portable pedal exercise machine for reducing sedentary time in the workplace.” British Journal of Sports Medicine, 46, 430-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lara, A"&gt;Lara, Agustin; Yancey, Antronette K.; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto; Flores, Yvonne; Kuri-Morales, Pablo; Mistry, Ritesh; Subirats, Elena; McCarthy, William J. (2008). “Pausa para tu Salud: Reduction of Weight and Waistlines by Integrating Exercise Breaks into Workplace Organizational Routine.”  Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health Research, Practice, and Policy, 5.1, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, utilization of portable pedal exercise machines in office environments has been shown to improve employee health, and use was demonstrated feasible during working hours.&lt;ref name="Carr, LJ" /&gt; Interventions using pedometers to influence employee behavior, decrease the duration of sedentary periods, and increase total movement during the work day have also proven successful.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Catherine; Ryan, Daniel A.J.; Tudor-Locke, Catrine (2004). “Health benefits of a pedometer-based physical activity intervention in sedentary workers.” Preventive Medicine, 39, 1215-1222.&lt;/ref&gt; Smartphone applications and workplace signs promoting stair use are known to improve employee health, and many employers are now investing in wearable technologies to encourage employees to monitor physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Frank F.; Webb, Oliver J.; Mutrie, Nanette (2006-12-01). "A workplace intervention to promote stair climbing: greater effects in the overweight.” Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.). 14 (12): 2210–2216. doi:10.1038/oby.2006.259.

"Is 'corporate wellness' the big new thing that will keep Fitbit ahead of the pack?" The Guardian. ISSN 0261-3077. Retrieved 2016-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace [[Tai Chi]] programs have also proven effective as a health intervention and means of reducing [[absenteeism]], particularly in older workers.&lt;ref&gt;Palumbo, Mary V.; Wu, Ge; Shaner-McRae, Hollie; Rambur, Betty; McIntosh, Barbara (2012). “Tai Chi for Older Nurses: A Workplace Wellness Pilot Study.” Applied Nursing Research, 25.1, 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, many health promotion programs struggle with poor participation, and the introduction of incentives is shown to improve employee involvement.&lt;ref name="Baicker, K"&gt;Baicker, Katherine; Cutler, David; Song, Zirui (2010). “Workplace Wellness Programs Can Generate Savings.” Health Affairs, 29.2, 304-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incentive based programs ==
To encourage physical activity among the workforce, many employers offer financial incentives to employees through Fitness Rewards Programs (FRPs).&lt;ref name="Abraham, J" /&gt; Seeing that exercise and dieting produce immediate discomfort, the benefits of weight loss are often not noticeable in the short-term, and many people seek long-term health but succumb to near-term temptations of unhealthy eating and inactivity ([[hyperbolic discounting]]), maintaining employee involvement in wellness programs is difficult. To solve these problems of immediacy, salience, and hyperbolic discounting FRPs offer financial incentives to employees for healthy behaviors.&lt;ref name="Cawley, J"&gt;Cawley, John; Price, Joshua (2013). “A case study of a workplace wellness program that offers financial incentives for weight loss.” Journal of Health Economics, 32, 794-803.&lt;/ref&gt; Though lack of participation remains a problem even among well crafted FRPs, attrition is not random and greater weight loss success is associated with a reduction in later program dropout probability.&lt;ref name="Cawley, J" /&gt;

== Effects of workplace health promotion ==
The positive impact of workplace health promotion programs on productivity is widely discussed. The impact of workplace health promotion on absenteeism is substantial since productivity is impossible if an employee is absent.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Kirsten (2008). “Health and productivity management in Europe.” International Journal of Workplace Health Management, 1.2, 136-144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effects of [[presenteeism]] are also significant, and working while sick is estimated to cost the United States economy more than $150 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hemp, Paul (2004). “Presenteeism: At Work--But Out of It.” Harvard Business Review, October.&lt;/ref&gt; Absenteeism is estimated to cost the average employer $660 annually per employee.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Chris; Bass, Cara (2006). “The Cost of Employee Absenteeism.” Compensation Benefits Review, 38.6, 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on productivity costs, employees experiencing negative health conditions or at risk of developing impaired health cost employers up to $1601 more than healthy employees per year.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Rebecca; Bates, Paul (2011). “Measuring Health-Related Productivity Loss.” Population Health Management, 14.2, 93-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in [[productivity]] and absenteeism following implementation of workplace health promotion programs can annually save employers $15.6 for every one dollar spent on health initiatives.&lt;ref name="Aldana, SG" /&gt; More generally, employee health care costs and absentee day costs decrease by $3.27 and $2.73, respectively, for every dollar spent on workplace health promotion.&lt;ref name="Baicker, K" /&gt; In some cases, employer-based health programs have been shown to yield no reduction in health care spending or employer insurance outlay.&lt;ref&gt;Gowrisankaran, Gautaum; Norberg, Karen; Kymes, Steven; Chernew, Michael E.; Stwalley, Dustin; Kemper, Leah; Peck, William (2013). “A Hospital System’s Wellness Program Linked to Health Plan Enrollment Cut Hospitalizations But Not Overall Costs.” Health Affairs, 32.3, 477-485.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Debra; Rodday, Angie M.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Rogers, William H. (2013). “A Systematic Review of the Evidence Concerning the Economic Impact of Employee-Focused Health Promotion and Wellness Programs.” Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55.2, 209-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant to health outcomes, workplace health promotion programs have demonstrated numerous short and long term benefits. Significantly, workplace physical activity interventions are shown to improve employee fitness, activity behavior, unhealthy lipid levels, work attendance, and [[job stress]], and workplace exercise programs are known to reduce supervisor stress and abusive supervision of subordinates, increasing productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Conn, Vicki S.; Hafdahl, Adam R.; Cooper, Pamela S.; Brown, Lori M.; Lusk, Sally L. (2009). “Meta-Analysis of Workplace Physical Activity Interventions.” American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 37.4, 330-339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnton, James; Hoobler, Jenny M.; Scheuer, Melinda L. (2012). “Supervisor Workplace Stress and Abusive Supervision: The Buffering Effect of Exercise.” Journal of Business and Psychology, 27.3, 271-279.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional improvements have been noted following workplace health programs in [[injury]] incidence, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index, cardiovascular disease risk, dynamic muscle performance, and maximal oxygen consumption.&lt;ref name="Abraham, J" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Erickson, J" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Rooy, Kim; Sutherland, Stephanie; Squillace, Mike (2014). “Mayo Clinic’s Mindful Movements in the Workplace.” Health Benefits, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Karen; Jacques, Paul H. (2007). “Combined diet and Exercise Intervention in the Workplace: Effect on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors.” Workplace Health and Safety, 55.3, 109-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Some improvements vary by gender, with men often experiencing more consequential improvements in body mass index than women.&lt;ref name="Lara, A" /&gt; Workplace health promotion is also known to improve the “perceived health status” of employees, enhancing productivity and improving health program participation.&lt;ref name="Pohjonen, T" /&gt;

Summarily, the expected outcomes of an ideal workplace health promotion program include:
* “Make workers aware of their health and how being in good health improves quality of life.”
* “Workers should take ‘ownership’ of their behaviors and be accountable for health and cost outcomes.”
* “High participation and active involvement in these programs. People should take advantage of the many programs offered.”
* “Employees should lose weight, stop smoking, exercise more often, eat a healthy diet, better manage their stress levels, and generally adopt healthy habits.”
* “Medical claims costs should go down. The company should experience a lower incidence of certain diseases linked to behaviors like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), musculoskeletal disorders, and stroke.”
* “Workers will be absent less often, disability costs will be controlled, accidents will be avoided, and injury rates should drop sharply.”
* “These programs will attract the best talent—and turnover rates will be reduced because we are the employer of choice in the community.”
* “Workers will perform at higher levels—they will be happier, have more energy, and produce better results for our company.”
* “Establish a culture of health and well-being, where every worker feels valued and important to the enterprise—this will inspire greater loyalty and a high level of engagement.”
* “The program will produce a positive return-on-investment (ROI) for the company—for every dollar spent, two or three will be saved.”&lt;ref name="Goetzel, RZ" /&gt;

A '''young carer''' is a young person who cares, [[Volunteering|unpaid]], for a friend or family member who has any type of illness, [[disability]] or addiction and cannot manage without the young carer's support. There are estimated to be around 700,000 young carers in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carers.org/about-us/about-young-carers|title=About young carers {{!}} Carers Trust|website=carers.org|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately 1 in every 12 teenagers and round 2 in every classroom. The roles taken on by a young carer are exhaustive and are carried out often behind closed doors on top of the normal pressures of a young persons life. Responsibilities may range from providing [[Activities of daily living assistance|practical support]] such as helping to cook, clean or wash, giving personal care, [[emotional support]], providing [[medication]] or helping with financial chores.

The person they care for may be a parent, a sibling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siblingsaustralia.org.au/teensibs.php|title=Teen Siblings Page|last=|first=|date=|website=Siblings Australia|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; another family member or a friend, but does not necessarily live in the same house as them. The care they give may be practical, physical, and emotional.

The terms "disability" and "long-term illness" do not mean just a physical disability or illness, but also cover, for example, mental illness, learning disability, or [[drug addiction]], frailty or old age.

There are support programs to assist young carers both emotionally and financially with day-to-day tasks and making decisions. These programs offer face-to-face counselling, online programs, and [[Helpline|phone helplines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carergateway.gov.au/support-for-young-carers|title=Support for young carers|last=|first=|date=|website=Carer Gateway|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/who-can-help-young-carers.aspx|title=Who can help young carers?|last=|first=|date=|website=NHS Choices|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copmi.net.au/kids-young-people/support-for-young-carers|title=Are you a young carer?|last=|first=|date=|website=COPMI - Children of Parents with a Mental Illness|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some support programmes for young carers have been cut due to [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]].  The amount of support young carers get varies from area to area and is subject to a [[postcode lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Being_a_young_carer Being a young carer] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
