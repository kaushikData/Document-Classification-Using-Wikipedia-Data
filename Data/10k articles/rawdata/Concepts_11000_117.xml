The '''Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps''' ({{lang-de|Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen}}, '''AVE''') is a common division of the [[Eastern Alps]] into 75 [[mountain range]]s, based on the Moriggl Classification (ME) first published in 1924 by the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]]. The present-day division established for the German-speaking world (less [[Switzerland]]) was compiled by the [[German Alpine Club|German]], [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian]] and [[South Tyrol Alpine Club]]s and published in 1984 and is also used for the basic numbering of [[Alpine Club map]]s for [[mountaineering]].

== Classification system ==
The Eastern Alps are divided into four main areas: the  [[Northern Limestone Alps]], the [[Central Eastern Alps]], the [[Southern Limestone Alps]], and the [[List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps|Western Limestone Alps]]. These four main ranges are further divided into 75 sub-groups. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each, while the Southern Limestone Alps have 15. The six groups of the Western Limestone Alps are also classed with the Central Eastern Alps.

The classification is based principally on [[orography|orographic]] considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The amendments of 1984 address a number of [[Geology of the Alps|geological]] problems and have dropped many of the 1924 Morrigl groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. The Western Limestone Alps were added, an area which is not covered by the three Alpine Clubs and actually is a continuation of the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern]] and [[Swiss Alps]]. Unlike the previous scheme, the [[Salzburg Slate Alps]] were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps as they are part of the [[greywacke zone]] that forms the [[Basement (geology)|basement]] of the Limestone Alps. The [[Ortler Alps]] and the [[Monte Sobretta|Sobretta]]-[[Monte Gavia|Gavia]] range were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, though geologically, they are north of the [[Periadriatic Seam]] and ranked part of the [[Austroalpine nappes]].

== Geographical characteristics ==
The Eastern Alps extend across six European countries: [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Slovenia]]. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group.

The only [[four-thousander]] and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the [[Piz Bernina]] at {{convert|4046|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Thus the [[Bernina Range]] is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the [[Ortler Alps]], whose highest peak, Mt. [[Ortler]] at {{convert|3905|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the [[Glockner Group]] with the highest mountain in Austria: the [[Grossglockner]] at {{convert|3798|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the [[Lechtal Alps]], whose highest summit is the [[Parseierspitze]] at {{convert|3036|m|ft|abbr=on}}. 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres—except for the [[Vienna Woods]], whose highest mountain, the [[Schöpfl]], just reaches an altitude of {{convert|893|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

== Mountain groups as per the Alpine Club classification ==
See [[List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps]]

== Other classifications ==
Up to today, there is no internationally accepted classification of the Alps. Beside the common AVE arrangement, the [[Swiss Alpine Club]] subdivides the Swiss Alps (including the East Alpine parts) along [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] boundaries, while Austrian [[hydrography]] uses a slightly different orographic system. In [[Italy]] and [[France]] the segmentation is usually based on the 1926 ''[[Partizione delle Alpi]]''. In 2005, a new proposal was made by the Italian Alpinist, Sergio Marazzi, to merge the competing systems of the [[Alpine states]] into the ''Suddivisione Orografica Internazionale Unificata del Sistema Alpino'' ([[SOIUSA]]), but this has not gained acceptance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">The concept of '''alternating planar algebras''' first appeared in the work of [[Hernando Burgos-Soto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgos-Soto|first1=Hernando|title=The Jones Polynomial of Alternating Tangles|journal=Journal of Knot Theory and Its Ramifications|date=2010|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1487–1505|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218216510008510?journalCode=jktr|doi=10.1142/s0218216510008510|arxiv=0807.2600}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Jones polynomial]] of [[alternating tangles]]. Alternating planar algebras provide an appropriate algebraic framework for other [[knot invariants]] in cases the elements involved in the computation are alternating. The concept has been used in extending to [[Tangle (mathematics)|tangles]] some properties of [[Jones polynomial]] and [[Khovanov homology]] of alternating links.

==Definition==

An alternating planar algebra is an oriented [[planar algebra]], where the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-input planar arc diagrams &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the following conditions:

* The number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of strings ending on the external boundary of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 0.
* There is complete connection among input discs of the diagram and its arcs, namely, the union of the diagram arcs and the boundary of the internal holes is a connected set.
* The in- and out-strings alternate in every boundary component of the diagram.

A planar arc diagram like this has been denominated type-&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; planar diagram.

==Applications==

There are two known applications of the concept of alternating planar algebra.

*It was used for extend to tangles the property that states that the Jones Polynomial of an alternating [[Link (knot theory)|link]] is an alternating polynomial.
*It was used for extend to tangles a result about the Khovanov homology that states that The Khovanov homology of an alternating [[Link (knot theory)|link]] is supported in two lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Natan|first1=Dror|last2=Burgos-Soto|first2=Hernando|title=Khovanov homology for alternating tangles|journal=Journal of Knot Theory and Its Ramifications|date=2014|volume=23|issue=02|page=1450013|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218216514500138|doi=10.1142/s0218216514500138|arxiv=1305.1695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1003">[[Image:Ivory Tirupati with heavy list 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A heavily listing ship]]
The '''angle of list''' is the degree to which a [[Watercraft|vessel]] heels (leans or tilts) to either [[Port and starboard|port]] or [[starboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|isbn=0192115537|year=1976|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A listing vessel is stable and at equilibrium, but the distribution of weight aboard (often caused by uneven loading or flooding) causes it to heel to one side.

By contrast, roll is the dynamic movement from side to side caused by waves.

If a listing ship goes beyond the point where a righting moment will keep it afloat, it will [[capsize]] and potentially sink.

Ayyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts ''[[Akilathirattu Ammanai]]'' and ''[[Arul Nool]]''.

The five Pancha pathi are:
1. the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope Pathi]], the venue of the great [[Tavam of Vaikundar|Tavam]] and the religion's headquarters.
2. [[Ambala Pathi]], where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.

==Symbolism==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi symbolism}}
[[File:Ayyavazhi Sahasrara.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sahasrara]], symbolised in Ayyavazhi as ''Lotus carrying Namam'']]
The symbol of Ayyavazhi is a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] carrying a flame-shaped white ''[[Thirunamam|Namam]]''.&lt;ref name="Namam Symbol"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulendiren|first=Pon|title=Hinduism a Scientific Religion|year=2012|publisher=[[iUniverse]]|location=Bloomington, Indiana.|isbn=9781475936735|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bwxDc6B9eokC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam"&gt;Tha. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled ''[[Sahasrara]]'' (in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''Ladam''), while the Namam represents the ''Aanma Jyothi'' or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]''.&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /&gt; Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Akilam15:39 "Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya ''Thirunama'' Pottumittu"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. Source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool – Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Thirunamam]] (the "flame shaped symbol" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;In the absence of written references, there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older, but is not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythical narration in akilam about the eight [[yuga]]s is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight [[chakra]]s.&lt;ref name="Yugas as Chakras"&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. (Additional) XII–XIII " Athara thana vilakka attavanai ".&lt;/ref&gt; The first, [[Neetiya Yukam]], is [[Bindu (symbol)|Bindu]] and the final state, [[Dharma Yukam]], is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of [[consciousness]] (''namam'') of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment, is for experiencing the absolute "bliss".&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is [[Ekam]], which is a part of Vaikundar a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute.&lt;ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /&gt; Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol "Lotus with Thirunamam" shows "Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara."

In certain [[Hindu]] texts, the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |publisher=kheper.net |title=Sahasrara Chakra |accessdate=3 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422124833/http://kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm |archive-date=22 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]], Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]].&lt;ref name="Yugas as Chakras" /&gt; ''Sahasrara'' is symbolised as a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] without a stem.

Ayyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of ''Sahasrara'' is used to cover the roof.&lt;ref&gt;See this image[[:File:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png]], a Nizhal Thangal constructed in this architectural manner near Marthandam, [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus may also represent the [[Human heart|heart]] and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Pulavar. R. Shanmugam's, (2000), ''Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam'', Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ' ''Triple Namam'' '(not used currently), and [[Conch]].

==Teachings and impact==
{{Main article|Teachings and impacts of Ayyavazhi}}
The majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as ''Ayya'', "dear father", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam'', pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ekam evolution.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution of [[Ekam]], the source of whole [[existence]] (till [[Kali Yuga]])]]
Ayyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundara Mani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The [[Kali (demon)|evil of Kali]] blocks the ultimate or supreme [[henosis|oneness]] prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of [[Self (spirituality)|individuality]] and of [[Ego (spirituality)|extreme pride]]. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Ekam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woldman|first1=Jeanette|title=Travel guide to other dimensions.|date=2010|publisher=Woldman|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0984531017|page=16|edition=Illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; —the "over-soul" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is "one which undergoes different changes with respect to [[space and time]]" because of the evil force [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', pp. 103–121&lt;/ref&gt;

All of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Janak|title=World religions and the new era of science|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corp.|location=[S. l.]|isbn=1453535721|page=Hinduism 5}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 October 2014--&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam,&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#Worship in front of a mirror|mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship]]. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as [[Paramatma]] (over-soul) by which, God is the "Husband", while all other souls are his "consorts",&lt;ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" &gt;Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; symbolised by [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]], where Vaikundar marries the individual souls.&lt;ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" /&gt; Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the [[Creation myth|creation]] of [[human beings]] and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnumani, ''Ucchippadippu'', pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, p. 114 ''" Other verses from Akilattirattu like, 'throw the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes."''&lt;/ref&gt; It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.
From its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ward and Conner, Geographical and Statistical Memoir, p. 133; V. Nagam Aiya, The Travancore State Manual, Volume-2, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In this contest, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf. Ponneelan'', ''Vaikunta Cuvamiyum Avar Kalamum'', Mimeograph note, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Nathan's, ''Ayyaa vaikuNdarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'' (Tamil), Chapter 4, p. 83: "இதற்கு ஆதாரமாக அய்யா வைகுண்டரைத் தெய்வமாக ஏற்றுக்கொண்ட சுமார் 8000 – க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அய்யாவழிப் பதிகள் தமிழ்நாடு மற்றும் கேரளப்பகுதிகளில் இயங்குவதைக் கூறலாம்." (This citation is from a Tamil Wikipedia article)&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of ''Nizhal Thangals''.&lt;ref&gt;From the following reports: ''James Town Mission District'' for 1863, ''Neyoor Mission District'' for 1869, ''Santhapuram Mission District'' for 1858, ''Nagercoil Mission District'' for 1864, from the ARTDC for the respective years.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, ''Swamithope pathi'' serves as the religious headquarters for all. The ''Pathi''s earn more importance among the worship centers.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers" /&gt;

The seven ''[[Pathi]]''s,&lt;ref name="Dr. Paulose's book" /&gt; obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship.&lt;ref name ="Worship Centers" /&gt; The ''Swamithope pathi'', though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All ''Pathis'', except itself, are managed by independent committees.&lt;ref&gt;N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World'', pp. 41–44&lt;/ref&gt; The five ''Pathis'' known as [[Pancha pathi]] are considered foremost among Pathis.

[[Nizhal Thangal]]s, compared with ''Pathis'', are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikundacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sarvesvaran, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamikal – A Forgotten Social Reformer'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118. Vaikuntacami is said to have established seven of these nilaltankalkal at Chettykudiyirrupu, Agastisvaram, Palur, Chundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadampankulam and Pampankulam.&lt;/ref&gt; and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

These centers emerged as the abode of Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Dharma'' (1985), Published by 'Center for the Study of World Religions', Dharmaram College, Bangalore.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide [[Panividai]] at least once daily.

==Ethics==
[[File:Flag mast of Swamithoppe.jpg|170px|thumb|right|The flag mast of [[Swamithoppe]] with Ayyavazhi symbol at the top]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi ethics}}
The ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, ''Akilattirattu Ammanai''.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics"&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', Chapter 5, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as "told by God" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], [[saint]]s, etc. when ever asked by them.

[[Neetham]] is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics" /&gt;

To an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and "attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] also.&lt;ref name="Dharma for devas" &gt;Mani Bharathi, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part – 2)''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.&lt;ref name="Dharma for devas" /&gt; Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]] with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] rules the minds of people.

Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religious studies==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}
[[File:Tamarai-Namam glossy.png|thumb|left|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]]]]
It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="G. Patrick, p.119"&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.

The philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'', pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name= "Hindu keys to Akilam"&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?'', pp.10–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the 96 [[tatvas]] are understood, then the [[Kaliyan]] is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts.&lt;ref name= "Hindu keys to Akilam" /&gt; Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.

On [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]], including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana and [[Vishnu Purana]], but with limited details.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream {{sic}} story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151.&lt;/ref&gt; Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; some are regenerated,&lt;ref name="G. Patrick, p.119"/&gt; while others are rejected.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures" /&gt; But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.&lt;ref name="Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures"&gt;''Arisundara Mani'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. ''To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
[[File:The Evolution of Ekam.png|thumb|right|The Evolution – [[Ekam]] to [[Vaikundar]]]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi theology}}
The theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other [[monism|monistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, [[Infinity|infinite]], genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, "one", "absolute",&lt;ref&gt;M. Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]), {{ISBN|81-206-0001-0}}, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; "the whole which exists"&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; and "the incomparable";&lt;ref&gt;''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.

Narrating through mythology, The ''Sivam'' and the ''Sakthi'' are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The ''Natham''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from [[Akilam thirteen]] says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is [[Creation myth|created]] by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.

In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devil What Does He Look Like?|date=2012|publisher=Millennial Mind Pub|isbn=1589826620|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SD6-YKBqGr0C&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called ''Kalimayai'' (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 36, "Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance."&lt;/ref&gt; that contrasts the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

==Festivals and rituals==
[[File:Kodiyetru Thirunal.jpg|thumb|left|The flag hoisting fest during [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in [[Swamithope pathi]].]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}
There are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]] is celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month ''Masi'' (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the [[Solar calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass procession conducted on this day from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithoppe]] is a popular one in this part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021744/http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 27 September 2007|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=5 March 2007 |format= Kanyakumari District|work=Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thiru Edu-Vasippu]] is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ayyavazhi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30|title= www.ayyavazhi.org|accessdate=11 November 2007 |format= Festivals|work=Thiru Edu Vasippu

Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as '' 'Nitham Thirunal' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vazhvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as '' 'Anna Dharmam' '', physical as well as spiritual [[cleanliness]] through Thuvayal Thavasu,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sami+thope&amp;dq=Sami+thope&amp;pgis=1 The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181101/https://books.google.com/books?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sami+thope&amp;dq=Sami+thope&amp;pgis=1 |date=29 June 2016 }}'' (1986), Published by 'Mythic Society', Bangalore, India, v.77 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,&lt;ref name="Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices" &gt;''T. Krishnanathan'', ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.&lt;ref&gt;Akilathirattu p. 252: "the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Churul.jpg|thumb|right|A '' 'churul' '' prepared to be offered for Panividai]]
But they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The [[Muthirikkinaru]] and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the ''Patham'' and ''Namam'' of them have the power to heal all sorts of mental&lt;ref&gt;''N. Amalan'', ''Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varalaru'', Akilam Publications, 86–87: "முத்திரிபுகளை (மும்மலம்) போக்க முத்திரிக்கிணற்றில் பதம் விட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்".&lt;/ref&gt; as well as physical illness.&lt;ref name="Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] Report for the year ''1847'', pp. 88–89: ''"They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water as the cure for all their diseases."''&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundaramani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai'', p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ayyavazhi religious practices#Wearing of headgear during worship|use of the crown]] reveals that "all are kings", visualising an ideology similar to ''advaita''. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==
{{Main article|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}
The formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[Exclusivity (religion)|exclusivity]], as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
[[File:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|thumb|left|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars of Vishnu]] carved on it]]
Ayyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of [[Allah]] and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi"&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /&gt; But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clause|first1=Forrest|title=The Esoteric Codex: Fallen Angels|date=21 March 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329006461|page=41|edition=Illustrated}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda [[Avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in [[Akilam thirteen]] which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana,&lt;ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /&gt; but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the [[Books of the Bible|Bible composition]]. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is "it was created with the intention of man and not that of God".&lt;ref&gt;"He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention". – Akilam5:571&lt;/ref&gt; In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like '' 'Accept God; Reject religion' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'' p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' ''Hindu'' ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam 12:151 – "Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal"&lt;/ref&gt; Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boon]] they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali).&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp. 114 -116.&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.&lt;ref name= "Ayyavazhi belief system" /&gt;

==Mythology==

{{Main article|Ayyavazhi mythology}}
The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present, and a future – constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts."&lt;/ref&gt; It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, "It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]], is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula −6th&amp;11th Venpaas (a species of verse).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Zecharia (1826–1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805–1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing of Headgear during worship,&lt;ref&gt;M.S.S. Pandiyan, Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal Thavasu&lt;ref&gt;LMS Report for 1838, p. 71 says "About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform."&lt;/ref&gt; all were noted in history.

::::&lt;small&gt; * Chakras: The yugas assumed as chakras &amp; as geological time periods above, are philosophical and geological metaphors respectively and are not mentioned directly so in Akilam. &lt;/small&gt;
::::&lt;small&gt; ** Cambrian Explosion: As per [[Akilam]] the [[Kroni]] is fragmented into six and each of the fragments took birth in each subsequent yugas. So the death of Kroni as in the Akilam narrative is to be considered as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], where the diversification of life begins, in spite of it being listed as an extinction in the context of the destruction of Kroni. . &lt;/small&gt;

Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten [[Avatars of Vishnu]], it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and Dharma yukam==
[[File:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide celestial [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]
{{Main article|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}
[[The Santror]] is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 151 "Canror (Santror) is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)"&lt;/ref&gt; There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.&lt;ref name="Chanar"&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early "Chanars", who were called by the Arabs as "Al Hind", and known in biblical times as the "People of Five Rivers"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp| title= Nadar Community – Who Are they| accessdate= 23 January 2008| format= Nadars – Where they live? what they do? reason behind their success| work= "Nadars are one of the earliest inhabitants of our land, Bharat, which was later called by the Arabs as 'Al Hind'. In biblical times they were known as the 'People of Five Rivers'."| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127144306/http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp| archivedate= 27 January 2008| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term "Santror" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignity&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 23, line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and supreme knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A quote from Akilam too reads, "Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly."&lt;ref name="Chanar" /&gt;

The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to be born in the mythical garden [[Ayotha Amirtha Gangai|Ayodha Amirtha Vanam]] ''(supposed to be between present-day [[Srirangam]], Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, [[Sri Lanka]])'' by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by [[Thirumal]], to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term "Santror" refers to the entire [[human race]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage started at the end phase of [[Dvapara Yuga|Dvapara Yukam]] and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.

The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of [[Dharma Yukam]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam."&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the belief is that [[Ayya Vaikundar]] had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 109 says, "Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it."&lt;/ref&gt; over the Dharma Yukam in the place of [[Kali Yukam]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, "The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam."&lt;/ref&gt; after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of ''Dwaraka pathi'', the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]] by [[Krishna]]) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swami|first1=Bhaktivejanyana|title=Ithihaasa: The Mystery of His Story Is My Story of History|date=2013|publisher=Author House|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=1477242732|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BqHBvySDxEQC&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=SM. |last1=Ramasamy|title=Geomatics in tsunami|date=2006|publisher=New India Publ. agency|location=New Dehli|isbn=8189422316|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5gEBfvCBclUC&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 161, "Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist eternally&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to [[Moksha]]—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', pp. 657–658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with Hinduism==
[[File:Kailash Tibet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Kailash|Kailash]], where the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boons]] were offered to [[Kaliyan]] by [[Shiva|Siva]], is sacred in Ayyavazhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courtney|first1=Tom|title=Walkabout Northern California : hiking inn to inn|date=2011|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Birmingham, AL|isbn=0899976581|page=196|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQZLAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adventure|first1=National Geographic|title=World's Best Hikes: Epic Trails|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/lists/hiking-backpacking/worlds-best-grail-trails/|website=www.nationalgeographic.com|publisher=National Geographic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}
The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remained with Divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kirushnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and are unhelpful.

The reason, as stated in [[Akilam]] for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], there in [[Mount Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Brahma]] surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to [[Shaivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Here the ideology changes similar to that of [[Vaishnavism]]. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.
[[File:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya Vaikundar|Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]] the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by [[Lakshmi]] and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt;

And from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and [[Brahma]] therefore form a part within Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" &gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through [[Vinchai]]s.&lt;ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" /&gt; After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name="Akilathirattu parts" &gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.&lt;ref name="Akilathirattu parts" /&gt; So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.

==Phenomenology==
{{Main article|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}
[[File:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar|Prajapathi Adikalar]], Last Descendant of the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyan]] family of [[Swamithope pathi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|title= www.dhyanapeetam.org|accessdate= 20 February 2009|format= Peace Walk (Pada Yatra) by Swamiji – Tamil Nadu – 12 January 2009 onwards|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303104019/http://dhyanapeetam.org/Web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|archivedate= 3 March 2009|deadurl= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiruvasakam – 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.)&lt;/ref&gt; But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' or ''Narayana Swami Temple'', similar to Hindu [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as [[Kali]], [[Hanuman]] and other folk deities in spite of the anti-[[polytheistic]] ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities"&gt;Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten [[Avatar]]s of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 1, ''"Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya."''&lt;/ref&gt; The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" /&gt; Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.&lt;ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" /&gt;

The spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).&lt;ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai"&gt;R. Shunmugam, ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', pp. 189–191&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]].&lt;ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai" /&gt; Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, " ... but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and&amp;nbsp;..." Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar.&lt;/ref&gt; Not even the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyans]] from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Court Judgement, District Court, Nagercoil, Case: O.S. No.80/1110, '' "The doctrines and the philosophic basis of this cult are not clearly known. Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism"''&lt;/ref&gt; All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a religion|as a separate belief]] and instead taken as [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a Hindu sect|a Hindu sect]].

There is a common belief that Ayya Vaikundar is a [[prophet]] and he had made many prophecies during his earthly years. On the contrary, there are no implications in [[Akilam]] or other books of [[Arul Nool]] that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)|Thiruvasagam 4]], Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of [[Prophecies]] and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the [[Seedars]] by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. [[Robert Caldwell]], one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] [[Christian missionary]]), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergunder|first1=Michael|last2=Frese|first2=Heiko|title=Ritual, caste, and religion in colonial South India|date=2011|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=9380607210|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OcEM2IsnA1AC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Ayya+Vaikundar#v=onepage&amp;q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}
Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The [[Ayyavazhi rituals|rituals]] are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', "Rituals", p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to [[Shastras]], [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Akilattirattu Ammanai (T. Palaramachandran Nadar), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar,&lt;ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar" /&gt; from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a ''Hindu renaissance''.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp.62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp.163–178.&lt;/ref&gt; as it brought many social changes there in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala|keralite]] society during the 19th century.

The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as ''"Path of God"'' with the phrase ''"Ayya Vazhi"''. On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that [[Vaikundar]] unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar"&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, '' "Ayya Vali – A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon" '', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate [[Ayyavazhi theology|theology]], [[Ayyavazhi mythology|mythology]], [[Ayyavazhi holy sites|holy places]], [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centres]], and ethics of its own. [[File:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|thumb|right|'' 'The Great Masi Procession' '' from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]]]]
Though many new papers, academic researchers&lt;ref name= "Historical Dictionary of Shamanism" /&gt; and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last = Bagavathikan|first = M. Raj|title = Ayya Vaikuntar|date = 10 February 1999|url = http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm|accessdate = 13 January 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080214072150/http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm|archivedate = 14 February 2008|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They indulge in the mystic practices of possessions and divinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.

Regarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across [[India]], comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of [[Tamil Nadu]], it is very hard to find a village without a [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centre of Ayyavazhi]].&lt;ref name="Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers" /&gt; Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers)&lt;ref name="Paulose: Spread of Ayyavazhi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers"&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered [[Hindu]]s in the census.

[[Image:Baksheesh Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|Mounted policemen in Egypt allow photos of themselves for baksheesh, 2008]]
'''Baksheesh''' or '''bagsheesh''' (from {{lang-fa|بخشش}} ''bakhshesh''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=+baksheesh&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[tip (gratuity)|tipping]], [[Charity (virtue)|charitable giving]], and certain forms of [[political corruption]] and [[bribery]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]].

==Etymology and usage==
Baksheesh comes from the Persian word {{lang|fa|بخشش}} (''bakhshesh''), which originated from the [[Middle Persian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word had also moved to other cultures and countries. In the [[Albanian Language|Albanian]], [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Languages of India|Indian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language]]s, ''bakshish'' or бакшиш means "tip" in the conventional western sense. In Greek, μπαξίσι (''baksisi'') can mean a gift in general. In [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], ''Bakschisch'' is a small bribe (in Romanian as well, depending on the context; usually employed as a euphemism to ''şpagă'', which means outright bribe).

== Types ==
*[[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] to beggars:  In [[Pakistan]], [[beggars]] solicit alms by crying'' 'baksheesh, baba!'.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark McCrum. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9oiqvpqxusC&amp;pg=PA104 ''Going Dutch in Beijing: How to Behave Properly When Far Away from Home'']. Macmillan, 2008. {{ISBN|0-8050-8676-5}}, {{ISBN|9780805086768}}/ Pg 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tipping: This does not correlate with the European system of [[tip (gratuity)|tipping]], as it also includes demonstrations of gratitude, respect, or veneration. An offering to the [[deity|gods]] may be considered baksheesh. A ''[[faqir]]'' may also ask for ''baksheesh'', but no thought is in his mind that he is begging. In fact, in Pakistan and the [[Muslim]] world, the giver of alms often salutes the beggar for having been given the opportunity to gain [[:wikt:merit|merit]]. In [[Egypt]], baksheesh is often requested on top of fares to taxi drivers, and as service charges to waiters, doormen, shopkeepers, garage attendants, and many others employed in service-sector jobs.
* Outright [[bribery]]: In countries with [[Corruption index|endemic corruption]], for instance, a member of the police force, or a migration or customs officer, or any other type of government official may be swayed from legitimately or illegitimately arresting, issuing a fine, or imposing a tax on someone by a suitable payment of baksheesh which would constitute a bribe, whether it was offered to the official or requested by the official.

==In literature==

When American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] travelled on his maiden visit to [[India]] in 1954, he encountered pervasive begging which he called the "Baksheesh Complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph |editor=Robin Larsen |editor2=Stephen Larsen |editor3=Antony Van Couvering |title=Baksheesh and Brahman: Asian Journals - India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VySPqLx1DucC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Brahma+and+Baksheesh&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Brahma%20and%20Baksheesh&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|isbn=1-57731-237-6|pages= xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]], after riding through the [[Bible|Biblical]] town of [[Magdala]] in 1867, makes note of his encounter with beggars and the term "bucksheesh" in his published work ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'': "They hung to the horses' tails, clung to their manes and the stirrups, closed in on every side in scorn of dangerous hoofs&amp;mdash;and out of their infidel throats, with one accord, burst an agonizing and most infernal chorus:'' '[[wikt :howadji|Howajji]], bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! bucksheesh! bucksheesh!' ''I never was in a storm like that before."

Leo Deuel, the writer on archaeology, sardonically described baksheesh as "lavish remuneration and bribes, rudely demanded but ever so graciously accepted by the natives in return for little or no services rendered".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Testaments of Time; the Search for Lost Manuscripts and Records, | author=Deuel, Leo | year=1966 | location=New York | page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bram Stoker]] mentions backsheesh twice in ''[[Dracula]]''.  The log of the ship ''Demeter'' when recording the voyage from Varna to Whitby uses the word backsheesh separately during the description of two inspections by customs officers, once when the ship was entering the [[Bosphorus]] and again while on the way through the [[Dardanelles]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=sn9W2cLuhxYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dracula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=evRKUojPFoWI0AXw4oDABQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=backsheesh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative Diffusion''' is a type of [[pathfinding]] algorithm which uses the concept of ''antiobjects'', objects within a computer program that function opposite to what would be conventionally expected. Collaborative Diffusion is typically used in video games, when multiple agents must path towards a single target agent. For example, the ghosts in [[Pac-Man]]. In this case, the background tiles serve as antiobjects, carrying out the necessary calculations for creating a path and having the foreground objects react accordingly, whereas having foreground objects be responsible for their own pathing would be conventionally expected.

Collaborative Diffusion is favored for its efficiency over other pathfinding algorithms, such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]], when handling multiple agents. Also, this method allows elements of competition and teamwork to easily be incorporated between tracking agents. Notably, the time taken to calculate paths remains constant as the number of agents increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Repenning|first1=Alexander|title=Collaborative Diffusion: Programming Antiobjects|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf|publisher=AgentSheets Inc &amp; University of Colorado|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7286">In [[mathematics]], a '''complex differential form''' is a [[differential form]] on a [[manifold]] (usually a [[complex manifold]]) which is permitted to have [[complex number|complex]] coefficients.

Complex forms have broad applications in [[differential geometry]].  On complex manifolds, they are fundamental and serve as the basis for much of [[algebraic geometry]], [[Kähler metric|Kähler geometry]], and [[Hodge theory]].  Over non-complex manifolds, they also play a role in the study of [[almost complex structure]]s, the theory of [[spinor]]s, and [[CR structure]]s.

Typically, complex forms are considered because of some desirable decomposition that the forms admit.  On a complex manifold, for instance, any complex ''k''-form can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of so-called '''(''p'',''q'')-forms''': roughly, wedges of ''p'' [[exterior derivative|differentials]] of the holomorphic coordinates with ''q'' differentials of their complex conjugates.  The ensemble of (''p'',''q'')-forms becomes the primitive object of study, and determines a finer geometrical structure on the manifold than the ''k''-forms.  Even finer structures exist, for example, in cases where [[Hodge theory]] applies.

==Differential forms on a complex manifold==
Suppose that ''M'' is a [[complex manifold]].  Then there is a local [[coordinate system]] consisting of ''n'' complex-valued functions ''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,z&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the coordinate transitions from one patch to another are [[holomorphic function]]s of these variables.  The space of complex forms carries a rich structure, depending fundamentally on the fact that these transition functions are holomorphic, rather than just [[smooth manifold|smooth]].

===One-forms===
We begin with the case of one-forms.  First decompose the complex coordinates into their real and imaginary parts: ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;+''iy''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; for each ''j''.  Letting
:&lt;math&gt;dz^j=dx^j+idy^j,\quad d\bar{z}^j=dx^j-idy^j,&lt;/math&gt;
one sees that any differential form with complex coefficients can be written uniquely as a sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n\left(f_jdz^j+g_jd\bar{z}^j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Let &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; be the space of complex differential forms containing only &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt;'s and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; be the space of forms containing only &lt;math&gt;d\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;'s.  One can show, by the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]], that the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; are stable under holomorphic coordinate changes.  In other words, if one makes a different choice ''w''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of holomorphic coordinate system, then elements of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; transform [[tensor]]ially, as do elements of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; determine complex [[vector bundle]]s on the complex manifold.

===Higher-degree forms===
The wedge product of complex differential forms is defined in the same way as with real forms.  Let ''p'' and ''q'' be a pair of non-negative integers &amp;le; ''n''.   The space &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt; of (''p'',''q'')-forms is defined by taking linear combinations of the wedge products of ''p'' elements from &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''q'' elements from &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^{p,q}=\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\dotsb\wedge\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\Omega^{0,1}\wedge\dotsb\wedge\Omega^{0,1}&lt;/math&gt;
where there are ''p'' factors of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''q'' factors of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Just as with the two spaces of 1-forms, these are stable under holomorphic changes of coordinates, and so determine vector bundles.

If ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is the space of all complex differential forms of total degree ''k'', then each element of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; can be expressed in a unique way as a linear combination of elements from among the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt; with ''p''+''q''=''k''.  More succinctly, there is a [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;E^k=\Omega^{k,0}\oplus\Omega^{k-1,1}\oplus\dotsb\oplus\Omega^{1,k-1}\oplus\Omega^{0,k}=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}\Omega^{p,q}.&lt;/math&gt;
Because this direct sum decomposition is stable under holomorphic coordinate changes, it also determines a vector bundle decomposition.

In particular, for each ''k'' and each ''p'' and ''q'' with ''p''+''q''=''k'', there is a canonical projection of vector bundles
:&lt;math&gt;\pi^{p,q}:E^k\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The Dolbeault operators===
The usual exterior derivative defines a mapping of sections &lt;math&gt; d: \Omega^{r} \to \Omega^{r+1}&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt; d(\Omega^{p,q}) \subseteq \bigoplus_{r + s = p + q + 1} \Omega^{r,s}&lt;/math&gt;
The exterior derivative does not in itself reflect the more rigid complex structure of the manifold.

Using ''d'' and the projections defined in the previous subsection, it is possible to define the '''Dolbeault operators''':
:&lt;math&gt;\partial=\pi^{p+1,q}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p+1,q},\quad \bar{\partial}=\pi^{p,q+1}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q+1}&lt;/math&gt;
To describe these operators in local coordinates, let
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sum_{|I|=p,|J|=q}\ f_{IJ}\,dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J\in\Omega^{p,q}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' and ''J'' are [[multi-index|multi-indices]].  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\partial\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_\ell \frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial z^\ell}\,dz^\ell\wedge dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_\ell \frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial \bar{z}^\ell}d\bar{z}^\ell\wedge dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J.&lt;/math&gt;

The following properties are seen to hold:
:&lt;math&gt;d=\partial+\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2=\bar{\partial}^2=\partial\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\partial=0.&lt;/math&gt;

These operators and their properties form the basis for [[Dolbeault cohomology]] and many aspects of [[Hodge theory]].

===Holomorphic forms===
For each ''p'', a '''holomorphic ''p''-form''' is a holomorphic section of the bundle &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;''p,0''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In local coordinates, then, a holomorphic ''p''-form can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sum_{|I|=p}f_I\,dz^I&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; f_I &lt;/math&gt; are holomorphic functions.  Equivalently, the (''p'',0)-form &amp;alpha; is holomorphic if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}\alpha=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of holomorphic ''p''-forms is often written &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, although this can sometimes lead to confusion so many authors tend to adopt an alternative notation.

'''Complexity''' characterises the behaviour of a [[system]] or [[model (disambiguation)|model]] whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of [[emergence]] greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].

[[Science]] {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;

reflect many of these. [[Neil F. Johnson|Neil Johnson]] states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."  Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

== Overview ==
Definitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential "[[system]]" – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.

[[Warren Weaver]] posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Phenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront "dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole".&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt; Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.

Some definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.

== Disorganized vs. organized ==
One of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.

Weaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between "disorganized complexity" and "organized complexity".

In Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a "disorganized complexity" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.

A prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of planetary orbits – the latter can be predicted by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sir James Lighthill and Modern Fluid Mechanics", by Lokenath Debnath, The University of Texas-Pan American, US, Imperial College Press: {{ISBN|978-1-84816-113-9}}: {{ISBN|1-84816-113-1}}, Singapore, page 31. Online at http://cs5594.userapi.com/u11728334/docs/25eb2e1350a5/Lokenath_Debnath_Sir_James_Lighthill_and_mode.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to "emerge," without any "guiding hand".

The number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and factors ==
There are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.

The source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.

In the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert, "Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective", Columbia, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.

== Varied meanings ==
In several scientific fields, "complexity" has a precise meaning:

* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm. This allows classification of computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP,]] etc.). An axiomatic approach to computational complexity was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.
* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. [[Minimum message length]] is a practical application of this approach. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, M. (1982) Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations, Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v.25, No. 3, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to Kolmogorov complexity. It is possible to treat different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).
* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].
* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[Quantum state|state vector]] of the system. This should not be confused with [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy in [[statistical mechanics]].
* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn–Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].
* In [[Network theory]] complexity is the product of richness in the connections between components of a system,&lt;ref&gt;A complex network analysis example: "[http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/ Complex Structures and International Organizations]" ({{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia. L'esempio della cooperazione intellettuale della Società delle Nazioni | journal = Memoria e Ricerca | date = 2017| pages = 371–393| url = https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.14647/87204 | doi = 10.14647/87204}} See also: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01610098v2 French version]).&lt;/ref&gt; and defined by a very unequal distribution of certain measures (some elements being highly connected and some very few, see [[complex network]]). 
* In [[software engineering]], [[programming complexity]] is a measure of the interactions of the various elements of the software. This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.
* In [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] sense – Abstract Complexity, is based on visual structures [[perception]] &lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Stanowski (2011) Abstract Complexity Definition, Complicity 2, p.78-83 [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/complicity/article/view/11156]&lt;/ref&gt; It is complexity of binary string defined as a square of features number divided by number of elements (0's and 1's). Features comprise here all distinctive arrangements of 0's and 1's. Though the features number have to be always approximated the definition is precise and meet intuitive criterion.

Other fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:

* A [[complex adaptive system]] has some or all of the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson" /&gt;
** The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial – however, there is no general rule to separate "trivial" from "non-trivial";
** The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];
** The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;
** The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;
** The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment;
** The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.

== Study ==
Complexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex – displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]] – is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.

The use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting "stovepipes" and effective "integrated" solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lissack, Michael R.]]; [[Johan Roos]] (2000). ''The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity.'' Intercultural Press. {{ISBN|978-1-85788-235-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.

While this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s, social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30193748/Complexics_as_a_Meta-Transdisciplinary_Field|title=Complexics as a meta-transdisciplinary field|last=Bastardas-Boada|first=Albert|date=|website=Academia.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].

== Topics ==

=== Behaviour ===
The behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and [[self-organization]]. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.

===Mechanisms ===
Recent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].

=== Simulations ===
In [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].

=== Systems ===
{{main article|Complex system}}
[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (in recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including [[biology]], [[economics]], social studies and [[technology]]. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al, [[non-linearity|non-linear]], and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.

=== Data ===
In [[information theory]], algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.

Complex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command "X" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like "18995316"), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the "translation" language – which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.

These algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity{{who|date=October 2013}}.

[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.

Recent work in [[machine learning]] has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] for [[binary classification]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, T.K.; Basu, M. (2002). "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=990132&amp;tag=1 Complexity Measures of Supervised Classification Problems]". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (3), pp 289–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity measures broadly cover:
* the overlaps in feature values from differing classes.
* the separability of the classes.
* measures of geometry, topology, and density of [[manifold]]s. Instance hardness is another approach seeks to characterize the data complexity with the goal of determining how hard a data set is to classify correctly and is not limited to binary problems.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R.; Martinez, T.; Giraud-Carrier, C. (2014). "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5422-z An Instance Level Analysis of Data Complexity]". Machine Learning, 95(2): 225–256.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Saez, J.; Luengo, J.; Herrera, F. (2013). "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320312003251 Predicting Noise Filtering Efficacy with Data Complexity Measures for Nearest Neighbor Classification]". Pattern Recognition 46 (1) pp 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt; and could be expanded to other areas.

=== In molecular recognition ===
A recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes [[molecular recognition]] as a phenomenon of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Complexity in molecular recognition | author=Jorg Grunenberg | journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. | year=2011 | volume=13 | pages= 10136–10146 | doi=10.1039/c1cp20097f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even for small molecules like [[carbohydrates]], the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual [[hydrogen bond]]'s strength is exactly known.

== Applications ==
Computational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems – that is, the difficulty of [[problem solving|solving]] them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm – usually a computer program – to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 2^n)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit – the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.

Even though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.

There exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].

There is another form of complexity called [[Model of hierarchical complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.

[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Śmierć.jpg|thumb|right|''Śmierć'' ("Death"), a 1902 painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]]]]
'''Consciousness after death''' is a common theme in [[society]] and [[culture]] in the context of [[Afterlife|life after death]].  [[Science|Scientific]] [[research]] has established that the [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the [[brain]], the cessation of which defines [[brain death]]. However, many believe in some form of [[Afterlife|life after death]], which is a feature of many [[religion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Neuroscience==

[[Neuroscience]] is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the [[premise]] that all of [[behavior]] and all of the [[mental function|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the [[nervous system]], especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Neural_Science_Fifth_Editi.html?id=s64z-LdAIsEC Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition]" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, L. et al. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamental_Neuroscience.html?id=AEmEn-_hD9IC Fundamental Neuroscience, 4th edition]" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Carter Snead. "[http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1557&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship Neuroimaging and the "Complexity" of Capital Punishment]" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Kandel, M.D. "[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=172780 A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry]" (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience Core Concepts: The Essential Principles of Neuroscience|website=BrainFacts.org: Explore the Brain and Mind|url=http://www.brainfacts.org/about-neuroscience/core-concepts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple lines of [[scientific evidence|evidence]] that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.

* '''Neuroanatomical correlates''': In the field of [[neuroimaging]], [[neuroscientist]]s can use various [[functional neuroimaging]] methods to measure an aspect of brain function that correlates with a particular mental state or process.
* '''Experimental manipulations''': Neuroimaging (correlational) studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of mental processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]] and necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit [[Experiment|experimental manipulation]] of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes [[consciousness]], then a causal role for that brain activity can be [[Inference|inferred]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

In a loss-of-function (also called "necessity") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called "sufficiency") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Carter, Jennifer C. Shieh. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Guide_to_Research_Techniques_in_Neurosci.html?id=3rT4ngEACAAJ Guide to Research Techniques in Neuroscience]" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of brain activity can be performed in several ways:
::'''Pharmacological manipulation''' using various [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] which alter neural activity by interfering with [[neurotransmission]], resulting in alterations in [[perception]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]], consciousness, cognition, and behavior. Psychoactive drugs are divided into different groups according to their pharmacological effects; [[euphoriants]] which tend to induce feelings of [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[stimulant]]s that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions, [[depressant]]s that depress or reduce arousal or stimulation and [[hallucinogen]]s which can cause [[hallucinations]], perception anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness|disorders of consciousness}}
Death is the cessation of all [[biological process|biological functions]] that sustain a living [[organism]]. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).&lt;ref name="enc bd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Brain-Death.html |title=Brain death| website=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| accessdate= 25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death?source=search_result&amp;search=brain+death&amp;selectedTitle=1~37 | title=Diagnosis of brain death| last=Young | first= G Bryan| website=UpToDate|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.53108| pmid = 19881172| title = The diagnosis of brain death| journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 7–11| year = 2009| last1 = Goila | first1 = A. | last2 = Pawar | first2 = M. | pmc = 2772257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4081/ni.2010.e2| pmid = 21577338| pmc = 3093212| title = Diagnosis of brain death| journal = Neurology International| volume = 2| issue = 1| year = 2010| last1 = Machado | first1 = C.| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Near-death experience (NDE)==
{{Main|Near-death experience}}
A near-death experience (NDE) is a [[personal experience]] associated with impending [[death]], encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a [[hallucination|hallucinatory state]] caused by various neurological factors such as [[cerebral anoxia]], [[Hypercapnia|hypercarbia]], abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Blanke, Sebastian Dieguez.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1890">The Data-based Online Nonlinear Extremumseeker (DONE) algorithm is a black-box [[optimization]] algorithm.
DONE models the unknown cost function and attempts to find an optimum of the underlying function.
The DONE algorithm is suitable for optimizing costly and noisy functions and does not require derivatives.
An advantage of DONE over similar algorithms, such as [[Bayesian Optimization]], is that the [[computational cost]] per iteration is independent of the number of function evaluations.

==Methods==

The DONE algorithm was first proposed by Hans Verstraete and Sander Wahls.&lt;ref&gt;Hans R. G. W. Verstraete, Sander Wahls, Jeroen Kalkman, Michel Verhaegen: [https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-40-24-5722 Model-based sensor-less wavefront aberration correction in optical coherence tomography], Opt.

==Applications==
DONE was first demonstrated for maximizing the signal in [[optical coherence tomography]] measurements, but has since then been applied to various other applications. For example, it was used to help extending the field of view in [[light sheet fluorescence microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean Wilding, Paolo Pozzi, Oleg Soloviev, Gleb Vdovin, Colin J. Sheppard,  Michel Verhaegen: [http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~mverhaegen/papers/PupilFilters.pdf Pupil filters for extending the field-of-view in light-sheet microscopy], Optics letters 41, no. 6 (2016): 1205-1208&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discernment''' is the ability to obtain sharp [[perception]]s or to judge well (or the activity of so doing).  In the case of [[judgment]], discernment can be [[psychology|psychological]] or [[morality|moral]] in nature.  Within judgment, discernment 
involves going past the mere perception of something and making nuanced judgments about its properties or qualities.  Considered as a [[virtue]], a discerning individual is considered to possess [[wisdom]], and be of good judgement; especially so with regard to subject matter often overlooked by others.

==Christianity==
In [[Christianity]], the word may have several meanings. Discernment can describe the process of determining [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] in a situation or for one's life or identifying the true nature of a thing, such as discerning whether a thing is good or evil. In large part, it describes the interior search for an answer to the question of one's [[vocation]], namely, determining whether or not God is calling one to the [[married]] life, [[Celibacy|single life]], [[consecrated life]], [[ordained ministry]] or any other calling.

[[Discernment of Spirits]] is a term used in both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] (Evangelist) Christian theology to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence. 

&lt;br /&gt;

== Process of Discernment ==
The process of individual discernment has required tasks in order for good discernment. These tasks include taking time in making the decision, using both the head and heart, and assessing important values. Time is necessary to make a good choice, decisions made in a hurry are often not the best decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When time is available to assess the situation it improves the discernment process. When time allots the tentative decision can be revisited days later to make sure that the individual is satisfied with their choice after the discernment process. Making decisions with the head means to first reflect on the situation and emphasize the rational aspect of the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a decision that is ours it also requires the heart in which the individual makes based on feelings as well as rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values in the discernment process are weighing options that decide what is most important to the individual. Every individuals value system is different which effects each individual discernment process.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignatian Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=Liguori, Missouri|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining values, using both the head and heart and taking sufficient time when making decision are the main steps for a successful discernment process.

Group discernment is a separate branch of discernment. In group discernment each individual must first undergo their own discernment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waaijman|first=Kees|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual must keep in mind what is best for the group as a whole as well as the individual when making a decision. The same principles of values, using the head and heart, as well as giving the decision making process ample time all still apply in group discernment. Group discernment is different because it requires multiple people to have a unanimous decision in order to move forward forward. Group discernment requires discussion and persuasion between individuals to arrive at a decision.

Christian spiritual discernment can be separated from other types of discernment because every decision is to be made in accordance with God's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental definition for Christian discernment is a decision making process in which an individual makes a discovery that can lead to future action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunz|first=Sandra|date=2011|title=Respecting the Boundaries of Knowledge: Teaching Christian Discernment with Humility and Dignity, a Response to Paul O. Ingram|url=|journal=Buddhist- Christian Studies|volume=|pages=177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of Christian spiritual discernment God guides the individual to help them arrive at the best decision. The way to arrive at the best decision in Christian spiritual discernment is to seek out internal external signs of God's action and then apply them to the decision at hand. Christian Discernment also has an emphasis on Jesus, and making decisions that align with those of Jesus within the New Testament.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The focus on God and Jesus when making decisions is what separates Christian discernment from secular discernment. Ignatius of Loyola is often regarded as the master of the discernment of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kees|first=Waaijman|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatian discernment comes from Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) when he created his own unique way of Catholic discernment. Ignatian discernment uses a series of Spiritual Exercises for discerning life choices and focuses on noticing God in all aspects of life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Exercises are designed to help people who are facing a major life decision. There are seven steps of discernment to be followed that include identifying the issue, taking time to pray about the choice, making a wholehearted decision, discussing the choice with a mentor and then finally trusting the decision made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=7-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ignatius was a religious man his discernment process can be applied to anyone independent of religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">In the field of [[simulation]], a [[discrete time|discrete]]-rate simulation (DRS) models the behavior of mixed discrete and continuous systems. This methodology is used to simulate linear continuous systems, hybrid continuous and discrete-event systems, and any other system that involves the rate-based movement or flow of material from one location to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc08papers/089.pdf | title = Discrete Rate Simulation Using Linear Programming | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of application ==

Industrial areas where DRS is used include: [[bulk material handling]] (e.g. minerals and ores, powders, particles, mixed wastes, wood chips), liquids and gases, pulp, oil and gas pipelines, traffic, and high speed/volume [[production lines]] in the food &amp; beverage, consumer products, and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc97papers/0706.PDF | title = Simulation of Bulk Flow and High Speed Operations | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://informs-sim.org/wsc13papers/includes/files/102.pdf | title = Simulation of Mixed Discrete and Continuous Systems: an Iron Ore Example | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compared to discrete-event and continuous simulation ==

DRS combines the event-based timing of [[Discrete event simulation|discrete-event simulation]](DES) and the continuous variables calculations found in [[continuous simulation]]. It predicts and schedules events when the system needs to calculate a new set of rates and determines the appropriate rate of flow for each branch or stream.

[[File:A comparison between discrete rate, continuous, and discrete event simulation.gif|thumb|A comparison between discrete rate, continuous, and discrete event simulation]]
DRS is similar to DES in that both methodologies model the operation of the system as a discrete [[sequence of events]] in time. However, while DES assumes there is no change in the system between consecutive events, in a DRS model the flow continues to move at a constant rate such that, for example, the level in a tank could change. Another difference is that DES models are overwhelmingly concerned with the status of system entities (discrete objects moving through the system) while DRS models are concerned with the status (quantity and location) of homogeneous flow. For rate-based systems, DRS has faster computational times and is more accurate in calculating mass balance compared to DES.

DRS is also similar to continuous simulation in that it simulates homogeneous flow. In addition, both methods recalculate flow rates, which are continuous variables, whenever a state change occurs. However, DRS differs from continuous simulation in that it is event-based and does not simulate every time slice. Modeling linear flow systems using continuous simulation has limitations because it usually is unable to detect important events, such as a tank becoming full or empty, until after the event has occurred plus requires many more system recalculations during the course of the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/031.pdf | title = ExtendSim Advanced Technology: Discrete Rate Simulation | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

An exercise in learning how to build discrete-rate simulations is to model a tank filling and emptying over time. The tank fills at a constant rate and empties at two different rates, one rate until it is full and a faster rate until it is empty. There are 4 types of events in the simulation: start simulation, storage full, storage empty, and end simulation. At each event the model determines which emptying rate to use; between events the emptying rate remains constant.

'''Ellen Jane Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; born March 25, 1947) is a professor of [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]];  in 1981, she became the first woman ever to be tenured in psychology at Harvard.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilts|first1=Philip J|date=23 September 1997|title=Scientist At Work: Ellen Langer; A Scholar of the Absent Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/23/science/scientist-at-work-ellen-j-langer-a-scholar-of-the-absent-mind.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMindfulnessChronicles&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Cara|date=2010|title=The Mindfulness Chronicles|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/09/the-mindfulness-chronicles|newspaper=[[Harvard Magazine]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langer studies the [[illusion of control]], decision-making, [[aging]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] theory.&lt;ref name=TheMindfulnessChronicles/&gt; Her most influential work is ''Counterclockwise'', published in 2009, which answers the questions of aging from her extensive research, and increased interest in the particulars of aging across the nation.

== Early life and education ==
Langer was born in [[The Bronx]], New York. She received her bachelor's degree in Psychology from [[New York University]], and her PhD in Social and Clinical Psychology from [[Yale University]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

== Career ==

Langer has had a significant influence on the [[positive psychology]] movement.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Drake|date=21 February 2010|title=Mind Power|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/02/21/mind_power/|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being known as the mother of positive psychology, her contributions to the study of mindfulness have earned her the moniker of the "mother of mindfulness."  &lt;ref name=PsychCentral&gt;{{cite web|last1=PsychCentral|title=The Mother of Mindfulness, Ellen Langer|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/02/27/the-mother-of-mindfulness-ellen-langer/|website=psychcentral.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Langer.com /&gt; Together her work has ushered in the movement of mind/body medicine &lt;ref name="Mind-set Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grierson |first1=Bruce |title=What if Age is Nothing but a Mindset? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html |accessdate=20 September 2018 |work=New York Times |date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been regarded by many scientist to be an important intellectual movement and one that now has "considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment." &lt;ref name="Mind-Body"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Astin |first1=John |last2=Shapiro |first2=Shauna |last3=Eisenberg |first3=David |last4=Forys |first4=Kelly |title=Mind-Body Medicine: State of the Science, Implications for Practice |journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine |date=March 1, 2003 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=131-147|doi=10.3122/jabfm.16.2.131 |url=http://www.jabfm.org/content/16/2/131.short |accessdate=20 September 2018 |ref=Mind-Body Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has published over 200 articles and academic texts, was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and discussed her works on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; Additionally, in many introductory psychology courses at universities across the United States, her studies are required reading.&lt;ref name=Boston /&gt;

=== Aging ===
Langer and colleagues have conducted multiple forms of research to promote the flexibility of aging.&lt;ref name=Boston /&gt; Some of her most impactful work has been her pioneering research on her famous Counterclockwise Study (1979). This study was originally published by Oxford University Press&lt;ref name="Human Development"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander (Ed.) |first1=Charles |last2=Langer (Ed.) |first2=Ellen |title=Higher stages of human development: Perspectives on adult growth. |date=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=019503483X |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-98072-000 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in her best seller, ''Mindfulness''.&lt;ref name="Mindfulness"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langer |first1=Ellen |title=Mindfulness |date=1989 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-7382-1800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis of what is now called [[Reminiscence_therapy|Reminiscence Therapy]]. The study was replicated in England, South Korea and the Netherlands&lt;ref name="Mind-set Times"/&gt; and was the basis of a [[British_Academy_Film_Awards|British Academy of Film and Television  Awards]] nominated [[BBC]] series, [https://www.walltowall.co.uk/news/the-young-ones-nominated-for-bafta-in-factual-series-category_363.aspx The Young Ones]. The study has also been mentioned in other media such as [[The_Simpsons|The Simpsons]] episode [[Havana_Wild_Weekend|Havana Wild Weekend]].

Other important work has shown that rewarding behaviors and following completion of memory tasks improves memory. Another study showed that simply taking care of a plant improves mental and physical health, as well as life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodin|first1=Judith|last2=Langer|first2=Ellen J.|title=Long-term effects of a control-relevant intervention with the institutionalized aged.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1977|volume=35|issue=12|pages=897–902|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.12.897|pmid=592095}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were the primitive steps to creating the Langer Mindfulness Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pirson |first1=Michael |last2=Langer |first2=Ellen |last3=Bodner |first3=Todd |last4=Zilcha-Mano |first4=Sigal |title=The Development and Validation of the Langer Mindfulness Scale - Enabling a Socio-Cognitive Perspective of Mindfulness in Organizational Contexts |journal=Fordham University Schools of Business Research Paper |date=October 9, 2012 |pages=54 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research provided for improved methods in [[nursing home]]s and [[Assisted living facility|assisted living facilities]]. Additionally, in one of her most famous studies, Langer demonstrated the drastic benefits of mind/body unity theory. By having chambermaids call their everyday activity “exercise” rather than “labor,” Langer found that the chambermaids experienced a myriad of health benefits including: "a decrease in their systolic blood pressure, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio — and a 10 percent drop in blood pressure."&lt;ref name="NPR Chambermaids"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiegel |first1=Alix |title=Hotel Maids Challenge the Placebo Effect |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17792517 |website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/ellen-langer-science-of-mindlessness-and-mindfulness/6332| title= Ellen Langer - Science of Mindlessness and Mindfulness | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness===
Langer is well known for her contributions to the study of mindfulness and of mindless behaviour, with these contributions having provided the basis for many studies focused on individual differences in unconscious behavior and decision making processes in humans.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scholar|first1=Harvard|title=Ellen Langer, Research|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/langer/pages/research|website=scholar.harvard.edu|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, she published ''Mindfulness'', her first book, and some have referred to her as the "mother of mindfulness".&lt;ref name=PsychCentral&gt;{{cite web|last1=PsychCentral|title=The Mother of Mindfulness, Ellen Langer|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/02/27/the-mother-of-mindfulness-ellen-langer/|website=psychcentral.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Langer.com /&gt;  In an interview with Krista Tippett on the National Public Radio program "On Being," broadcast on Sept. 13, 2015, Langer defined mindfulness as "the simple act of noticing  new things." &lt;ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/ellen-langer-science-of-mindlessness-and-mindfulness/6332| title= Ellen Langer - Science of Mindlessness and Mindfulness | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Langer Mindfulness Scale is still used in modern research.

== Awards ==
In 1980, she was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=Langer.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langer|first1=Ellen|title= Ellen Langer Bio |url=http://ellenlanger.com/about|website=ellenlanger.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other honors include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the [[American Psychological Association]], [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/ellen-langer-joins-group-of-geniuses/ the Liberty Science Center Genius Award,] the Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to Applied Psychology award from the [[American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology]], the James McKeen Cattel Award, and the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize.

== Criticism ==
Her finding that taking care of a plant significantly improved health outcomes in nursing home patients was shown to be the result of a statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rodin, J., &amp; Langer, E. J. (1978). Erratum to Rodin and Langer. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36(5), 462.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-09641-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of her famous "counterclockwise" studies, Langer claimed that when elderly men were temporarily placed in a setting that recreated their past, their health improved, and they even looked younger. However, this study was never published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The only publication of this finding is in a chapter of a book edited by Langer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellen Langer's reversing aging experiment - Business Insider|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ellen-langers-reversing-aging-experiment-2015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 2014 New York Times Magazine profile, Langer described the week-long paid adult counterclockwise retreats she was creating in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, aimed towards replicating the effects found in her New Hampshire study. According to the article, "Langer makes no apologies for the paid retreats, nor for what will be their steep price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What if Age Is Nothing but a Mind-Set?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langer was defiant when pressed on the ethics of her study:

&lt;blockquote class="templatequote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To my question of whether such a nakedly commercial venture will undermine her academic credibility, Langer rolled her eyes a bit. 'Look, I’m not 40 years old. I’ve paid my dues, and there’s nothing wrong with making this more widely available to people, since I deeply believe it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What if Age Is Nothing but a Mind-Set?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14352">The '''Erlangen program''' is a method of characterizing [[geometry|geometries]] based on [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]]. It was published by [[Felix Klein]] in 1872 as ''Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen.'' It is named after the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University Erlangen-Nürnberg]], where Klein worked.

By 1872, [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:

:* Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, [[Euclidean geometry]] was more restrictive than [[affine geometry]], which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry.

:* Klein proposed that [[group theory]], a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of [[symmetry]], was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the [[theory of equations]] in the form of [[Galois theory]].

:* Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about [[conic section]]s, but not about [[circle]]s or [[angle]]s because those notions were not invariant under [[projective transformation]]s (something familiar in [[geometrical perspective]]). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way [[subgroup]]s of a [[symmetry group]] related to each other.

Later, [[Élie Cartan]] generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to [[Cartan connection]]s on certain principal bundles, which generalized [[Riemannian geometry]].

==The problems of nineteenth century geometry==

Since [[Euclid]], geometry had meant the geometry of [[Euclidean space]] of two dimensions ([[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]]) or of three dimensions ([[solid geometry]]). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of [[higher dimensions|four or more dimensions]]; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the [[parallel postulate]] from the others, and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the [[projective geometry]], as already developed by [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|Poncelet]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical ''physicists'' that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.

With every geometry, Klein associated an underlying [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]]. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and hierarchy of their [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]]. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean group]] of symmetries, while only the [[incidence structure]] and the [[cross-ratio]] are preserved under the most general [[projective geometry|projective transformations]]. A concept of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]ism, which is preserved in [[affine geometry]], is not meaningful in [[projective geometry]]. Then, by abstracting the underlying [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a [[subgroup]] of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is ''a priori'' meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).

==Homogeneous spaces==

In other words, the "traditional spaces" are [[homogeneous space]]s; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language.

In today's language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as [[Lie group]]s: the [[classical groups]]. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language.

===Examples===

For example, the group of [[projective geometry]] in ''n'' real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of ''n''-dimensional real [[projective space]] (the [[general linear group]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, quotiented by [[Scalar matrix|scalar matrices]]). The [[affine group]] will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen [[hyperplane at infinity]]. This subgroup has a known structure ([[semidirect product]] of the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n'' with the subgroup of [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.

To explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The [[Euclidean group]] is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi-direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations.  (See [[Klein geometry]] for more details.)

==Influence on later work==

The long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at [[congruence (geometry)]], for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] has become standard in [[physics]].

When [[topology]] is routinely described in terms of properties [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[homeomorphism]], one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not [[Lie group]]s – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became [[transformation geometry]], a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of [[Euclid]], but is less easily converted into a [[logical system]].

In his book ''Structuralism'' (1970) [[Jean Piaget]] says, "In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the Erlangen Program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of [[mathematical structure|structure]]."

For a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]] through a development based on [[hyperbolic motion]]s. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the [[ultraparallel theorem]] by successive motions.

==Abstract returns from the Erlangen program==
Quite often, it appears there are two or more distinct [[Geometry|geometries]] with [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]]s. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the ''abstract'' group, to the geometry.

One example: [[oriented]] (i.e., [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] not included) [[elliptic geometry]] (i.e., the surface of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] with opposite points identified) and [[oriented]] [[spherical geometry]] (the same [[nonEuclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]], but with opposite points not identified) have [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]], [[Special orthogonal group|SO(''n''+1)]] for even ''n''. These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise.

To take another example, [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic geometries]] with different [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]] have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General [[Riemannian geometry]] falls outside the boundaries of the program.

[[Complex numbers|Complex]], [[dual numbers|dual]] and [[split-complex number|double (aka split-complex) numbers]] appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,'''R''')/H for the group [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] and its subgroups H=A, N, K &lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kisil |first=Vladimir V. |year=2012 |title=Geometry of Möbius transformations. Elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic actions of SL(2,R) | location=London |publisher=Imperial College Press|page=xiv+192 |isbn=978-1-84816-858-9 | doi=10.1142/p835}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The group SL(2,'''R''') acts on these homogeneous spaces by [[linear fractional transformation]]s and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen programme.

Some further notable examples have come up in physics.

Firstly, ''n''-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]], ''n''-dimensional [[de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[inversive geometry]] all have isomorphic automorphism groups,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}(n,1)/\mathrm{C}_2,\ &lt;/math&gt;

the [[orthochronous Lorentz group]], for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}. But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are "dual" for some models.

Again, ''n''-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[conformal space]] with "Lorentzian" signature (in contrast with [[conformal space]] with "Euclidean" signature, which is identical to [[inversive geometry]], for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with "dualities" between both [[Geometry|spaces]]. See [[AdS/CFT]] for more details.

The covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional [[twistor space]].

The Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics.

In the seminal paper which introduced [[Category theory|categories]], [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and S. Eilenberg stated: "This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Program, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings"&lt;ref&gt;S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane, ''A general theory of natural equivalences'', Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 58:231–294, 1945. (p. 237); the point is elaborated in Jean-Pierre Marquis (2009), ''From a Geometrical Point of View: A Study of the History of Category Theory'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations of the Erlangen program with work of C. [[Ehresmann]] on [[groupoids]] in geometry is considered in the article below by  Pradines.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pradines, ''In [[Ehresmann]]'s footsteps: from group geometries to [[groupoid]] geometries'' (English summary) Geometry and topology of manifolds, 87–157, Banach Center Publ., 76, Polish Acad. Sci., Warsaw, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical logic, the Erlangen Program also served as an inspiration for [[Alfred Tarski]] in his analysis of [[Alfred Tarski#Work on logical notions|logical notions]].&lt;ref&gt;Luca Belotti, ''Tarski on Logical Notions'', Synthese, 404-413, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4989">'Fault Reporting ''' is a maintenance concept that increases [[operational availability]] and that reduces [[operating cost]] through three mechanisms.
* Reduce labor-intensive diagnostic evaluation
* Eliminate diagnostic testing down-time
* Provide notification to management for degraded operation

This is a prerequisite for [[Condition-based maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.16: Condition Based Maintenance|publisher=US Navy Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Active redundancy]] can be integrated with fault reporting to reduce down time to a few minutes per year.
* Passive redundancy 
* Active redundancy

==History==

Formal maintenance philosophies are required by organizations whose primary responsibility is to ensure systems are ready when expected, such as space agencies and military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.7: Maintenance Policy for United States Navy Ships|publisher=US Navy Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor-intensive [[planned maintenance]] began during the rise of the industrial revolution. This depends upon periodic diagnostic evaluation based upon calendar dates, distance, or use. The intent is to accomplish diagnostic evaluations that indicate when maintenance is required to prevent inconvenience and safety issues that will occur when critical equipment failures occur during use.

The electronic revolution allowed inexpensive sensors and controls to be integrated into most equipment. This includes diagnostic indicators, fluid sensors, temperature sensors, ignition sensors, exhaust monitoring, voltage sensors, and similar monitoring equipment that indicates when maintenance is required. Sensor displays are often located in inaccessible locations that cannot be observed during normal operation. Labor-intensive periodic maintenance is often required to inspect indicators.

Some organizations have eliminated most labor-intensive periodic maintenance and diagnostic down time by implementing designs that bring all sensor status to fault indicators located in close proximity to users.

== Principle ==

Maintenance requires three actions.
* Fault discovery
* Fault isolation
* Fault recovery

Fault discovery requires diagnostic maintenance, which requires system down time and labor costs.

Down time and cost requirements associated with diagnostics are eliminated for every item that satisfies the following criteria.
* Automated diagnostic
* Instrumented for remote viewing
* Displayed in the viscidity of supervisory personnel

==Implementation==

Fault reporting is an optional feature that can be forwarded to remote displays using simple configuration setting in all modern computing equipment. The system level of reporting that is appropriate for [[Condition Based Maintenance]] are critical, alert, and emergency, which indicate software termination due to failure. Specific failure reporting, like interface failure, can be integrated into applications linked with these reporting systems. There is no development cost if these are incorporated into designs.
* [[Syslog]]
* [[Event Viewer|Event Log]]
* [[Power distribution unit]]

Other kinds of fault reporting involves painting green, yellow, and red zones onto temperature gages, pressure gages, flow gages, vibration sensors, strain gages, and similar sensors. Remote viewing can be implemented using a [[video camera]].

=== Benefits ===

The historical approach for '''Fault discovery'''  is periodic diagnostic testing, which eliminates the following operational availability penalty.

:&lt;math&gt;Availability \ Reduction = \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Maintenance \ Down \ Time } &lt;/math&gt;

Fault reporting eliminates maintenance costs associated manual diagnostic testing.

:&lt;math&gt;Diagnostic \ Cost = Maintenance \ Down \ Time \times Labor \ Rate \times \ Team \ Size&lt;/math&gt;

Labor is eliminated in redundant designs by using the fault discovery and fault isolation functions to automatically reconfigure equipment for degraded operation.

Maintenance savings can be re-allocated to upgrades and improvements that increase organizational competitiveness.

=== Detriments ===

Faults that do not trigger a sustained requirement for fault isolation and fault recovery actions should not be displayed for management action.

As an example, lighting up a fault indicator in situations where human intervention is not required will induce breakage by causing maintenance personnel to perform work when nothing is already broken.

As another example, enabling fault reporting for Internet network packet delivery failure will increase network loading when the network is already busy, and that will cause total network outage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15666">The '''gates of horn and ivory''' are a [[Literature|literary]] image used to distinguish true [[dream]]s (corresponding to factual occurrences) from false. The phrase originated in the Greek language, in which the word for "horn" is similar to that for "fulfil" and the word for "ivory" is similar to that for "deceive". On the basis of that play on words, true dreams are spoken of as coming through the gates of horn, false dreams as coming through those of ivory.

==The Odyssey==
The earliest appearance of the image is in the [[Odyssey]], book 19, lines 560–569. There [[Penelope]], who has had a dream that seems to signify that her husband [[Odysseus]] is about to return, expresses by a play on words her conviction that the dream is false. She says:
:Stranger, dreams verily are baffling and unclear of meaning, and in no wise do they find fulfilment in all things for men. For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of ''horn'' and one of ''ivory''. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ''ivory deceive'' men, bringing words that find no ''fulfilment''. But those that come forth through the gate of polished ''horn bring'' true issues ''to pass'', when any mortal sees them. But in my case it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomerOdyssey19.html Loeb Classical Library edition]. The original text is:
:Ξεῖν’, ἦ τοι μὲν ὄνειροι ἀμήχανοι ἀκριτόμυθοι
:γίγνοντ’, οὐδέ τι πάντα τελείεται ἀνθρώποισι.
:δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνείρων·
:αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δ' ἐλέφαντι,
:τῶν οἳ μέν κ’ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος,
:οἵ ῥ’ ἐλεφαίρονται, ἔπε’ ἀκράαντα φέροντες·
:οἱ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε,
:οἵ ῥ’ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι, βροτῶν ὅτε κέν τις ἴδηται.
:ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν ὀΐομαι αἰνὸν ὄνειρον
:ἐλθέμεν·&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur T. Murray,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomerOdyssey1.html Text (without footnotes) of the 1919 Loeb translation]&lt;/ref&gt; translator of the original [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition of the Odyssey, commented:
:The play upon the words κέρας, "horn", and κραίνω, "fulfil", and upon ἐλέφας, "ivory", and ἐλεφαίρομαι, "deceive", cannot be preserved in English.&lt;ref&gt;Homer: The Odyssey, II (The Loeb Classical Library. First printed 1919; Reprinted 1925, 1928, 1931, 1940, 1942, 1946, 1953, 1960, 1966, 1975, 1980; American {{ISBN|0-674-99117-6}}; British {{ISBN|0-434-99105-8}}), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Echoes in later Greek literature==
Homer greatly influenced Greek literature as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Richard C. Jebb and A.T. Sinclair in Whibley (1905),[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Companion to Greek Studies, p. 120]:
:Homeric influence is not only all-pervading in Greek literature, but enters also into every part of Greek life.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plato]] refers to the two gates in his dialogue ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'':
:Socrates: "Listen then," I said, "to my dream, to see whether it comes through horn or through ivory."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Charmides|173a|gr}}:
:ἄκουε δή, ἔφην, τὸ ἐμὸν ὄναρ, εἴτε διὰ κεράτων εἴτε δι᾽ ἐλέφαντος ἐλήλυθεν.&lt;/ref&gt;
A reference to the Odyssean image also appears in the late (c. AD 400) epic poet [[Nonnus]]:
:As Morpheus slept, the vision of a dream cajoled him,
:beguiling his mind after flitting through the gates of ivory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritatis-societas.org/203_CSHB/0390-0429,_Nonnos,_Dionysiacorum_Libri_XLVIII_(CSHB),_GR.pdf Dionysiaca, 34:89-90]
:Μοῤῥέα δ' ὑπνώοντα παρήφανεν ὄψις ὀνείρου,
:κλεψινόων ἐλέφαντος ἀναΐξασα πυλάων.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aeneid==
[[Virgil]] borrowed the image of the two gates in lines 893–898 of Book 6 of his ''[[Aeneid]]'', describing that of horn as the passageway for true shadows&lt;ref&gt;In the original, "veris umbris", but translated by Dryden as "true visions"&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ivory as that through which the [[Manes]] in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] send false dreams up to the living.&lt;ref&gt;altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto,&lt;br&gt;
sed falsa ad caelum mittunt insomnia Manes.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the latter gate Virgil makes his hero [[Aeneas]], accompanied by the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], return from his visit to the underworld, where he has met, among others, his dead father [[Anchises]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;
&lt;br&gt;Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:
&lt;br&gt;True visions thro' transparent horn arise;
&lt;br&gt;Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.
&lt;br&gt;Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,
&lt;br&gt;Anchises hither bends his steps at last.
&lt;br&gt;Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd
&lt;br&gt;His valiant offspring and divining guest.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.6.vi.html translation] given here is by [[John Dryden]] (cf. [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Aeneid/Book_VI?match=la Wikisource]). The original text is:
:Sunt geminae Somni portae, quarum altera fertur
:cornea, qua veris facilis datur exitus umbris;
:altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto,
:sed falsa ad caelum mittunt insomnia Manes.
:his ubi tum natum Anchises unaque Sibyllam
:prosequitur dictis portaque emittit eburna ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why Virgil has Aeneas return through the ivory gate (whence pass deluding lies)&lt;ref&gt;"falsa insomnia" (literally, false dreams)&lt;/ref&gt; and not through that of horn is uncertain. One theory is that it refers to the time of night at which he returned.&lt;ref&gt;
Nicholas Reed, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638188 The Gates of Sleep in Aeneid 6]'', The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Nov., 1973), pp. 311-315&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]] accepted the view that, for Virgil, what we call reality is not in fact such; that Virgil may have considered the [[Plato]]nic world of the archetypes to be the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Borges made this remark in a lecture that he gave in Buenos Aires in the mid-1970s on the subject of nightmares. The transcription of the lecture is included in English translation in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ty8LLZ_U93MC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=borges+ivory+horn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CdePhbdKFP&amp;sig=2eii_2JRE5UzrwQG1JBzQ3SHDbU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q75xTuXCN4KWhQfXgqHQCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jorge Luis Borges, ''Seven Nights''] (see pp. 30-31) and in [https://books.google.com/books?id=8EMSAEfXzk0C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=borges+ivory+horn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nJdavqjeeJ&amp;sig=oDbqmAwyhjEK1J3BK5KH6fYKZFU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q75xTuXCN4KWhQfXgqHQCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jorge Luis Borges, ''Everything and Nothing''] (see p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation is that Virgil is thus indicating that what he has recounted is not to be taken as literal fact. In [[John Wesley]]'s last sermon, preached on 17 January 1791, he spoke of how uncertain even the best conjectures about the invisible world were without revelation: "The most finished of all these accounts, is that of the great Roman poet. Where observe how warily he begins, with that apologetic preface, – Sit mihi fas audita loqui – 'May I be allowed to tell what I have heard'. And, in the conclusion, lest anyone should imagine he believed any of these accounts, he sends the relater of them out of hades by the ivory gate, through which, he had just informed us, that only dreams and shadows pass, – a very plain intimation, that all which has gone before, is to be looked upon as a dream!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-sermons-of-john-wesley-1872-edition/sermon-122-on-faith/ John Wesley, Sermon 122, On Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Latin writing==
In his ''Silvae'' V iii 285–290, a lament for his dead father, the poet [[Statius|Publius Papinius Statius]], expresses the wish that his father may come to him from the abode of the dead in the form of a true dream, passing therefore through the gate of horn:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thence mayst thou pass to where the better gate of horn o'ercomes the envious ivory, and in the semblance of a dream teach me what thou wert wont to teach.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by J. H. Mozley  -  Loeb Classic Library (Harvard University  Press). Statius's words are:
:inde tamen venias, melior qua porta malignum
:cornea vincit ebur, somnique in imagine monstra,
:quae solitus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 15th century Latin poet Basinio of Parma, employed at the court of [[Sigismondo Malatesta]] in Rimini, wrote a panegyric epic poem for his prince (''Hesperis'') modelled largely on the ''Aeneid'' and the Homeric epics, in which Sigismondo, as epic hero, undertakes a journey to the underworld in order to meet his deceased father Pandolfo Malatesta. Before that he passes the temple of Fama which has a bipartite gate, one half made of horn, one of ivory. On the ivory half not only Sigismondo's descent but also the ones by Hercules, Theseus, Ulysses and Aeneas are depicted.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Having seen that, they turn towards the astounding temple of Fame, a temple enormous and imposing in size and shape, whose door on its left side is white from ivory steps with shining horn on the other half. Disturbing nightmares are conveyed by false rumour on the vain gates of ivory, while true dreams of horn are sent by trustworthy rumours. The gate of horn shows the Spaniards defeated on the Tyrrhenian shore [i.e. Sigismondo's victory over Alfonso's V. troops at Piombino in 1448]. On the ivory steps Sigismondo turns toward the sea, and is swimming after his ship is destroyed [on his way to the island where he is to undertake his trip to the underworld]. There Theseus and also Hercules made their way: there brave and victorious Ulysses went to the gloomy homes of the Cimmerians; there faithful Aeneas took to the Stygian lake Avernus." &lt;br /&gt;
Basinio's Latin text is as follows:
:Haec ubi visa, petunt famae mirabile templum,
:templum augustum immane horrens, cui limen eburnis
:canebat gradibus laeva de parte ; nitebant
:parte alia cornu solido loca. Falsa elephanti
:fama refert vanis insomnia turbida portis,
:somnia vera ferunt non vanae cornua famae.
:Cornea dejectos Tyrrheno in litore Iberos
:porta docet templi. Gradibus Sismundus eburnis
:tendit ad Oceanum, et fracta natat alta carina.
:Hac iter Aegides, nec non Tyrinthius heros
:Taenarias legere vias : hac durus Ulysses
:Cimmerium obscuras victor concessit ad Arces ;
:hac pius Aeneas Stygio se immisit Averno. (''Hesperis XIII 205-217)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==English writing==

The gates of horn and ivory appear in the following notable English written works:
*[[David Gemmell]]'s epic novel "[[Troy: Lord of the Silver Bow]]", chapter sixteen. This is referenced when Odysseus talks to Xander about his vision of the future, and what his wife Penelope had taught him about dreams and their gates in the past on page 268.
*[[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic poem "[[The Faery Queene]]" (1590, English) in book 1, stanzas XL and XLIV, in reference to a false dream being brought to the hero (Prince Arthur/the Knight of the Red Crosse).
*[[Alexander Pope]]'s mock-epic [[The Dunciad]] (1743), in Book III: "And thro' the Iv'ry Gate the Vision flies."
*[[E. R. Eddison]]'s romance ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'' (1922), in Chapter 2: "...belike the dream was a true dream, sent thee through the gate of horn".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/ring/two/two08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[E. M. Forster]]'s short story ''[[The Other Side of the Hedge]]''. The reference from Forster comes when the main character of the story observes the two gates; ''The Other Side of the Hedge'' is usually read as a metaphor of death and [[Heaven]].
*[[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem "Sweeney Among the Nightingales". The line "And Sweeney guards the horned gate" is likewise a reference to this image.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Norton and Peters Rushton, Classical Myths in English Literature 183-84 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eliot's poem [[Ash-Wednesday]]. The lines "And the blind eye creates / The empty forms between the ivory gates" similarly refer to this concept.
*[[William Empson]]'s poem 'Letter III': '...offspring of Heaven first born, | Earth's terra firma, the Hell-Gate of Horn'
*[[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s story, "[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]", as a set of magnificent ivory gates, carved from one piece of ivory stood at the entrance of a city of vain humans, which seems to be taken from [[Lord Dunsany]]'s story "The Idle Days on the Yann". It is also mentioned as a passage to the realm of hallucinations in Lovecraft's "[[Celephaïs]]".

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}
The '''golden age of Jewish culture in Spain''' coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During intermittent periods of time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. 

The nature and length of this "Golden Age" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as  711–718, the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia|Muslim conquest of Iberia]]. Others date it from 912, during the rule of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] ended; 1066, the date of the [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada massacre]]; 1090, when the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the [[Almohades|Almohads]] invaded.

==The nature of the Golden Age==

Having invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. [[Al-Andalus]] was a key center of Jewish life during the early [[Middle Ages]], producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As [[Sefarad]], al-Andalus was the "capital" of world Judaism. 

[[María Rosa Menocal]], a specialist in Iberian literature at [[Yale University]], claims  that "tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828225825/http://twbookmark.com/books/52/0316566888/press_release.html The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal]&lt;/ref&gt; Menocal's 2003 book, ''The Ornament of the World'', argues that the Jewish [[dhimmi]]s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to ''al-Andalus'', where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on [[proselytisation]] and, sometimes, on [[synagogue]] construction.

[[Bernard Lewis]] takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a "theological as well as a logical absurdity."&lt;ref name = lewis&gt;Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; However, also Lewis states:

{{Quotation|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.&lt;ref name = lewis /&gt;|}} Jews were allowed certain freedoms but, like their Christian counterparts, were prohibited from having administrative authority over Muslims except in a few cases.

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the idealized interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78|doi=10.2307/1455066 |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Golden Age==
Prior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The [[Visigoths]] were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the [[Visigoths]] joined the [[Catholic Church]], they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and mainly [[Berber people|Berber]] conquerors in the 8th century.

A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest.{{cn|date=April 2018}} North African Jewish immigrants  and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]]. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of [[Jewish Philosophy]]. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called [[Toledo School of Translators]], as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to [[botany]], [[geography]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim] by Rebecca Weiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], the patron of [[Menahem ben Saruq]], [[Dunash ben Labrat]], and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as [[Samuel Ha-Nagid]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Judah Halevi]].&lt;ref name="weiner" /&gt; During 'Abd al-Rahman's  term of power, the scholar [[Moses ben Hanoch|Moses ben Enoch]] was appointed [[rabbi]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and as a consequence [[al-Andalus]] became the center of [[Talmud]]ic study, and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

This was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As "[[dhimmi]]s", or "protected non-Muslims", Jews in the [[Islam]]ic world paid the [[jizya]], which was administered separately from the [[zakat]] paid by Muslims. The [[jizya]] has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own [[legal system]] and [[social services]]. [[Monotheism|Monotheist]] religions of the [[people of the book]] were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Fred J. Hill et al., ''A History of the Islamic World'' 2003 {{ISBN|0-7818-1015-9}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and medieval [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], the Jews were far more integrated in [[Political aspects of Islam|the political]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic life of Islamic society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3n9XnQiShQ&amp;sig=LNPYLaAtXOFB_WS0tV9IuwsCRGY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ra6_S8ycOIb20wSNtsydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a "myth".&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The notable Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:

{{Quotation|Dear brothers, because of our many sins Hashem has cast us among this nation, the Arabs, who are treating us badly. They pass laws designed to cause us distress and make us despised. ... Never has there been a nation that hated, humiliated and loathed us as much as this one.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;Avraham Yaakov Finkel (translator): "Rambam: Selected Letters of Maimonides", Yeshivat Beit Moshe, Scranton, PA, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9626226-3-X}}, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==End of the Golden Age==
With the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The first major persecution was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, "more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.
[[Image:Manuscript page by Maimonides Arabic in Hebrew letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuscript page by [[Maimonides]], one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]]. [[Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters]]

Beginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a puritan Muslim sect from [[Morocco]]. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of "[[vizier]]" or "[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]]. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical [[Almohades]].

During the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had been [[Reconquista|reconquered]] in 1085 by Christian forces.

The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the [[Alhambra decree]] of 1492 and a similar [[Portuguese Inquisition|decree]] by  [[Portugal]] in 1496.

'''Hedonimetry''' is the study of happiness as a measurable [[economic]] asset.  The first major work in the field was an 1881 publication of ''Mathematical Psychics'' by the famous statistician and economist [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], who hypothesized a way of measuring happiness in units.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth, F. Y. (1881):  ''Mathematical Psychics'', Kegan Paul, London.[https://books.google.com/books?id=StokAAAAMAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;   In recent times, it has been applied to many areas, including consumer behavior and health care.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

An '''inexact differential equation''' is a [[differential equation]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt;M(x,y) \, dx+N(x,y) \, dy=0, \text{ where } \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} \ne \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to such equations came with the invention of the [[integrating factor]] by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoht.info/page/History+of+differential+equations|title=History of differential equations – Hmolpedia|website=www.eoht.info|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution method ==
In order to solve the equation, we need to transform it into an [[exact differential|exact differential equation]]. In order to do that, we need to find an [[integrating factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to multiply the equation by. We'll start with the equation itself.&lt;math&gt;M\,dx+N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;, so we get &lt;math&gt;\mu M\,dx+\mu N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;. We will require &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial\mu N}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;. We get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial y}M+\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\mu=\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial x}N+\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\mu&lt;/math&gt;. After simplifying we get &lt;math&gt;M\mu_y-N\mu_x+(M_y-N_x)\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is a [[partial differential equation]], it is mostly extremely hard to solve, however in most cases we will get either &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (y)&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we only need to find &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; with a [[first-order linear differential equation]] or a [[separable differential equation]], and as such either &lt;math&gt;\mu(y)=e^{-\int{\frac{M_y-N_x}{M} \, dy}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)=e^{\int{\frac{M_y-N_x} N \, dx}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Wegner|author2=David J. Schneider|title=The White Bear Story|journal=[[Psychological Inquiry]]|date=2003|volume=14|issue=3/4|pages=326–329|jstor=1449696|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1403&amp;4_24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sex&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stafford|first1=Tom|title=How often do men really think about sex?|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140617-how-often-do-men-think-about-sex|date=18 June 2014|work=bbc.com |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a white bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute."&lt;br /&gt;
 — [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[Winter Notes on Summer Impressions]]'', 1863&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppressing the 'white bears'|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/10/unwanted-thoughts.aspx|website=apa.org|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The phenomenon was identified through thought suppression studies in [[experimental psychology]]. Social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] first studied ironic process theory in a laboratory setting in 1987. Ironic mental processes have been shown in a variety of situations, where they are usually created or worsened by [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. In extreme cases, ironic mental processes result in [[intrusive thoughts]] about doing something immoral or out of character, which can be troubling to the individual. These findings have since guided clinical practice. For example, they show why it would be unproductive to try to suppress anxiety-producing or depressing thoughts.&lt;ref name=wegnerbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|title=White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control|date=1989|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=978-0670825226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Memorization and mnemonics===
Although in certain domains, such as [[memorization]], it appears that ironic effects of attempting to remember vary with the level of mental control over [[mnemonic]] processing and may simply be due to ineffective mental strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffith |first=J. D. |last2=Hart |first2=C. L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Randell |first3=J. A. |year=2007 |title=Ironic Effects of Attempting to Remember |journal=North American Journal of Psychology |volume= |issue=1-2 |pages= |doi= |issn=1527-7143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

In certain scenarios, things and stuff are strongly interrelated.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffith |first=J. D. |last2=Hart |first2=C. L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Randell |first3=J. A. |year=2007 |title=Ironic Effects of Attempting to Remember |journal=North American Journal of Psychology |volume= |issue=1-2 |pages= |doi= |issn=1527-7143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

"Intentional memory processes and their associated mnemonic strategies can be viewed as one form of mental control",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John F. Kihlstrom|author2= Terrence M. Barnhardt |editor1-last=Wegner|editor1-first=Daniel M.|editor2-last=Pennebaker|editor2-first=James W.| chapter=The Self-Regulation of Memory: For Better and For Worse, With and Without Hypnosis |chapterurl = http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/SelfRegMem.htm |title=Handbook of Mental Control|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; When we attempt to exert influence over our memories we engage in mental control in the form of mnemonics our faculties of memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wegner |first=Daniel M. |year=1994 |title=Ironic Processes of Mental Control |journal=Psychological Review |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=34–52 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.101.1.34|pmid=8121959 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; because "mental control occurs when people suppress a thought, concentrate on a sensation, inhibit an emotion, maintain a mood, stir up a desire, squelch a craving, or otherwise exert influence on their own mental states".&lt;ref name=penne&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wegner|editor1-first=Daniel M.|editor2-last=Pennebaker|editor2-first=James W.|title=Handbook of Mental Control|date=1992| location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ | publisher= Prentice-Hall Century Psychology Series|isbn=978-0133792805|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience sampling===
The [[experience sampling method|experience sampling]] or daily diary method is one way that psychologists attempt to scientifically measure thoughts. This involves "interrupting people as they go about their daily lives and asking them to record the thoughts they are having right at that moment, in that place", often by using "[[audience response|clickers]]".&lt;ref name=sex/&gt;

One research team at [[Ohio State University]] tried to figure out how often people think about [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] by using so-called "[[audience response|clickers]]", asking the 283 college students to click each time they thought about sex, food, or sleep (there were three groups of students). The study found that on average men had 19 thoughts about sex per day (the highest being 388 times per day) whereas women thought about sex ten times per day.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Terri D. Fisher|author2=Zachary T. Moore|author3=Mary-Jo Pittenger|title=Sex on the Brain?: An Examination of Frequency of Sexual Cognitions as a Function of Gender, Erotophilia, and Social Desirability|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=69–77|doi=10.1080/00224499.2011.565429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the study's flaws were that the researchers had not taken ironic process theory into their experimental design—students "were given a clicker by the researchers and asked to record when they thought about sex (or food or sleep). Imagine them walking away from the psychology department, holding the clicker in their hand, trying hard not to think about sex all the time, yet also trying hard to remember to press the clicker every time they did think about it."&lt;ref name=sex/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Ironic process theory proposed two opposing mechanisms (a [[dual process theory]]). First, ''monitoring processes'' unconsciously and automatically monitor for occurrences of the unwanted thought, calling upon the second—''conscious operating processes''—if the thought occurs. This theory explains the effects of increased [[cognitive load]] by emphasizing that where there is cognitive effort, the monitoring process may supplant the conscious process, also suggesting that in order for thought suppression to be effective, a balance between the two processes must exist, with the cognitive demand not being so great as to let the monitoring process interrupt the conscious processes.&lt;ref name="wegner1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wegner |first=Daniel M. |last2=Schneider |first2=David J. |last3=Carter |first3=Samuel R.|lastauthoramp=yes |last4=White |first4=Teri L. |title=Paradoxical effects of thought suppression |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1987 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–13 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.5 |pmid=3612492}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that individual differences may be able to account for differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Geraerts |first=E. |last2=Merckelbach |first2=H. |last3=Jelicic |first3=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Smeets |first4=E. |year=2006 |title=Long term consequences of suppression of intrusive anxious thoughts and repressive coping |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1451–1460 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=October 2014}}

Cognitive overload inhibits successful activation of operating processes. Such overload has been shown to occur experimentally, when individuals attempt to aggressively suppress intrusive thoughts by [[Distraction|distracting]] themselves—either by focusing on different environmental objects, or thinking of anything but the thought in question. (Overload is also believed to occur in daily life as a result of mental pressures, anxieties, stresses, and so forth). The monitoring process, serving to alert the individual to an unwanted thought about to become salient and intrude on his or her consciousness, continues to find instances of the unwanted thought creating a state of hyper-accessibility unchecked by controlled cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Aronson |first=Elliot |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin M. |year=2007 |title=Social Psychology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-13-233487-9 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that individuals do have a capacity to successfully suppress thoughts by focusing on specifically prepared distractions or objects—a process in [[thought suppression]] experiments sometimes referred to as "focused distraction".&lt;ref name="wegner1987" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Similar ideas appear throughout popular culture and sayings, often with variations on animal and color, such as "It's as hard as trying not to think of a pink rhinoceros."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/opinion/a-fascination-with-fire-is-elementary-20090309-8t91.html |title=A Fascination with Fire Is Elementary |last=Sutton |first=Jill |date=9 March 2009 |work=[[WAtoday]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic process theory is also the basis for the mind game known as "[[The Game (mind game)|The Game]]", which constitutes trying not to think about the Game.

At the end of the 1984 movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', the characters are asked to think of a form for the coming of [[Gozer]]. They instruct each other not to think of anything, which sees one of the team, Ray, thinking of what he considers to be an innocuous thought of the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]], who then terrorizes them.

In an episode of ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'', Mira uses Ironic Process Theory to outsmart the Emperor Zerg, who has stolen her mind reading powers.

The idea figures heavily into the episode "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]" of British television series ''[[Black Mirror]]''.

A '''legacy hero''' is a type of character, usually a [[superhero]], that is the descendant or relative of an already or previously existing hero who either inherits or adopts the name and attributes of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/generations-the-15-best-marvel-legacy-heroes/|title=Taking Up The Mantle: The 15 Best Marvel Legacy Heroes|date=30 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/future-star-wars-films-focus-new-characters-not-legacy-heroes|title=Future Star Wars films to focus on new characters, not legacy heroes|first=Trent|last=Moore|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest examples of this character type was comic strip hero [[The Phantom]], assumed to be immortal by his enemies—various members of a single family, the descendants of Christopher Walker.

The term is used most often to refer to characters published by [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel comics]]. Family franchises such as DC's [[Batman]], [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], [[Black Canary]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[The Flash]], [[Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman]], [[Hawkwoman]], [[The Ray]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] or Marvel's [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], [[List of incarnations of Captain America|Captain America]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Iron Man]], [[List of incarnations of Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], have seen several characters take up the name and abilities of the original.

In the video games series, ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]],'' many of the game's characters are descended from bloodlines of Assassins.

==Legacy villain==
In opposition, there have been legacy villains in fiction as well. In comics, examples are DC's [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Captain Boomerang]], and [[Clayface]]; Marvel's [[Green Goblin]], [[Mysterio]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].

One of the best examples exists in Disney's ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', as a multi-generational line of villains known as [[Hunter (Gargoyles)|the Hunter]], originates with the TV series' fictionalized depiction of the historic [[Gille Coemgáin of Moray]] as a boy. The young "Gillecomegain", as he is known within the series' storyline, is confronted by the evil female gargoyle [[Demona]] and slashed by her on his face,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |year=1995 |title=Gargoyles — City of Stone (Part 1) |trans-title=|medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbuDobX484 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbuDobX484 |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |format=YouTube |time=10:10 to 10:22 |location= |publisher=Disney Shows |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the trio of slash wound scars on Gillecomegain's face, carried by him for the rest of his life as he seeks his revenge on the female gargoyle, becomes part of the ''Hunter'' disguise for succeeding examples of the Demona-hunting antagonists.

{{Confucianism}}
'''Li''' ({{zh|p=lǐ|t=禮|s=礼}}) is a classical Chinese word which is commonly used in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly within [[Confucianism]].  ''Li'' does not encompass a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea and, as such, is translated in a number of different ways. [[Wing-tsit Chan]] explains that ''li'' originally meant "a religious sacrifice," but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with [[Natural law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chan|first=Wing-tsit|title= A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy|publisher= Princeton University Press |date= 1963|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese [[cosmology]], human agency participates in the ordering of the universe by Li ('rites'). There are several Chinese definitions of a rite, one of the most common definitions is that it transforms the invisible to visible; through the performance of rites at appropriate occasions, humans make visible the underlying order. Performing the correct ritual focuses, links, orders, and moves the social, which is the human realm, in correspondence with the terrestrial and celestial realms to keep all three in harmony. This procedure has been described as centering, which used to be the duty of the Son of Tian, the emperor. But it was also done by all those who conducted state, ancestral, and life-cycle rites and, in another way, by [[Daoists]] who conducted the rites of local gods as a centering of the forces of exemplary history, of liturgical service, of the correct conduct of human relations, and of the arts of divination such as the earliest of all Chinese classics—the ''[[Book Of Changes|Book of Changes]]'' (''Yi Jing'')—joining textual learning to bodily practices for health and the harmonized enhancement of circuits of energy (qi).  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9780415858816|location=New York|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The rites of ''li'' are not rites in the Western conception of religious custom. Rather, ''li'' embodies the entire spectrum of interaction with humans, nature, and even material objects. Confucius includes in his discussions of ''li'' such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] cites "songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|translator-last=Watson|translator-first=Burton|title= Basic Writings of Mo Tzu, Hsun Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=1967|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; as vital parts of the fabric of ''li''.

==Approaches to ''Li''==
Among the earliest historical discussions on ''li'' stands the 25th year of Zhao Gong ({{cjkv|p=zhāo gōng|t=昭公|s=昭公}}) in the [[Zuo Zhuan]].

''Li'' consists of the norms of proper social behavior as taught to others by fathers, village elders and government officials. The teachings of li promoted ideals such as [[filial piety]], brotherliness, [[righteousness]], good faith and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Arthur F.|last1=Wright|first2=Dennis|last2=Twitchett|title= Confucian Personalities|date=1962|publisher= Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ''li'' guided public expectations, such as the loyalty to superiors and [[respect]] for elders in the community.

Continuous with the emphasis on community, following ''li'' included the internalization of action, which both yields the comforting feeling of tradition and allows one to become "more open to the panoply of sensations of the experience" (Rosemont 2005). But it should also maintain a healthy practice of selflessness, both in the actions themselves and in the proper example which is set for one's brothers. Approaches in the community, as well as personal approaches together demonstrate how ''li'' pervades in all things, the broad and the detailed, the good and the bad, the form and the formlessness. This is the complete realization of ''li''.

The rituals and practices of ''li'' are dynamic in nature. ''Li'' practices have been revised and evaluated throughout time to reflect the emerging views and beliefs found in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Asia/AsiaWong.htm|last=Wong|first=Yew Leong|title=''Li'' and Change|date= August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these practices may change, which happens very slowly over time, the fundamental ideals remain at the core of ''li'', which largely relate to social order.

==''Li'' in Government==
Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of ''li''. Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of  human beings with learning Li as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on ''li'' and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.

Confucius stressed the importance of the rites as fundamental to proper governmental leadership. In his sayings, Confucius regarded feudal lords in China that adopted the Chinese rites as being just rulers of the Central States. Contrarily, feudal lords that did not adopt these rites were considered uncivilized, not worthy of being considered Chinese or part of the Central States (Spring and Autumn Annals).

''Li'' should be practiced by all members of the society. ''Li'' also involves the superior treating the inferior with propriety and respect. As Confucius said "a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety (Li); ministers should serve their prince with loyalty" (Analects, 3:19).

==In quotations==

''Li'' is "one term by which the [traditional Chinese] historiographers could name all the principles of conservatism they advanced in the speeches of their characters." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Schaberg |first= David |title= A Patterned Past: Form and Thought in Early Chinese Historiography|publisher= Harvard University Press |date= 2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobbing''', as a sociological term, means [[bullying]] of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online.

When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as ‘ganging up’ by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace'' by Noa Davenport, Ruth D. Schwartz and Gail Pursell Elliott.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the concept ==
[[Konrad Lorenz]], in his book entitled ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), first described mobbing among birds and animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the [[Darwinian]] struggle to thrive (see [[animal mobbing behavior]]). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control.&lt;ref name="Westhues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/mobbing.htm|title=Workplace Mobbing in Academe|website=arts.uwaterloo.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's explanation for his choice of the English word Mobbing was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to [[Kenneth Westhues]], Lorenz chose the word mobbing because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term ''hassen auf'', which means "to hate after" or "to put a hate on" was applied and this emphasised "the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made" rather than the English word mobbing which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack.&lt;ref&gt; Westhues, Kenneth.(2007) [http://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm Mobbing a Natural Fact], Adapted and revised from "Mobbing am akademischen Arbeitsplatz," a lecture given in the Society for Sociology at the University of Graz, Austria, on 23 January 2007, Retrieved on 17 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, the Swedish physician {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter-Paul Heinemann|sv|3=Peter-Paul Heinemann|vertical-align=sup}} applied Lorenz's conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt;

In the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist [[Heinz Leymann]] applied the term to ganging up in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt; 

In 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper published an essay in [[The Huffington Post]] suggesting that some of the anti-bully approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label "bully" to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases, sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper/the-bully-label-has-to-go_b_1068456.html|title=The Bully Label Has to Go|first=Janice|last=Harper|date=1 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Janice Harper followed her Huffington Post essay with a series of essays in both The Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper|title=Janice Harper - HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her column, Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home in Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-bullying|title=Beyond Bullying|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily "evil" or "psychopathic," but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mobbed-What-When-They-Really/dp/0692693335/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Mobbed!: What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You|first=Janice Harper|last=Ph.D|date=24 August 2013|publisher=Backdoor Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.

== In the workplace ==
{{main article|Workplace bullying}}
British anti-bullying researchers [[Andrea Adams]] and [[Tim Field]] have used the expression "workplace bullying" instead of what Leymann called "mobbing" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as "an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through [[innuendo]], rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace."&lt;ref name="amwork"&gt;Davenport NZ, Schwartz RD &amp; Elliott GP [http://www.mobbing-usa.com Mobbing, Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace], 3rd Edition 2005, Civil Society Publishing. Ames, IA,&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually "exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication".&lt;ref name="amwork" /&gt;

In contrast, Janice Harper&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.

Shallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace "mobbing" to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and [[unfounded accusations]]. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by [[humiliation]], general [[harassment]], [[emotional abuse]] and/or [[terrorism|terror]]. Mobbing can be described as being "ganged up on." Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent "mob-like" behaviour toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008) [http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf Workplace Mobbing: Expulsion, Exclusion, and Transformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045605/http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf |date=13 July 2011 }}, retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing as "downward bullying" by superiors is also known as "bossing", and "upward bullying" by colleagues as "staffing", in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Oberhofer, P [http://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/bossing-und-staffing-mobbing-zwischen-chef-und-mitarbeitern/ Bossing und Staffing], retrieved 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and health effects ===
Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: [[adjustment disorders]], somatic symptoms, [[psychological trauma]] (e.g., trauma [[tremor]]s or sudden onset [[selective mutism]]), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and [[major depression]].&lt;ref name="CPV"&gt;Hillard JR [http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf Workplace mobbing: Are they really out to get your patient?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509035009/http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }} Current Psychiatry Volume 8 Number 4 April 2009 Pages 45–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the "mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences." Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes [[occupational psychosis]] generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.&lt;ref name="CPV" /&gt;

== At school ==
{{See also|School bullying}}
Following on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves 'ganging up' on someone using tactics of [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[discrediting]], [[Social rejection|isolating]], [[intimidating]], and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible ([[victim blaming]]).&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott GP [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHm5dqvPLSwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PR8&amp;dq=mobbing+bully+checklist ''School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse: See it – Stop it – Prevent it with Dignity and Respect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
{{See also|Bullying in academia}}
[[Kenneth Westhues]]' study of mobbing in [[academia]] found that [[vulnerability]] was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more [[post-modern]] scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Other factors included [[envy]], [[heresy]] and [[campus politics]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{citation |url=http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |title=Workplace Bullying in the Academic World? |date=13 May 2007 |publisher=Higher Education Development Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185410/http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Checklists ==
Sociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westhues2"&gt;Westhues K. [http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/checklist.htm Checklist of Mobbing Indicators] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohut MR [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSREF06T2ZQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA169 ''The Complete Guide to Understanding, Controlling, and Stopping Bullies &amp; Bullying at Work: A Complete Guide for Managers, Supervisors, and Co-Workers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based off a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as "self-labeling" and "behavior experience" methods respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steffgen|first1=Georges|last2=Sischka|first2=Philipp|last3=Schmidt|first3=Alexander|last4=Kohl|first4=Diane|last5=Happ|first5=Christian|title=The Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale|journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment|date=2016|doi=10.1027/1015-5759/a000381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations of some mobbing examination tools are:
* Participant exhaustion due to examination length
* Limited sample exposure resulting in limited result generalizability
* Confounding with constructs that result in the same affect as mobbing but are not purposely harmful 

Common Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:
* Leyman Inventory of Psychological Terror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leymann|first1=Heinz|title=Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror|journal=Tübingen: Deutsche Gellschaft für Verhaltenstherapie Verlag.|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LIPT)
* Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsen|first1=Staale|last2=Hoel|first2=Helge|last3=Notelaers|first3=Guy|title=Measuring exposure to bullying and harassment at work: Validity, factor structure and psychometric properties of the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised|journal=Work &amp; Stress|date=2009|volume=23|pages=24-44|doi=10.1080/02678370902815673}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NAQ-R)
* Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; (LWMS)

The [http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf Waterloo Anti-Mobbing  Instruments (WAMI)] created by [[Kenneth Westhues]] contains a 16 item checklist to identify the signs of mobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf |title=Conference Summary |format=PDF |date=2004 |accessdate=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counteracting Mobbing ==
From an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=Len|title=Workplace mobbing and bullying: a consulting psychology perspective and overview|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=165-168|doi=10.1037/a0016936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Maureen|title=Preventing workplace mobbing and bullying with effective organizational consultation, policies, and legislation|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=242-262|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferris|first1=Patricia|title=The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=169-189|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''Moral suasion''' is an appeal to [[morality]] in order to influence or change [[behavior]]. A famous example is the attempt by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and his [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] to end [[slavery in the United States]] by using moral suasion.&lt;ref&gt;Tunde Adeleke, "Afro-Americans and moral suasion: the debate in the 1830's," The Journal of Negro History, 1998: 127-142.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], moral suasion is more specifically defined as "the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law."&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia, What does moral suasion mean, http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralsuasion.asp (accessed June 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion in this narrower sense is also sometimes known as [[jawboning]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Verkuil, "Jawboning administrative agencies: Ex Parte Contracts by the White House," Columbia Law Review, 1980: 943-989.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of moral suasion:
* "Pure" moral suasion is an appeal for [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  and is rarely used in economic policy
* "Impure" moral suasion, which is the usual meaning of "moral suasion" in economics, is backed by explicit or implicit threats by authorities in order to provide incentives to comply with the authorities' wishes&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==Pure moral suasion==
[[File:William_Lloyd_Garrison_by_Southworth_and_Hawes,_c1850.png|thumb|[[William Lloyd Garrison]], who attempted to end slavery through moral suasion.]]
[[File:Shimer College Assembly Nov 15 2009.jpg|thumb|The Assembly of [[Shimer College]], which "governs by virtue of the moral suasion established by communal deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/256-constitution-of-the-assembly-9-2014pdf|date=2014-09-04|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=Constitution of the Assembly|publisher=Shimer College}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Moral suasion has been applied in many different fields.  In early [[education]]al thought, it was often paired against [[corporal punishment]] as a means of achieving [[school discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America|first=Randall M.|last=Miller|chapter=Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7bkGF4DytgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA251|page=251|volume=4|isbn=9780313065361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in [[parenting]], writers from the 19th century through [[Benjamin Spock]] have advocated the use of moral suasion with children as an alternative to physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYf8QfXPNWkC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;|page=30|first=Philip J.|last=Greven|year=2010|title=Spare the Rod: The Religious Roots of Punishment and the Psychological Impact of Physical Abuse|chapter=Moral Suasion and Nonviolence|isbn=9780307773005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[politics]], moral suasion has frequently been employed by movements for [[social change]], but its effectiveness has varied widely.

=== Examples ===

==== Temperance movement ====

In the [[temperance movement]] of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain and North America, moral suasion was initially a key part of the strategy for reducing the prevalence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in society.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXHYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472|page=472|title= Alcohol and Drugs in North America: A Historical Encyclopedia|chapter=Moral Suasion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the movement began to face the limitations of this strategy in the late 19th century, its members turned to legal coercion, leading to the rise of [[prohibitionism]].&lt;ref name="alcohol"/&gt;

==== United States civil rights movement ====
In the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] of the twentieth century, moral suasion was one of three major prongs of the movement, the others being legal action and collective [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jajYn4iXLBoC&amp;pg=PT72|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 24: Race|chapter=Civil Rights, African American|first=Waldo|last=Martin|ref=harv|page=72|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial victories, this nonviolent strategy began to struggle in the 1960s, and largely ended with the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Martin|2013|p=78}}

==== Promoting religious tolerance ====

Moral suasion has sometimes been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in [[Singapore]] in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times, "Govt will step in when efforts fail," Straits Times, March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protecting the environment ====

Usage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative [[externalities]] that they cause.&lt;ref name="zekri"&gt;S. Zekri, "Analyse comparative d'instruments de lutte contre la pollution," in Séminaire de l'Association Tunisienne des Anciens de l'Institut Agronomique Méditerranéen de Zaragoza (Tunis: CIHEAM-IAMZ, 1993), 61-73&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax.  Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low.&lt;ref name="zekri"/&gt;

A study of [[marine debris]] regulations in the United States from 1989 to 1993 revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour however is not strong&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;James M. Coe and Donald B. Rogers, Marine Debris, Sources, Impacts, and solutions (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policy makers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.van Kooten &amp; Andrew Schmitz, "Preserving Waterfowl Habitat on the Canadian Prairies: Economic Incentives versus Moral Suasion," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1992: 79-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impure moral suasion==
[[File:Ottawa - ON - Bank of Canada.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Bank of Canada, a [[central bank]]. Central banks often use impure moral suasion to control the [[credit supply]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NjWGbq7JMwC&amp;pg=PA426|page=426|title=Essentials of Macroeconomic Management|edition=1st|isbn=9788125928584|year=|first=M.C.|last=Vaish|publisher=Vikas Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As a policy tool, impure moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers.&lt;ref name="romans"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.T.|last=Romans|title=Moral Suasion as an Instrument of Economic Policy|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=56|issue=5| date=December 1996 |pages=1220–1226|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===

Moral suasion will be "an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance".{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}}

There are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen.
* First, citizens must support the Government's policy,{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}} thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion and the target whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange in violation of the country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt;
* Second, the population of economic agent to be persuaded must be small.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Fewness entails the easy identification of economic agents to persuade, and increase the perceived likelihood that non-compliers will be identified and punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Even when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Although neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion.  Indeed, companies that have been "persuaded" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Shleifer, "Does Competition Destroy Ethical Behavior?," The American Economic Review (American Economic Association) 94, no. 2 (May 2004): 414-418&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Regulating the financial sector ====
The [[Bank of Canada]] defines moral suasion in central banking as "a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy".&lt;ref name="chant"&gt;John F. Chant &amp; Keith Acheson, "The Choice of Monetary Instruments and the Theory of Bureaucracy," Public Choice Vol. 12 (Spring, 1972), 1972: 13-33&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be defined more generally as "a process whereby commercial banks co-operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Breton and Ronald Wintrobe, "A theory of 'moral' suasion," The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique, 1978: 210-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to "refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank".&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried though various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial finance institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters.

The oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive.&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==== Curbing inflation ====

Moral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as "open mouth operations" in the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Brash, "Inflation targeting 14 years on," Speech to the American Economics Association by the chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Atlanta, January 5, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank.  For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations,&lt;ref&gt;Lars E. O. Svensson, http://people.su.se/~leosven/, January 26–27, 2004, (accessed May 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;Editor in Chief Hama Saburi Financial Gazette, "http://www.newzimbabwe.com," http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-2111-Interview+Gono+on+Indigenisation/opinion.aspx, March 26, 2010, (accessed May 28, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of "democratic socialism" has been in place for some time.&lt;ref name="madden"&gt;Carl H. Madden, "Government Control versus Market Discipline," Academy of Political Science, 1979: 203-218&lt;/ref&gt; Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.&lt;ref name="madden"/&gt;

=== In different political regimes ===

Although moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective.

Centralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent.  Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly.

Effectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.

As fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography  .

Studies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in  advanced economies.  It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Interaction with other policy instruments ===

Moral suasion is rarely used in isolation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives.

==== Regulation ====

Firms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations.  In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.&lt;ref name="glazer"&gt;Amihai Glazer and Henry McMillan, "Pricing by the Firm Under Regulatory Threat," ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 1992: 1089-1099&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Price cap ====

Governments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed.  This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, [[Paul Volcker]], warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level,&lt;ref name="glazer"/&gt; and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Vernon and Carmelo Giaccotto, "The impact of indirect government controls on U.S. drug prices and R&amp;D," Cato Journal, 2006: 143-158&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional taxation ====

Moral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, "Moral outrage," The Economist, October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The threat of additional, specific taxes&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "House Passes Bonus Tax Bill" Wall Street Journal, March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely.

==== Open market transactions and other interventions by central banks ====

Central banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of "appropriate" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;John Williamson, "The case for Roughly Stabilizing the Real Value of the Dollar," The American Economic Review, 1989: 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range.

==== Information provision ====

Governments can choose to publish information in order to "shame" certain market participants into altering their behaviour.  The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging "excessive" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt;  The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kai Hong Phua, "Privatization and restructuring of health services in Singapore," IPS occasional paper series (Singapore: Institute of Policy Studies, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Service provision ====

The threat of a [[public option]], i.e. direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced, can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.

==== Privatisation and deregulation ====

Large monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.

'''Muhūrt''' ({{lang-sa|मुहूर्त}}) is a  [[Hindu units of measurement|Hindu unit of measurement]] for time along with nimesh, kāṣṭhā and kalā&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hinduism for Children Activity Workbook|last=Verma|first=Dinesh|publisher=Chanda Books|year=2008|isbn=9781440499913|location=|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hindu calendar]].

In the [[Brāhmaṇas]], ''muhūrta'' denotes a division of time: one-thirtieth of a day, or a period of forty-eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, I, I (for the names); 9, 7; 12, 9, 6; Śatapata Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 2, 18. 25. 27; 3, 20; xii. 3, 2, 5; x. 4, 4, 4, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense "moment" is also common in the Brāhmanạs.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, 139 et seq.; Indische Streifen, I, 92, et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]]&lt;ref&gt;Rigveda iii. 33, 5: 53, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; we only find the sense "moment."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonnell and [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], ''Vedic Index of Names and Subjects,'' vol. 2, p. 169. Motilal Banarsidas, London 1912, reprint 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further each muhūrta is further divided into 30 (Indian) minutes or kalā (making 30 Kalā ≈ 48 western min). Each kalā is further divided into 30 (Indian) seconds or Kāṣṭhā, making 30 Kāṣṭhā ≈ 1.6 western minute.

==Etymology==
The "Sandhi Vidchhed" for the term is thus: It breaks muhūrt into two parts, "muhu" (moment/immediate) and "ṛta" (order). The author of Ṛg Ved III.33.5 has accordingly created this descriptive term. [[Rta|Ṛta]] refers to the natural, yearly order of the seasons, so that the term muhūrt refers to the daily reflection of these. Also, cf., ''Śatpath Brāhmaṇa'' X.4.2.18, as below.

==Usage in the Vedic Period==
The term appears as early as the Ṛg Veda, where, according to Monier Williams, it means "a moment",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0825-mugdha.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but does not evidence any specification of an exact periodicity there as received in later works, such as the  ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The One Hundred Path Riddle" or the ''[[Taittiriya Brahmana|Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The Partridge's Riddle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 2; Volume 5|page=169|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |author2=Arthur Berriedale Keith|date=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5GaKHfNzScC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pt. Vijay Shrikrishna Jakatdar points to two specific Ṛg Veda passages that employ the term, III.33.5, and III.53.8:&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"&gt;http://ebookbrowsee.net/filedownload-php-v-8-a-y-b-y-f-71-muhurtaaconcepttobeamendedaspermoderntimesbw-pdf-d169899279&lt;/ref&gt;

पर सिन्धुमछा बर्हती मनीषावस्युरह्वे कुशिकस्य सूनुः ||

"Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a ''moment'' in your journey.
With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto the River." (trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03033.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
and

रूपं-रूपं मघवा बोभवीति मायाः कर्ण्वानस्तन्वं परि सवाम | 
तरिर्यद दिवः परि मुहूर्तमागात सवैर्मन्त्रैरन्र्तुपा रतावा ||

"Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body,
Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a ''moment'', through fit prayers, from heaven." (ibid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Authur Anthony Macdonell and Authur Berriedale, the Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa mentions the names of 15 muhūrtas:

''(1) saṁjñānaṁ (2) vijñānaṁ (3) prajñānaṁ (4) jānad (5) abhijānat'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(6) saṁkalpamānaṁ (7) prakalpamānam (8) upakalpamānam (9) upakḷptaṁ (10) kḷptam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(11) śreyo (12)  vasīya (13) āyat (14) saṁbhūtaṁ (15) bhūtam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''citraḥ ketuḥ prabhānābhānt saṁbhān'' |&lt;br&gt;
''jyotiṣmaṁs-tejasvānātapaṁs-tapann-abhitapan'' |&lt;br&gt;
''rocano rocamānaḥ śobhanaḥ śobhamānaḥ kalyāṇaḥ'' |&lt;br&gt;
''darśā dṛṣṭā darśatā viṣvarūpā surdarśanā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpy-āyamāṇāpyāyamānāpyāyā su-nṛterā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpūryamāṇā pūryamāṇā pūryantī pūrṇā paurṇamāsī'' |&lt;br&gt;
''dātā pradātā'nando modaḥ pramodaḥ ''|| III.10.1.1 ||

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa describes a muhūrta as 1/15th portion of a day:

átʰa yaccáturviṃśatimātmáno'kuruta |
tásmāc-cátur-viṃśaty-ardʰa-māsaḥ saṃ-vatsaraḥ sá etaiś-cátur-viṃśatyā triṃ-śád-iṣṭakair-ātmábʰir-na vyábʰavat-sa páñca-daśā́hno rūpā́ṇy-apaśyad-ātmánas-tanvò muhūrtā́lokam-pr̥ṇāḥ páñca-daśaiva rā́tres-tadyán-muhu trā́yante tásmān-muhurtā átʰa yát-kṣudrāḥ sánta imā́ṃ-lokā́n-āpūráyanti tásmāl-lokam-pr̥ṇā́ḥ || (X.4.2.18)

It is stated in ''[[Manusmṛti]]'' that 18 nimeṣas (twinklings of the eye) are 1 Kāṣṭhā, 30 Kāṣṭhās are 1 Kāla, 30 Kālas are one Muhūrta, and 30 Muhūrtas are one day and night.

==Ritual Significance==
It is a common practice in Hinduism to perform or avoid activities like important religious ceremonies on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demystifying Brahminism and Re-Inventing Hinduism: Volume 1 - Demystifying Brahminism|last=Shri|first=Satya|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=9781946515544|location=Chennai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dheivegam.com/tamil-muhurtham-dates/ | title=Tamil Muhurtham dates | publisher=Dheivegam}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the way "Muhūrt" is used in present-day South Asia for calculating the most auspicious moment for a Vedic-Hindu Wedding ceremony. Astrologers are often hired to calculate a moment for the wedding so that any possible divinely-sourced problems can be averted. Jakatdar suggests a shift in the contemporary temperament regarding the traditional approach to calculating such events, to accommodate the ever increasing complexity of modern life.&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"/&gt; The muhūrt has the same utility in the marriage rites in Brahmanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 20|last=Sholapur|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1884|isbn=|location=Bombay|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example is the so-called Brahma Muhūrta, which is about one and a half hours before sunrise. This particular time, which is associated with the constellations during the Vernal Equinox, is said to be auspicious for practicing yoga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the case of ''samayik'', which is part of the initiation rite for the ''Svetambar'' mendicants or those who pursue a perpetual state of heightened meditative awareness. They take the ''samayik,'' a vow for life taken for short periods, preferably one or two muhūrts, where one muhūrt constitutes forty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|last=Cort|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0195132343|location=Oxford|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yearly Calibration==
The Muhūrtas are traditionally calculated{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} by assuming sunrise at 06:00 AM on the Vernal Equinox, which is the Vedic New Year.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Not all of the constellations cross the zenith, so that it is not in every case clear which constellation presides over the Muhūrta. Yet it is clear that one or more prominent features of the correlate constellations, from which the later Muhūrtas draw their respective names, falls within the Celestial Longitude of the same, drawn from the Polar Axis.

==Significance==
Traditionally, it is common practice amongst [[Hindu]]s to start or avoid starting significant tasks like religious ceremonies, etc. on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. The [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]] also generally recommend one or more Muhūrtas to perform rituals and practices. The most widely known example of this practice:

* [[Brahma muhurta|Brahma Muhūrta]], approximately one and a half hours before sunrise or more precisely is 1Hr 36 Mins. i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā, is recommended in all practices of [[yoga]] is traditionally considered most apt for [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="brahma-muhurta" /&gt; However, it is clear from the associations of the names with specific constellations that the present Brahma-Muhūrta starts just before 6:00AM during the Vernal Equinox. At present, Jīva-Amṛta and Viṣṇu comprise the two twilight muhūrtas prior to sunrise.

[[Image:Nikolay Danilevski.jpg|right|thumb|Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky]]
'''Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Я́ковлевич Даниле́вский}}; 28 November 1822 – 7 November 1885) was a Russian Empire [[natural history|naturalist]], [[economics|economist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[history|historian]] and ideologue of [[Pan-Slavism]] and the [[Slavophile]] movement. He expounded a [[eternal return|circular]] view of world history.

He is remembered also for his opposition to [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] and for his theory of historical-cultural types.

==Life==
Danilevsky was born in the village of [[Izmalkovsky District|Oberets]] in [[Oryol Governorate]].  As a member of a noble family, he was educated at the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]. After graduation, he went on to an appointment with the Military Ministry Office. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a military career, he began to attend the [[University of St Petersburg]], where he studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

Having passed his master's exams, Danilevsky prepared to defend his thesis on the flora of the [[Black Sea]] area of [[Europe]]an Russia but in 1849 he was arrested there for his membership in the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], which studied the work of French [[socialism|socialists]] and included [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Its most active members were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Danilevsky was imprisoned for 100 days in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and then was sent to live under police surveillance in [[Vologda]], where he worked in provincial administration.

In 1852, he was appointed to an expedition, led by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], to assess the condition of the fishing industry on the [[Volga]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. The expedition lasted four years, and Danilevsky was then reassigned to the Agricultural Department of the State Property Ministry. For over 20 years, he was responsible for expeditions to the [[White Sea]], the Black Sea, the [[Azov Sea]], the Caspian Sea and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The expertise that he gained from the expeditions led to the publication of his 1872 book, ''Examination of Fishery Conditions in Russia''.

Aside from his work on fisheries and the seal trade, he was the head of the commission setting the rules for the use of running water in [[Crimea]] from 1872 to 1879. He ran the [[Nikitsky Botanical Gardens]] from 1879 to 1880, and he was part of a commission appointed to deal with the [[phylloxera]] epidemic in the 1880s. His papers on Russian [[climatology]], [[geology]], [[geography]], and [[ethnology]] earned him a gold medal from the [[Russian Geographical Society]].

Danilevsky died in [[Tbilisi]], [[Tiflis Governorate]], and was buried at his estate, in Mshanka.

==Work==
=== Natural theology and rejection of Darwinism===
Danilevsky's ''Darwinism: Critical research,'' which brings together more than 1200 pages of arguments against Darwin's theory, mostly assembled from the literature that already existed at the time, was published in 1885. It was meant to be the first volume of a longer work, the second volume containing Danilevsky's own theories, which he characterised as "[[natural theology]]", but it was unfinished at his death. When it was published posthumously, it contained only preliminary studies.

Danilevsky had been influenced by the work of von Baer, who had developed his own [[Teleology|teleological]] theory of evolution and gone on to criticise Darwin's work in the 1870s. Danilevsky took from von Baer's theory the notion of ''[[Zielstrebigkeit]]''. The [[German language|German]] word means "singleness of purpose" but Danilevsky imbued it with a religious aspect and argued that evolution, as well as the original creation of the world, has a rational purpose and follows the will of a divine creator.

===Theory of historical-cultural types===
Danilevsky first published ''Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World'' in the journal ''[[Zarya]]'' in 1869. Later republished as a [[monograph]], it brought him international fame.

He pioneered the use of biological and morphological metaphors in the comparison of cultures. Danilevsky compared cultures and nations to biological species, denied their commonality and argued that each nation or civilisation is united by its language and culture, which it cannot pass on to any other nation. He thus characterised [[Peter the Great]]'s reforms in Russia as doomed to failure, as they had attempted to impose alien values on the Slavic world.

Danilevsky distinguished four categories of historical-cultural activity:

# religious
# political
# sociopolitical
# cultural

They gave rise to ten historical-cultural types:&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# Chaldean
# Hebrew
# Arab
# Indian
# Persian
# Greek
# Roman or ancient Italian
# Germanic
# Hamitic or Egyptian
# Chinese

Danilevsky applied his teleological theory of evolution by stating that each type went through various predetermined stages of youth, adulthood, and old age, the last being the end of that type. He characterised the Slavic type as being at the youth stage, and he developed a socio-political plan for its development, involving unification of the Slavic world, with its future capital at [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), ruled by an Orthodox emperor. While other cultures would degenerate in their blind struggle for existence, the Slavic world should be viewed as a [[Messiah]] among them. Danilevsky, however, believed that there is no genuine or absolute progress, as history is circular.

Aspects of Danilevsky's book prefigured some of the theories in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]''. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] mentions them in ''[[A Study of History]]''. The Danilevsky hypothesis became the subject of much controversy and polarised its readers. On one hand, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] praised it, but on the other hand, [[Westernizer|Occidentalist]]s, such as [[Nikolai Kareev]], [[Pavel Milyukov]] (1859-1943) and [[Nikolai Mikhailovsky]] (1842-1904), strongly opposed it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25454">In [[mathematics]], '''non-standard calculus''' is the modern application of [[infinitesimals]], in the sense of [[non-standard analysis]], to differential and integral calculus.  It provides a rigorous justification for some arguments in [[infinitesimal calculus|calculus]] that were previously considered merely heuristic.

Nonrigourous calculations with infinitesimals were widely used before [[Karl Weierstrass]] sought to replace them with the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] starting in the 1870s.  (See [[history of calculus]].) For almost one hundred years thereafter, mathematicians like [[Richard Courant]] viewed infinitesimals as being naive and vague or meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Courant described infinitesimals on page 81 of ''Differential and Integral Calculus, Vol I'', as "devoid of any clear meaning" and "naive befogging". Similarly on page 101, Courant described them as "incompatible with the clarity of ideas demanded in mathematics", "entirely meaningless", "fog which hung round the foundations", and a "hazy idea".&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--On this paragraph, see Talk, three sections that mention Courant and/or quotations--&gt;

Contrary to such views, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed in 1960 that infinitesimals are precise, clear, and meaningful, building upon work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy Łoś]]. According to [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Howard Keilser]], "Robinson solved a three hundred year old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals.  Robinson's achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of non-standard calculus began with the use of infinitely small quantities, called [[infinitesimal]]s in [[calculus]].  The use of infinitesimals can be found the foundations of calculus independently developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] starting in the 1660s. [[John Wallis]] refined earlier techniques of [[indivisibles]] of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] and others by exploiting an [[infinitesimal]] quantity he denoted &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; in area calculations, preparing the ground for integral [[calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J.F. 1981. "The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. (1616&amp;ndash;1703)". Chelsea Publishing Co. New York, NY. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They drew on the work of such mathematicians as [[Pierre de Fermat]], [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[René Descartes]].

In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]''.

Several mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], advocated the use of limits. [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] developed a versatile spectrum of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|ε, δ argument]] in working with differentiation. [[Karl Weierstrass]] formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]&lt;!--correct link?--&gt; in the context of a (real) number system without infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on ε, δ arguments instead of infinitesimals.

This approach formalized by Weierstrass came to be known as the ''standard'' calculus.  After many years of the infinitesimal approach to calculus having fallen into disuse other than as an introductory pedagogical tool, use of infinitesimal quantities was finally given a rigorous foundation by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s.  Robinson's approach is called [[non-standard analysis]] to distinguish it from the standard use of limits.  This approach used technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to create a theory of [[hyperreal number]]s that interpret infinitesimals in a manner that allows a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. An alternative approach, developed by [[Edward Nelson]], finds infinitesimals on the ordinary real line itself, and involves a modification of the foundational setting by extending [[ZFC]] through the introduction of a new unary predicate "standard".

==Motivation==

To calculate the derivative &lt;math&gt;f '&lt;/math&gt; of the function &lt;math&gt; y =f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; at ''x'', both approaches agree on the algebraic manipulations:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{(x + \Delta  x)^2 - x^2}{\Delta  x} = \frac{2 x \Delta x + (\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x} = 2 x  + \Delta x \approx 2 x&lt;/math&gt;

This becomes a computation of the derivatives using the [[hyperreals]] if we interpret &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; as an infinitesimal and let the symbol "&lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt;" be the relation "is infinitely close to".

In order to make ''f ''' a real-valued function, we must dispense with the final term &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. In the standard approach using only real numbers, that is done by taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero. In the [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] approach, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be an infinitesimal, a nonzero number that is closer to 0 than to any nonzero real. The manipulations displayed above then show that &lt;math&gt;\Delta y /\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely close to 2''x'', so the derivative of ''f'' at ''x'' is then 2''x''.

Discarding the "error term" is accomplished by an application of the [[standard part function]]. Dispensing with infinitesimal error terms was historically considered paradoxical by some writers, most notably [[George Berkeley]].

Once the hyperreal number system (an infinitesimal-enriched continuum) is in place, one has successfully incorporated a large part of the technical difficulties at the foundational level.  Thus, the [[epsilon, delta technique]]s that some believe to be the essence of analysis can be implemented once and for all at the foundational level, and the students needn't be "dressed to perform multiple-quantifier logical stunts on pretense of being taught [[infinitesimal calculus]]", to quote a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Keisler's textbook==
Keisler's [[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]] defines continuity on page 125 in terms of infinitesimals, to the exclusion of epsilon, delta methods.
The derivative is defined on page 45 using infinitesimals rather than an epsilon-delta approach.
The integral is defined on page 183 in terms of infinitesimals.
Epsilon, delta definitions are introduced on page 282.

==Definition of derivative==

The [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] can be constructed in the framework of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the standard axiomatisation of set theory used elsewhere in mathematics.  To give an intuitive idea for the hyperreal approach, note that, naively speaking, non-standard analysis postulates the existence of positive numbers ε ''which  are infinitely small'', meaning that ε is smaller than any standard positive real, yet greater than zero.  Every real number ''x'' is surrounded by an infinitesimal "cloud" of hyperreal numbers infinitely close to it.  To define the derivative of ''f'' at a standard real number ''x'' in this approach, one no longer needs an infinite limiting process as in standard calculus.  Instead, one sets

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \mathrm{st} \left( \frac{f^*(x+\varepsilon)-f^*(x)}{\varepsilon} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where '''st''' is the [[standard part function]], yielding the real number infinitely close to the hyperreal argument of '''st''', and &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is the natural extension of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to the hyperreals.

==Continuity==
A real function ''f'' is continuous at a standard real number ''x'' if for every hyperreal ''x' '' infinitely close to ''x'', the value ''f''(''x' '') is also infinitely close to ''f''(''x'').  This captures [[Cauchy]]'s definition of continuity as presented in his 1821 textbook [[Cours d'Analyse]], p.&amp;nbsp;34.

Here to be precise, ''f'' would have to be replaced by its natural hyperreal extension usually denoted ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (see discussion of [[Transfer principle]] in main article at [[Non-standard analysis#Internal sets|non-standard analysis]]).

Using the notation &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; for the relation of being infinitely close as above,
the definition can be extended to arbitrary (standard or non-standard) points as follows:

A function ''f'' is ''[[microcontinuous]]'' at ''x'' if whenever &lt;math&gt;x'\approx x&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;f^*(x')\approx f^*(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the point x' is assumed to be in the domain of (the natural extension of) ''f''.

The above requires fewer quantifiers than the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(''ε'',&amp;nbsp;''δ'')-definition]] familiar from  standard elementary calculus:

''f'' is continuous at ''x'' if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for every ''x' '', whenever |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'&amp;thinsp;''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ'', one has |''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'&amp;thinsp;'')|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε''.

==Uniform continuity==
A function ''f'' on an interval ''I'' is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if its natural extension ''f''* in ''I''* has the following property (see Keisler, Foundations of Infinitesimal Calculus ('07), p.&amp;nbsp;45):

for every pair of hyperreals ''x'' and ''y'' in ''I''*, if &lt;math&gt;x\approx y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^*(x)\approx f^*(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

In terms of microcontinuity defined in the previous section, this can be stated as follows: a real function is uniformly continuous if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous at every point of the domain of f*.

This definition has a reduced quantifier complexity when compared with the standard [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε,&amp;nbsp;δ)-definition]].  Namely, the epsilon-delta definition of uniform continuity requires four quantifiers, while the infinitesimal definition requires only two quantifiers.  It has the same quantifier complexity as the definition of uniform continuity in terms of ''sequences'' in standard calculus, which however is not expressible in the [[first-order logic|first-order language]] of the real numbers.

The hyperreal definition can be illustrated by the following three examples.

Example 1: a function ''f'' is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval (0,1], if and only if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous (in the sense of the formula above) at every positive infinitesimal, in addition to continuity at the standard points of the interval.

Example 2: a function ''f'' is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval [0,∞) if and only if it is continuous at the standard points of the interval, and in addition, the natural extension ''f''* is microcontinuous at every positive infinite hyperreal point.

Example 3: similarly, the failure of uniform continuity for the squaring function

:&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is due to the absence of microcontinuity at a single infinite hyperreal point, see below.

Concerning quantifier complexity, the following remarks were made by [[Kevin Houston (mathematician)|Kevin Houston]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Houston (mathematician)|Kevin Houston]], How to Think Like a Mathematician, {{ISBN|978-0-521-71978-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The number of quantifiers in a mathematical statement gives a rough measure of the statement’s complexity. Statements involving three or more quantifiers can be difficult to understand. This is the main reason why it is hard to understand the rigorous definitions of limit, convergence, continuity and differentiability in analysis as they have many quantifiers.  In fact, it is the alternation of the &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; that causes the complexity.

[[Andreas Blass]] wrote as follows:
:Often ... the nonstandard definition of a concept is simpler than the standard definition (both intuitively simpler and simpler in a technical sense, such as quantifiers over lower types or fewer alternations of quantifiers).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Andreas|last1=Blass

==Compactness==

A set A is compact if and only if its natural extension A* has the following property: every point in A* is infinitely close to a point of A.  Thus, the open interval (0,1) is not compact because its natural extension contains positive infinitesimals which are not infinitely close to any positive real number.

==Heine–Cantor theorem==
The fact that a continuous function on a compact interval ''I'' is necessarily uniformly continuous (the [[Heine–Cantor theorem]]) admits a succinct hyperreal proof.  Let ''x'', ''y'' be hyperreals in the natural extension ''I*'' of ''I''.  Since ''I'' is compact, both st(''x'') and st(''y'') belong to ''I''.  If ''x'' and ''y'' were infinitely close, then by the triangle inequality, they would have the same standard part

:&lt;math&gt;c = \operatorname{st}(x) = \operatorname{st}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the function is assumed continuous at c, we have

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\approx f(c)\approx f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore ''f''(''x'') and ''f''(''y'') are infinitely close, proving uniform continuity of ''f''.

==Why is the squaring function not uniformly continuous?==

Let ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;N\in \mathbb{R}^*&lt;/math&gt; be an infinite hyperreal.  The hyperreal number &lt;math&gt;N + \tfrac{1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely close to ''N''.  Meanwhile, the difference

:&lt;math&gt; f(N+\tfrac{1}{N}) - f(N) = N^2 + 2 + \tfrac{1}{N^2} - N^2 = 2 + \tfrac{1}{N^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is not infinitesimal.   Therefore, ''f*'' fails to be microcontinuous at the hyperreal point ''N''.  Thus, the squaring function is not uniformly continuous, according to the definition in [[Non-standard calculus#Uniform continuity|uniform continuity]] above.

A similar proof may be given in the standard setting {{harv|Fitzpatrick|2006|loc=Example 3.15}}.

==Example: Dirichlet function==
Consider the [[Dirichlet function]]
:&lt;math&gt;I_Q(x):=\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if }x \text{ is rational}, \\
0 &amp; \text{ if } x \text{ is irrational}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It is well known that, under the [[continuous function|standard definition of continuity]], the function is discontinuous at every point.  Let us check this in terms of the hyperreal definition of continuity above, for instance let us show that the Dirichlet function is not continuous at π.  Consider the continued fraction approximation a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of π.  Now let the index n be an infinite [[hypernatural]] number.  By the [[transfer principle]], the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes the value 1 at a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Note that the hyperrational point a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is infinitely close to π.  Thus the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes different values (0 and 1) at these two infinitely close points, and therefore the Dirichlet function is not continuous at&amp;nbsp;''π''.

==Limit==
While the thrust of Robinson's approach is that one can dispense with the approach using multiple quantifiers, the notion of limit can be easily recaptured in terms of the [[standard part function]] '''st''', namely

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if whenever the difference ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' is infinitesimal, the difference ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''L'' is infinitesimal, as well, or in formulas:

:if st(''x'') = ''a''&amp;nbsp;  then st(''f''(''x'')) = L,

cf. [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]].

==Limit of sequence==
Given a sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\{x_n|n\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;L\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we say ''L'' is '''the limit''' of the sequence and write

::&lt;math&gt; L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt;

if for every infinite [[hypernatural]] ''n'', we have st(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)=L (here the extension principle is used to define x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for every hyperinteger n).

This definition has no [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] alternations.The standard  [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε, δ)-style]] definition on the other hand does have quantifier alternations:

::&lt;math&gt;L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n\Longleftrightarrow \forall \epsilon&gt;0\;, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}\;,  \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n &gt;N \rightarrow  |x_n-L|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

==Extreme value theorem==

To show that a real continuous function ''f'' on [0,1] has a maximum, let ''N'' be an infinite [[hyperinteger]].  The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] has a natural hyperreal extension.  The function ''f'' is also naturally extended to hyperreals between 0 and 1.  Consider the partition of the hyperreal interval [0,1] into ''N'' subintervals of equal [[infinitesimal]] length 1/''N'', with partition points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''i''&amp;nbsp;/''N'' as ''i'' "runs" from 0 to ''N''.  In the standard setting (when ''N'' is finite), a point with the maximal value of ''f'' can always be chosen among the ''N''+1 points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, by induction.  Hence, by the [[transfer principle]], there is a hyperinteger ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that 0&amp;nbsp;≤ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''N'' and &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i_0})\geq f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N'' (an alternative explanation is that every [[hyperfinite set]] admits a maximum).  Consider the real point

:&lt;math&gt;c= {\rm st}(x_{i_0})&lt;/math&gt;

where '''st''' is the [[standard part function]].  An arbitrary real point ''x'' lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely &lt;math&gt;x\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]&lt;/math&gt;, so that '''st'''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= ''x''.  Applying '''st''' to the inequality &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i_0})\geq f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;{\rm st}(f(x_{i_0}))\geq {\rm st}(f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;.  By continuity of ''f'' we have
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm st}(f(x_{i_0}))= f({\rm st} (x_{i_0}))=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence ''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;≥ ''f''(''x''), for all ''x'', proving ''c'' to be a maximum of the real function ''f''.  See {{harvtxt |Keisler|1986|p=164}}.

==Intermediate value theorem==

As another illustration of the power of [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]]'s approach, we present a short proof of the [[intermediate value theorem]] (Bolzano's theorem) using infinitesimals.

Let ''f'' be a continuous function on [''a,b''] such that ''f(a)&lt;0'' while ''f(b)&gt;0''.  Then there exists a point ''c'' in [''a,b''] such that ''f(c)=0''.

The proof proceeds as follows.  Let ''N'' be an infinite [[hyperinteger]].  Consider a partition of [''a,b''] into ''N'' intervals of equal length, with partition points ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' as ''i'' runs from 0 to ''N''.  Consider the collection ''I'' of indices such that ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;0''.  Let ''i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the least element in ''I'' (such an element exists by the [[transfer principle]], as ''I'' is a [[hyperfinite set]]).  Then the real number

&lt;math&gt;c=\mathrm{st}(x_{i_0})&lt;/math&gt;

is the desired zero of ''f''.
Such a proof reduces the [[Predicate logic|quantifier]] complexity of a standard proof of the IVT.

== Basic theorems ==

If ''f'' is a real valued function defined on an interval [''a'', ''b''], then the transfer operator applied to ''f'', denoted by ''*f'',  is an ''internal'', hyperreal-valued function defined on the hyperreal interval [*''a'', *''b''].

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''f'' be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [''a'', ''b'']. Then ''f'' is differentiable at ''a &lt; x &lt; b'' if and only if
for every ''non-zero'' infinitesimal ''h'', the value

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_h f := \operatorname{st} \frac{[{}^*\!f](x+h)-[{}^*\!f](x)}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

is independent of ''h''.  In that case, the common value is the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

This fact follows from the [[transfer principle]] of non-standard analysis and [[overspill]].

Note that a similar result holds for differentiability at the endpoints ''a'', ''b'' provided the sign of the infinitesimal ''h'' is suitably restricted.

For the second theorem, we consider the Riemann integral.  This integral is defined as the limit, if it exists, of a directed family of ''Riemann sums''; these are sums of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(\xi_k) (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 \leq \xi_0 \leq x_1 \leq \ldots x_{n-1} \leq \xi_{n-1} \leq x_n = b.&lt;/math&gt;

We will call such a sequence of values a ''partition'' or ''mesh'' and

:&lt;math&gt; \sup_k (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

the width of the mesh.  In the definition of the Riemann integral, the limit of the Riemann sums is taken as the width of the mesh goes to 0.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''f'' be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [''a'', ''b'']. Then ''f'' is Riemann-integrable on [''a'', ''b''] if and only if
for every internal mesh of infinitesimal width, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; S_M = \operatorname{st} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [*f](\xi_k) (x_{k+1} - x_k) &lt;/math&gt;

is independent of the mesh.  In this case, the common value is
the Riemann integral of ''f'' over [''a'', ''b''].

== Applications ==

One immediate application is an extension of the standard definitions of differentiation and integration to [[internal set|internal function]]s on intervals of hyperreal numbers.

An internal hyperreal-valued function ''f'' on [''a, b''] is ''S''-differentiable at ''x'', provided

:&lt;math&gt;  \Delta_h f = \operatorname{st} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

exists and is independent of the infinitesimal ''h''. The value is the ''S'' derivative at ''x''.

'''Theorem'''.  Suppose ''f'' is ''S''-differentiable at every point of [''a, b''] where ''b'' &amp;minus; ''a'' is a bounded hyperreal.  Suppose furthermore that

:&lt;math&gt; |f'(x)| \leq M \quad a \leq x \leq b. &lt;/math&gt;

Then for some infinitesimal ε

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)| \leq M (b-a) +  \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, let ''N'' be a non-standard natural number.  Divide the interval [''a'', ''b''] into ''N'' subintervals by placing ''N'' &amp;minus; 1 equally spaced  intermediate points:

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 &lt;  x_1&lt; \cdots &lt; x_{N-1} &lt; x_N = b&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)|  \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} |f(x_{k+1}) - f(x_{k})| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \left\{|f'(x_k)| + \epsilon_k\right\}|x_{k+1} - x_{k}|.&lt;/math&gt;

Now the maximum of any internal set of infinitesimals is infinitesimal.  Thus all the ε&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'s are dominated by an infinitesimal ε. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; |f(b) - f(a)|  \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (M + \epsilon)(x_{k+1} - x_{k}) = M(b-a) + \epsilon (b-a)&lt;/math&gt;

from which the result follows.

[[File:Phase change - en.svg|thumb|right|340px|This diagram shows the nomenclature for the different phase transitions.]]

The term '''phase transition''' (or '''phase change''') is most commonly used to describe transitions between [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]]eous [[states of matter]], as well as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in rare cases. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform [[physical property|physical properties]]. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of the change of some external condition, such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], or others. For example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to the [[boiling point]], resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The measurement of the external conditions at which the transformation occurs is termed the phase transition. Phase transitions commonly occur in nature and are used today in many technologies.

==Types of phase transition==
Examples of phase transitions include:
*The transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a single component, due to the effects of temperature and/or [[pressure]]:

* A [[eutectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a [[eutectoid]] transformation.
* A [[peritectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase solid is heated and transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase.
* A [[spinodal decomposition]], in which a single phase is cooled and separates into two different compositions of that same phase.
* Transition to a [[mesophase]] between solid and liquid, such as one of the "[[liquid crystal]]" phases.
* The transition between the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] and [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials at the [[Curie point]].
* The transition between differently ordered, [[ANNNI model|commensurate]] or [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurate]], magnetic structures, such as in cerium [[antimonide]].
* The [[martensitic transformation]] which occurs as one of the many phase transformations in carbon steel and stands as a model for [[displacive phase transformations]].
* Changes in the [[crystallographic]] structure such as between [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[austenite]] of iron.
* Order-disorder transitions such as in alpha-[[titanium aluminide]]s.
* The dependence of the [[adsorption]] geometry on coverage and temperature, such as for [[hydrogen]] on iron (110).
* The emergence of [[superconductivity]] in certain metals and ceramics when cooled below a critical temperature.
* The transition between different molecular structures ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], [[allotropy|allotropes]] or [[polyamorphism|polyamorphs]]), especially of solids, such as between an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] structure and a [[crystal]] structure, between two different crystal structures, or between two amorphous structures.
* Quantum condensation of [[boson]]ic fluids ([[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]]). The [[superfluidity|superfluid]] transition in liquid [[helium]] is an example of this.
* The [[Symmetry breaking|breaking of symmetries]] in the laws of physics during the early history of the universe as its temperature cooled.
* [[Isotope fractionation]] occurs during a phase transition, the ratio of light to heavy isotopes in the involved molecules changes. When [[water vapor]] condenses (an [[equilibrium fractionation]]), the heavier water isotopes (18O and 2H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) tend toward the vapor phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Phase transitions occur when the [[thermodynamic free energy]] of a system is [[analytic function|non-analytic]] for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. [[phase (matter)|phases]]). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are too small. It is important to note that phase transitions can occur and are defined for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.

At the phase transition point (for instance, [[boiling point]]) the two phases of a substance, liquid and [[vapor]], have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the gaseous form is preferred.

It is sometimes possible to change the state of a system [[diabatic]]ally (as opposed to [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic]]ally) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is [[metastable]], i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in [[superheating]], [[supercooling]], and [[supersaturation]], for example.

==Classifications==

===Ehrenfest classification===

[[Paul Ehrenfest]] classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the [[thermodynamic free energy]] as a function of other thermodynamic variables.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions: Introduction and Evolution|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|date=1 May 1998|volume=53|issue=1|pages=51–81|doi=10.1007/s004070050021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. ''First-order phase transitions'' exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable.&lt;ref name = Blundell&gt;{{Cite book | last = Blundell | first = Stephen J. |author2=Katherine M. Blundell | title = Concepts in Thermal Physics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-19-856770-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. ''Second-order phase transitions'' are continuous in the first derivative (the [[order parameter]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy.&lt;ref name = Blundell/&gt; These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the [[magnetization]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the [[Curie temperature]]. The [[magnetic susceptibility]], the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions.

Though useful, Ehrenfest's classification has been found to be an incomplete method of classifying phase transitions, for it does not take into account the case where a [[derivative]] of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] diverges (which is only possible in the [[thermodynamic limit]]). For instance, in the [[ferromagnetic]] transition, the [[heat capacity]] diverges to [[infinity]]. The same phenomenon is also seen in superconducting phase transition.

===Modern classifications===
In the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

First-order phase transitions are those that involve a [[latent heat]]. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a "mixed-phase regime" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. Familiar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into [[water vapor|vapor]], but forms a [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Imry and Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Imry | first1 = Y. | last2 = Wortis | first2 = M. | year = 1979 | title =  Influence of quenched impurities on first-order phase transitions| url = | journal = Phys.

Second-order phase transitions are also called ''continuous phase transitions''. They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power-law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a [[Type-I superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a [[Type-II superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state—mixed-state and mixed-state—superconducting-state transitions) and the [[superfluid]] transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature&lt;ref name="J. Non-Cryst 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ojovan | first1 = M.I. | year = 2013 | title = Ordering and structural changes at the glass-liquid transition | url = | journal = J. Non-Cryst.

[[Lev Landau]] gave a [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] [[Landau theory|theory]] of second-order phase transitions.

Apart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as [[multicritical point]]s, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.

Several transitions are known as ''infinite-order phase transitions''.
They are continuous but break no [[#Symmetry|symmetries]]. The most famous example is the [[Kosterlitz–Thouless transition]] in the two-dimensional [[XY model]]. Many [[quantum phase transition]]s, e.g., in [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es, belong to this class.

The [[glass transition|liquid–glass transition]] is observed in many [[polymers]] and other liquids that can be [[supercooling|supercooled]] far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a ''[[quenched disorder]]'' state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium.

==Characteristic properties==

===Phase coexistence===
A disorder-broadened  first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1995 | title =  Metallic Glasses| url = | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5206| pages = 1947–1953 |bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1947G |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5206.1947 | pmid =  17770105| last1 =  Greer| first1 =  A.

Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature.

The interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.

===Critical points===
In any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]], at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).

===Symmetry===
Phase transitions often involve a [[symmetry breaking]] process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a [[crystalline solid]] breaks continuous [[translation symmetry]]: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], with the exception of certain [[accidental symmetry|accidental symmetries]] (e.g. the formation of heavy [[virtual particles]], which only occurs at low temperatures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivancevic|first1=Vladimir G.|last2=Ivancevic|first2=Tijiana, T.|title=Complex Nonlinearity|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-79357-1|pages=176–177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wpsPgHgtxEYC&amp;pg=PA177 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order parameters&lt;!--'Order parameter' and 'Order parameters' redirect here--&gt;===
An '''order parameter'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Compendium of Chemical Terminology  | editor = A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson | isbn = 978-0-86542-684-9 | doi = | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/O04323.html | accessdate = 2007-10-23| year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the critical point, the order parameter [[susceptibility (disambiguation)|susceptibility]] will usually diverge.

An example of an order parameter is the net [[magnetization]] in a [[ferromagnetic]] system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.

From a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the [[ferromagnetic]] phase, one must provide the net [[magnetization]], whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the [[Curie point]]. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions. Some phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.

There also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as [[Quantum vortex|vortex]]- or [[Topological defect|defect]] lines.

===Relevance in cosmology===
Symmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. It has been speculated by Lee Smolin and [[Jeremy Bernstein]] that, in the [[Big Bang|hot early universe]], the vacuum (i.e. the various [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]] that fill space) possessed a large number of symmetries. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the [[electroweak force|electroweak field]] into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day [[electromagnetic field]]. This transition is important to understanding the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe (see [[Baryogenesis#Baryogenesis within the Standard Model|electroweak baryogenesis]].)

Progressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of [[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, ''Cosmic Evolution'', Harvard, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and David Layzer.&lt;ref&gt;David Layzer, ''Cosmogenesis, The Development of Order in the Universe'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Relational order theories]].

===Critical exponents and universality classes===
{{main|critical exponent}}
Continuous phase transitions are easier to study than first-order transitions due to the absence of [[latent heat]], and they have been discovered to have many interesting properties. The phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions are called critical phenomena, due to their association with critical points.

It turns out that continuous phase transitions can be characterized by parameters known as [[critical exponent]]s. The most important one is perhaps the exponent describing the divergence of the thermal [[correlation length]] by approaching the transition. For instance, let us examine the behavior of the [[heat capacity]] near such a transition. We vary the temperature {{mvar|T}} of the system while keeping all the other thermodynamic variables fixed, and find that the transition occurs at some critical temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' . When {{mvar|T}}  is near ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' , the heat capacity {{mvar|C}} typically has a [[power law]] behavior,
:&lt;math&gt; C \propto |T_c - T|^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat capacity of amorphous materials has such a behaviour near the glass transition temperature where the universal critical exponent α = 0.59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1958/1/ojovanmi1_Topologically2.pdf |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/50/007|bibcode = 2006JPCM...1811507O |title=Topologically disordered systems at the glass transition|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=18|issue=50|pages=11507–11520|year=2006|last1=Ojovan|first1=Michael I|last2=Lee|first2=William E}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar behavior, but with the exponent {{mvar|ν}} instead of {{mvar|α}}, applies for the correlation length.

The exponent {{mvar|ν}} is positive. This is different with {{mvar|α}}. Its actual value depends on the type of phase transition we are considering.

It is widely believed  that the critical exponents are the same above and below the critical temperature. It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then some exponents (such as &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, the exponent of the susceptibility) are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=F.|last2=Delamotte|first2=B.|year = 2015|title=Critical exponents can be different on the two sides of a transition| url = | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 115 | issue = 20| page = 200601 | arxiv = 1508.07852|bibcode = 2015PhRvL.115t0601L| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.200601 |pmid=26613426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For −1 &amp;lt; α &amp;lt; 0, the heat capacity has a "kink" at the transition temperature. This is the behavior of liquid helium at the [[lambda transition]] from a normal state to the [[superfluid]] state, for which experiments have found {{mvar|α}} = -0.013±0.003.
At least one experiment was performed in the zero-gravity conditions of an orbiting satellite to minimize pressure differences in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.174518 | title=Specific heat of liquid helium in zero gravity very near the lambda point | year=2003 | last1=Lipa | first1=J. | last2=Nissen | first2=J. | last3=Stricker | first3=D. | last4=Swanson | first4=D. | last5=Chui | first5=T. | journal=Physical Review B | volume=68 | issue=17| pages=174518 |arxiv = cond-mat/0310163 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68q4518L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experimental value of α agrees with theoretical predictions based on [[variational perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.60.085001 | title=Critical exponents from seven-loop strong-coupling φ4 theory in three dimensions | year=1999 | last1=Kleinert | first1=Hagen | journal=Physical Review D | volume=60 | issue=8| pages=085001 |arxiv = hep-th/9812197 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h5001K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 0 &amp;lt; {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the heat capacity diverges at the transition temperature (though, since {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the enthalpy stays finite). An example of such behavior is the 3D ferromagnetic phase transition. In the three-dimensional [[Ising model]] for uniaxial magnets, detailed theoretical studies have yielded the exponent {{mvar|α}} ∼ +0.110.

Some model systems do not obey a power-law behavior. For example, mean field theory predicts a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity at the transition temperature, and the two-dimensional Ising model has a [[logarithm]]ic divergence. However, these systems are limiting cases and an exception to the rule. Real phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior.

Several other critical exponents, {{math| ''β, γ, δ, ν''}}, and {{mvar|η}}, are defined, examining the power law behavior of a measurable physical quantity near the phase transition. Exponents are related by scaling relations, such as
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\gamma/(\delta-1) , \qquad \nu=\gamma/(2-\eta)&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be shown that there are only two independent exponents, e.g. {{mvar|ν}} and {{mvar|η}}.

It is a remarkable fact that phase transitions arising in different systems often possess the same set of critical exponents. This phenomenon is known as ''universality''. For example, the critical exponents at the liquid–gas critical point have been found to be independent of the chemical composition of the fluid.

More impressively, but understandably from above, they are an exact match for the critical exponents of the ferromagnetic phase transition in uniaxial magnets. Such systems are said to be in the same universality class. Universality is a prediction of the [[renormalization group]] theory of phase transitions, which states that the thermodynamic properties of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of features, such as dimensionality and symmetry, and are insensitive to the underlying microscopic properties of the system. Again, the divergence of the correlation length is the essential point.

===Critical slowing down and other phenomena===
There are also other critical phenomena; e.g., besides ''static functions'' there is also ''critical dynamics''. As a consequence, at a phase transition one may observe critical slowing down or ''speeding up''. The large ''static universality classes'' of a continuous phase transition split into smaller ''dynamic universality'' classes. In addition to the critical exponents, there are also universal relations for certain static or dynamic functions of the magnetic fields and temperature differences from the critical value.

===Percolation theory===
Another phenomenon which shows phase transitions and critical exponents is [[percolation theory|percolation]]. The simplest example is perhaps percolation in a two dimensional square lattice. Sites are randomly occupied with probability p. For small values of p the occupied sites form only small clusters. At a certain threshold p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; a giant cluster is formed and we have a second-order phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fractals and Disordered Systems|author= Armin Bunde and [[Shlomo Havlin]] |year= 1996|publisher= Springer|url= http://havlin.biu.ac.il/Shlomo%20Havlin%20books_fds.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; near p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is, P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;~(p-p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;, where β is a critical exponent.

===Phase transitions in biological systems===
Phase transitions play many important roles in biological systems. Examples include the [[lipid bilayer]] formation, the [[Coil–globule transition|coil-globule transition]] in the process of [[protein folding]] and [[DNA melting]], liquid crystal-like transitions in the process of [[DNA condensation]], and cooperative ligand binding to DNA and proteins with the character of phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/07391102.2000.10506578 | pmid=10798534 | title=Long-range interactions between ligands bound to a DNA molecule give rise to adsorption with the character of phase transition of the first kind | year=2000| author = D.Y.

In ''biological membranes'', gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play a critical role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R.C. | year = 1987 | title = 13-C NMR studies of lipid fatty acyl chains of chloroplast membranes | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230822408 | journal = Indian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 177–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, flouorescence, [[spin label]] [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] and [[NMR]] by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures. A simple method for its determination from 13-C NMR line intensities has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R C | year = 1990 | title = Determination of membrane lipid phase transition temperature from 13-C NMR intensities | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20790042 | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 353–356 | pmid = 2365951 |doi=10.1016/0165-022X(90)90097-V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that some biological systems might lie near critical points.

In groups of organisms in stress (when approaching critical transitions), correlations tend to increase, while at the same time, fluctuations also increase. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of people, mice, trees, and grassy plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political egalitarianism''' is where members of a society are of equal standing in terms of political power or influence.&lt;ref&gt; https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/ &lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding principle of various forms of [[democracy]]. It was an idea which was supported by Thomas Jefferson.

It is a concept similar to [[moral reciprocity]] and [[legal equality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">The '''postcautionary principle''' is a principle of ''de facto'' environmental management formulated by [[John Paull]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John, [http://orgprints.org/11042/  Certified Organic Forests &amp; Timber: the Hippocratic Opportunity], Proceedings ANZSEE Conference 2007, 1-14,  2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the postcautionary principle, as the antithesis of the [[precautionary principle]], has guided environmental management, as it is actually practised. 

Taking the Rio 1982 formulation of the '''pre'''cautionary principle as a guide, the '''post'''cautionary principle has been stated as follows: 
''"Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty shall be used as a reason for not implementing cost-effective measures until after the environmental degradation has actually occurred"'' [http://orgprints.org/11042]. 

Examples of this principle include: the extinction of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), which was, after decades of government bounty hunting (starting in 1888), declared a protected species on 10 July 1936 by the Fauna Board of [[Tasmania]], only weeks before the last one died in captivity (on 7 September 1936); the 2003 Forestry Tasmania burning of Tasmania's largest tree ''El Grande'',&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3306655.stm  Forestry officials admit killing biggest tree], BBC News, 10 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; a tree protected under legislation, and its subsequent demise, after which "new standard operating procedures" were implemented;&lt;ref&gt;FPB, 2004, Derwent 02-03, Forest Practices Board, Hobart, Tasmania, 13  January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and seven months after [[Malaysia Airlines]] flight [[MH370]] disappeared without trace, the airline introduced a monitoring system where the onboard communication system will issue an electronic ping every few minutes&lt;ref&gt;Creedy, Steve, 2014, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/more-pings-to-locate-malaysian-planes/story-e6frg95x-1227107689500  More pings to locate Malaysian planes], The Australian, 31 October.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychoanalysis]], the '''primal scene''' ({{lang-de|Urszene}}) is the initial witnessing by a child of a [[Human sexual behavior|sex act]], usually between the parents, that [[Psychological trauma|traumatizes]] the [[psychosexual development]] of that child. The scene witnessed may also occur between animals, and be [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] onto humans.

The expression "primal scene" refers to the sight of sexual relations between the parents, as observed, constructed, or fantasized by the child and interpreted by the child as a scene of violence. The scene is not understood by the child, remaining enigmatic but at the same time provoking sexual excitement.

==Freud's views==

===Evolution===
The term appeared for the first time in Freud's published work apropos of the "[[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]" case (1918b [1914]), but the notion of a sexual memory experienced too early to have been translated into verbal images, and thus liable to return in the form of conversion symptoms or obsessions, was part of his thinking as early as 1896 [as witnessed in his letter of May 30 of that year to [[Wilhelm Fliess]], where he evokes a "surplus of sexuality" that "impedes translation" (1950a, pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230)]. Here Freud is already close to the model of the trauma and its "[[Afterwardsness|deferred]]" effect. The following year, in his letter to Fliess of May 2, Freud uses the actual term ''Urszene'' for the first time;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 270n&lt;/ref&gt; and gives the approximate age when in his estimation children were liable to "hear things" that they would understand only "subsequently" as six or seven months (SE 1, p.&amp;nbsp;247). The subject of the child's witnessing parental coitus came up as well, albeit in an older child, with the case of "Katharina," in the ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (1895d), and Freud evoked it yet again in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', with the fantasy of the young man who dreamed of watching his parents copulating during his life in the womb (1900a [addition of 1909], pp.&amp;nbsp;399–400).

===Fantasy or reality?===
Freud persistently strove to decide whether the primal scene was a fantasy or something actually witnessed; above all, he placed increasing emphasis on the child's own fantasy interpretation of the scene as violence visited upon the mother by the father. He went so far, in "On the Sexual Theories of Children" (1908c, p.&amp;nbsp;221), as to find a measure of justification for what he called the "sadistic concept of coitus",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that, though the child may exaggerate, the perception of a real repugnance towards sexual intercourse on the part of a mother fearful of another pregnancy may be quite accurate. In the case of "[[Little Hans]]," however, the violence was explained in terms of a prohibition: Hans deemed it analogous to "smashing a window-pane or forcing a way into an enclosed space" (1909b, p.&amp;nbsp;41).

The case history of the Wolf Man gave Freud the opportunity not only to pursue the issue of the reality of the primal scene, but also to propose the idea that it lay at the root of childhood (and later adult) neurosis: the sexual development of the child was "positively splintered up by it" (1918b [1914), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).  In his ''[[Introduction to Psychoanalysis|Introductory Lectures]]'', however, he argued for the universality of the fantasy of the primal scene (like the sexual theories of children): it may be encountered in all neurotics, if not in every human being (Freud, 1915f), and it belongs in the category of "primal" fantasies. It appears, however, not to have the same force for all individuals.  Freud would later assign a central place to the primal scene in his analysis of [[Marie Bonaparte]], although in her case the scene took place between her nanny and a groom (Bonaparte, 1950–53).

Looked upon as an actual event rather than as a pure fantasy reconstructed in a retrospective way (as with [[Carl Jung]]'s ''zurückphantasieren''), the primal scene had a much more marked traumatic impact, and this led Freud to insist on the "reality" of such scenes, thus returning to the debate over event-driven (or "historical") reality versus psychic reality. Beyond the issue of the scene itself, however, it was the whole subject of fantasy that was thus raised (in chapter five of the Wolf Man case-history [1918b, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–60]), discussed in terms that would be picked up by Freud again later in ''Constructions in Analysis'' (1937d).

It was not merely, in Freud's view, that the technique of psychoanalysis demanded that fantasies be treated as realities so as to give their evocation all the force they needed, but also that many "real" scenes were not accessible by way of recollection, but solely by way of dreams. Whether a scene was constructed out of elements observed elsewhere and in a different context (for example, animal coitus transposed to the parents); reconstituted on the basis of clues (such as bloodstained sheets); or indeed observed directly, but at an age when the child still had not the corresponding verbal images at its disposal; did not fundamentally alter the basic facts of the matter: "I intend on this occasion," wrote Freud, "to close the discussion of the reality of the primal scene with a non liquet" (1918b, p.&amp;nbsp;60).

==Kleinian interpretations==

[[Melanie Klein]]'s view of the primal scene differed from Freud's, for where Freud saw an enigmatic perception of violence, she saw the child's projective fantasies. Klein considered that a child's curiosity was first provoked by the primal scene, and that typically the child felt both excited and excluded by the primal scene.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual relationship between the parents, fantasized as continuous, is also the basis of the "combined-parent figure",&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; mother and father seen as locked in mutual (but excluding) gratification.

Where Klein laid emphasis on the way the infant projected hostile and destructive tendencies onto the primal scene, with the mother pictured therein as just as dangerous for the father as the father is for her, later Kleinians like [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)|John Steiner]] have stressed the creative aspect of the primal scene; and the necessity in analysis of overcoming a [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of its image between a loving couple on the one hand, and a combined parent figure locked in hate.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 141 and p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==

The primal scene is inseparable from the sexual theories of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness the libidinal excitement the child feels in response. [[Otto Fenichel]] has stressed the traumatic nature of the excess excitement felt by the child, which they are unable to process — what he called the "overwhelming unknown".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 214-5 and p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularity of the primal scene lies in the fact that the subject experiences in a simultaneous and contradictory way the emergence of the unknown within a familiar world, to which they are bound by vital needs, by expectations of pleasure, and by the self-image that it reflects back to them. The lack of common measure between the child's emotional and psychosexual experience and the words that could give an account of the primal scene creates a gulf that the sexual theories of childhood attempt to bridge. A sadistic reading of the scene combines the child's curiosity about both the origin and the end of life in a representation in which death and life are indeed fused.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Intertextual readings==
Ned Lukacher has proposed using the term in literary criticism to refer to a kind of intertextuality in which the ability to interpret one text depends on the meaning of another text. It is "the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Lukacher, ''Primal Scenes'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Spkk4Rlmo7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:primal+intitle:scenes&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA24,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
*[[Maynard Solomon]] interprets four recorded dreams of [[Beethoven]] as all being centered on the primal scene, with the composer either as participant or as impotent by-stander.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (1988) p. 65 and p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prisoner abuse''' is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated, therefore deprived of the [[right of self-defense]] against acting authorities and generally defenseless in actual fact.

Abuse falling into this category includes:
* [[Physical abuse]]: Illicit beating and hitting, unlawful [[corporal punishment]], [[stress position]]s, excessive or prolonged [[physical restraints|physical restraining]], etc.
* [[Psychological abuse]]: [[Verbal abuse]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[white noise]], pointless/absurd or [[humiliation|humiliating]] instructions, recurrent exhaustive [[inspection]]s and [[Police raid|shakedowns]], arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, exposure, etc.
* [[Sexual abuse]]: Excessive [[body cavity search|vaginal or rectal contraband searches]] or other internal checks, forced [[sexual intercourse]], forced insertion of objects into vagina or rectum, arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, etc. (Sexual abuse is thematically widely overlapping with psychological abuse.)
* [[Enhanced interrogation]]: methods implemented in the [[War on Terror]] purportedly needed to extract information from detainees.
* [[Torture]]: any act, whether physical or psychological, which is deliberately done to inflict excruciating and agonizing pain upon a person under the actor's custody or physical control for any reason such as extracting information or punishment.
* Other abuse: Refusal of essential medication, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Prisoner Abuse Law &amp; Legal Definition. ''USLegal''. Retrieved from http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prisoner-abuse/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological abuse ==
===White noise===
The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation.

===Verbal abuse===
Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities.  Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.

===Enablement of sexual violence===
Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of [[prison rape in the United States|rape in US prisons]], which was the topic of the 2001 report No Escape from Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/|title=No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons|author=|date=|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 -- Redefining Gender Violence -- Transcripts from Converge!

It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner.

The most prominent explanation in present literature draws upon "Intemporal discounting, task averseness and certain personality traits such as indecisiveness and distractibility" as the common causes of procrastination.

A study of behavioural patterns of pigeons through delayed reward suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans, but can also be observed in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=James|date=1998|title=Procrastination by Pigeons with Fixed-Interval Response Requirements|journal=Experimental Analysis Behav|volume=69|pages=|via=|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284653/pdf/9540230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Latin: ''procrastinare'', ''pro-'', 'forward', with ''-crastinus'', 'till next day' from "''cras''", 'tomorrow'

== Prevalence ==
In a study of academic procrastination from the [[University of Vermont]], published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they "always" or "nearly always" procrastinate writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"&gt;{{cite web |author= Solomon, LJ |author2=Rothblum |url= http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|date=1984|title=Academic Procrastination: Frequency and Cognitive-Behavioural Correlates|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729211829/http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study showed that "52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=Robert P. |last2=Golin |first2=Anne |last3=Kelleher |first3=Kathleen |journal=Journal of College Student Development |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=301–10|date=1992 |title=The Personal, Career, and Learning Skills Needs of College Students|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-03494-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 80–95% of college students engage in procrastination, and approximately 75% consider themselves procrastinators.

In a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater on tasks that were perceived as [[unpleasant]] or as impositions than on tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norman A. Milgram |author2=Barry Sroloff |author3=Michael Rosenbaum |title=The Procrastination of Everyday Life|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=22|number=2|date=June 1988|pages=197–212|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral criteria of academic procrastination ==
Gregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.1.12 |title=Doing the Things We Do: A Grounded Theory of Academic Procrastination |year=2007 |last1=Schraw |first1=Gregory |last2=Wadkins |first2=Theresa |last3=Olafson |first3=Lori |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=99 |pages=12–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is "to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay."&lt;ref name="Steel2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65 |url=http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |title=The Nature of Procrastination: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self-Regulatory Failure |year=2007 |last1=Steel |first1=Piers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |pages=65–94 |pmid=17201571 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401132716/http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabini &amp; Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay.

An approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the [[temporal motivation theory]]. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

== Psychological perspective==
The [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pychyl, T.|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012|title=The real reasons you procrastinate — and how to stop|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/why-you-cant-help-read-this-article-about-procrastination-instead-of-doing-your-job/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[psychologist]]s cite such behavior as a [[coping mechanism|mechanism for coping]] with the [[anxiety]] associated with starting or completing any task or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Penguin Group| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5| last = Fiore| first = Neil A| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be [[impulsiveness]]. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.&lt;ref name=Steel2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Steel |first=Piers |title=The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done |year=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-170361-4}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping responses ===
Negative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and [[cognitive dissonance]]) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00127.x |title=Self-Deception As Pretense |year=2007 |last1=Gendler |first1=Tamar Szabó |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=21 |pages=231–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosling|first=J.|title=Weakness of the Will|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian [[defense mechanisms]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping styles]] and [[self-handicapping]].  
 
Coping responses of procrastinators include the following.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

*[[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]]: Avoiding the location or situation where the task takes place (e.g. a graduate student avoiding driving into the university).
*[[Denial]] and [[trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]]: Pretending that procrastinatory behavior is not actually procrastinating, but rather a task which is more important than the avoided one, or that the essential task that should be done is not of immediate importance.
*[[Distraction]]: Engaging or immersing in other behaviors or actions to prevent awareness of the task (e.g. [[Cyberslacking|intensive video game playing or web browsing]]). The subject is very sensitive to instant gratification and becomes absorbed in coping behaviors beyond self-restraint.
* Descending [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactuality]]: Comparing consequences of one's procrastinatory behavior with others' worse situations (e.g. "Yes, I procrastinated and got a B− in the course, but I didn't fail like one other student did.")
*Valorisation: Pointing in satisfaction to what one achieved in the meantime while one should have been doing something else.
* Blaming: Delusional attributions to external factors, such as rationalizing that the procrastination is due to external forces beyond one's control (e.g. "I'm not procrastinating, but this assignment is tough.")
* Mocking: Using [[humor]] to validate one's procrastination. The person uses [[slapstick]] or slipshod methods to criticize and ridicule others' striving towards the goal.

Task- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator's outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one's behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.

In 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.010 |title=A Closer Look at the Relationships Among Trait Procrastination, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness |year=2006 |last1=Lee |first1=Dong-gwi |last2=Kelly |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Edwards |first3=Jodie K. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=40 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. "Putting things off even until the last moment isn't procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment".&lt;ref name="Sabini &amp; Silver."&gt;Sabini, J. &amp; Silver, M. (1982) Moralities of everyday life, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Steel ''et al.'' explained in 2001, "actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning".&lt;ref name="Steel2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steel | first1 = P. | last2 = Brothen | first2 = T. | last3 = Wambach | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Procrastination and Personality, Performance and Mood | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000131 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 30| issue = | pages = 95–106| doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health perspective ==
To a certain degree it is [[normality (behavior)|normal]] to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlina|first=Steve|title=How to Fall in Love with Procrastination|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055057/http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, [[stress (medicine)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Tice1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tice | first1 = DM | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = RF | year = 1997 | title = Longitudinal Study of Procrastination, Performance, Stress, and Health: The Costs and Benefits of Dawdling | jstor = 40063233 | journal = Psychological Science| volume = 8| issue = 6| page = | pages=454–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00460.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.461.1149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anxiety]], sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[crisis]] as well as loss of personal [[productivity]] and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost [[chronic condition|chronic]]. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also [[social stigma]] and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of [[Self discipline|willpower]] or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying [[mental illness|psychological disorder]], but not necessarily.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

Research on the [[physiological]] roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="Evans2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James R.|title=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-3360-4|page=293|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601195833/http://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|archivedate=1 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area of the brain that is responsible for [[executive functions|executive brain functions]] such as [[impulse control]], [[attention]] and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a [[Executive dysfunction|lack thereof]]. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one's ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in [[ADHD|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], where it is commonly underactivated.&lt;ref name="strub"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2775008 |year=1989 |last1=Strub |first1=RL |title=Frontal Lobe Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Globus Pallidus Lesions |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1024–27 |journal=Archives of Neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520450096027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in [[twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal-]] and [[twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] pairs, both traits were found to be "moderately heritable". The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (r&lt;sub&gt;genetic&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found.&lt;ref name="gustav"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustavson|first=Daniel E|author2=Miyake A|author3=Hewitt JK|author4=Friedman NP|title=Genetic Relations Among Procrastination, Impulsivity, and Goal-Management Ability Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Procrastination|journal=Psychological Science|date=4 April 2014|volume=25|doi= 10.1177/0956797614526260|pmid=24705635|issue=6|pages=1178–88|pmc=4185275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: "(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation."&lt;ref name="gustav" /&gt;

== Management ==
[[Psychologist]] William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis and Knaus, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education (college dropouts).

Perfectionism is a prime cause for procrastination&lt;ref&gt;Hillary Rettig (2011). ''The 7 Secrets of the Prolific: The Definitive Guide to Overcoming Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Writer's Block''&lt;/ref&gt; because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy [[self-esteem]] and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning,&lt;ref&gt;James Prochaska, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Principles of ACT|date=October 2015}} to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.

Behaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:{{citation needed|reason=post the paraphrased guideline/Rx protocol|date=October 2015}}

* Awareness of habits and thoughts that lead to procrastinating.
* Seeking help for self-defeating problems such as fear, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, poor time management, indecisiveness, and perfectionism.
* Fair evaluation of personal goals, strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.
* Realistic goals and personal positive links between the tasks and the concrete, meaningful goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese Hoff|date=1994|title=Time management: Test of a process model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=79|issue=3|pages=381–391|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.3.381|issn=0021-9010|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.4283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structuring and organization of daily activities. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Modification of one's environment for that newly gained perspective: the elimination or minimization of noise or distraction; investing effort into relevant matters; and ceasing day-dreaming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disciplining oneself to set priorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Motivation with enjoyable activities, socializing and constructive hobbies.
* Approaching issues in small blocks of time, instead of attempting whole problems at once and risking intimidation.
* To prevent relapse, reinforce pre-set goals based on needs and allow yourself to be rewarded in a balanced way for accomplished tasks.
 
Making a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.&lt;ref&gt;Burka &amp; Yuen (1990). ''Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It''&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers Steel suggests&lt;ref&gt;The Procrastination Equation, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that better [[time management]] is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one's "power hours" (being a "morning person" or "night owl"). A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal [[circadian rhythms]] that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the "small successes". Brian O'Leary supports that "finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive", suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one's efficiency at handling tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/work-life-is-productivity-in-the-balance|title=Work-Life: Is Productivity in the Balance?|date=2004-07-05|work=HBS Working Knowledge|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] authored an essay entitled "Structured Procrastination",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he proposes a "cheat" method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a [[pyramid scheme]] to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with a mental note that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.

== Severe and negative impact ==
For some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], irrational behaviour, low [[self-esteem]], [[anxiety]] and neurological disorders such as [[ADHD]]. Others have found relationships with [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Pychyl2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pychyl | first1 = TA | last2 = Lee | first2 = JM | last3 = Thibodeau | first3 = R | last4 = Blunt | first4 = A | year = 2000 | title = Five Days of Emotion: An Experience Sampling Study of Undergraduate Student Procrastination (special issue) | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2002-10572-019 | journal = Journal of Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 239–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress.&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained [[psychotherapy|therapist]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schouwenburg|first=H.C.|year=1993|title=Trait procrastination, time management, and academic behavior|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21344492853&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=8922AD549640D5B2BACA406E901F44B5.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1|journal=Trait Procrastination, Time Management, and Academic Behavior|volume=8|pages=647–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits,&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.

== Correlates ==
Procrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[Behavior|behavioral]] relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and [[anxiety]] to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Solomon1984" /&gt; A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.&lt;ref name="Jackson2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = T. | last2 = Fritch | first2 = A. | last3 = Nagasaka | first3 = T. | last4 = Pope | first4 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Procrastination and Perceptions of Past, Present, and Future | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2004-15383-003 | journal = Individual Differences Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 17–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between procrastination and [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|eveningness]] was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate{{Fact|date=August 2018}}. It has been shown that [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|Morningness]] increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;,&lt;ref name="Duffy2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = JF | last2 = Czeisler | first2 = CA | year = 2002 | title = Age-Related Change in the Relationship Between Circadian Period, Circadian Phase, and Diurnal Preference in Humans | url =https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394001024272 | journal = | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Perfectionism ===
{{Main|Perfectionism (psychology)}}
Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and "[[workaholic|workaholism]]". However, adaptive perfectionists—[[egosyntonic]] perfectionism—were ''less'' likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—[[egodystonic]] perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.&lt;ref name="McGarvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|title=The Almost Perfect Definition|author=McGarvey, Jason A.|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313153133/http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with "the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling".&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

=== Academic ===
According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient [[time management]] skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odaci|first1=Hatice|title=Academic Self-Efficacy and Academic Procrastination as Predictors of Problematic Internet Use in University Students|date=August 1, 2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=5624d9855cd9e38cd78b456e&amp;assetKey=AS%3A286236704034819%401445255556988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Student syndrome]]" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task [[duration (project management)|duration]] [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]]. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.&lt;ref&gt;

In one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt;

Other reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |title=Procrastination |publisher=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill |website=writingcenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318150005/http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckman1991"&gt;Tuckman, BW (1991). The Development and Concurrent Validity of the Procrastination Scale [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1991-32090-001]&lt;/ref&gt; were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.&lt;ref name="Howell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = AJ | last2 = Watson | first2 = DC | last3 = Powell | first3 = RA | last4 = Buro | first4 = K | year = 2006 | title = Academic Procrastination: The Pattern and Correlates of Behavioral Postponement | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000055 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 40| issue = 8| pages = 1519–30| doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]]'' intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis &amp; Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsin Chun Chu|first=Angela|last2=Nam Choi|first2=Jin|title=Rethinking Procrastination: Positive Effects of "Active" Procrastination Behavior on Attitudes and Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=145|issue=3|pages=245–64|doi=10.3200/socp.145.3.245-264|pmid=15959999|year=2005|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.2444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s "irrational" and "postponement" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt; During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed."

Procrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201307/getting-around-procrastination|title=Getting Around to Procrastination|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = 40| issue = 6| pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">In [[mathematics]], '''R-algebroids''' are constructed starting from [[groupoid]]s. These are more abstract concepts than the [[Lie algebroid]]s that play a similar role in the theory of [[Lie groupoid]]s to that of [[Lie algebra]]s in the theory of [[Lie group]]s. (Thus, a Lie algebroid can be thought of as 'a ''[[Lie algebra]] with [[categorification|many objects]]'' ').

==Definition==
An '''R-algebroid''', &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt;, is constructed from a groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; as follows. The object set of &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that of &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Free module|free]] [[R-module]] on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt;, with composition given by the usual bilinear rule, extending the composition of &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Mosa: ''Higher dimensional algebroids and Crossed complexes'', PhD Thesis, University of Wales, Bangor, (1986). (supervised by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==R-category==
A groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with invertible morphisms.
Than an '''R-category''' is defined as an extension of the '''R'''-algebroid concept by replacing the groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; in this construction with a general category '''C''' that does not have all morphisms invertible.

==R-algebroids ''via'' convolution products==
One can also define the '''R-algebroid''', &lt;math&gt;{\bar R}\mathsf{G}:=R\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt;, to be the '''set of functions''' &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}(b,c){\longrightarrow}R&lt;/math&gt; '''with [[finite support]]''', and with the '''[[convolution]] product''' defined as follows:
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (f*g)(z)= \sum \{(fx)(gy)\mid z=x\circ y \}&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown and G. H. Mosa. ''Double algebroids and crossed modules of algebroids'', University of Wales-Bangor, Maths ''Preprint'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only this second construction is natural for the topological case, when one needs to replace '[[Function (mathematics)|function]]' by '[[continuous function]] with [[compact support]]', and in this case &lt;math&gt;R\cong \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

*The Lie algebroid associated to a [[Lie groupoid]].

In [[computer science]], a '''randomization function''' or '''randomizing function''' is an [[algorithm]] or [[Subroutine|procedure]] that implements a [[random]]ly chosen [[function (mathematics)|function]] between two specific [[set (mathematics)|set]]s, suitable for use in a [[randomized algorithm]].

Randomizing functions are related to [[random number generator]]s and [[hash function]]s, but have somewhat different requirements and uses, and often need specific algorithms.

==Uses==

Randomizing functions are used to turn algorithms that have good [[expected value|expected]] performance for ''random'' inputs, into algorithms that have the same performance for ''any'' input.

For example, consider a [[sorting algorithm]] like [[quicksort]], which has small expected running time when the input items are presented in random order, but is very slow when they are presented in certain unfavorable orders. A randomizing function from the integers 1 to ''n'' to the integers 1 to ''n'' can be used to rerrange the ''n'' input items in "random" order, before calling that algorithm.  This modified (randomized) algorithm will have small expected running time, whatever the input order.

==Requirements==

===Randomness===
In theory, randomization functions are assumed to be truly random, and yield an unpredictably different function every time the algorithm is executed.  The randomization technique would not work if, at every execution of the algorithm, the randomization function always performed the same mapping, or a mapping entirely determined by some externally observable parameter (such as the program's startup time).  With such a "pseudo-randomization" function, one could in principle construct a sequence of calls such that the function would always yield a "bad" case for the underlying deterministic algorithm.  For that sequence of calls, the average cost would be closer to the worst-case cost, rather than the average cost for random inputs.

In practice, however, the main concern is that some "bad" cases for the deterministic algorithm may occur in practice much more often than it would be predicted by chance.  For example, in a naive variant of quicksort, the worst case is when the input items are already sorted — which is a very common occurrence in many applications.  For such algorithms, even a fixed pseudo-random permutation may be good enough.  Even though the resulting "pseudo-randomized" algorithm would still have as many "bad" cases as the original, they will be certain peculiar orders that would be quite unlikely to arise in real applications.  So, in practice one often uses randomization functions that are derived from [[pseudo-random number generator]]s, preferably [[random seed|seeded]] with external "random" data such as the program's startup time.

===Uniformity===
The uniformity requirements for a randomizing function are usually much weaker than those of hash functions and pseudo-random generators.  The minimum requirement is that it maps any input of the deterministic algorithm into a "good" input with a sufficiently high probability.  (However, analysis is usually simpler if the randomizing function implements each possible mapping with uniform probability.)

'''Sanguino3 G-Code''' is the protocol by which 3rd-generation [[RepRap Project]] electronics communicate with their host machine, as well as the protocol by which the RepRap host communicates with its subsystems.&lt;ref name="protocol spec" /&gt; It can also be written in a binary format to storage for later replay, usually in a file with a ".s3g" extension.&lt;ref name="replicat" /&gt;

The protocol is intended as a simplification of [[G-code]], to ease processing by the somewhat limited CPU of the Sanguino, an [[Arduino]]-based controller.

A formal language is identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]

In [[logic]], '''syntax''' is anything having to do with [[formal language]]s or [[formal system]]s without regard to any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]], [[well-formed formula|formulas]], [[formal system|system]]s, [[theorem]]s, [[formal proof|proofs]], and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.

Syntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal system.

In [[computer science]], the term ''[[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]'' refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] in a [[programming language]]. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.

== Syntactic entities ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A symbol is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[Type-token distinction|tokens]] of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are [[logical constant]]s which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.

=== Formal language ===
{{Main|Formal language}}

A ''formal language'' is a syntactic entity which consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s which are its words (usually called its [[well-formed formula]]s). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of [[formation rule]]s. Such a language can be defined without [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning.

=== Formation rules ===
{{main|Formation rule}}

''Formation rules'' are a precise description of which [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s are the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [[String (computer science)|strings]] over the [[alphabet]] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e. what they mean).

=== Propositions ===
{{main|Proposition}}

A '''proposition''' is a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] expressing something [[truth|true]] or [[falsity|false]]. A proposition is identified [[ontology|ontologically]] as an [[idea]], [[concept]] or [[abstraction]] whose [[type-token distinction|token instances]] are patterns of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]], marks, sounds, or [[string (computer science)|strings]] of words.&lt;ref&gt;Metalogic, [[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]]&lt;/ref&gt; Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also [[truthbearer]]s.

=== Formal theories ===
{{main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A '''formal theory''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

=== Formal systems ===
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).

==== Syntactic consequence within a formal system ====

A formula A is a '''syntactic consequence'''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Frege: Philosophy of Language|author=Dummett, M.|date=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674319318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYP7uCZIRQYC|page=82|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle and Logical Theory|author=Lear, J.|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521311786|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXI7AAAAIAAJ|page=1|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Carnap|author1=Creath, R.|author2=Friedman, M.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521840156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87BcFLgJmxMC|page=189|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uniba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+consequence|title=syntactic consequence from FOLDOC|publisher=swif.uniba.it|accessdate=2014-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403201417/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+consequence|archivedate=2013-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within some formal system &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; of a set Г of formulas if there is a [[Formal proof|derivation]] in [[formal system]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; of A from the set Г.

==== Syntactic completeness of a formal system ====
{{Main|Completeness (logic)}}

A formal system &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is ''syntactically complete''&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jigpal.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/5/513.pdf|title=A Note on Interaction and Incompleteness|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=504575|title=Normal forms and syntactic completeness proofs for functional independencies|publisher=portal.acm.org|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Mathematical Logic|author=Barwise, J.|authorlink=Jon Barwise|date=1982|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080933641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0Fvrw9tBcMC|page=236|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uniba2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+completeness|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502223539/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+completeness|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2001-05-02|title=syntactic completeness from FOLDOC|publisher=swif.uniba.it|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also ''deductively complete'', ''maximally complete'', ''negation complete'' or simply ''complete'') iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or ¬A is a theorem of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an [[consistency|inconsistency]]. Truth-functional [[propositional logic]] and first-order [[predicate logic]] are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable "a" is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]). [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no [[recursive system]] that is sufficiently powerful, such as the [[Peano axioms]], can be both consistent and complete.

=== Interpretations ===
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)|Interpretation (logic)}}

An ''interpretation'' of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and [[truth value]]s to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. ''Giving an interpretation'' is synonymous with ''constructing a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|model]]''. An interpretation is expressed in a [[metalanguage]], which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.

The '''ten realms''', sometimes referred to as the ''ten worlds'',&lt;ref&gt;Junjirō Takakusu: The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy, Motilal Barnasidass, Dehli 1998, pp. 143-145.  {{ISBN|81-208-1592-0}} (Ten realms in Tiantai/Tendai)&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the  belief of some forms of [[Buddhism]] that there are ten conditions of life which sentient beings are subject to, and which they experience from moment to moment. The popularization of this term is often attributed to the Chinese scholar [[Zhiyi|Chih-i]] who spoke about the "co-penetration of the ten worlds."&lt;ref name="LaFleur 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaFleur|first1=William R.|title=The karma of words : Buddhism and the literary arts in medieval Japan|date=1983|publisher=Univ. of Calif. Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520046009|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ten Realms==
The ten realms are part of [[Buddhist cosmology]] and consist of four higher realms and six lower realms  derived from the Indian concept of [[Bhavacakra#Third_layer:_the_six_realms_of_samsara|the six realms of rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lopez|first1=Donald S.|title=The "Lotus Sūtra": A Biography Lives of Great Religious Books|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400883349|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTL9CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22ten+realms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgwqLEpazXAhXFeCYKHXmJDFsQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20realms%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These realms can also be described through the degrees of enlightenment that course through them.&lt;ref name="Arai 1893"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arai|first1=Nissatsu|title=Outlines of the Doctrine of the Nichiren Sect, Submitted to the Parliament of the World's Religions|date=1893|publisher=Central Office of the Nichiren Sect|location=Tokyo, Japan|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WE0uAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdid=book-WE0uAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdot=1|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been translated in various ways.  They are divided into the Six Realms (六道), followed by higher states of enlightened consciousness that lead to final Buddhahood. The Six Realms are: [[Naraka_(Buddhism)|Hell]] (地獄道), the Hungry Ghosts or [[preta]]s (餓鬼道), the [[Animals_in_Buddhism|Beasts]] (畜生道), the Titans or [[Asura_(Buddhism)|Asuras]] (修羅道), Humans (人道) and lastly Heaven, or the realm of the gods (天道). Above these lie the four holy states: the [[Śrāvaka]] (声聞), the [[Pratyekabuddha]] (縁覚), the [[bodhisattva]] (菩薩) and finally completely enlightened [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref name="Japan Library"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=Collected writings of Carmen Blacker|date=2000|publisher=Japan Library|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=9781873410929|pages=186–199|edition=Transferred to digital printing.|chapter=16: Initiation in the Shugendo: The passage through the ten states of existence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some systems of cosmology these states are perceived as distinct realms in which the inhabitant has to experience various forms of suffering in order to expiate karma.  In [[Shugendō|Japanese syncretic practices]] the ten realms are seen as distinct trials of discipline a practitioner must encounter or overcome in order to reach a material or spiritual goal.&lt;ref name="Japan Library"/&gt;

However, according to [[Zhiyi|Chih-i's]] conceptualization of [[Zhiyi#Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life|"three thousand realms in a single moment of life,"]] they are not separate physical realms into which one may be reborn but interrelated realms of consciousness, each of which is contained within each other (Jp. jikkai gogu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowring|first1=Richard|title=The religious traditions of Japan, 500-1600|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521851190|page=123|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzeODCVG26UC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=jikkai+distinct+realms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGzIKji5nXAhXmx4MKHb7ZB8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jikkai%20distinct%20realms&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ten Realms are a conceptualization of the [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sutra's]] worldview of the interconnected relationship of phenomena, the ultimate reality of the universe, and human agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ikeda|first1=Daisaku|title=Unlocking the mysteries of birth &amp; death : &amp; everything in between, a Buddhist view of life|date=2003|publisher=Middleway|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=9780972326704|pages=106–107|edition=2nd|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_QBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=nichiren+%22ten+worlds%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcmZ7n8pjXAhVDxoMKHU65Dc8Q6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20worlds%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anesaki 1916"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anesaki|first1=Masaharu|title=Nichiren, the Buddhist Prophet|date=1916|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9781498186582|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ub0KAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PR3|pages=150-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three thousand realms in a single moment ==

Each of the ten realms or worlds are contained within each realm, the "mutual possession of the ten realms" (Jap. ''jikkai gogu'').  The one subsequent hundred worlds are viewed through the lenses of the [[Ten suchnesses]] and the three realms of existence (Jpn. ''san-seken'') to formulate three thousand realms of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|lay-url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51961656|title=The Soka Gakkai dictionary of buddhism|date=2002|publisher=Soka Gakkai|others=Sōka Gakkai., 創価学会.|isbn=9784412012059|location=Tokyo|oclc=5196165|url=http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/T/165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hundred aspects of existence leads to the concept of "''three thousand realms in a single moment'' (Jap. ''Ichinen Sanzen'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caine-Barrett|first1=Myokei|title=Teachings for Uncertain Times: Viewing 3,000 Realms in a Single Moment|url=https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/myokei/|publisher=Tricycle|date=Feb 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to this conception, the world of Buddha and the nine realms of humanity are interpenetrable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimazono|first1=Susumu|editor1-last=Takeuchi|editor1-first=Yoshinori|title=Buddhist spirituality: later China, Korea, Japan, and the modern world|date=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120819443|page=445|chapter=29: Soka Gakkai and the Modern Reformation of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXMBhF_lhk8C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=9788120819443&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjku8eSnp3XAhWo7oMKHUT6CHgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soka%20gakkai&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no original "pure mind," and good and evil are mutually possessed.&lt;ref name="Stone 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Jacqueline I.|title=Original enlightenment and the transformation of medieval Japanese Buddhism|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824827717|page=179|edition=Pbk.|quote=The mutual encompassing or copenetration of the ten realms (jikkai gogu) collapses any ontological distinction between the Buddha and the beings, implying that the nine realms of unenlightened beings possess the Buddha nature inherently, while the Buddha possesses the nine realms of unenlightened beings. The mutual inclusion of the ten realms represents an important characteristic of Chih-i's thought there is no original "pure mind"; good and evil are always nondual and mutually possessed. The most depraved icchantika is endowed the Buddha realm, while the Buddha is still latently endowed with the realms of unenlightened beings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This establishes a proclivity to immanence rather than transcendency.  According to [[Nichiren]] the three thousand realms in a single moment is practical and realizable in this lifetime in the concrete world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=See|first1=Tony|editor1-last=Bogue|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Chiu|editor2-first=Hanping|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Yu-lin|title=Deleuze and Asia|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443868884|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TFQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=nichiren&amp;f=false|chapter=2: Deleuze and Mahayana Buddhism: Immanence and Original Enlightenment Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More frequently, the theory of the ten realms and its larger associated concept of three thousand realms of existence in a single moment portray a non-theistic interpretation of how a person is affected by the cosmos and, in turn, has the potential to impact on the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Merv|editor1-last=Copson|editor1-first=Andrew|editor2-last=Grayling|editor2-first=A.C.|title=The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Humanism|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119977179|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BotCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=ichinen+sanzen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT8c_So53XAhXG1IMKHRy6B1MQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=ichinen%20sanzen&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some schools of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] practitioners believe the calligraphic scroll [[Gohonzon]] is Nichiren's representation of the ten realms and chanting [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]] to it activates the Buddha's attributes of wisdom, courage, and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mette Fisker-Nielsen|first1=Anne|editor1-last=Gallagher|editor1-first=Eugene V.|title=Visioning New and Minority Religions: Projecting the Future|date=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781315317892|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=piglDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=nichiren+gohonzon+ten+worlds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-nrvpsKDXAhVF6YMKHcF3C3kQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=nichiren%20gohonzon%20ten%20worlds&amp;f=false|chapter=From Japanese Buddhist sect to global citizenship: Soka Gakkai past and future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photos of the painted rocks and hints of where to find them are commonly shared on [[List of Facebook features#Groups|Facebook groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/parents/rock-painting-groups-connect-families-communities-t111934|title=Why thousands of families are painting and hiding rocks... for fun|last=Peters|first=Terri|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend originated in the [[United States|U.S.]] and has spread to the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as well as other countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/08/10/one-rock-few-kind-words-and-movement-born/SQUeAzQyJZFQEOTF63d1tI/story.html|title=One rock, a few kind words, and a movement is born|last=Guerra|first=Cristela|date=August 10, 2016|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/06/rocking-all-over-the-world-the-painted-pebble-trend-crossing-continents|title=Rocking all over the world: the painted pebble trend crossing continents|last=Featherstone|first=Emma|date=2018-05-06|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Origin ==
The Kindness Rock Project was started by Megan Murphy in 2015 who wrote "You've got this" on a rock and left it on a beach on [[Cape Cod]]. After a friend found it, she started leaving more rocks with inspirational messages behind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekindnessrocksproject.com/|title=The Kindness Rocks Project|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
As the trend of painting pebbles has spread, it has many derivatives. Rocks are painted as a fun activity for kids, as well as to support particular charities, events or movements. Sometimes the name of a hashtag or the Facebook group the painter belongs to is written on it as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.familiesonline.co.uk/local/dunfermline/in-the-know/-kids-are-going-to-love-doing-this-during-the-school-holidays-60529|title=Kids Are Going to Love Doing This During the School Holidays|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|website=www.familiesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/viral/this-is-why-youre-seeing-pictures-of-really-pretty-rocks-in-your-feeds-36192892.html|title=This is why you’re seeing pictures of really pretty rocks in your feeds|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2017|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7202">The '''Symbolic''' (or '''Symbolic Order''') is a part of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], part of his attempt "to distinguish between those elementary registers whose grounding I later put forward in these terms: the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real — a distinction never previously made in psychoanalysis".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==

Lacan's early work was centred on an exploration of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]], of those "specific images, which we refer to by the ancient term of ''imago''. ... it set out from their formative function in the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore "[t]he notion of the "symbolic came to the forefront in the Rome Report [1953] ... henceforth it is the symbolic, not the imaginary, that is seen to be the determining order of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Sheridan]],"Translator' Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan's concept of the symbolic "owes much to a key event in the rise of structuralism ... the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' in 1949. ... In many ways, the symbolic is for Lacan an equivalent to Lévi-Strauss's order of culture":&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'', p. xxii and p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; a language-mediated order of culture. "Man speaks, then, but it is because the symbol has made him man ... superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 65–6&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting then that "language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language",&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (London 1995) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan found in [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that "his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud and Joseph Breuer, quoted in Macey, ''Four'', p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triumph==

For a decade or so after the Rome Report, Lacan found in the concept of the symbolic an answer to the neurotic problematic of the imaginary: "It is the task of symbolism to forbid imaginary capture ... supremacy of the symbolic over the imaginary ... supremacy of the symbolic over the real".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Commentary" in Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 332 and p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting through Lévi-Strauss the anthropological premise that "man is indeed an 'animal symbolicum'", and that "the self-illumination of society through symbols is an essential part of social reality",&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz, ''The Problem of Social Reality'' (The Hague 1973) p. 356 and p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan made the leap to seeing "the Oedipus complex - in so far as we continue to recognise it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; - as the point whereby the weight of social reality was mediated to the developing child by the (symbolic) father: "It is in the ''[[name of the Father]]'' that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The imaginary now came to be seen increasingly as belonging to the earlier, closed realm of the dual relationship of mother and child — "[[Melanie Klein]] describes the relation to the mother as a mirrored relationship ... [neglecting] the third term, the father"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar III, in J. Mitchell and J. Rose, ''Feminine Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 57–8&lt;/ref&gt; — to be broken up and opened to the wider symbolic order.

Lacan's shorthand for that wider world was the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] — "the big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words [which] ... are public, communal property".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 160 and p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; But though it is an essentially linguistic dimension, Lacan does not simply equate the symbolic with language, since the latter is involved also in the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The symbolic dimension of language is that of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]], in which elements have no positive existence but are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.

The [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is the discourse of the Other and thus belongs to the symbolic order. It is also the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the [[Oedipus complex]], and is determinant of [[subjectivity]]. "The unconscious is the sum of the effects of speech on a subject, at the level at which the subject constitutes himself out of the effects of the signifier ... we depend on the field of the Other, which was there long before we came into the world, and whose circulating structures determine us as subjects"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'', p. 126 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; on the symbolic order.

==Eclipse==

With the Sixties, the early rush of expectations associated with the concept of the symbolic order had begun to fade, and the symbolic was increasingly seen as ''part'' of the human condition, rather than as a therapeutic cure-all. Lacan's critical attention began to shift instead to the concept of the Real, seen as "that over which the symbolic stumbles ... that which is lacking in the symbolic order, the ineliminable residue of all articulation ... the umbilical cord of the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''Four'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the decade, "(1968–71) Lacan gradually came to dismiss the Oedipus ... as 'Freud's dream'"&lt;ref&gt;J. Clemens and R. Grigg eds., ''Jacques Lacan and the Other Side of Psychoanalysis: Reflections on Seminar XVII'' (London 2006) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; — despite his own earlier warning of the dangers if "one wishes to ignore the symbolic articulation that Freud discovered at the same time as the unconscious ... his methodical reference to the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether his development of the concept of ''[[jouissance]]'', or 'the "identification with the ''[[sinthome]]''" (as the naming of one's Real) advocated in Lacan's last works as the aim of psychoanalysis',&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Chiesa, ''Subjectivity and Otherness'' (London 2007) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; will in time prove as fruitful as that of the symbolic order perhaps remains to be seen. Part of Lacan's enduring legacy will surely however remain bound up with the triumphal exploration of the symbolic order that was the Rome Report: "Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together ... the shape of his destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the [[Young Lords]], a Puerto Rican nationalist group founded in the United States, advocated for gender equality and challenged male authority in the organization from 1969-1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/the-radical-puerto-rican-movement-of-the-1960s-was-way-woke-on-the-women-question-95f31217a86f|title=Women Took on the Male Leadership of the Radical 1960s Puerto Rican Movement and (Mostly) Won|last=Gilligan|first=Heather|date=March 17, 2017|website=Timeline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote articles critiquing sexist and patriarchal structures and demanded a series of reproductive rights that included access to abortion and an end to forced sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Jennifer|date=2001|title=Abortions under Community Control|url=|journal=Johnson Hopkins University Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of 1970, women consisted of roughly forty percent of the group’s membership and were between the ages of 13 and 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transnationalwomensorganizing.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/women-of-the-young-lords/|title=Feministas, Puerto Rico, Reproductive Rights, Social Justice, Women, Young Lords|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their considerable presence in the YLP, female members were consistently overlooked to occupy high-ranking leadership positions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Young Lords: A Reader|last=Enck-Wanzer|first=Darrel|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0814722428|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1970 [[Denise Oliver-Vélez]] was appointed as Minister of Economic Development and became the highest ranking woman in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/11/archives/young-women-find-a-place-in-high-command-of-young-lords.html|title=Young Women Find a Place in High Command of Young Lords|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|date=November 11, 1970|work=New York Times|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward &amp; Wall, Jim V. "The Cointelpro Papers" 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the Young Lords made significant contributions to the daily maintenance of the organization. They led free breakfast programs for children in local churches as well as educational workshops for community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transnationalwomensorganizing.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/women-of-the-young-lords/|title=Feministas, Puerto Rico, Reproductive Rights, Social Justice, Women, Young Lords|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining their commitment to feminism and female liberation, they worked on the Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women, which explicitly linked traditional family structures as initial sites of female oppression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;The Young Lords. "Position Paper on Women." http://palante.org/Women's%20Position%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women was later included in ''[[The Young Lords: A Reader]]'' (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer (see external links below for the full text of that book). The paper would go on to cement the Young Lords as a main organization in the fight for gender equality at the time. 

Iris Morales, a former Young Lord and grassroots organizer, has worked to preserve the legacy of women in the party today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irismoralesblog.wordpress.com/iris-morales-biography/|title=Iris Morales' Biography|last=Morales|first=Iris|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she directed a documentary ''¡Palante, Siempre Palante!'', chronicling the life of the Young Lords from its inception in 1969 to its fragmentation and ultimate demise in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/movies/iris-morales-palante-siempre-palante-interview|title=Young Lord Iris Morales Talks Film, 50th Anniversary of the Black Power Movement, Solidarity, &amp; More.|last=Reichard|first=Raquel|date=November 17, 2016|work=Latina Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her role in documenting the history of the party and centering women throughout her work highlights another instance of female leadership in the Puerto Rican nationalist organization to this day.

==Early change==
In its early stages as an organization, [[machismo]] was widespread within the Young Lords. Men relegated women to peripheral roles in leadership and subjected them to stereotypical assignments like secretary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorlines.com/articles/mujeres-young-lords|title=Mujeres of the Young Lords|last=Gonzalez|first=Erica|date=|website=Colorlines|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these machista attitudes, several female members formed their own women’s caucus in 1969.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbar|first=Jeffrey|date=2006|title=Puerto Rico en Mi Corazón: The Young Lords, Black Power, and Puerto Rican Nationalism in the US|url=http://marxists.catbull.com/history/erol/ncm-1/corazon.pdf|journal=Centro Journal|volume=|pages=148–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met to confront sexism within the party and eventually decided to propose a change to one of the objectives in the Thirteen Point Platform, “Machismo must be revolutionary and not oppressive.”&lt;ref&gt;The Young Lords. Thirteen Point Platform. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denise Oliver-Vélez]] was quoted saying, “I was in the Young Lords, and one of the points in the original program was ‘Revolutionary Machismo.’ Machismo is reactionary, so you can’t have revolutionary machismo. We women weren’t having it. So we made a very different kind of statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/denise-oliver-velez/|title=Denise Oliver-Velez|last=Oliver-Velez|first=Denise|date=|website=She's Beautiful When She's Angry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘We want equality for women. Down with machismo and male chauvinism.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To this day, that revision remains a part of the final Thirteen Point Platform.

The women’s caucus issued demands to the Central Committee of the organization that called for an end to sexual discrimination and the full inclusion of women into the leadership of the Lords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Central Committee reacted by quickly promoting [[Denise Oliver-Vélez]] and Gloria Fontanez to the Central Committee. They also adopted a new slogan, ¡Abajo con el machismo! (Down with Machismo!).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, these changes did not happen immediately and women still faced sexism within the party regularly. Oliver-Vélez became aware of gendered assumptions made by the central committee about who could and could not perform certain tasks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Fernández, Johanna. 2009. "Denise Oliver and the Young Lords Party: Stretching the Political Boundaries of Struggle." New York University Press. 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when women were assigned to posts in various ministries, including the Defense Ministry, they were disproportionately assigned traditional "women's work" like child care and secretarial tasks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Some changes could be seen as stricter guidelines were placed on the men within the party to respect their female counterparts both inside and outside of the organization. For example, [[Felipe Luciano]] was demoted from his position as Central Committee chairman and organization spokesperson for being unfaithful to his wife in 1970. He was charged with “male chauvinism” and was sent back for re-education within the non-ranking cadre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trouble with Unity: Latino Politics and the Creation of Identity|last=Beltran|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780195375909|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position Paper on Women==

One of the major contributions women made to the success of the Young Lords Party was working on the Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women, published in 1970, which was later included in ''[[The Young Lords: A Reader]]'' (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer (see external links below for the full text of that book). [[Denise Oliver-Vélez]] helped construct the document and theorized the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of race and class in the lives of women of color.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The paper outlined the expectations placed on women and how their value in society is tied to their potential in the household and in the kitchen. It indicted the practice of [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] in [[Puerto Rico]] that had happening since the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It also denounced the use of [[Oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], since they had been tested on Puerto Rican women for fifteen years. They had been tied to cancer and death from blood clotting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Women in the Young Lords were subject to harsh criticism and backlash by the male dominated central committee as well as men in their communities who saw their involvement as a front to culture and established gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through the Eyes of Rebel Women: The Young Lords 1969-1976|last=Morales|first=Iris|publisher=Red Sugarcane Press, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9968276-2-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, women started making demands, occupying space in group meetings, and challenging male authority on an institutional level. Women in the Puerto Rican activist organization the Young Lords made significant contributions to the programs and platform of the Young Lords. They were situated within the ranking system and performed the labor for free meal and clothing drives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To this day, the women who made up the Young Lords from 1969-1976 struggle to receive the same recognition as their male counterparts. With the publication of ''Through the Eyes of Rebel Women: The Young Lords 1969-1976'' in 2016 by Iris Morales, more information about the role women had in the organization is coming to light and being celebrated.

Worldwide, there are between 180 and 220 million '''youth with disabilities'''. Eighty percent of disabled youth live in developing countries, and therefore have even less access to education, health care, jobs and general rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth with Disabilities|url=http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx|website=Youth Social Policy and Developmental Division|accessdate=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127013856/http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx |archive-date=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabilities include [[physical disabilities|physical]], [[mental disabilities]] or [[mental illness]].  Many youth live normal and stable lives, however those with disabilities may experience more obstacles than those without due to potential limitations, those created by physical limitations and social limitations. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Disability and education==
===Legal regulations in the United States===
Before the 1970s, there were no major [[federal law]]s that protected the [[civil rights|civil]] or [[constitutional right]]s of [[United States|Americans]] with disabilities. The [[civil rights movement]] started off the "[[disability rights movement]]", which focused on [[social services|social]] and therapeutic services for those with disabilities, and in 1975 the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was created. This law establishes the rights of children with disabilities to attend [[State school|public schools]], to receive services designed to meet their needs free of charge, and to receive instruction in regular education [[classroom]]s alongside non-disabled children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laudan |first1=Aron |last2=Loprest |first2=Pamela |title=Disability and the Education System|journal=The Future of Children |date=Spring 2012 |volume=22.1 |publisher=Princeton|location=United Kingdom |pmid=22550687 |pages=97–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEA also authorized [[federal grant]]s to [[U.S. state|states]] to cover some of the costs of special education services for youth aged three to twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Additions to the law focused on improving access to general education and [[curriculum]] (inclusion programs), developing appropriate assessments, implementing appropriate [[punishment|disciplinary]] procedures and alternative placements, and creating transition services for youth leaving the [[education system]]. This transition can be difficult for youth with a disability if it is too sudden- many of these youth struggle with the independence that [[graduation]] allows. In 2004, additions were made to promote better accountability for results, enhance parent involvement, encourage the use of proven practices and materials (increase research on current practices), and reduce administrative burdens for [[teacher]]s, states and local [[school district]]s. Before 1975, only one in five children with identified disabilities attended public school, and many states explicitly excluded children with certain types of disabilities from school; these included children who were [[blindness|blind]] or [[deafness|deaf]], and children labeled "[[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotionally disturbed]]" or "[[mentally retarded]]".&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

===Current special education system===
The current special education system can offer many different supports and services including transportation, speech-language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation, and mobility services, medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes, school health services, social work services in school, and parent counseling and training children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Each unique student and their unique symptoms of their disability is going to require different supports from another youth with a disability (even if it is the same disability). Within the classroom, there are many different ways that teachers and administration can adjust their work to meet the needs of the youth in their classroom with disabilities. Just a few of these adaptations are curriculum modification, small-group or individual instruction, and teachers who are especially skilled in motivating students, adapting instructional materials, teaching reading skills and language arts, and managing student behaviors.Specific accommodations might include tutors or aides, more time for students to take tests, alternative tests or assessments, modified grading standards, slower-paced instruction, shorter or different assignments, more frequent feedback, a reader or interpreter, a peer tutor, or special behavior management approaches and programs.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

==Challenges and hardships==

===Family effects===
{{Globalize|date=December 2014}}
Being a [[youth]] with a disability can create a financial burden on the individual, as well as to those who provide care and support. Their families also incur extra [[direct cost|direct]] and [[indirect cost]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Families with disabled yout spend money on [[health care]], [[Therapy|therapeutic]], behavioral, or [[education]]al services; transportation; [[caregiver]]s; and other [[special needs]] services. Indirect costs include reductions in parents' ability to work because of additional time that is required to care for a child with a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|disability]] combined with high costs or unavailability of adequate [[child care]]. This is a similar problem to one that many families face, but disabled youth may live at home longer require more attention.&lt;ref name=Stabile&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stabile|first1=Mark|title=The Economic Costs of Childhood Disability|pmid=22550686|volume=22|year=2012|pages=65–96|journal=Future Child|doi=10.1353/foc.2012.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs alone can decrease the financial stability of a family.  Having a child with disabilities increases the likelihood that the mother (or less often the father) will either curtail hours of work or stop working altogether.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;  One study showed that a decline in employment of 9% for mothers with a disabled child relative to all mothers, with a resultant estimate of approximately $3,150 in lost pay. In addition, mothers who continue to work are estimated to reduce time worked by around two hours a week, with a range of between half an hour and five hours a week.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;

Families with more resources may be able to maintain financial stability, even with the financial strain of having a youth with a disability. These resources may provide treatment, [[affordable housing]], therapy, etc. for a youth with special needs. As a conclusion from the research listed above, these children are more likely to be able to function independently from their family, and live on their own at an earlier age, than those from families that may not be able to afford these extra resources.

===Poverty===
Eighty percent of people with disabilities live in resource-poor societies. They are often considered to be a burden, and carry a very negative [[social stigma]]. Many are unable to contribute to society, attend school, or find [[job|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manderson|first1=Lenore|title=Disability, Global Legislation and Human Rights|journal=The Politics of Health|date=June 2004|volume=47.2|pages=29–35|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled youth in the justice system===
{{globalize|date=December 2014}}
In the justice system, youth are disproportionately male, poor and have significant learning or behavioral disabilities to the extent that they require services listed under the IDEA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Mary|last2=Rutherford|first2=Robert|last3=Leone|first3=Peter|last4=Osher|first4=David|last5=Poirer|first5=Jeffery|title=Youth with Disabilities in Juvenile Corrections: A National Survey|journal=Exceptional Children|date=2005|volume=71|issue=3|pages=339–345|doi=10.1177/001440290507100308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1345,000 youth incarcerated in the U.S system, and 30%-70% of these individuals are youth with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
[[Psychiatric disorder]]s occur more often among [[prisoner]]s than among those outside of [[prison]]. Such illnesses relate to at least some of the difficulties former inmates experience after they are released.&lt;ref name="Schnittker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnittker |first1=Jason |last2=Massoglia|first2=Michael|last3=Uggen|first3=Christopher|title=Out and Down: Incarceration and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=Journal of Health and Social behavior|date=2012|volume=53.4 |url=http://users.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Schnittker_Massoglia_Uggen_JHSB_12.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were diagnosed with a mental disability may have a harder time readjusting to life outside of [[incarceration|prison]] after being released; this often consists of [[recidivism|repetition of crime]], or difficulty maintaining independent stability financially or emotionally.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

:''This article is about the Cuban taekwondo athlete. For the Puerto Rican politician, see [[Angel Matos García]].''
'''Ángel Valodia Matos Fuentes''' (born December 24, 1976 in [[Holguín]]) is a former [[Cuba]]n [[taekwondo]] athlete. He received a [[gold medal]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]],&lt;ref name=db-ol-TKD2000&gt;[http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD "2000 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp; – Sydney, Australia&amp;nbsp; – Taekwondo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823081100/http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD |date=2008-08-23 }} ''databaseOlympics.com'' (Retrieved on April 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and added [[Taekwondo at the 2007 Pan American Games|another]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] banned Matos and his coach for life following an incident [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|at the 2008 Summer Olympics]] where Matos kicked the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[referee]] [[Chakir Chelbat]] in the face, after being disqualified in the [[bronze medal]] match. The decision was later ratified by the [[IOC]].&lt;ref name = "SMH_20080825"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/taekwondo/cuban-kicked-out-after-attacking-referee/2008/08/25/1219516279008.html Cuban kicked out after taekwondo disgrace] ''Sydney Morning Herald Aug 25, 2008''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also banned for life by the same committee.

==2000 Summer Olympics==
[[Taekwondo at the 2000 Summer Olympics|At the 2000 Summer Olympics]], Matos was gold medalist in the men's middleweight (80&amp;nbsp;kg) class.&lt;ref name="time2004"&gt;Staff report (August 9, 2004). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994816,00.html The Olympians], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round, he defeated [[Felipe Soto Alvarez]] of [[Chile]] 9–2. In the quarterfinals, he defeated [[Victor Manuel Estrada Garibay]] of [[Mexico]] 2–0, besting [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Roman Livaja]] in the semifinals, 4–0. In the gold medal match Matos defeated [[Germany]]'s [[Faissal Ebnoutalib]] 3–1.&lt;ref name="espn2000"&gt;Staff report (September 29, 2000). [http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/results/taekwondo.html Summer Olympics 2000 Results - Taekwondo] ESPN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Matos was the defending Olympic welterweight champion. At the [[2003 Pan American Games]], Matos was defeated 4–1 by eventual gold medalist [[Steven López]].&lt;ref name="weir2004"&gt;Weir, Tom (August 2, 2004). [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/athens/fight/2004-08-02-lopez-cover_x.htm Lopez kicks his way to Athens with help from family], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a medalist [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics|at Athens in 2004]], being ousted by Mexican Estrada 8–7, in the preliminary round of 16.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
In the bronze medal match in the men's 80+ kg class at the [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], Matos was set against Kazakhstan's [[Arman Chilmanov]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo|title=Cuban banned after assault on referee | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-08-24 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he incurred a foot injury (at which point he led the match 3-2), he took a [[Kyeshi]]&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; ("suspend", medical timeout). Under [[World Taekwondo Federation]] tournament rules, players sustaining injury are allowed one minute of Kyeshi time, at the end of which the competitor in question must return to the center of the ring to resume the fight, request further time, or forfeit the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtf.org/site/rules/competition.htm#19|title=The World Taekwondo Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden|Swedish]] referee [[Chakir Chelbat]] gave a time warning at 40 seconds, but Kyeshi elapsed without Matos returning to the center.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The referee ruled while he was sitting awaiting medical attention that he had taken too long during his time out and subsequently ruled he had retired.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; "To me it was obvious he was unable to continue," his opponent [[Arman Chilmanov]] of Kazakhstan said. "His toe on his left foot was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/sports/olympics/24taekwondo.html|title=Cuban athlete is barred for kicking referee’s face | work=The New York Times | date=2008-08-24 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chilmanov was declared the winner, Matos briefly argued with Chelbat and then kicked him in the face, punched a judge in the arms, and spat on the floor of the arena before being escorted out by security with his coach, Leudis Gonzalez.&lt;ref name="AFP/Fox"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cuban attacks judge after losing bronze in taekwondo | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/beijing_olympics/story/0,27313,24231037-5016792,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher=AFP/Fox }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBc5uA2gEfcqAO50n1lqHot8aWLAD92O159G0 |title=Cuban taekwondo athlete banned after kicking ref |publisher=AP/Google |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Eric |last=Talmadge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825202646/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBc5uA2gEfcqAO50n1lqHot8aWLAD92O159G0 |archivedate=August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/taekwondo/news/newsid=251304.html |title=Kicked out: Cuban banned for life |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824164335/http://www.nbcolympics.com/taekwondo/news/newsid%3D251304.html |archivedate=August 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fight, Yang Jin-suk, the secretary general of the World Taekwondo Federation, apologised and said "This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my opinion, an insult to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/23/AR2008082301905.html|title=Cuban Taekwondo Athlete Puts Worst Foot Forward|date=2008-08-24|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, the WTF banned Matos and González from WTF-sanctioned events for life; in a statement announcing its decision, the WTF called Matos' behaviour "a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the Olympic Games."  It also deleted Matos' results from the 2008 Olympics from the records.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= Ransom|title= Cuban banned for referee kick|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK30514420080823|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 2008-08-23|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSGpc2ezfJpI&amp;refer=home|title=Cuban Taekwondo champ faces ban for kicking Olympic ref in head | work=Bloomberg | date=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matos's coach Leudis González said of the referee's initial decision to end the fight, "He was too strict..." and accused the Kazakhstan team of offering bribes.&lt;ref name="AFP/Fox"/&gt; Former Cuban [[president]] [[Fidel Castro]] also defended Matos, saying he was rightfully indignant over his disqualification. "I saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two Cuban boxers [[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|in the semifinals]]," Castro wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidel Castro defends Ángel Matos' actions |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831113340/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |archivedate=August 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
