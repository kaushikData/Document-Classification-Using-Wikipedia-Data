      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">:''This article discusses a text which is quite distinct from the [[Acts of Peter|Act'''s''' of Peter]]''.

The '''''Act of Peter''''' is a brief miracle text celebrating [[virginity]] that is found in the 5th-century papyrus [[Berlin Codex]] (Berolinensis Gnosticus 8502). It treats of the crippled virgin daughter of [[Simon Peter|Peter]], who was accused by the crowd that gathered before his door, among whom he had caused many blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the lame to walk: "But your virgin daughter, who has grown up to be beautiful and who has believed in the name of God, why have you not helped her? For behold, one side of her is completely paralyzed and she lies crippled there in the corner."

Peter bids the girl rise and walk, and she does, and the crowd rejoices. "Then Peter said to his daughter, 'Go to your place, sit down, and become an invalid again.'" The crowd weeps.

Peter then relates the vision he received when the girl was born, that she would wound many with her beauty. ""When the girl became ten years old, many were tempted by her. And a man rich in property, Ptolemy, after he had seen the girl bathing with her mother, sent for her so that he might take her for his wife."

A section is missing, and when the text resumes, Ptolemy's servants are putting her down before the house, and depart. Finding her "with one whole side of her body, from her toes to her head, paralyzed and withered, we picked her up, praising the Lord who had saved his servant from defilement, [and] pollution."

The contrite Ptolemy receives a vision, saying "Ptolemy, God did not give his vessels for corruption and pollution. But it was necessary for you, since you believed in me, that you not defile my virgin, whom you should have recognized as your sister, since I have become one Spirit for you both." This is the one [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] detail of the text, which is in every other way a conventional [[miracle]] tale.

Ptolemy leaves a plot of land to the girl, "since because of her he believed in God and was saved", and Peter sells it and distributes the price to the poor.

Only nominally connected with the Peter of the [[New Testament]], this brief ''Act'' expresses in a characteristically extreme form the cult of virginity in the male-dominated 5th-century [[Christian Church]], a cultural thread that may also be detected in many early ''Acta'' of female martyrs.

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

== Definition of religion==
One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

'''''Children of God''''' is a 2010 Bahamian [[romantic drama film]] by director and screenwriter [[Kareem Mortimer]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |title= Children of God |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/movies/children-of-god-review.html |trans-title=A Romance Stalked by Hatred |author= Catsoulis, Jeannette |date= May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It tells the story of two young Bahamian men who fall in love with each other, and it portrays the [[homophobia]] of the Bahamian society. The film also deals with themes of [[bisexuality]], as a [[romantic drama film]].

It is one of the first feature narratives from the [[Caribbean]] to address [[homosexuality]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It was the opening night film of the [[Bahamas International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Stephen, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/children-god-tackles-homophobia-bahamas-92422 "'Children of God' tackles homophobia in the Bahamas"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', December 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahamas had banned the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' in 2006. The film made its International Premiere at the [[Miami International Film Festival]] and has premiered at over 100 film festivals around the world, winning 17 awards. ''Children of God'' was named one of the top ten films of 2010 on BET.com.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Plot==
Jonny ([[Johnny Ferro]]), an awkward painting student, is “banished” by his instructor to the remote island of [[Eleuthera]], to focus on his work and find his artistic voice. But first he finds Romeo ([[Stephen Tyrone Williams]]), a handsome, self-confident guy who shows Jonny the scenic spots, and a bit more. Romeo's got a girlfriend, however, as well as a blustery mother who willfully ignores any clue or hint he drops to set her straight.

Meanwhile, Lena (Margaret Laurena Kemp), a pastor's wife, has also made her way to this distant spot to contemplate her future in relative calm. Tired of her husband spouting high-and-mighty, anti-gay rhetoric at rallies while refusing to own up to the cruelty and contradictions in his private life, Lena has a decision to make.

The phrase, "Children of God" is the religious expression used by [[Christians]] to refer to human divinity as being all God's Children. Four Bahamian individuals set out on a journey from the frenetic energy of Nassau to the slower-paced and open Eleuthera. The year is 2004, when the Caribbean world is rocked by the emergence of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s gay family [[Norwegian Dawn|cruise ship]]. Actual documentary footage details the mass hysteria that divides the Caribbean, as some fundamentalists lead widespread rallies.

Jonny, a young, obsessive-compulsive white Bahamian artist, faces losing his scholarship at a local university if he does not live up to the potential his professors believe he has. Jonny escapes from his gritty inner-city life, in Nassau, to the under-populated and dramatic Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Here he decides to paint his 'masterpiece' and then gets killed by a closeted homosexual when Jonny was en route to meet Romeo. It could have had a happy ending. However, in this film, life does not have happy endings for many gay and lesbians.

Lena Mackey is an extremely conservative forty-year-old, anti-gay activist who finds out that her husband is not who he represents himself to be. She believes that the only way to fix problems in her life is to limit the rights of homosexuals. She heads to Eleuthera for the purpose of galvanizing the community to oppose gay rights. When Jonny arrives, his and Lena's paths cross, and together these two embark on a series of physical and emotional adventures that not only inspire Jonny to paint, but also give him a new zest for life.

==Reception==
''New York Times'' critic  Jeannette Catsoulis found the film mediocre, with the characters standing for overly simplistic representatives of the films' ideas.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  [[BET|BET.com]] reviewer Clay Cane gave it a strongly positive review, praising the acting (especially Margaret Laurena Kemp as Lena) and the photography and technical excellence despite its low budget.&lt;ref&gt;Cane, Clay,  [https://www.bet.com/news/opinion/what-the-flick/05/movie-review-children-of-god.html "Movie Review: Children of God"], [[BET|BET.com]], April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Boyd van Hoeij similarly praised its cinematography and the lead actors while also noting its "formulaic elements".&lt;ref&gt;van Hoeij, Boyd, [https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/children-of-god-1117942721/ "Children of God" (review)], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', May 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Muslims''' are religiously unobservant, [[secularism|secular]] or [[irreligion|irreligious]] individuals who still identify with the [[Muslim culture]] or the religion due to family background, personal experiences, or the social and cultural environment in which they grew up. Cultural Muslims can be found across the world, but are especially numerous in the Middle East (Arabic speaking countries as well as in Israel, Turkey and Iran), [[Islam in Europe|Europe]], [[Islam in Central Asia|Central Asia]], [[North America]], and parts of [[Islam in South Asia|South]] and [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]].

==Definition==
In Central Asia and in former communist countries, the term "cultural Muslim" came into use to describe those who wished their "Muslim" identity to be associated with certain national and ethnic rituals, rather than merely religious faith.&lt;ref name="AitchisonHopkins2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Cara Aitchison|author1-link= Cara Aitchison|author2= Peter E. Hopkins|author3= Mei-Po Kwan|title= Geographies of Muslim Identities: Diaspora, Gender and Belonging|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DRnthQxB8lYC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate= 30 June 2013|year= 2007|publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn= 978-1-4094-8747-0|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malise Ruthven]] (2000) discussed the terms "cultural Muslim" and "nominal Muslim" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Islam: A Very Short Introduction'', by Malise Ruthven, Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, however, a secondary meaning to ''Muslim'' which may shade into the first. A Muslim is one born to a Muslim father who takes on his or her parents' confessional identity without necessarily subscribing to the beliefs and practices associated with the faith, just as a Jew may describe him- or herself as ''Jewish'' without observing the Tanakh or Halacha. In non-Muslim societies, such Muslims may subscribe to, and be vested with, secular identities. The Muslims of Bosnia, descendants of Slavs who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule, are not always noted for attendance at prayer, abstention from alcohol, seclusion of women and other social practices associated with believing Muslims in other parts of the world. They were officially designated as ''[[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims by nationality]]'' to distinguish them from Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats under the former Yugoslav communist regime. The label ''Muslim'' indicates their ethnicity and group allegiance, but not necessarily their religious beliefs. In this limited context (which may apply to other Muslim minorities in Europe and Asia), there may be no contradiction between being Muslim and being [[atheism | atheist]] or [[agnosticism | agnostic]], just as there are Jewish atheists and Jewish agnostics. This secular definition of Muslim (sometimes the terms ''cultural Muslim'' or ''nominal Muslim'' are used) is very far from being uncontested.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural Muslim internalizes the Islamic cultural tradition, or way of thinking, as a [[framing (social sciences) | frame]] of reference. Cultural Muslims are diverse in terms of norms, values, political opinions, and religious views. They retain a shared "[[discourse]] or structure of feeling" related to shared history and memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l-axAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq=%22cultural+Muslim%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GBF6U9uvGZXNsQT-loKQDA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20Muslim%22&amp;f=false|title= Islam in Europe: Public Spaces and Civic Networks|author= Spyros A. Sofos|author2= Roza Tsagarousianou|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year= 2013|isbn= 978-1137357779}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a ''cultural Muslim'' - someone who identifies as a Muslim yet is not religious - is not met with acceptance in [[conservative Islam]]ic religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to WIN-Gallup International's Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf GLOBAL INDEX OF RELIGIOSITY AND ATHEISM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; countries with the highest proportion of irreligious Muslims are [[Turkey]] (73%), [[Kosovo]] (60%), [[Azerbaijan]] (51%) and [[Lebanon]] (33%).

'''Filippians''' or '''Philippians''' ({{Lang-ru|Филипповцы}})  was a ''soglasiye'' ([[Confession (religion)|confession]], literally, "agreement") of the [[Bespopovtsy]] (the "priestless") strain of  [[Old Believers]]. They detached themselves from [[Pomortsy]] under the leadership of a "teacher" Filipp at the beginning of the 18th century. Because of the repressions of the government, they started practicing [[self-immolation]] as a means for the "preservation of the faith". In the second half of the 18th century, their [[fanaticism]] decreased, and several other confessions were spun off: [[Aaronovtsy]] (Aaron's Confession), [[Shepherd's Confession]] (пастухово согласие), and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3476">The '''"Gestalt prayer"''' is a 56-word statement by [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] [[Fritz Perls]] that is taken as a classic expression of [[Gestalt therapy]] as way of life model of which Dr. Perls was a founder.

The key idea of the statement is the focus on living in response to one's own needs, without projecting onto or taking [[Introjection|introjects]] from others. It also expresses the idea that it is by fulfilling their own needs that people can help others do the same and create space for genuine contact; that is, when they "find each other, it's beautiful."

==Text of "prayer"==
{{quote|
I do my thing and you do your thing.&lt;br/&gt;
I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,&lt;br/&gt;
And you are not in this world to live up to mine.&lt;br/&gt;
You are you, and I am I,&lt;br/&gt;
and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful. &lt;br/&gt;
If not, it can't be helped.&lt;br/&gt;
(Fritz Perls, "Gestalt Therapy Verbatim", 1969) }}

==Impact and legacy==

The prayer is well known in gestalt and psychotherapy circles, where it is generally taken as a summarizing statement of the philosophy of personal independence central to gestalt therapy. This philosophy still attracts critics, generally arguing that [[interpersonal relationship]]s require real, hard work to maintain. Supporters counter that an attitude of independence does not refute this, but rather encourages people to realize that relationships need not be founded on obligation or expectation.
The prayer remains popular in general culture, although the last line is sometimes omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/poetry/frederick-perls.html Example of an individual omitting the last line]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dking-gallery.com/store/HEAD_24mything.html Another example from a 1970s poster]&lt;/ref&gt;  In academic discussion, it sometimes acts as a starting point for debate around issues of autonomy and interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ238287&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=EJ238287 |title=Reflections on Fritz Perls's Gestalt Prayer. |accessdate=2007-08-31 |format= |work= |author=Dolliver, Robert H. |journal=Personnel and Guidance Journal |date=January 1981 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=311–13 |doi=10.1002/j.2164-4918.1981.tb00556.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crocker, S.

It must be added, however, that it does not characterize Gestalt therapy in general, but rather Fritz Perls' personal attitude during the time at the [[Esalen Institute]].

The statement "I am not in this world to live up to your expectations" was used by the reggae artist [[Peter Tosh]] in his 1977 song "I Am That I Am".

'''''Guicang''''' (歸藏, "Return to the Hidden") is a divination text dating to the [[Zhou dynasty]], which was once used in place of the ''[[I Ching]]''. The text of ''Guicang'' was rediscovered in a rural bog in 1993; it had been lost for roughly two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Shaughnessy|first1=Edward L.|title=Unearthing the Changes: Recently Discovered Manuscripts of the Yi Jing ( ''I Ching'') and Related Texts|date=2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231533306|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guicang'' contains the sixty-four hexagrams and stories relating to each of them. For example, [[List_of_hexagrams_of_the_I_Ching#Hexagram_54|Hexagram 54 of the ''I Ching'']], "Returning Maiden", is accompanied by the story of how the maiden [[Chang'e]] stole the medicine of immortality from the [[Xi Wangmu]] and, upon returning home, used the hexagrams to determine that she should flee to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Shaughnessy|first1=Edward L.|title=Unearthing the Changes: Recently Discovered Manuscripts of the Yi Jing ( I Ching) and Related Texts|date=2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231533306|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gurdwara Sri Tarn Taran Sahib''' is a [[gurdwara]] established by the fifth [[guru]], [[Guru Arjan Dev]], in the city of [[Tarn Taran Sahib]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]. The site has the distinction of having the largest sarovar (water pond) of all the gurdwaras. It is famous for the monthly gathering of pilgrims on the day of Amavas (a no-moon night). It is near [[Harmandir Sahib]], [[Amritsar]].

==Sikh Gurus Period 1469-1708==
[[Guru Arjan Dev]] Ji, the Fifth Sikh Guru, founded [[Tarn Taran Sahib]] in the year 1590, in the Land of Panjab (Majha Region). At that time, the digging of the lake tank started. When the tank was completed, it was the biggest and largest sarovar lake in the whole of Panjab. The foundation stone of Darbar Sahib was laid by Dhan Dhan Baba Buddha Ji, a famous Sikh saint (1506–1631). Later, the Sixth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]] Sahib, came to the gurdwara and stayed for some time. Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru, also visited Tarn Taran Sahib and preached to the Sikh sangat.

==Sikh Misl Period 1707-1799==
Shaheed Baba Deep Singh made a mark on the ground at Tarn Taran Sahib, and he asked the Sikhs if they were ready to die fighting against the enemies before entering into war against the Afhan Empire in 1757.

In 1768 Sardar Budh Singh Virk of Singhpuria Misl and Maharaja Jassa Singh Ramgarhia of Ramgarhia Misl joined hands to rebuild the Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran. Which then was in a shape of a traditional mud building.

==Sher-e-Panjab period 1799-1849==
Later Maharaja Ranjit Singh Sher-e-Panjab (1799–1839), who visited Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran from 1802-1837, reconstructed the present Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran in 1836-1837 and also completed the work of the Parikarma which had been left unfinished by the two Sardars Singhpuria Misl and Ramgarhia Misl. Sher-e-Panjab gold-plated the Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran, as he did with the [[Harmandir Sahib]] at [[Amritsar]]. Artisans were called in by the Maharaja of Panjab Kingdom to decorate the inside of Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran.

Sher-e-Panjab built 17 massive gate entrances in Tarn Taran in which elephants could easily go through. When Maharaja [[Nau Nihal Singh]], the grandson of Sher-e-Panjab, came to Tarn Taran, he built a minara (tower) at the end of the sarovar. Only one was completed, which can be seen while walking to Darbar Sahib. Three others were planned on each end of the sarovar, but were not constructed due to the death of Maharaja Nau Nihal Singh and also because of the two [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]] (1845–1849) against the British.

==British Period 1849-1947==

In 1877, Bhai Harsa Singh, a granthi of Darbar Sahib, Tarn Taran, was the first teacher, of the Singh Sabha movement, which came into existence in 1873, to protect the Sikhs of Punjab, against the Arya Samaj, Christian Missionaries, who were at that time trying the best to convert the Sikhs, but found it hard to make there ways into the Sikh population.  

In 1883, Raja Raghubir Singh (1832-1887), the Sikh Chieftain of Jind Princely State, had a channel dug, from the sarovar, to bring in new water, to keep the tank beautified. The channel was latter paved by Sant Gurmukh Singh (1849-1947), of Patiala from 1927-28. During 1923-28, the Sarovar at Tarn Taran was desilted and lined. 

During the British Rule (1849–1947), Sardar Arur Singh Shergill (1865–1926) was made the manager of Tarn Taran Sahib Gurdwara from 1907-1920, by the British, to keep the Sikh shrine out of direct Sikh Control.  In 1905 an earthquake damaged the Lotus Dome of Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran, but soon after it was rebuilt.  The Sikhs of Punjab fought and sacrificed to gain independence from the British rulers. In 1921 greedy priests divided the income of the Gurdwara among themselves.  It was in 1921 that the Sikhs decided to free Tarn Taran Sahib. Seventeen Sikhs got injured at Tarn Taran.  Two Sikhs attained martyrdom - Sardar Hazara Singh of Village Aladinpur District Amritsar and Sardar Hukam Singh of Village Wasoo Kot District Gurdaspur.

They were the first martyrs of the Gurdwara reform movement. On arrival of more squads on 26 January, the priests handed over the management of the Gurdwara to the Prabhandak Committee. This martyrdom was known as Saka Tarn Taran.

==After independence Period 1947 – present Day==
Since the partition of 1947, more work (kar Seva) has been done on Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran. The first work was in 1970, when the Old Bungas Towers of Sikh chieftains were demolished to construct a big complex. In all four corners of Darbar Sahib, the Holy Tank (Sarovar) was cleaned by Sikhs. In the early 1980s, a big hall was built to replace many Old Sikh period buildings. In 2005 the whole of Darbar Sahib was renovated. It was plated in new gold, and inside the Darbar Sahib new work was done. New marble was inlaid; a big complex was built; and more buildings were added around the complex. This Karsewa was done by Baba Jagtar Singh ji Karsewa Tarn Taran Wale.

The '''Hadith of Warning''' or '''Yawm al-Inzar''' ({{lang-ar|یوْمُ الْاِنذار}}), also known as '''Invitation of the close families of Muhammad''' (دعوة ذو العشیرة - Da‘wat dhul-‘Ashīrah) is an event that took place in the fourth year of [[Islam]]. [[Shia Islam|Shias]] use this hadith to prove [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib's]] claim as the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.eshia.ir/27112/1/10}}{{better source|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invitation of close families==
[[Muhammad]] invited people to Islam in secret for three years before he started inviting them publicly. In the fourth year of Islam, when Muhammad was commanded to invite his closer relatives to come to Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|26|214|style = ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony. At the banquet, he was about to invite them to Islam when [[Abu Lahab]] interrupted him, after which everyone left the banquet. The Prophet ordered Ali to invite the 40 people again. The second time, Muhammad announced Islam to them and invited them to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said to them,
{{quote|"I offer thanks to Allah for His mercies. I praise Allah, and I seek His guidance. I believe in Him and I put my trust in Him. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah; He has no partners; and I am His messenger. Allah has commanded me to invite you to His religion by saying: And warn thy nearest kinsfolk. I, therefore, warn you, and call upon you to testify that there is no god but Allah, and that I am His messenger. O ye sons of Abdul Muttalib, no one ever came to you before with anything better than what I have brought to you. By accepting it, your welfare will be assured in this world and in the Hereafter. Who among you will support me in carrying out this momentous duty? Who will share the burden of this work with me? Who will respond to my call? Who will become my vicegerent, my deputy and my wazir?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ali was the only one to answer Muhammad's call. Muhammad told him to sit down, saying, "Wait! Perhaps someone older than you might respond to my call." Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a second time. Once again, Ali was the only one to respond, and again, Muhammad told him to wait. Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a third time. Ali was still the only volunteer. This time, Ali's offer was accepted by Muhammad. Muhammad "drew [Ali] close, pressed him to his heart, and said to the assembly: 'This is my wazir, my successor and my vicegerent. Listen to him and obey his commands.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's eager offer, Muhammad "threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom" and said, "Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent...Let all listen to his words, and obey him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irving|first1=Washington|title=The Life of Mohammed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]] writes about the banquet in his 1898 book, saying, "It won for [Muhammad] a proselyte worth a thousand sabers in the person of Ali, son of Abu Talib."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Sir Richard|title=(The Jew the Gypsy and El Islam|date=1898|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hindu Temples – What Happened to Them''''' is a two-volume book by [[Sita Ram Goel]], [[Arun Shourie]], [[Harsh Narain]], [[Jay Dubashi]] and [[Ram Swarup]]. The first volume was published in the Spring of 1990.

The first volume includes a list of 2,000 mosques that were built on Hindu temples, based primarily on the books of Muslim historians of the period or inscriptions found on mosques. The second volume excerpts from medieval histories and chronicles and from inscriptions concerning the destruction of [[Hindu]],  [[Jain]] and [[Buddhist]] [[temple]]s. The authors claim that the material presented in the book as "the tip of an iceberg".

The book contains chapters about the [[Ayodhya debate]]. The appendix of the first volume contains a list of temple-destructions and atrocities that the authors claim took place in [[Bangladesh]] in 1989. The book also criticizes [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], and one of the appendices of the second volume includes a questionnaire for "Marxist professors", one of which the authors sent to well-known Indian historian [[Romila Thapar]].

In August 1990, while releasing the book "Hindu Temples – What Happened To Them", [[Bharatiya Janta Party]] leader L. K. Advani chided Goel for using "strong language".&lt;ref&gt;Goel, Sita Ram, "How I became a Hindu", Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; There were proposals in November 1990 in [[Uttar Pradesh]] to ban the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/books/ayodhya/ch12.htm |title=Ayodhya and After - Chapter 12 - Book Banning |publisher=Koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233935/http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/books/ayodhya/ch12.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

Cynthia Talbot in 1995 claimed that Goel's list of destroyed temples is "greatly inflated", but also called for a systematic and unbiased study of the subject, without which it is very difficult to gauge the extent of damage wrought on Indian temples.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Talbot. Inscribing the Other,Inscribing the Self:Hindu-Muslim Identities in Pre-Colonial India. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol.37, No.4 (Oct. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Talbot noted that in the decades after 1565, temple desecration were on the rise in [[Andhra Pradesh]], which is in accord with the dates of temple destructed provided by Goel's list (in Goel's chapter "Let the Mute Witness speak"). Reflecting on Goel's list, Talbot states: "Five date from the fourteenth century (phase one), six come from phase two, and nineteen date from 1565 to 1650 CE (phase three). The remaining thirty or so cases stem from the century after 1650, with a notable bunching of incidents in the late 1600s, when the Mughal empire was absorbing the former [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahi]] kingdom of [[Golkonda|Golconda]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Talbot. Inscribing the Other,Inscribing the Self:Hindu-Muslim Identities in Pre-Colonial India. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol.37,No.4 (Oct. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Manini Chatterjee, in a review in the ''Calcutta Telegraph'', called Goel's book a "very bad book".&lt;ref&gt;Manini Chatterjee, review in the Calcutta Telegraph (ca. 30-1-1991). Koenraad Elst ''[[Who is a Hindu?]]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Eaton also criticized the book.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eaton: "Temple desecration and Indo-Muslim states", Essays on Islam and Indian History. Chapter Six&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton discussed one of the cases in Goel's list of destroyed temples: "an inscription dated 1455, found over the doorway of a tomb-shrine in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh" which mentions "the destruction of a Hindu temple by one Abdullah Shah Changal during the reign of [[Bhoja]], a renowned [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]] king who had ruled over the region from 1010 to 1053". Eaton says that the inscription is "hardly contemporary" and "presents a richly textured legend elaborated over many generations of oral transmission until 1455". He acknowledges that "Goel does, however, consider it more likely that the event took place during the reign of Raja [[Bhoja II (Paramara dynasty)|Bhoja II]] in the late thirteenth century rather than during that of Raja Bhoja I in the eleventh century." Richard Eaton thinks that "we cannot know with certainty" if the temple destruction did take place.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eaton: "Temple desecration and Indo-Muslim states", Essays on Islam and Indian History. Chapter Six&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton also claimed that Goel has used "selective translations of premodem Persian chronicles, together with a selective use of epigraphic data".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eaton: "Temple desecration and Indo-Muslim states", Essays on Islam and Indian History. Chapter Six&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vimal Yogi Tiwari, such an historical assessment as in Goel's book "Hindu Temples" has by and large been missing in India.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Vimal Yogi Tiwari in the Pioneer. Elst, Koenraad, Ayodhya and After: Issues Before Hindu Society (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goel's book also includes an exchange of comments between Romila Thapar and Goel.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix 4 of "Hindu Temples – What Happened to Them"&lt;/ref&gt; Romila Thapar has criticized Goel, claiming that he does not understand how to use historical sources, without actually refuting any of the facts presented by Goel.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar et al.: Communalism in the Waiting of Indian History, People's Publishing House, Delhi 1987 (1969), pp. 15–16, and repeated in her letter to Mr. Manish Tayal (UK), 7-2-1999, concerning Arun Shourie: Eminent Historians, ASA, Delhi 1998. Manish Tayal: "Romila Thapar's reply to 'Eminent Historians'", 16-2-1999. "Koenraad Elst ''[[Who is a Hindu?]]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ibrahimafall.jpg|thumb|250px|Ibrahima Fall]]
[[Sheikh]] '''Ibrahima Fall''' (1855–1930) was a disciple of Sheikh [[Amadou Bamba|Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke]], founder of the [[Mouride]] Brotherhood movement in [[West Africa]]. Well known in the Mouride Brotherhood, Ibrahima Fall established the influential [[Mouride#Baye Fall|Baye Fall]] movement.

Neil Savishinsky (1994) contends that Sheikh Ibrahima Fall is “one of the first and most illustrious of Ahmadu Bamba’s disciples”.&lt;ref name="Savishinsky"&gt;Savishinsky, J. N. (1994) The Bayed Fall of Senegambia: Muslim Rastas in the Promised Land? Africa: Journal International African Institute, 64, 211-219&lt;/ref&gt; The Bimestriel Islamique (2000, December) claims that [[French West Africa]] called him the minister of economic affairs in the Mouridism.&lt;ref name="Origines"&gt;Les origines de Cheikh Ibra Fall (2000, December). Touba’, Bimestriel Islamique d’Informations Générales. Retrieved May 25, 2007 from
[http://www.metissacana.sn/sites/touba/fall.html Cheikh Ibra Fall&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708042138/http://www.metissacana.sn/sites/touba/fall.html|date=2007-07-08}} at www.metissacana.sn&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahima Fall catalysed the [[Mouride]] movement. Fall led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride [[Talibes]] (Mouride disciples) and their guide, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of ''Dieuf Dieul'' “you reap what you sow”.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt;

Serigne Bassirou Mbacké, son of Sheikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, claims that Ibrahima Fall renovated the Mouride Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Mbacke"&gt;Mbacké, S. B. (1995) Intineraires du Bienfait (K. Mbacké, Trans.)
Dakar, Senegal: Imprimerie Saint Paul&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mbacké, Ibrahima Fall introduced giving money to Aamadu Bàmba.&lt;ref name="Mbacke" /&gt; Mourides follow this practice of giving money to their sheikh. Serigne Moussa Kâ understands that “Fall initiated devoting ones life to his [[Sheikh]] in search of aura ([[Wolof language|Wolof]] ''tarbiya'').&lt;ref name="Moussa"&gt;Kâ, S. M. (1930)  ﻝ ﻓﺍ ﮬﯿﻡ ﺍ ﺑﺮ ﺇ ﺸﺍﺥ  ﻡ ﻣﺎ ﯘﻟﻔﻝ  (the poetry of Cheikh Ibrahima Fall), Touba, Senegal : Imprimerie Serigne Issa Niang&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Diop (1980) confirms the great importance of Ibrahima Fall to Mouridism, stating that “Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba and Sheikh Ibrahima Fall realise the symbiosis of Mouride values, pray and work” .&lt;ref name="Diop"&gt;Diop, M. C. (1980). La Confrérie mouride: organisation politique et mode d’implentation urbaine. Lyon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Ibrahima Fall comes from an aristocratic [[Wolof people|Wolof]] family from Cayor. A scholar confirms that Fall came out of an [[animistic]] influenced Muslim tradition, but believes Fall’s family was prosperous and formerly powerful in [[Cayor]]. Other sources confirm that Fall’s grandfather, [[Damel]] Dethialaw, was a ruler of the [[Cayor]] kingdom.

=== Family and education ===
Ibrahima Fall was born around 1855 in a northern village, Ndiaby Fall, Cayor. His original ''tyeddo'' name was Yapsa Khanth Fall. Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke gave him later the name Ibrahima Fall. Ibrahima Fall was a son of Amadou Rokhaya Fall and Seynabou Ndiaye. At an early age, Ibrahima Fall learned the Qur'an in a neighbouring village, Ndiaré.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt;
Fall achieved major [[Arabic]] sciences such as [[theology]], [[fiqh]], [[tafsir]], grammar and rhetoric. Savishinsky (1994) tells us that Ibrahima Fall had “reputation for ferocity and extraordinary strength” &lt;ref name="Savishinsky" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;212). Another scholar claims that Fall was viewed as a troubled man who seldom went with his peers and often remained alone in the bush.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt; However, all agree that the turning point of his life was Fall’s search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke.

== In Search of Aamadu Bàmba ==
One major study of Ibrahima Fall reports that two versions exist of his search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba. In the first version, Fall is rich merchant who travelled in [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Jolof|Jolof]] and [[Saloum]]. But after meeting Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in [[Mbacké]] Bari, Fall gave up business to become Bamba’s disciple.

In the second version, which is more commonly believed in Senegal, Ibrahima Fall in 1882 went on looking to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Scholars state that Ibrahima Fall knew that his destiny dictated him to search for him. Without any knowledge of him, Ibrahima Fall went on looking for the best Muslim teachers. Ibrahima Fall tested Serigne Massamba Syll and after Serigne Adama Gueye. Adama Gueye conducted Ibrahima Fall through mystic ways to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in 1883.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt;

== Pact with Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke ==
The encounter between Ibrahima Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke defined the beginning of Mouridism.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt; Savishinsky claims “Fal (Ibra Faal) performed his obeisance to Ahmadu Bamba in crown-slave style disrobing and falling forward to the ground."&lt;ref name="Savishinsky" /&gt; Serigne Bassirou (1995) narrates the famous speech that Ibrahima Fall and Ahmadou Bamba exchanged:

Ibrahima Fall: “If I found only your gravestone, be aware that the force of my intention would satisfy my objective”

Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba: “If I found only the [[star]]s and the sky that [[Muhammad]] watched at, I’m sure that I could attain my objective with my strong love of the prophet [...] Know that from this life, I’ll neither protect you from sun nor provide you material goods. I accept you if you follow God recommendations”.&lt;ref name="Mbacke" /&gt;

In this way, the contract started between Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Ibrahima Fall became his 40th disciple. From this moment, Fall followed the ''Ndiguel'' "orders" of the Shaikh until Fall’s death.

== Introduction of Mouride Values ==
Within this contract called “Diebelou”, Savishinsky claims that Ibrahima Fall displayed an absolute, slave-like devotion to his master.&lt;ref name="Savishinsky" /&gt; His “pastef” (courage and devotion) served example for all Mourides. In fact, Fall started “growing food, cutting firewood, fetching water and building shelters and mosques” (p.&amp;nbsp;213). Likewise, Serigne Moussa Kâ tells us that Fall reshaped quickly the relation between a disciple and his guide. Ibrahima Fall instituted five rules of deference to the Sheikh:
# Never stand at the same level than Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke
# Never greet the Shaikh with your hat on your head
# Never walk in front of him
# Always do the “sudiot” (kiss his hands) with the Shaikh
# Always lower your voice in front of him
Ibrahima Fall himself supervised these rules.&lt;ref name="Moussa" /&gt;

== Physical Description ==
In appearance, Ibrahima Fall had matted locks. Fall carried a black cudgel especially for making people respecting these rules. Fall also smoked a Western African plant called “pone”. Moussa Kâ claims that Fall often begged in neighbour villages with a wood bowl, which was an unorthodox practice. When Mame Chiekh Ibra Fall was taking a haircut, S.Touba told him not to take a haircut today, because it is not a day to take a haircut and he didn't take a haircut because he didn't have permission.&lt;ref name="Moussa" /&gt;

== Contribution to Aamadu Bàmba's mission ==
In 1890, Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba nominated Fall the third responsible in the Mouride Brotherhood. Fall had to supervise all manual works. With the exile of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Fall’s life changed. He moved to [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], to defend the innocence of his Shaikh. During Fall’s negotiations with the French, Paul Marty recognised that Fall hid great intelligence.&lt;ref name="Origines" /&gt; Another scholar cites the multiple Arabic poetries of Ibrahima Fall to prove Fall’s intellectualism. Fall wrote also an [[Arabic]] book, ''Jazbul Mouride''.

=== Exile of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke ===
On 21 September 1895, the French exiled Aamadu Bàmba to [[Gabon]].&lt;ref name="Hizbut"&gt;Hizbut (2006). Retrieved June 07, 2007 from {{cite web |url=http://www.htcom.sn/spip/article.php3?id_article=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207090153/http://www.htcom.sn/spip/article.php3?id_article=55 |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamadu Bàmba ordered Ibrahima Fall to work for [[Sherif]] Hassan. He did so until 1901, when Sherif Hassan died. In this interval (1895–1901), Fall kept sending money (in [[Wolof language|Wolof]] “Adiya”) to the Shaikh until his return in 1902. On 11 November 1902, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke returned to [[Senegal]] and awarded Ibrahima Fall the degree of Sheikh.

=== Return of Aamadu Bàmba ===
In June 1912, the French kept Aamadu Bàmba under house arrest in Ndjarèem, [[Diourbel]].&lt;ref name="Ibrahima"&gt;Mame Cheikh Ibrahima Fall(2006). Le travail voie royale d'acces au paradis. Retrieved June 07, 2007 from http://mapage.noos.fr/alkhidmat/ibra.html&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall followed him to [[Diourbel]]. In Diourbel, Fall created a famous district, Keur Sheikh. In Keur Sheikh, the Baye Fall movement consolidated and expanded very quickly. Many ''tyeddo''s became his disciples. In 1925, the French banned construction of the Touba Mosque. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall enclosed the area of the mosque with timbers Fall carried from Ndjarèem to [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]].

In 1927, at the death of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall performed among the first obeisance to the Shaikh's son, Serigne Moustapha Mbacké. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall participated in the difficult creation of the railroads between [[Diourbel]] and [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]]. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall died 9 June 1930 after helping the succession of Aamadu Bàmba. He lies in Touba.&lt;ref name="Mouride"&gt;Mouride, (2005).

== Recognition by the Mouride Brotherhood ==
Sheikh Ibrahima Fall obviously helped Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke to expand Mouridism, particularly with Fall’s establishment of the Baye Fall movement. For this contribution, Serigne Fallou (2nd [[Caliph]] after Aamadu Bàmba) named him “Lamp Fall" (the light of Mouridism).&lt;ref name="Fallou"&gt;Ngom, F.(2002) Linguistic Resistance in the Murid speech community. Retrieved June 14, 2007 from http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/023/0214/jmmd0230214.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ibrahima Fall earned the title of “Babul Mouridina”, meaning "Gate of Mouridism".

{{nihongo|'''Iyomante'''|イヨマンテ|}} is an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ceremony in which a [[brown bear]] is raised for two years then [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]]d.  The word literally means "to send something/someone off". In some Ainu villages, it is a [[Blakiston's fish owl]], rather than a bear, that is sacrificed. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the ceremony is known as {{nihongo|"sending off the bear"|熊送り|kumaokuri|}} or, sometimes, {{nihongo|"the bear [[festival]]"|熊祭|kumamatsuri}}.

==Practice==
Trappers set out to the bear caves at the end of winter, while the bears are still hibernating.  If they find a newborn cub, they kill the mother and take the cub back to the village, where they raise it indoors, as if it were one of their own children.  It is said that they even provide the cub with their own breast milk.  When the cub grows larger, they take it outdoors, and put it into a small pen made of logs.  Throughout their lives, the bears are provided with high-quality food.  The cubs are treated as, and traditionally believed to be, gods.

After the cub reaches one or two years of age, they release it from the cell and place it in the center of the village, where it is tied to a post with a rope.  The males in the village then take shots at the cub with bows and arrows.  Even at the age of two years, the brown bears are quite large, and it usually takes numerous shots before they fall.  After the bear has been weakened from numerous arrow strikes and is too weak to defend itself, one villager will approach the bear and shoot it in the neck [[point-blank]], to ensure that it is dead.  The villagers then slit the bear's throat and drink the blood.  The bear is skinned, and the meat is distributed amongst the villagers. Its bare skull is placed on a spear, which is then rewrapped with the bear's own fur. This "doll" is  an object of worship for the villagers.  The bear has now been "sent off" to the world of the gods.

==Legality==
[[Hokkaido]] encouraged local governments to abolish the Iomante in 1955, but the circular notice was abolished in April 2007, because the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment of Japan]] announced that animal ceremonies were generally regarded as an exception of the [[animal rights]] law of Japan in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200704/CN2007042801000456.html|script-title=ja:イヨマンテ禁止通達を撤廃　アイヌ儀式、５２年ぶり|language=Japanese|work=47 News|publisher=Press Net Japan Co., Ltd.|date=April 28, 2007|accessdate=March 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722071300/http://www.47news.jp/CN/200704/CN2007042801000456.html|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] is a major [[religion]] in [[Israel]]. [[Muslim]]s, who are mostly [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizens of]] Israel, constitute 17.7% of the [[Israelis]],&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html Israel].

== History ==
{{further|Muslim history in Palestine|Islamization of Palestine|Islam in the Ottoman Empire}}

Islam was brought to the [[Palestine (region)|region of Palestine]] during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, when armies from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered a territory previously under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/islamhistory.htm A Concise History of Islam and the Arabs] MidEastWeb.org&lt;/ref&gt; that is [[Shaam]].{{efn|''[[Ash-Shām]]'' ({{lang-ar|اَلـشَّـام}}) is a region that is bordered by the [[Taurus Mountains]] of [[Anatolia]] in the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, the [[Arabian Desert]] in the south, and [[Mesopotamia]] in the east.&lt;ref name="KillebrewSteiner2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Killebrew, A.

Bosworth]], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Volume 9 (1997), page 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Salibi, K. S. |authorlink=Kamal Salibi |title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_amYLJq4SQC |year=2003 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-912-7 |pages=61–62 |quote=To the [[Arabs]], this same territory, which the Romans considered Arabian, formed part of what they called [[Bilad al-Sham]], which was their own name for [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s, there was actually a [[Syria Palestina|province of Syria]], with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like [[Arabia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] was no more than a geographic expression. In [[Islam]]ic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christian]] Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the [[Christianity|Christian]] Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of [[Western Europe]]. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in [[Muslim]] Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Middle Ages, the region became [[Islamization of Palestine|increasingly Islamized]]. This tendency was temporarily reversed during the 2 centuries of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], a Christian state established by [[Crusader states|European Crusaders]].{{fact|date=September 2017}} As a result of the [[rise of the Ottoman Empire]], from 1516 to 1917, the Sunni [[Ottoman Turks]] ruled the [[Levant]]. In [[Ottoman Palestine]], Islam was the state religion administered remotely from Constantinople, while Christians, Jews, and Samaritans were mostly tolerated as [[dhimmi]].

The [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|conquest of Palestine by British forces]] in 1917 and the subsequent [[Balfour Declaration]] opened the gates for the arrival of large numbers of Jews and Arabs and in to the [[Mandatory Palestine]]. However, the British transferred the symbolic Islamic governance of the land to the [[Hashemite]]s based in [[Jordan]], and not to the [[House of Saud]]. The Hashemites thus became the official guardians of the Islamic holy places of Jerusalem and the areas around it, particularly strong when Jordan controlled and illegally annexed the [[West Bank]] of the River Jordan (1948–1967). In 1922, the British created the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] in the Mandatory Palestine and appointed [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] (1895–1974) as the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The council was abolished in 1948.

The small [[Circassians|Circassian]] community is composed of Sunni Muslims uprooted from the [[Caucasus]] in the late 19th century. In addition, smaller populations of [[Kurds in Israel|Kurdish]], [[Dom people|Romani]] and [[Turks in Israel|Turkish]] Muslims also live in Israel.

=== Ahmadiyya ===
{{main|Ahmadiyya in Israel}}

The city of [[Haifa]] in Israel acts as the Middle East headquarters of the reformist [[Ahmadiyya]] Islamic movement. [[Kababir]], a mixed neighbourhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs is the only one of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haifatrail.com/haifa-trail-segment14-eng.htm#./images/sect-14/Haifa-Trail-Sect14-P1610817.jpg | title=Kababir and Central Carmel – Multiculturalism on the Carmel | accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visit-haifa.org/eng/Kababir | title=Visit Haifa | accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |title=Kababir |publisher=Israel and You |accessdate=26 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130170337/http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |archivedate=30 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sunni ===
Sunni Islam is by far the largest sect in the country. Most Israeli Muslims shared the same school of thought as with many Sunnis in the Levant that is [[Shafi'i]] even though there are also [[Hanafi]] presence as well. There is a strong community of [[Sufism|Sufis]] in several parts of the country and Sufism has garned popular attention to non-Muslim Israelis. An annual Sufi Festival in Ashram Desert in [[Negev]] is dedicated to Sufi arts and traditions.

=== Shia ===
{{main|Shia villages in Palestine}}
During the British rule in [[Mandatory Palestine]], it used to have seven Shia Twelver majority villages especially in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon before it was deserted during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in which the residents of those seven villages fled to neighbouring Lebanon as refugees. Because of this, Twelver Shias are very tiny minority in Israel.

=== Alawites ===
{{main|Ghajar}} 
There are around 4,000 Alawites in Israel and majority of them lives in [[Ghajar]] village in the occupied [[Golan Heights]] near the border with [[Lebanon]]. Most residents in Ghajar considered themselves as Syrian but majority of them have Israeli citizenship. They are currently the only Alawite community in Israel.

== Education ==
15% of Muslims in Israel have a college degree, which was lower than the number of Jews (33%), but similar to the number of Christians (18%) and Druze (20%) with a degree. The overwhelming majority of Muslims believe that giving their children a good secular education is very/somewhat important (93%). 53% of Muslims say “science and religion are in conflict,” which was lower than the number of Jews agreeing with that statement (58%). On the particular topic of evolution, 38% of Muslims believe humans and other living things have evolved over time. More Muslims in Israel believe in evolution than Christians (37%) and Druze (24%), but fewer than Jews (53%).&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;

== Religiosity, beliefs or practices ==
While Muslims living in Israel, overall, are more religious than Israeli Jews, they are less religious than Muslims living in many other countries in the Middle East. For example, about two-thirds of Muslims in Israel (68%) say religion is very important in their lives, which was similar to the number of Lebanese Muslims who agreed with that statement (59%), but lower than the share of Muslims in [[Jordan]] (85%), the [[Palestinian territories]] (85%) and [[Iraq]] (82%) who say this. Israeli Muslims nearly universally say they believe in Allah and his Prophet Muhammad (97%). A majority of Muslims say they pray daily (61%) and roughly half report that they go to a mosque at least once a week (49%). Muslim women are more likely to say that religion has high importance in their lives, and younger Muslims are generally less observant than their elders.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;

83% of Muslims in Israel fast during [[Ramadan]],&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt; which was the lowest among Muslims in any Middle Eastern country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/08/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf|title=The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity|date=9 August 2012|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 33% of Muslims believe that Jesus will return during their lifetime, which was similar to the number of Christians who held that belief (33%). When surveyed in 2015, Muslims were most comfortable with their child marrying outside of the faith compared to Jews, Christians, and Druze. The overwhelming majority of Muslims say that (97%) believe strong family relationships is very/somewhat important to them and the majority (68%) say having the opportunity to travel around the world is very/somewhat important. Younger Muslim adults are considerably more likely than older Muslims to say they value world travel. Among Muslims ages 18–49, 73% say having the opportunity to travel the world is very or somewhat important to them, compared with 52% of older Muslims.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;

== Discrimination ==
In a 2015 survey, one-third of Muslims report having experienced at least one incident of discrimination in the past 12 months including being questioned by security officials (17%), being prevented from traveling (15%), physically threatened or attacked (15%), or having suffered property damage (13%) because of their religion. However, about a quarter of Israeli Muslims (26%) say a Jewish person has expressed concern or sympathy toward them in the past year because of their religious identity.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;  Muslim and Christians within Israel have equal rights and many become parliamentarians, judges, diplomats, public health officials and IDF generals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/11/arabs-are-prominent-israels-government-deroy-murdock/|title=Arabs Are Prominent in Israel’s Government {{!}} National Review|date=2013-11-25|work=National Review|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam by country}}

[[Islam]] is the majority religion of [[the Gambia]], with around 95%  of the population being Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious societies are made up of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], and [[Traditional African religion]]. Islam in the Gambia is characterized by its coexistence with other religions. The majority of its Muslims are [[Sunni]] belonging to [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]], influenced with [[Sufism]]. The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement is also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_87_2.asp | title=Association of Religious Data Archives | accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some popular religious and tribal practices diverge from mainstream Islam, with a system of [[marabout]] societies being very common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">The '''Jewish Reconstructionist Federation''' ('''JRF'''), founded in 1955, was the [[synagogue]] arm of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], serving more than 100 congregations and havurot spread across [[North America]]. As of June 3, 2012, the JRF web site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org jrf.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was no longer being updated and was re-directing users to the new web site of the Jewish Reconstructionist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishrecon.org jewishrecon.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the Reconstructionist movement underwent a restructuring that brought JRF into closer relationship with the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] (RRC). RRC became the primary national organization of the movement, headed at the time by Rabbi [[Dan Ehrenkrantz]], a 1989 graduate of the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rrc.edu/node/1193 |title=Movement Restructuring FAQs |publisher= Reconstructonist Rabbinical College |date=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/25852/Do_the_Jewish_Streams_Have_a_Future/ |title=Do the Jewish Streams Have a Future? |publisher= The Jewish Exponent |date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Rabbi [[Deborah Waxman]], became the RRC president.

'''Joseph L. Lichten''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Józef L. Lichten) (June 6, 1906 – December 1, 1987) was a [[Polish Americans|Polish-American]] lawyer and diplomat. He is known for his contributions in interfaith relations between [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Jews]].

==Early life and studies==
Born Józef Lichtensztul in a Jewish family in Poland, he received his Doctor of Law degree from the University of Warsaw, and engaged in international diplomacy for the Polish government. He also obtained a PhD in Catholic [[canon law]].

==Diplomatic career==
From 1941-1945 he served as a consultant and advisor on eastern European affairs to the embassy of the Polish government in exile. When the Communists took control of his native country, he left its diplomatic service and became an American citizen.

==Interfaith work==
In 1953, he participated in the very first interfaith conference sponsored by the [[anti-Defamation League]]. He organized hundreds of such conferences over the years with prominent figures in the Catholic clergy and laity.

In 1963, shortly after the initial production of [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s play, [[The Deputy]], and while serving as director of the International Affairs Department for the ADL, he wrote a monograph defending the actions of Pope [[Pius XII]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/piusdef2.html A Question of Judgment: Pius XII &amp; the Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Pope John Paul II named him a knight commander of the pontifical equestrian order of St. Gregory the Great for improving relations between the Church and society, the first American Jew to be so honored.

==Legacy==
The Anti-Defamation League's Dr. [[Joseph L. Lichten Award in Catholic-Jewish Relations]] was established in 2005 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of ''[[Nostra aetate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/lichten_award.asp ADL Dr. Joseph L.

[[File:Decorated Ketubbah, Livorno, 1698.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] ketubah]]
A '''ketubah''' ({{Hebrew Name 1|כְּתוּבָּה||"written thing"}}; pl. ''ketubot'') is a special type of [[Jewish prenuptial agreement]]. It is considered an integral part of a traditional [[Jewish views of marriage|Jewish marriage]], and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom, in relation to the bride. In modern practice, the ketubah has no agreed monetary value, and is never enforced, except in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/KETUBAH.pdf The Value and Significance of the Ketubah]," Broyde, Michael and Jonathan Reiss. Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society, XLVII, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[rabbi]]s in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into the ''ketubah'' as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical ''mohar''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|34:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:16–17|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:29|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hosea|2:19–20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the [[bride price]]). The ''ketubah'' became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid in the event of the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]]. The biblical ''mohar'' created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the ''mohar'' at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they would be more likely to have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the ''mohar'' to be a part of the ''ketubah''. Both the ''mohar'' and the ''ketubah'' amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to [[alimony]] in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ''ketubah'' amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating [[Get (divorce document)|divorcing]] his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.

Over two hundred ''ketubot'' were discovered, among other manuscripts, in the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/search?keyword=ketubba|title=Search for 'ketubba'|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They date between the 6th and 19th centuries and, whilst many consist of plain text, there are examples that utilise decorative devices such as [[micrography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal document: ketubba (T-S 8.90)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TS-00008-00090/1|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal document: ketubba (T-S 16.106)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TS-00016-00106/1|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to elaborate them.

==Composition==

=== Content ===
The content of the ''ketubah'' is in essence a one-way contract that formalizes the various requirements by [[Halakha]] (Jewish law)  of a Jewish husband ''vis à vis'' his wife. The Jewish husband takes upon himself in the ''ketubah'' the obligation that he will provide to his wife three major things: clothing, food and conjugal relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosher Sex|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm|work = Judaism 101|accessdate = 29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that he will pay her a pre-specified amount of cash in the case of a divorce. Thus the content of the ''ketubah'' essentially dictates security and protection for the woman, and her rights in the marriage. ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jews]] often include an additional paragraph, called the [[Lieberman clause]], which stipulates that divorce will be adjudicated by a modern rabbinical court (a [[beth din]]) in order to prevent the creation of a [[agunah|chained wife]].) 

==== Bat-Kohen variation ====
{{Main|Bat-Kohen}}

The [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud Bavli]] record that the "Beth-Din of Kohanim" would oversee that the Ketubah of a Bat-Kohen would contract the amount of four hundred [[Zuz (Jewish coin)|Zuz]] (an increase from the standard amount of two hundred Zuz) in the event the Bat-Kohen would be given a [[Get (divorce document)|Get]] (bill of divorce)&lt;ref&gt;limited to a Bat-Kohen virgin whereas an [[Almanah]] (widow) would receive the standard one hundred Zuz&lt;/ref&gt; – the increase was written as the base amount due the Bat-Kohen and not penned as a bonus.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Ketuboth chap. 1 halacha 5, Bavli Ketuboth p. 12b&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Talmud Yerushalmi]] opines that the Bat-Kohen who marries a non-Kohen receives that standard two hundred Zuz amount, as a penalty for not marrying within the greater family of Kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;Yerushalmi to Ketuboth 1:5 (p. 6a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the research of A. Epstien, in his work "Toldot HaKetubah B'Yisrael", the recording of Four hundred Zuz in the Ketubah of the Bat-Kohen was well in effect during the [[Amoraim|Amora]] period, but from thence onward, no mentioning of the increased amount is found in Rabbinic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Toldot HaKetubah B'Yisrael, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and language===

[[File:Ketuba for Benjamin Levy and Esther Solomon.jpg|thumb|Wedding certificate for Esther Solomon and Benjamin Levy, [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], 1 June 1842, witnessed by Alfred Hort and [[Nathaniel William Levin]].]]
The ketubah is a significant popular form of [[Jewish ceremonial art]]. Ketubot have been made in a wide range of designs, usually following the tastes and styles of the era and region in which they are made. Many couples follow the Jewish tradition of ''hiddur mitzvah'' which calls for ceremonial objects such as the ketubah to be made as beautiful as possible.

Traditional ''ketubot'' are not written in the [[Hebrew language]], but in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the [[lingua franca]] of Jews at the time ''ketubot'' became standardized. This was done in order to make sure the bride and groom understood the contract that was being signed.  Many contemporary ''ketubot'' have translations into English or other vernacular languages or an accompanying vernacular text.  Many [[Conservative Jews]] and other non-Orthodox Jews use ketubot written in Hebrew rather than in Aramaic.  Others may use Aramaic ketubot but also have an additional official version in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamant|first=Anita|title=The New Jewish Wedding|date=2001|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9780743202558|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years kettubot have become available in a variety of formats as well as the traditional Aramaic text used by the Orthodox community.  Available texts include Conservative text, using the [[Lieberman Clause]], Reform, Egalitarian and Interfaith texts.  Some congregations have texts available for same sex couples too. In addition, Secular Humanist and Anniversary texts are also available today.

== Usage ==

===Role in wedding ceremony===
[[File:Opperrabbijn Jacobs ondertekend.jpg|thumb|left|Rabbi filling in the final details of a ketubah]]
In a traditional [[Jewish wedding|Jewish wedding ceremony]], the ''ketubah'' is signed by two witnesses and traditionally read out loud under the [[chuppah]]. Close family, friends or distant relatives are invited to witness the ketubah, which is considered an honour. The witnesses must be halakhically valid witnesses, and so cannot be a blood relative of the couple. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], women are also not considered to be valid witnesses.  The ketubah is handed to the bride for safekeeping.

===Display===

Ketubot are often hung prominently in the home by the married couple as a daily reminder of their vows and responsibilities to each other.

However, in some communities, the ketubah is either displayed in a very{{clarify|date=April 2016}} private section of the home or is not displayed at all. Various reasons given for this include the fact that the details specify personal details, prominent display may invite jealousy or fears of the [[evil eye]]. Historically, the ketubah specified whether the bride was a virgin. In [[Sephardic]] communities, it still specifies the actual contributions of the family to the new household and the divorce settlement; [[Ashkenazi]] communities have adopted the custom of having set amounts for all weddings.

===Conditio sine qua non===
According to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], spouses are prohibited from living together if the ketubah has been destroyed, lost, or is otherwise unretrievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/cs/jewishweddings/f/ketubah.htm |title=What is a Ketubah? |publisher=about.com |first=Lisa |last=Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Even Haezer]] 66:3&lt;/ref&gt; In such case a second ketubah is made up (called a Ketubah De'irketa&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/211,2279592/What-happens-if-a-ketubah-is-lost.html&lt;/ref&gt;), which states in its opening phrase that it comes to substitute a previous ketubah that has been lost.

'''Kicking Bear''' (March 18, 1846 – May 28, 1904), also called '''Matȟó Wanáȟtaka''',&lt;ref&gt;'''''Matȟó Wanáȟtáka''''', pronounced / matȟó wanáȟtaka /.  See [[Lakota language]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ullrich| first = Jan | title = New Lakota Dictionary: ''New Lakota Dictionary''. Lakota Language Consortium. {{ISBN|0-9761082-9-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] who became a band chief of the  [[Miniconjou]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]]. He fought in several battles with his brother, [[Flying Hawk]] and first cousin, [[Crazy Horse]] during the [[Great Sioux War of 1876|War for the Black Hills]], including [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Greasy Grass]].

Kicking Bear was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877. The ceremony was held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the victory at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Greasy Grass]], and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kadlecek and Mabell Kadlecek, ''To Kill An Eagle: Indian Views on the Last Days of Crazy Horse'', 1981, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The five warrior cousins were brothers Kicking Bear, [[Flying Hawk]] and Black Fox II, all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;"Young Black Fox was the half brother of Kicking Bear and Flying Hawk.  On September 4, 1877, Young Black Fox commanded Crazy Horse's warriors in his absence.  The courage displayed on that occasion earned him the respect of both Indians and whites alike.  In the same year Young Black Fox sought sanctuary in Canada, but he was killed on his return to the United States in 1881 by Indians of an enemy tribe."  See McCreight, ''Firewater and Forked Tongues: A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History'', (1947), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The five warrior cousins were braves considered vigorous battle men of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Kadlecek,p.143.  Also, see Kingsley M. Bray, ''Crazy Horse: A Lakota Life'', 2006, P.314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kicking Bear was also a [[medicine man|holy man]] active in the [[Ghost Dance]] religious movement of 1890, and had traveled with fellow Lakota [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]] to visit the movement's leader, [[Wovoka]] (a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] holy man living in [[Nevada]]). The three Lakota men were instrumental in bringing the movement to their people who were living on reservations in [[South Dakota]]. Following the murder of [[Sitting Bull]], Kicking Bear and Short Bull were imprisoned at [[Fort Sheridan, Illinois]]. Upon their release in 1891, both men joined ''[[Buffalo Bill Cody|Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show]]'', and toured with the show in Europe. That experience was humiliating to him {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. After a year-long tour, Kicking Bear returned to the Pine Ridge Reservation to care for his family. In March 1896, Kicking Bear traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] as one of three Sioux delegates taking grievances to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. He made his feelings known about the drunken behavior of traders on the reservation, and asked that Native Americans have more ability to make their own decisions. While in Washington, Kicking Bear agreed to have a life mask made of himself. The mask was to be used as the face of a Sioux warrior to be displayed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]]. A gifted artist, he painted his account of the Battle of Greasy Grass at the request of artist [[Frederic Remington]] in 1898, more than twenty years after the battle. Kicking Bear was buried with the arrowhead as a symbol of the ways he so dearly desired to resurrect when he died on May 28, 1904. His remains are buried somewhere in the vicinity of Manderson-White Horse Creek.

The '''Lead Books of Sacromonte''' ({{lang-es|Los Libros Plúmbeos del Sacromonte}}) are a series of texts inscribed on circular [[lead]] leaves, now considered to be 16th century [[forgery|forgeries]].

==History==
The Lead Books were discovered in the caves of [[Sacromonte]], a hillside outside the old city of [[Granada]], Spain, between 1595 and 1606. They originally comprised 22 volumes of inscribed circular lead leaves, laced together with lead wire and bound within folded lead covers; although three volumes no longer survive. The books were found together with burned human remains, identified by lead plaques as being those of [[Caecilius of Elvira]] and eleven followers, supposedly martyred under the Emperor [[Nero]]. References in the books claim that they were inscribed by Arabic-speaking Christians during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period, and deposited with the martyrs' remains.

The Lead Books appeared to be written in a combination of Arabic and Latin, using characters that 16th century [[Morisco]] scholars claimed to recognise as "Solomonic" and which they identified as pre-Islamic Arabic. Many letter forms were uncertain, and the texts themselves were cryptic and obscure, so the Catholic authorities found themselves entirely reliant on Morisco translators; chief amongst whom were [[Miguel de Luna]] and [[Alonso del Castillo]], who by fortunate chance lived in the nearby [[Albaicin]], and who had indeed been instrumental in the rediscovery of some of the books. One complete book, the so-called "Libro Mudo", or "Mute Book", has remained undeciphered and untranslated to this day.

As reported by the Christian Morisco translators, the books recorded the prophetic and liturgical teachings of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], chiefly addressed through [[Saint Peter]], in which she gave instructions for [[Saint James the Great]] and [[Caecilius of Elvira|Saint Caecilius]] to be dispatched on a mission to evangelise Spain, stating her love for the Arabic peoples and language of that land, and promising her particular guardianship over the city of Granada. Taken together, the books may be regarded as a supplement to the canonical [[Acts of the Apostles]] (and taken together, are indeed of similar length), but recording an alternative mission history in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] does not appear. The Virgin's words had apparently been delivered in Latin, but were claimed to have been translated and interpreted into Arabic by Caecilius. The texts include an explicit reference, in Latin, to the [[Counter-Reformation]] formulation of the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] (''Mariam non comprehendit peccatum originale''), but also employ terminology otherwise closer to Islamic formulae: "God is One. There is no God but God, and Jesus is the Spirit of God."

A consistent theme is to emphasise Arabic as an ancient language of Spain, Arabs in Granada as the first Christians in Spain, and Christianity as the true religion of the Arabs. The form of Christianity presented is such as to be highly acceptable to [[Catholics]] in Granada, emphasising the veneration of relics, the cult of the Virgin, and the priority of Granada as a Christian bishopric, but also downplaying some aspects of Christianity that were most repugnant to [[Islam|Muslims]], including the cult of [[icons]], the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], the worship of [[Jesus]] as the incarnate Son of God and the use of wine in the [[Eucharist]].

The discovery of the books, and the associated relics, proved to be the occasion of numerous miracles that confirmed their authenticity in the sight of the local population and of the church authorities in Granada, and attracted royal support from both [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].

==Analysis==
Early 17th century [[Protestant]] scholars in [[the Netherlands]] also took a keen interest, but their characterisation of the Lead Books as a blatant fabrication only served to discredit dissenting opinions within Catholic Spain by association with [[heresy]]. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] remained highly sceptical of the texts, however, and in 1642 succeeded in having the Lead Books sent to Rome, together with an associated "ancient" parchment which had been discovered in 1588 in a lead box in the tower of a former mosque in the city of Granada itself. A prolonged investigation by the [[Holy Office]] in Rome concluded in 1682 that both the parchment and the Lead Books were heretical forgeries. While the Vatican's condemnation did not implicate any specific individuals, scholarly consensus since the sixteenth century is that the forgers were probably Luna and Castillo, the same two Moriscos who had translated many of the texts. While further discussion of the books by Catholics was officially forbidden, some Spanish scholars continued to maintain the authenticity of the texts through till the 19th century. The Lead Books were kept in the Vatican, but eventually returned to the Abbey of the Sacromonte in the year 2000. The Church authorities in Granada continue to forbid scholarly access however, on the grounds that the official prohibition remains in force. Current studies depend on the various (often partial and highly contradictory) transcripts and translations made at the time of the books' discovery, and on some independent decipherments produced by Vatican Arabists.

Almost all scholars now concur with the official verdict and believe that the books are a forgery intended to promote toleration of the language, dress and customs of Christian Moriscos in the face of increasing hostility from the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] state. If so, this exercise was unsuccessful in its general objective, as it did not avoid the order of expulsion of the Moriscos which was carried out between 1604 and 1609. Both Castillo and Luna escaped the expulsion, as the [[archbishop of Granada]], Pedro de Vaca de Castro y Quiñones, grateful for the immense increase in the prestige of his see arising from the discovery of the relics of St Caecilius, extended his personal protection to them and their families. Many of the deported Moriscos remained convinced of the books' authenticity however, and transcripts continued to circulate within [[Tunisia]], until this practice was forcibly suppressed by Islamic religious authorities there.

The authenticity of the bones and ashes of the 12 martyrs was never officially challenged, and they continue to be venerated in the Abbey that Archbishop Castro built on the spot. Hence the legend has acquired a moral function directly contrary to the intention of its presumed original propagators; far from validating the authentically Spanish identity of Granada's Morisco traditions, the legend has served to sanction and celebrate the supersession of those traditions.

{{about|Eastern Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch since 518|Patriarchs prior to 518|List of Patriarchs of Antioch before 518|Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch from 1724|List of Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch}}

The '''[[Patriarch of Antioch]]''' is one of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[patriarch]]s, the leader of the [[autocephalous]] [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]]. The term "Greek" does not refer to ethnic origin (the majority of these patriarchs were not ethnic Greeks), but to the fact that this church follows the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] Orthodoxy associated with the (Greek-speaking) [[Byzantine Empire]]. Since 518, there have been two Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch: the Chalcedonian ones listed here, and the non-Chalcedonian [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30398">This is a '''list of notable [[mosque]]s in the United States of America'''.

==Selected history of mosques in the United States==

A [[mosque]], or [[masjid]], can be defined as any place that Muslims pray facing to Mecca, and is not necessarily a building; by that meaning, there were mosques in the United States by 1731 or earlier. Muslim [[Job ben Solomon]] (1701–1773), an African-American who was kidnapped into slavery in [[Senegal]] or [[Gambia]], is documented by his [[slave narrative]] memoir to have prayed in the forest of [[Kent Island]], [[Maryland]], where he was brought during 1731–33.&lt;ref name=fivemyths/&gt;

Some sources assert that what is likely the first American mosque building was a mosque in [[Biddeford, Maine]] that was founded in 1915 by [[Albanian-Americans|Albanian Muslims]]. A Muslim cemetery still existed there in 1996.&lt;ref name=queen&gt;{{cite book |author=Queen, Edward L., Stephen Prothero and Gardiner H. Shattuck Jr.|year=1996 |title=The Encyclopedia of American Religious History |publisher=New York: Facts on File}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghazali&gt;{{Cite news | last = Ghazali | first = Abdul Sattar | title = The Mosques in America: A National Portrait by CAIR: The number of mosque attendants increasing rapidly in America | newspaper = American Muslim Perspective | url = http://www.amp.ghazali.net/html/mosques_in_us.html | date = August 4, 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142701/http://www.amp.ghazali.net/html/mosques_in_us.html | archivedate = September 28, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the first "purpose-built" mosque building was probably a mosque opened in 1921 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It was close to the famous [[Highland Park Ford Plant]] which began mass, assembly-line production of [[Ford Model T]] cars in 1913, and where "hundreds of Arab American men" came to work. This mosque included [[Sunni]], [[Shiite|Shia]] and [[Ahmadi]] Muslims, and was funded by Muhammad Karoub, a real estate developer.&lt;ref name=fivemyths&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/26/AR2010082605510.html |title=Five myths about mosques in America |author=Edward E. Curtis IV |date=August 29, 2010 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mother Mosque of America]], built in 1934 in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], is asserted to be the oldest still-existing mosque building in the U.S. Also is asserted to be the oldest standing mosque in the U.S. is the [[Al-Sadiq Mosque]], built in 1922 in the [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]].

[[Nation of Islam]] mosques, mostly of African Americans, are often in storefronts or former churches.&lt;ref name=fivemyths/&gt;

It has been estimated that there were somewhat more than 100 mosques in the U.S. in 1970, but immigration of more than a million Muslims since then led to hundreds more being built.&lt;ref name=fivemyths/&gt;

In 1994, the [[Islamic Center of Yuba City]], in California, was destroyed by fire set in a hate-crime, and is one of two mosques destroyed by a hate-crime in U.S. history, (the second being in [[Joplin, Missouri]] in 2012) . It had just been completed at cost of $1.8 million plus sweat equity of the Muslims of its rural community, including descendants of Pakistani who immigrated to the area {{circa}} 1902. Its story, including its rebuilding, is told in [[David Washburn]]'s 2012 documentary film ''[[An American Mosque (documentary)|An American Mosque]]''.&lt;ref name=anamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=An American Mosque |url=http://www.anamericanmosque.com/ }} documentary produced by [[David Washburn]] and accompanying website (documentary first aired nation-wide on PBS July 11, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a book on "the American Mosque" appeared.&lt;ref name=kahera&gt;{{cite book|author=Akel Ismail Kahera |title=Deconstructing the American Mosque: Space, Gender, and Aesthetics |year=2002 |publisher=[[University of Texas Press|UT Press]] |url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/kahdec }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall number of mosques in the United States rose from 1,209 in 2000 to 2,106 in 2010, an increase of 74%.&lt;ref name=usatoday1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-02-29/islamic-worship-growth-us/53298792/1 |title=Islamic places of worship in U.S. up 74% since 2000 – USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Ground Zero mosque]]", a planned mosque in lower Manhattan, was the subject of controversy from 2010 on. In September 2011, a temporary {{convert|4000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} Islamic center opened in renovated space at the site,&lt;ref name="opens"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://culture.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/sep/21/park-51-gallery-show/|title=Park 51 Opens Renovated Space with Photo Exhibit of NYC Immigrant Children|author=Abbie Fentress Swanson|work=WNYC Culture|date=September 21, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924200759/http://culture.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/sep/21/park-51-gallery-show/|archivedate=September 24, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current plans are for a museum to be built, instead of a mosque.

A 2011 study, ''The American Mosque 2011'', sponsored by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research (Hartford Seminary), the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, as well as the nation's largest Islamic civic and religious groups, including the [[Islamic Society of North America]] and the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], found that the U.S. States with the most mosques were New York (257), California (246), and Texas (166).&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;

Through 2014, a building boom for mosques has been going on.&lt;ref name=boom&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=August 14, 2014 |author=Tamara Audi |title=A New Mosque Rises—in Alaska: Construction Is Part of a Building Boom Nationwide as Muslim Population Rises}} (see [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-mosque-risesin-alaska-1408051159 intro])&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous ones mentioned for their architecture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Import, Adapt, Innovate: Mosque Design in the United States |author=Omar Khalidi |journal=Aramco World |year=2001 |url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200106/import.adapt.innovate-mosque.design.in.the.united.states.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Litochoro''' ({{lang-el|Λιτόχωρο}}, ''Litóchoro''; [[Katharevousa]]: Λιτόχωρον) is a town and a former municipality in the southern part of the [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria regional unit]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the [[Dio-Olympos]] municipality, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the base of [[Mount Olympus]], on the western shore of the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. The first recorded mention of Litochoro is in an account of a visit by Saint Dionysius (Greek: Άγιος Διονύσιος) to Mount Olympus in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimos Diou olympou|url=http://www.dion-olympos.com/index.php/styles/litohoro|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town is a popular destination for those wishing to climb Mount Olympus as almost all climbing routes begin to the southwest of the town. A famous son of the town was [[Christos Kakkalos]], who ascended first Mount Olympos in 1913.

==Geography and information==
Litochoro is located 22&amp;nbsp;km S of [[Katerini]], 90&amp;nbsp;km SSW of [[Thessaloniki]], 58&amp;nbsp;km N of [[Larissa]] and 420&amp;nbsp;km WNW of [[Athens]], on the eastern slopes of Mount Olympus, of mythological fame as the home of the twelve gods of Olympus. Two important ancient sites are located in the neighbourhood of Litochoro. [[Dion, Pieria|Dion]] with its large [[Archaeological Park of Dion|archaeological park]] and a [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|museum]] is located about 8 km to the north. [[Leivithra]] with its acropolis and the Leivithra Park is about 9 km to the south. The municipal unit has an area of 169.632 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pine, cedar and fir trees of the forests of Mount Olympus lie to the southwest and northwest. Much of the land around Litochoro, in particular to the South, remains uncultivated. Farmland is predominant to the North.  Litochoro has several restaurants and cafeterias.

Litochoro has [[school]]s, [[bank]]s, a [[post office]], a [[harbour]], a [[sports centre]], a [[town hall]], a [[hospital]], a [[museum]], a [[concert hall]], a gym, shopping facilities and squares. There are two main churches: Agios Nikolaos in the centre and Agios Dimitrios in the North. Litochoro has one of the most traditional cemeteries of Greece, known as ''Agios Athanasios'', in the north of the town.

==Settlements==

=== {{anchor|Plaka}} Pláka===
An extended coastal area known as '''[[Plaka, Pieria|Pláka]]''' or '''Pláka Litochorou''' (Πλάκα Λιτοχώρου) is located east of the town of Litochoro, spreading from the foot of Olympus to the [[Thermaic Gulf]] and extending from [[w:Leptokarya|Leptokarya]] in the south to [[#Gritsa|Gritsa]] in the north. The [[European route E75|E75]] highway passes through the area of Plaka to the south of Litochoro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pieria-tourism.gr/Beach-south-3en.html|title=Plaka Litochoro|publisher=Pieriki Anaptyxiaki S.A|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coast mainly consists of sandy beaches with seaside resorts as well as hotels, campsites, restaurants, and beach bars (which mostly operate during the summer season from June to September). In the area of Plaka there are private residences, luxurious villas, and cottages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaka Litochoro|url=http://villalitochoro.wordpress.com/location/|work=Villa Litochoro|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gritsa===
North-east of Litochoro (North from Pláka) the coastal area continues, known by the name '''Gritsa''' or '''[[Limenas Litochorou]]''' extending from Pláka in the south to the community of Variko in the north. Sandy beaches can be also found here&lt;!-- (as in Pláka)--&gt; but the tourist facilities are much less than Pláka's. Yet here are some cottages and a luxury hotel (Dion resort). Gritsa is also the port of Litochoro, even though its capacity is restricted.

==Access and transport==
[[File:Mount Olympus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of the peaks of [[Mount Olympus]] from Litochoro.]]
Since the 1960s Litochoro has been served by an interchange with [[Greek National Road 1|GR-1]]/[[European route E75|E75]] to its east. In the mid-1990s, parts of the Greek national road from Athens to Thessaloniki were upgraded to motorway standard. Litochoro is on the Northern stretch of this 6 lane dual carriageway, 90&amp;nbsp;km from Thessaloniki. Its nearest beach is 5&amp;nbsp;km to the east. &lt;br&gt;
There is a regular bus service to [[Katerini]] and a local train service (3 trains daily in each direction) to [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Larissa]], where there is an interchange with the main line to [[Athens]]. Because Litochoro railway station is about 6&amp;nbsp;km away from Litochoro and 1&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest bus stop, people wishing to take the train often take the bus to [[Katerini]] and take the train from there. Taxis are to be found in abundance.
* Litochoro acquired some fame during the 1999 [[NATO]] war in [[Yugoslavia]] when allied naval forces arrived on the beach of Gritsa; an action which provoked a reaction by the town's [[Communism|Communists]] and many people took part in it. The event was broadcast live on [[CNN International]].

Also called "Mother Maya," she is an international teacher of [[Ayurveda]], a health activist and the founder of the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda and Mother Om Mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The author has posted comments on this article |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-30/holistic-living/29599273_1_food-body-natural-foods-sadhana |title=Food sadhanas - The Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maya Tiwari was born in Guyana, the daughter of [[Brahmin]] priest Pandit Bhagawan Ramprasad Tiwari, whose family originated from [[Lucknow, India]].&lt;ref name=Healing09&gt;The Everyday Miracle of Healing, Shift!, Winter 2008–2009, by Elliott-Escobedo, Catherine&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, she became a [[fashion designer]] in New York City at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News, December 20, 1999, by Richardson, Clem&lt;/ref&gt; Her fashion and "Maya" boutique was a prominent store at 773 [[Madison Avenue]], [[New York City]]  where she served clientele like [[Jackie Onassis]], [[Princess Diana]], Nureyev, and [[Patti La Belle]] among other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayatiwari.com/fashion-pics.php |title=Renowned Spiritual Teacher &amp;#124; Ayurveda Pioneer &amp;#124; Vedic Scholar &amp;#124; International Author &amp;#124; Founder of the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda, Mother Om Mission, Living Ahimsa Foundation |publisher=Maya Tiwari |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her designs were featured in stores such as [[Bergdorf Goodman]], [[Henri Bendel]]'s, and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] to [[Harrods]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Himalayan Academy |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3615 |title=Making it Fashionable to Walk Through Fire - Magazine Web Edition &gt; May 1996 - Publications - Hinduism Today Magazine |publisher=Hinduismtoday.com |date=2016-04-06 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Maya established the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda, the first school for [[Ayurveda]] studies in North America, based in the knowledge of the Greater [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=wisearth.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisearth.org/ayurveda/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625033528/http://wisearth.org/ayurveda/index.html |archivedate=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Practice, Ballantine Books 2000"&gt;The Path of Practice, Ballantine Books, (2000, 1st Ed.) by Tiwari, Maya {{ISBN|978-0-345-43030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sunday 6pm Repeated: Wednesday 9pm |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/spiritofthings/stories/2008/2154871.htm |title=Mother Maya - The Spirit of Things - ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Mother's Day in 1998, Tiwari founded the Mother Om Mission (MOM), a [[nonprofit organization]] that provides Ayurveda education and services to at-risk communities in New York's [[inner city|inner cities]] and [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name="themysticmasala.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themysticmasala.com/panchaq/maya-tiwari/ |title=Maya Tiwari &amp;#124; The Mystic Masala Aromatherapy |publisher=Themysticmasala.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Tiwari was a featured speaker at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia.

In 2010 Maya Tiwari renounced her monastic title and spiritual honorific—Her Holiness, Sri Swami Mayatitananda—to, as she puts it, “walk a simpler and more accessible life in service of the populations in need." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/public/mothermaya/blog/Spiritual-Teacher-Mother-Maya-on-Living-Ahimsa-World-Tour |title=Spiritual Teacher Mother Maya on World Tour |website=Speakingtree.in |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Maya Tiwari was the opening guest on the radio show 'Unlock Your Health', where in she recorded a series of four interviews on her cancer healing journey. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uyhradio.com/archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mandala==
Among the healing programs developed by Tiwari is The Peace Mandala, a program in where she leads hundreds of people worldwide in the creation of Peace Mandalas created from seeds and grains "to help generate inner harmony by reconnecting to nature's seed memory of wellness and love." The purpose of The Peace Mandalas is "to re-enliven humanity's memory of inner harmony and the awareness necessary to cooperate with and celebrate Mother Earth's profound gifts to humanity. Living Ahimsa brings awareness to the preservation of the seed-memory of nature, human sentiency and the integrity of Mother Earth."  She appeared at Deepak Chopra's "Seduction of Spirit" meditation event in Toronto, Canada in August 2014 where she led the attendees through the creation of making a Peace Mandala.&lt;ref name="themysticmasala.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chopracenter/2014/04/10/the-purpose-of-the-mandala-with-maya-tiwari-and-gordon-mcgregor |title=The Purpose of the Mandala with Maya Tiwari and Gordon McGregor 04/09 by The Chopra Center &amp;#124; Self Help Podcasts |publisher=Blogtalkradio.com |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalmeditation.chopra.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908223520/http://globalmeditation.chopra.com/ |archivedate=September 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahimsalifecanada.ca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807050532/http://ahimsalifecanada.ca/ |archivedate=August 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour and Oath==
In December 2009, at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia, Tiwari began The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour and has traveled to several countries leading people in taking an oath of [[ahimsa]], which means non-harm or peace. ([[Mahatma Gandhi]] is a key world figure who promoted ahimsa as a vehicle for creating change.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/nonviolence.shtml |title=Ethics - War: Non-violence |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Living Ahimsa Peace Tour's aim is "teaching the cultivation of harmony and nonviolence in thought, speech, and action, with the purpose of healing individuals and safeguarding Mother Earth and the world." Tiwari states, 'The world can't engender peace until we as individuals . . . discover the state of inner harmony within us.' As of September 2014, Maya Tiwari has been on The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour for six years. 154,665 people have taken the oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypeacevow.org/tour_2013.php |title=Maya Tiwari &amp;#124; Living Ahimsa World Tour |publisher=My Peace Vow |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|sZhNZ7nwXdU}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism Today]] writes, "The Living Ahimsa Vrata mission makes the spirit of [[nonviolence]] a palpable reality for individuals [...] The vow can be taken in person or online. Central to the vow is a thirty-minute meditation twice a day. [[Om|Aum]] is chanted 108 times, two times, followed by contemplation on key Hindu Vedic verses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Himalayan Academy |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5068 |title=Global Dharma - Magazine Web Edition &gt; April/May/June 2010 - Publications - Hinduism Today Magazine |publisher=Hinduismtoday.com |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiwari's Inner Medicine Healing principle informs the curricula of Wise Earth Ayurveda education. Tiwari says that "Inner Medicine Healing is based on the concept that each one of us has the ability to heal ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Women's Power to Heal, Mother Om Media, 2007, 2010 by Maya Tiwari {{ISBN|978-0-9793279-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key part of her teachings is The Cosmic Memory Principle, which refers to achieving healing through the collective timeless memories of all species and life forms in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Reclaiming Your Cosmic Memory of Ahimsa, 2009 by Tiwari, Maya&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mazu''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox--&gt; also known by [[#Names|several other names and titles]], is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] [[sea goddess]]. She is the [[apotheosis|deified form]] of the purported historical '''Lin Mo''' or '''Lin Moniang''', a [[Fujian]]ese [[shamaness]] whose life span is traditionally dated from 960 to 987. Revered after her death as a [[tutelary deity]] of [[seafarer]]s, including [[fishermen]] and [[sailor]]s, her worship spread throughout China's coastal regions and [[overseas Chinese]] communities throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. She was thought to roam the seas, protecting her believers through [[miracle|miraculous]] interventions. She is now generally regarded by her believers as a powerful and benevolent Queen of Heaven. Mazuism is popular in [[religion in Taiwan|Taiwan]]; her [[#Festival|temple festival]] is a major event in the region, with the largest celebrations around her temples at Dajia and Beigang.

Although many of Mazu's temples honor her titles Tianhou and Tianfei, it became customary to never pray to her under those names during an emergency since it was believed that, hearing one of her formal titles, Mazu might feel obligated to groom and dress herself as properly befitting her station before receiving the petition. Prayers invoking her as Mazu were thought to be answered more quickly.&lt;ref name=bfw/&gt;

==History==
Very little is known of the historical Lin Moniang.&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt; She was apparently a [[shamaness]] from a small fishing village on [[Meizhou Island]], part of [[Fujian]]'s [[Putian County]],&lt;ref name=duv38-344/&gt; in the late 10th century.&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt; Her Meizhou was an uneducated and superstitious place, where out of "perhaps a thousand households... not one person [could] read".&lt;ref name=butterflyinthesky&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=126EsR8rpC8C&amp;pg=PA209 209]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She probably did not live there, however, but on the nearby mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2006|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|She may have been born on the mainland as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 126]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} During this era, Fujian was greatly [[sinification|sinicized]] by influxes of refugees fleeing invasions of northern China and Mazu's [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] may represent a hybridization of Chinese and local culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131 131–2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of her cult is from two centuries later, an 1150 inscription that mentions "she could foretell a man's good and ill luck" and, "after her death, the people erected a temple for her on her home island".&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt;

==Legend==
The [[Chinese legend|legends]] around Lin Moniang's life were broadly established by the 13th century.&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt;

She was said to have been born under the reign of the [[Quanzhou]]nese warlord [[Liu Congxiao]] ({{abbr|d|died}}.{{nbsp}}962),&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt; which eventually developed into the specific date of the 23rd day of the third month of the [[Chinese lunar calendar]]{{sfnp|Soo|1990|p=31}}{{efn|This is sometimes mistakenly translated into English as "March 23", for example by [[Fuzhou University]]'s overview of the [[Meizhou Temple]].&lt;ref name=fzu&gt;{{citation|contribution=Mazhu Temple in Meizhou |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707024306/http://www.fzu.edu.cn/fujian/eput.html |title=Fujian Province |url=http://www.fzu.edu.cn/fzu/f2_0 |publisher=Fuzhou University |location=Fuzhou |date=1999 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218061834/http://www.fzu.edu.cn/fzu/f2_0 |archivedate=2005-02-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}960, the first year of the [[Song dynasty|Song]].{{efn|The coincidence of the date, only attested in late sources, is often doubted by modern scholars such as [[Hugh R. Clark|Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130 130–1]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The late Ming ''[[Great Collection of the Three Teachings' Origin and Development and Research into the Divine]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{nowrap|{{linktext|三教}}}}{{nowrap|{{linktext|源|流}}}}{{nowrap|{{linktext|搜|神}}}}{{nowrap|{{linktext|大|全}}}}}}, ''Sānjiào Yuánliú Sōushén Dàquán''), however, placed her birth much earlier, in 742.&lt;ref name=bolt&gt;{{harvp|Boltz|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Sp6TfzhpIC&amp;pg=PA742 742]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sources speak of her as "Miss Lin"; her [[Chinese given name|given name]] Mo ("Silent One")&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; or Moniang ("the Silent Girl") appeared later. It was said to have been chosen when she did not cry during birth&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; or during the first month afterwards; she remained a quiet and pensive child as late as four.&lt;ref name=rmb2&gt;{{harvp|Yuan|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UBHQC_Iz6OMC&amp;pg=PA123 123]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She was said to have been the sixth&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; or seventh daughter of Lin Yuan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|林|愿}}}}). He is now usually remembered as one of the local fisherman,&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; although the 1593 edition of the ''[[Records of Research into the Divine]]'' made him Putian's chief military inspector.&lt;ref name=bolo/&gt; The family was helpful and popular within their village.&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; Late legends intended to justify Mazu's presence in Buddhist temples held that her parents had prayed to [[Guanyin]] for a son but received yet another daughter.&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; In one version, her mother dreamt of Guanyin giving her a magical pill to induce pregnancy and woke to find the pill still in her hand;&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; rather than being born in the conventional way, Mazu shot from her mother at birth in the form of a fragrant flash of red light.&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; Guanyin was said to have been especially devoted to Mazu or even to have [[avatar|been incarnated]] as Mazu;{{sfnp|Irwin|1990|p=63}}{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=316}} for her part, Mazu was said to have been entranced by a statue of Guanyin at a temple she visited as a child, after which she became an ardent Buddhist.&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; 

She is now often said to have studied religious literature,&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; mastering [[Confucian classics|Confucius]] by 8 and the principal [[Buddhist sutra]]s by 11.{{sfnp|Giuffrida|2004}} The ''[[Account of the Blessings Revealed by the Princess of Heaven]]'' {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|天妃|顯|聖|錄}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|天妃|显|圣|录}}}},}} ''Tiānfēi Xiǎnshèng Lù'') collected by her supposed descendants [[Lin Yaoyu]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|林|堯|俞}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|林|尧|俞}}}},}} ''Lín Yáoyú''; {{fl.|1589}}) and [[Lin Linchang]] {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|林|麟|焻}}}},}} ''Lín Línchàng''; {{fl.|1670}}) claimed that, while still a girl, she was visited by a Taoist master (elsewhere a [[Buddhist monk]])&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; named Xuantong {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|玄|通}}}},}} ''Xuántōng'') who recognized her [[Buddha nature]]. By 13, she had mastered the book of lore he had left her {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|玄|微|袐|法}}}},}} ''Xuánwēi Bìfǎ'')&lt;ref name=bolth/&gt; and gained the abilities to [[clairvoyance|see the future]] and [[astral projection|visit places in spirit]] without travel.&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; She was able to manifest herself at a distance as well and used this power to visit gardens in the surrounding countryside, although she asked owners' permission before gathering any flowers to take home.&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; Although she only started swimming at the relatively late age of 15, she soon excelled at it. She was said to have stood on the shore in red garments to guide fishing boats home, regardless of harsh or dangerous weather. She met a [[Taoist immortal]] at a fountain&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; at sixteen and received an amulet&lt;ref name=bolth/&gt; or two bronze tablets which she translated&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; or used to [[exorcism|exorcize]] [[Chinese demon|demons]], to heal the sick,{{sfnp|Giuffrida|2004}} and to avert disasters.&lt;ref name=rmb2/&gt; She was also said to be a [[rainmaking|rainmaker]] during times of drought.&lt;ref name=crook/&gt;

Mazu's principal legend concerns her saving one or some members of her family when they were caught offshore during a [[typhoon]], usually when she was 16.&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; It appears in several forms. In one, the women at home feared Lin Yuan and his son were lost but Mazu fell into a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] while weaving at her [[loom]]. Her spiritual power began to save the men from drowning but her mother roused her, causing her to drop her brother into the sea. The father returned and told the other villagers of the miracle; this version of the story is preserved in murals at [[Fengtin]] in Fujian.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=316}}  One variant is that her brothers were saved but her father was lost;&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; she then spent three days and nights searching for his body before finding it.&lt;ref name=bfw/&gt; Another version is that all the men returned safely.&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; Another is that Mazu was praying to Guanyin; another that she was sleeping and assisting her family through her dream.{{sfnp|Irwin|1990|p=63}} Still another is that the boats were crewed by her four brothers and that she saved three of them, securing their boats together, with the eldest lost owing to the interference of her parents, who mistook her trance for a [[seizure]] and woke her.&lt;ref name=bolt/&gt;

In earlier records, Mazu died unmarried at 27 or 28.&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt; (Her celibacy was sometimes ascribed to a vow she took after losing her brother at sea.)&lt;ref name=bolt/&gt; The date of her passing eventually became the specific date of the [[Double Ninth Festival]] in 987,&lt;ref name=rmb3&gt;{{harvp|Yuan|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UBHQC_Iz6OMC&amp;pg=PA124 124]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making her 27 by western reckoning and 28 by traditional Chinese dating. She was said to have died in meditation,&lt;ref name=bolt/&gt; though in some accounts she did not die but climbed a mountain alone and ascended into [[Tian|Heaven]] as a goddess&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; in a beam of bright light.&lt;ref name=rmb3/&gt; In others, she died protesting an unwanted betrothal.&lt;ref name=matanc/&gt; Still another places her death at age 16, saying she drowned after exhausting herself in a failed attempt to find her lost father,&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; underlining her [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name=bolth/&gt; Her corpse then washed ashore on [[Nangan Island]], which preserves a gravesite said to be hers.

==Myths==
In addition to the legends surrounding her earthly life, Mazu figures in a number of [[Chinese myth]]s. 

In one, the [[Chinese demon|demons]] [[Qianliyan]] ("Thousand-Mile Eye") and [[Shunfeng'er]] ("Wind-Following Ear") both fell in love with her and she conceded that she would marry the one who defeated her in combat. Using her [[kung fu|martial arts]] skills, however, she subdued them both and, after becoming friends, hired them as her guardian generals.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=319}}

In a book of the [[Taoist Canon]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|太|上|老君|說|天妃|救|苦|靈|驗|經}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|太|上|老君|说|天妃|救|苦|灵|验|经}}}},}} ''Tàishàng Lǎojūn Shuō Tiānfēi Jiùkǔ Língyàn Jīng''), the Jade Woman of Marvelous Deeds {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|妙|行|玉|女}}}})}} is a star from the [[Big Dipper]] brought to earth by [[Laojun]], the divine form of [[Laozi]], to show his compassion for those who might be lost at sea. She is incarnated as Mazu and swears not only to protect sailors but to oversee all facets of life and death, providing help to anyone who might call upon her.&lt;ref name=bolth/&gt;

|quote = Dressed in red, she shows her divine power. &lt;br/&gt; In the fourth year of the Xuanhe period of emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty, with the cyclical signs ''ren yin'' (1122), the Supervising Secretary Lu Yundi received an order to go on a mission to Korea. On his way through the Eastern Sea, he ran into an hurricane. Of the eight ships, seven were wrecked. Only Lu's ship did not capsize in the turbulent waves. As he prayed ardently to heaven for protection, he saw a goddess appear above the mast. Dressed in red, she was sitting still in a formal manner. Lu kowtowed and begged for protection. In the midst of the seething sea, the wind and waves calmed down suddenly, so that Lu was saved. After he had returned from Korea, he told his story to everyone. The Gentleman who Guards Righteousness, Li Zhen, a man who had visited (Sheng)dun for a long time, told him everything about the merciful manifestations of the holy princess. Lu said: "In this world, it is only my parents who have always shown endless kindness. Yet, when in the course of my vagrant life I almost arrived at the brink of death, not even my father and mother, in spite of their utmost parental love, could help me, while a divine girl, by simply breathing, was able to reach out to me. That day, I truly received the gift of rebirth." When Lu reported on his mission to the court, he memorialized the merciful manifestation of the goddess. He received the order to allow the words "Smooth crossing" to be used on a temple tablet, remit taxes on the temple fields, and make temple offerings at Jiangkou.

As Mazuism spread, it began to absorb the cults of other local shamanesses such as the other two of [[Xianyou]]'s "Three Princesses"&lt;ref name=godschool/&gt; and even some lesser maritime and agricultural gods, including Liu Mian&lt;ref name=fengting/&gt; and Zhang the Heavenly Instructor.&lt;ref name=godschool&gt;{{harvp|Clark|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=126EsR8rpC8C&amp;pg=PA208 208]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, she had already become a guardian to the people of Qiaodou when they suffered drought, flood, epidemic, [[Wokou|piracy]],&lt;ref name=godschool/&gt; or brigandage.{{sfnp|Giuffrida|2004}} She protected women during childbirth&lt;ref name=ddr/&gt; and when they sought [[contraception]].{{sfnp|Giuffrida|2004}} As the patron of the seas, her temples were among the first erected by arriving [[overseas Chinese]], as they gave thanks for their safe passage. Despite his [[Islam in China|Islamic]] upbringing, the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral and explorer [[Zheng He]] credited Mazu for protecting one of his journeys, prompting a new title in 1409.&lt;ref name=bolth/&gt; He patronized the Mazu temples of [[Nanjing]] and prevailed upon the [[Yongle Emperor]] to construct the city's [[Tianfei Palace (Nanjing)|Tianfei Palace]]; because of its imperial patronage and prominent location in the empire's southern capital, this was long the largest and highest-status center of Mazuism in China. During the [[Southern Ming]] resistance to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], Mazu was credited with helping [[Koxinga]]'s army [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|capture]] [[Dutch Formosa|Taiwan]] from [[Dutch Empire|the Dutch]]; she was later said to have personally aided some of [[Shi Lang]]'s men in defeating [[Liu Guoxuan]] at [[Battle of Penghu|Penghu]] in 1683, ending the [[Kingdom of Tungning|independent kingdom]] of [[Kingdom of Tungning#Rulers|Koxinga's descendants]] and placing Taiwan under Qing control.&lt;ref name=rmb3/&gt; The Ming prince [[Zhu Shugui]]'s palace was converted into [[Tainan]]'s [[Grand Matsu Temple]], the first to bear her new title of "Heavenly Empress".&lt;ref name=tcg&gt;{{citation |contribution=Tainan Grand Matsu Temple |contribution-url=https://tainancity.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/tainan-grand-matsu-temple-da-tienhou-gong/ |url=https://tainancity.wordpress.com/ |title=Tainan City Guide |publisher=Word Press |date=2009 |last=Bergman |first=Karl |location=Tainan }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late imperial China, sailors often carried [[effigy|effigies]] of Mazu to ensure safe crossings.&lt;ref name=crook/&gt; Some boats still carry small shrines on their bows.{{sfnp|Giuffrida|2004}} Mazu charms are also used as medicine, including as salves for blistered feet.{{sfnp|Zhang|1993|p=145}} As late as the 19th century, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] government officially credited her divine intervention with their [[Battle of Tamsui|1884 victory]] over the [[French Third Republic|French]] at [[Tamsui District]] during the [[Sino-French War]] and specially honored [[Fuyou Temple|the town's temple to her]], which had served as General Sun Kaihua's headquarters during the fighting.&lt;ref name=bfw&gt;{{citation |title=The Battle of Fisherman's Wharf |url=http://danshuihistory.blogspot.hk |contribution-url=http://danshuihistory.blogspot.hk/2009/07/blog-post.html |contribution=翌天昭佑 |date=2009 |location=Hong Kong |publisher=Blogspot }}. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mazuism is practiced in about 1500 temples in 26 countries around the world, mostly in the [[Sinosphere]] or the [[overseas Chinese]] communities. Of these temples, almost 1000 are on [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://thingstodo.viator.com/taiwan/mazu-matsu-chinese-goddess-of-the-sea/ |contribution=Mazu (Matsu), the Chinese Goddess of the Sea |title=Things to Do |url=http://thingstodo.viator.com/ |publisher=Viator |first=Erin de |last=Santiago |accessdate=23 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923080819/http://thingstodo.viator.com/ |archivedate=23 September 2014 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; representing a doubling of the 509 temples recorded in 1980 and more than a dozen times the number recorded before 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Boltz|1986|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These temples are generally registered as Taoist, although some are considered Buddhist.&lt;ref name=bolo/&gt; There are more than 90 [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Mazu Temples in Hong Kong]]. In [[Mainland China]], Mazuism is formally classified as a cult outside of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] and [[Taoism in China|Taoism]], although numerous Buddhist and Taoist temples include shrines to her. Her worship is generally permitted but not encouraged, with most surviving temples concentrated around Putian in Fujian. Including the twenty on [[Meizhou Island]], there are more than a hundred in the prefecture and another 70 elsewhere in the province, mostly in the settlements along its coast. There are more than 40 temples in [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]] and more than 30 in [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangsu]], but many historical temples are now treated as museums and operated by local parks or cultural agencies. The [[A-Ma Temple]] on [[Macao Island]] is the probable source of its name in Portuguese and English; the [[heritage conservation in Hong Kong|historic and protected]] [[Tin Hau Temple, Causeway Bay]] in Hong Kong is the source of the [[Tin Hau, Hong Kong|Tin Hau area]]'s name from the Cantonese pronunciation of one of Mazu's titles, "Empress of Heaven". The Mazu temple in Melbourne is the largest [[Chinese temple]] in [[Australia]].

A major project to build the world's tallest Mazu statue at [[Tanjung Simpang Mengayau]] in [[Kudat]], [[Borneo]], was officially launched by [[Sabah]]. The statue was to be 10 stories high, but was canceled due to protests from Muslims in Sabah and political interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/the-mazu-statue-controversy-should-not-only-be-resolved-at-the-negotiation-table/|title=The Mazu statue controversy should not only be resolved at the negotiation table|author=Lim Kit Siang|publisher=malaysia-today.net|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its absence, the [[list of tallest statues|world's tallest statue]] of the goddess is the {{convert|42.3|m|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Mazu of Tianjin]] that was erected in 2012.

Informal centers of pilgrimage for Mazu's believers include [[Meizhou Island]] and the [[Dajia Jenn Lann Temple|Zhenlan Temple]] in [[Taichung]] on [[Taiwan]].

The primary [[Miaohui|temple festival]] in Mazuism is Lin Moniang's traditional birthday on the 23rd day of the 3rd month of the [[Chinese lunar calendar]]. It is celebrated widely in Taiwan, with the largest festivities&lt;ref name=crook&gt;{{harvp|Crook|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 32]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; around the 8-day, {{convert|250|km|sp=us|adj=on}} annual "inspection tour" of a Mazu idol from the [[Dajia Jenn Lann Temple|Zhenlan Temple]] in [[Taichung]] to [[Chaotian Temple]] in [[Beigang, Yunlin|Beigang]] and back again. The highlight is an incense-cutting ritual used to restore the fires of the Taichung temple. As many as 6,000 join the tour itself, some dressed as medieval standard-bearers and foot-soldiers, and more than 30,000 sometimes arrive for the idol's entry into Beigang.&lt;ref name=naddy&gt;{{citation |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;pg=PA375 375] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions |editor=Randall L.

The anniversary of her death or supposed ascension into Heaven is also celebrated, usually on the [[Double Ninth Festival]] (the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar).&lt;ref name=bolo/&gt;

After her death, Mazu was remembered as a young lady who wore a red dress as she roamed over the seas.&lt;ref name=duv38-344&gt;{{harvp|Duyvendak|1938|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[idolatry|religious statuary]], she is usually clothed in the attire of an empress, and decorated with accessories such as a ceremonial ''hu'' tablet and a flat-topped imperial cap (''mian'guan'') with rows of beads (''liu'') hanging from the front and back.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=318}} Her temples are usually protected by the [[menshen|door gods]] [[Qianliyan]] and [[Shunfeng'er]]. These vary in appearance but are frequently demons, Qianliyan red with two horns and two yellow sapphire eyes and Shunfeng'er green with one horn and two ruby eyes.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=319}}

''[[Lin Moniang (series)|Lin Moniang]]'' (2000), a minor Fujianese [[TV series]], was a dramatization of Mazu's life as a mortal. ''[[Mazu (film)|Mazu]]'' {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|海之傳說媽祖}},}} 2007) was a Taiwanese animated feature film from the Chinese Cartoon Production Co. depicting her life as a shamaness and goddess. Its production director Teng Chiao admitted the limited appeal to the domestic market: "If young people were our primary target audience, we wouldn't tell the story of Mazu in the first place since they are not necessarily interested in the ancient legend[;] neither do they have loyalty to made-in-Taiwan productions". Instead, "when you look to global markets, the question that foreign buyers always ask is what can best represent Taiwan". ''Mazu'', with its story about  "a magic girl and two cute sidekicks [Mazu's door gods Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er] spiced up with a strong local flavor" was instead designed with an intent to appeal to international markets interested in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/ |contribution-url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/07/27/2003371538 |contribution=The Good, the Bad, and the Divine |title=Taipei Times |last=Ho |first=Yi |authormask=Ho Yi }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Muisca religion}}
{{main|Muisca mythology}}
The terms '''Muisca religion and mythology''' refer to the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] beliefs of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] indigenous people of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]] highlands of the [[Andes]] in the vicinity of [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. The tradition includes a selection of received myths concerning the origin and organization of the [[universe]]. Their belief system may be described as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion containing a very strong element of spirituality based on an [[epistemology]] of [[mysticism]].

[[File:La Bachue de Jose Horacio Betancur-Medellin(1).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Monument to Bachué by Luís Horacio Betancur, [[Medellín]] ([[Colombia]])]]
[[File:Bochica.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Monument to Bochica, [[Cuítiva, Boyacá|Cuítiva]] ([[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]])]]
=== Creation of the universe ===
[[Bachué]] ("the Grandmother") is a non-material principle of creation, the will, the thought and the imagination of all  the things to come. She is a similar concept  to the principle of ''[[tao]]'' in the [[Chinese mythology]].

The time of ''unquyquie nxie'' ("the first thought") is the time of the cosmic origin, when the thoughts of Bachué became actions. This is the time when Bachué created the builders of the universe and ordered them to create.

=== Beginning of the world ===
The world started with ''Chimi'' ("the pulp"), the first material object in the world. Then, in the inners of ''tomsa'', were incubated the embryos of [[star]]s, embryos of [[Earth|land]] and embryos of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. When ''tomsa'' was full, the seeds of the earth emerged and the remains were thrown away, forming the [[Milky Way]].

The elements were distributed to the deities: the heat to [[Sué]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[sun]], the cold to [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[Moon]], and the clouds and smoke to the [[Earth]], but all the things were still seeds and nothing was germinated. Then, ''Mnya'', [[gold]], energy, was united with ''Chimi'', the pulp, and became ''Chímini'', the creative force, which caused the germination of the seeds of all things.

=== Origin of mankind ===
According to Muisca legends, mankind was originated in [[Lake Iguaque]], when mother goddess Bachué came out from the lake with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, they populated the earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. finally, they disappeared unto the lake in the shape of snakes.

=== Great flood ===
Due to transgressions against the divine laws, [[Chibchacum]] brought forth a [[deluge (mythology)|flood]] that covered the world and nearly destroyed the human race. Then, the protective god [[Bochica]] drove away the waters through the [[Tequendama Falls]], and taught humans the basis of civilization, [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]], religion, the arts, and crafts. When he was about to leave to his heavenly kingdom, [[Cuchavira]] (the [[rainbow]]) appeared and [[Bochica]] announced his second coming, far away in the future, in an event marked by death and disease. These events are similar to the biblical histories of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Apocalypse]].

=== Deities ===
The first gods, constructors of the universe, built the first ''cuca'' or ceremonial temple. They were:
* [[Bachué]] ("The one with the naked breasts"): the [[mother goddess]] who raised from the underworld to give birth to the human race
* [[Bochica]] ("The father of civilization") also called Nemqueteba, Nemquereteba, Sadigua, Chimizapagua
* [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]: the Moon goddess of the Muisca
* [[Chibchacum]] ("The one who holds the earth"): the universal legislator
* [[Chiminigagua]]: trinity deity, constituted by  ''Chí'', ''Chímini'' and ''Chiminigagua''
* [[Cuchavira]]: god of the rainbow
* [[Cuza (god)|Cuza]] ("The one who is like the night"): the male principle of creation
* [[Huitaca (goddess)|Huitaca]]: rebelling goddess of sexual liberation
* [[Nencatacoa]] ("The protector of festivities, beer, and the arts")

The gods danced a very long dance (''sas quyhynuca''), with the music of the ''fo'' drum, in the first ceremony. This ceremony gave origin to [[space]] and [[time]].

Then, the gods created the first materials of the universe: ''fiva'' (the air),  ''faova'' (the cosmic cloud) and ''ie'' (the smoke). Then, they created the six directions of the material [[dimension]], and in the middle of ''itugue'', the emptiness, they created the centre of power ''tomsa'' ([[bellybutton]] of the universe). But, still the universe had no consistence, and they waited many ''bxogonoas'' [[aeon]]s until the ''sas bequia'', the beginning of the world.

{{nihongo|'''Naga the Serpent'''|白蛇のナーガ|Sāpento no Nāga}} is a fictional character in the light novel, [[anime]], [[manga]], radio drama and game versions of [[Hajime Kanzaka]]'s media franchise ''[[Slayers]]'', who was introduced in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'' in 1990. She is also often known as '''Naga the White Serpent''', which is a more literal translation from Japanese ([[:ja:白蛇|白蛇&lt;sup&gt;JP&lt;/sup&gt;]], lit. "white snake"), and an early English version by [[A.D. Vision]] had her name transliterated as "'''Nahga'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advfilms.com/advhome/cons/interviews/views-oct-98/views-oct-98.html |title=ADV - Active - Interviews |website=Web.archive.org |date=1999-04-29 |accessdate=2016-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990429065633/http://www.advfilms.com/advhome/cons/interviews/views-oct-98/views-oct-98.html |archivedate=April 29, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess '''Gracia Ul Naga Saillune''' (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン ''Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn'').

The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of ''Slayers'', [[Lina Inverse]]. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has numerous [[character flaw]]s, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike.

Naga's Japanese [[voice actress]] is [[Maria Kawamura]], and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the [[OVA]]s and movies. In the anime series ''Slayers Evolution-R'', Naga appears as a cameo character named '''Nama''' (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.

==Character==

===Background===
Naga's real full name is Gracia Ul Naga Saillune, making her the first daughter of the kingdom of Saillune's [[crown prince]] Philionel El Di Saillune and the older sister of [[Amelia Wil Tesla Saillune]]. She has one living uncle, Christopher Wil Brogg Seyruun, one deceased uncle, Randy Saillune, and a deceased cousin, Alfred Seyruun. Her grandfather, Eldoran Saillune, is the king of Saillune, although Philionel acts as a proxy ruler. Naga's mother was murdered several years earlier by the famous assassin Booley. The teenage (16 or 17 years old at the time) Naga immediately took revenge and killed him with the crown princess' original spell, Chaos String.&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! I to VI''. p.58. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the funeral, the traumatized Naga found the outfit she currently wears inside her mother's closet,&lt;ref name=ss8/&gt; and shortly after this, she left home to learn the ways of the world and gain more magic powers. Naga still keeps in touch with her homeland and occasionally she is sent living expenses money through a messenger.&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! VII and IX'' p.9. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this was disclosed only in interviews with the ''Slayers'' creator [[Hajime Kanzaka]], but was hinted in Naga's "White Serpent" nickname (a white serpent being the coat of arms of Saillune).&lt;ref name=k40&gt;Aleksandra Janusz (Ina, Błękitna Czarodziejka), "Slayers nie tylko w TV: Filmy kinowe oraz serie OAV." ''Kawaii'' 40 (October–November 2002), p.12-15. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Slayers NEXT'', [[Zelgadis Greywords|Zelgadis]] states that Seyruun has a "runaway princess," also implied to be Naga.

Naga has originally planned to simply challenge to a duel and defeat the famous teenage sorceress [[Lina Inverse]] to inherit her supposed title of the "Invincible Dark Lord" (which Naga apparently invented herself). However, as the story progressed, her obsession with Lina has quickly became more complicated and in some ways even more irrational. Naga becomes associate with Lina, is traveling with her supposed archrival and aiding her in battle, yet also often turning against her whenever someone offers Naga enough gain from it. From her side, the cynical and neurotic Lina is often abusive towards Naga and in total disregard of her safety even when they work together (such as repeatedly blowing her away with explosive spells or using her as bait for the enemy), but Naga almost never gets seriously hurt and usually just laughs it off, rarely seen as a serious enemy even when they are fighting. On the other hand, both Naga and Lina also directly saved each other's lives on a number of occasions.

===Attributes===
The novels describe Naga as a remarkably beautiful young woman of about 20 years with a distinguished appearance, long hair (either dark-blue, violet or raven black), and intelligent blue eyes. Tall and well endowed, Naga is in a striking contrast to the diminutive Lina and takes pride in being physically intimidating, preferring a menacing and revealing black leather outfit, which is as a keepsake from her mother but Naga also personally enjoys to wear it (though the exaggerated size of her spiked [[spaulders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/Slayers_A_Retrospective_1215.aspx |title=Slayers: A Retrospective |publisher=Otakuusamagazine.com |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is so unpractical that Naga may painfully jab them in her own face when spellcasting). Naga's introduction in the novels describe it as an old-time 'evil sorceress' fashion style that, according to Lina, used to be popular centuries earlier. Her large sword is just a prop that she carries around purely for a show and can be only used defensively for blocking due to Naga's [[hemophobia]] after witnessing the killing of her mother; in effect, she has a severe aversion to the sight of blood which can cause her to faint. To her dismay, Naga, who believes herself to be Lina's "greatest and strongest rival,"&lt;ref name=volks/&gt; is often referred to as Lina's [[sidekick]] or "that other girl." The usually dismissive Lina likes to compare Naga's irritating habit of following her around is akin to [[goldfish]]'s trailing feces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20110811_lina_inverse_mouse_pad/ |title=あの美少女天才魔道士リナ＝インバースの公式「貧乳マウスパッド」が登場 |website=Gigazine.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the words of Lina: "She might be a useless ally, but having her as an enemy can sure be amusing"&lt;ref name=volks/&gt;). However, Naga also often makes her very annoyed (even to the point of rage), especially when Naga makes fun of her small breasts, playing on Lina's physical inferiority complex and her envy of Naga's bust size.

She has an outrageously loud boisterous 'noblewoman' (''ojousama''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/08/24/ask-john-can-you-explain-the-ojousama-laugh/ |title=Ask John: Can You Explain the Ojousama Laugh? – AnimeNation Anime News Blog |website=Animenation.net |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101123143/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/08/24/ask-john-can-you-explain-the-ojousama-laugh/ |archivedate=2015-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) laugh (which Kanzaka said is similar to the laughter of Naga's mother&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! I to VI'' p.30. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that most people in the ''Slayers'' world find unbearably obnoxious (to the point of rendering them physically powerless). Being a [[princess]], Naga does not flaunt the fact that she is royalty (her heritage is never mentioned in any series and has only been acknowledged in interviews and supplemental materials), but the way she acts makes it quite apparent: when she stands before other members of royalty, she speaks to them as equals, while Lina will bow her head and speak only when spoken to. Many of her self-confident and 'dramatic' poses and speeches are strikingly similar to those of Amelia or Martina, another ''Slayers'' princess. Naga's inflated ego, her carefreeness and vanity, recurrent appetite for good food, considerable greed for money and magical treasure, frequent and excessive drinking of alcohol, and often-displayed overconfidence along with her notable lack of [[common sense]] mean she often gets herself, and Lina, into trouble.

===Abilities===
Despite Lina's mockery of Naga's magical skills, she is an exceptionally talented sorceress, and may, in fact, be Lina's greatest rival. She is well versed in [[black magic]] and capable of casting healing spells and [[golem]]-forming and dragon-conjuring spells. She is especially proficient at [[white magic]], though she only uses it when absolutely necessary, and also specializes in shamanistic magic, in particular spells of earth and water variety. She enjoys creating golems (even if they usually do not turn out very well and sometimes go berserk and turn against her), has developed several of her own spells (including Bogardic Elm, Freeze Rain, Gu Ru Dooga, Mega Vu Vraimer, Void Breath and Vu Raywa), and her most common spells to use are water/ice-based (such as Freeze Arrow) in contrast to Lina who uses fire-related ones. Naga knows and can use the ultimate shamanistic and white magic spells (Ra Tilt and Resurrection), is able to stop living-dead powered via [[necromancy]] with a powerful Flow Break spell, and has learnt Levitation by just observing its use by Lina.&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! VII and IX'' p.58. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kanzaka, Naga and Lina are the mightiest human magic users in the world of ''Slayers'' and Naga actually has a larger potential magical capacity, while Lina knows the ultimate black magic spells (notably the devastating Dragon Slave).&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! I to VI'' p.25. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also has a strange ability to control [[jellyfish]],&lt;ref name=p2b&gt;''BLASTER! VII and IX'' p.2b. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat, as well as talented at art and cooking. Her swordsmanship is often the subject of question, as she carries around a large sword yet never uses it. Naga's uncanny potential to survive any peril&lt;ref name=volks/&gt; practically unscathed was at first very surprising to Lina, who has actually left her for dead on a few occasions, before she got used to it and began to take it for granted.

==Appearances==

===Novels and drama CDs===
Naga has first appeared in the 1991-2008 ''Slayers Special'' series of light novels, which was later (from volume 30 onward) re-titled as ''Slayers Smash'' (an ongoing series since 2008). Like in the case of other ''Slayers'' novels, most of the ''Special'' series stories were first published in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]''. Some of them were first collected in the ''Slayers Delicious'' series and some are subtitled as "Slayers Excellent" or "Slayers Superior"; some were also later re-published in the series ''Slayers Select''. The ''Special'' series, which axis are the joint adventures of Lina and Naga, serves as a prequel to the main series (starting about three years prior to the first meeting of Lina and [[Gourry Gabriev]]) and is less serious in its content. Naga is the main protagonist of ''Slayers Special 3: Nāga no Bouken'' ("Adventures of Naga") and is the titular subject of the 2012 bonus book ''Slayers Addition: Nāga Ijin-den'' ("Legend of Naga the Great"). An exclusive side-story of Lina and Naga, "Slayers Gaiden", was published in the issue #200 of ''Dragon Magazine'' in 2002.

Hajime Kanzaka was originally going to make Naga appear in ''The Battle of Saillune'' (volume 4 of the main novel series) but had a trouble to implement this idea properly. This led him to create the character of Amelia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animemaga.ru/news/vecher-klassiki-the-slayers-3100 |title=Вечер классики: The Slayers - Animemaga |website=Animemaga.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanzaka said Naga would not appear in the main series due to Amelia being there,&lt;ref&gt;''BLASTER! I to VI'' p.7b. {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the two actually meet in ''Slayers VS Orphen'', a novel and CD drama crossover of ''Slayers'' and ''[[Sorcerous Stabber Orphen]]'', where the masked Naga appears incognito and keeps her identity secret to Amelia.&lt;ref&gt;''Slayers VS Orphen'' p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naga also appears in the first volume of [[Kadokawa Shoten]] Tsubasa-published alternative series of ''Slayers'' children's novels written by Nambo Hidehisa, where her outfit was redesigned to be a less skimpy (wearing a miniskirt instead of a thong) by the artist [[Yuji Himukai]]. When they first meet, Lina mistakes Naga for Gourry's mother due to their similar looks and guesses she is "about 40 years old."

The 2006 audio drama ''Slayers Kita Kaette EX #4: Kita kaette Naga!?'' provides a closure to the entire ''Slayers'' saga, with the retired Lina and Naga, now elderly in their eighties (with almost all other characters already dead) and vacationing together. After Lina revives the choking Naga (who meets her mother in a near-death experience), the two recall their past but their versions do not match, leading Lina to challenge Naga to a final fight as to decide who is right. The battle ends in both of them trying to cast top-level black magic spells (Naga's Dynast Brass and Lina's Dragu Slave) but breaking their own hips in the process.

===Anime and manga===
Naga is co-protagonist of the first four ''Slayers'' films from the late 1990s: ''[[Slayers: The Motion Picture]]'' (''Slayers Perfect''), ''[[Slayers Return]]'' (and its manga adaptation), ''[[Slayers Great]]'', and ''[[Slayers Gorgeous]]'' (the scripts for ''Return'', ''Great'' and ''Gorgeous'' were also published in the book ''Slayers Original''). She has the same role in all episodes of both of the ''Slayers'' OVA series, ''[[Slayers Special (OVA)|Slayers Special]]'', and Naga-centered&lt;ref name=k40/&gt; ''[[Slayers Excellent]]'' (the latter of which takes place before the events of the first ''Slayers'' film, 1995's ''Slayers Perfect'', and in fact details Naga's initial meeting with Lina). A typical plot of a Lina and Naga anime story features them as mercenary companions-opponents (that relationship being very fluid) meeting strangers who hire them against each other for their own purposes.

Naga's frequent role in the anime is that of a comedic [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Lina. According to [[Helen McCarthy]], while the ''Slayers'' TV series has "remained essentially asexual," it was "the absence of TV restrictions" that allowed to "retain Naga from the [light novel] stories."&lt;ref name=tae&gt;[[Helen McCarthy]], ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917]]'', p.591.&lt;/ref&gt; Naga's Japanese voice actress [[Maria Kawamura]] said she had trouble breathing after recording sessions of Naga's laugh for the ''Slayers Special'' episode "The Scary Chimera Plan", which featured Naga's ten clones all laughing at once.&lt;ref&gt;Mr.Gato&amp;Bandmanka, "Truskawkowy smak, czyli Slayersi znowu w akcji!". ''Kawaii'' 11/1998, p.5. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kawamura also provided an audio commentary for all the movies and OVAs in the 2015 Blu-ray release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ニュース |url=http://animeanime.jp/article/2015/07/11/24081.html |title=「スレイヤーズ」劇場版&amp;OVAのBD-BOX 10月30日発売 新規コメンタリーも収録 &amp;#124; アニメ！アニメ！ |website=Animeanime.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manga, Naga appears through the early 2000s series ''Slayers Special''. Some of the chapters are based on the novels and the OVA series and some are original stories. As described by [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], "the two bickering heroines go on [[dungeon crawl]]s, work as maids and waitresses, search for 'bosom growth potions,' and fight the occasional bad guy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naga makes only a cameo appearances in the 2001 film, manga and CD drama ''[[Slayers Premium]]'' (as is the tradition with all of the anime movies and series published thus far, Naga does not actually meet or interact with any of the main characters other than Lina &amp; Amelia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/library/Slayers_Premium |title=Slayers Premium - Overview, Reviews, Cast, and List of Episodes |publisher=Crunchyroll |date=2001-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the 2008 manga ''The Hourglass of Falces''. She also makes a possible cameo in the first season of the ''Slayers'' TV series (episode 17) and appears as Nama in the first six episodes of the fifth TV season, ''Slayers Evolution-R''.

===Games===
Naga appears as a supporting [[player character]] through the entire official series of the [[List of Slayers video games|''Slayers'' role-playing video games]] from the 1990s: ''Slayers'' for the PC98, [[Slayers (video game)|''Slayers'' for the Super Famicon]] (SNES, in a dual role including as a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] during the first encounter), ''[[Slayers Royal]]'', ''[[Slayers Royal 2]]'', and ''[[Slayers Wonderful]]'', at times interacting with some members of the main story [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] (often with Gourry). She and Lina are also featured as player characters in the 2008 game ''[[Magical Battle Arena]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://area-zero.net/product/mba/chara.htm |title=マジカルバトルアリーナ〜リリカルなのはやＣＣさくら達が激突する３Ｄアクション同人ゲーム |website=Area-zero.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Naga, Lina and Gourry were announced to join the cast of ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/01/01/slayers-teams-up-with-granblue-fantasy-smart-phone-game |title="Slayers" Teams Up with "Granblue Fantasy" Smart Phone Game |publisher=Crunchyroll |date=2016-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first setting book published for the Japanese tabletop role-playing game ''MAGIUS RPG'' was ''Slayers RPG: Together with Naga'' (スレイヤーズRPG―ナーガ様といっしょ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/スレイヤーズRPG―ナーガ様といっしょ-富士見文庫―富士見ドラゴンブック-神坂-一/dp/4829142936 |title=スレイヤーズRPG―ナーガ様といっしょ (富士見文庫―富士見ドラゴンブック) 文庫 – 1995/3 |website=Amazon.co.jp |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on Naga and her antics. In this fast-paced, gag-based comedic game released by [[Fujimi Shobo]] in 1995, the [[game master]]-controlled Naga has her own party of player characters; it later saw a release of the collection of illustrated transcripts of play sessions. She is also featured in several cards in the collectible card game ''Slayers Fight''.

===Other appearances===
Kawamura's image songs for Naga were included in several ''Slayers'' soundtracks. Naga-themed single CD {{nihongo|''A Skilled Rival Conceals Her Claws''|能あるライバルは爪を隠す|Nou aru raibaru wa tsume wo kakusu}} (KIDA-109) was released by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] in 1995.

A [[Stuffed toy|plushie]] of Naga was made by [[Banpresto]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/17272 |title=Databases › Goods › Slayers - Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Banpresto) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[PVC]] figure was released by MegaHouse in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/11429 |title=Databases › Figures › Slayers - Gracia Ul Naga Saillune - C-Model - Dragon Heroine Selection 1 - Dragon Heroine Festival (MegaHouse)|publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; another pre-painted figure was released by Kadokawa as a tie-in for ''Return'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/189314 |title=Slayers - Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Kadokawa) ‹ Figures ‹ Databases - MyFigureCollection.net (Tsuki-board.net) |website=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a small keychain figure of Naga was made by [[Toei Company|Toei]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/174384 |title=Databases › Goods › Slayers - Slayers Great - Gracia Ul Naga Saillune - Keyholder (Toei) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1/6 scale [[garage kit]] Naga figure sculpted by Kitahara Kousuke was released by [[Volks]] in 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/78352 |title=Databases › Figures › Slayers - Gracia Ul Naga Saillune - CharaGumin - 1/6 (Volks) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e2046.com/product/15677 |title=Naga (Slayers, FG7033) |publisher=E2046.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tiny figure called "Naga's golem" was also sold by Volks separately in a limited offer and is now available together with the main statuette.&lt;ref name=volks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volks.co.jp/en/charagumin/chara11.html/ |title=Characters &amp;#124; Naga the White Serpent &amp;#124; CharaGumin Official Site |publisher=Volks.co.jp |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nendoroid|Nenodroid]] figure was released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taghobby.com/archives/299379|title=[不斷更新] 2018年7月29日 WONDER FESTIVAL 2018夏 – WONDERFUL HOBBY LIFE FOR YOU!!28展區: NENDORID Series展出情報|last=|first=|date=|website=Taghobby.com|language=zh-TW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derived characters==

===Nama===
[[File:Nama Slayers.png|thumb|upright|"Nama" in ''Evolution-R'']]

Naga makes an extended cameo appearance in the 2009 ''Slayers'' TV series ''Slayers Evolution-R'' as an animated suit of armor calling herself Nama, who bears a striking resemblance to Naga in both mannerisms (including her laugh) and spellcasting preferences. Nama was a treasure hunter (of whom only a Naga-like shadow was shown) who has lost a majority of her memories when her soul got enchanted into the living armor. While it is never directly shown or confirmed to the audience or the characters that she is Naga, Nama is perfectly able to perform the Pacifist Crush move along with Amelia, something only a daughter of Prince Phil would know how to do, and [[Xellos]] makes a comment that the name Nama is very close to her actual name, implying that he knows her true identity. During the course of the series, Xellos makes Nama's spirit return to her original body by destroying the urn that has caused the curse.

===Naga copies===
*After the events of ''Slayers Special'', there are ten clones of Naga due to her participation in a chimera experiment of the wizard Diol. The copies are just like Naga (complete with the attire and the infamous laugh), except that they do not possess any of her memories and magical abilities. They also show up in the ''Slayers'' video games ''Slayers Royal'' and ''Slayers Wonderful'', the latter of which includes the copies #5 and #9 among playable characters in one part of the story.
*Following the use of the Shadow Reflector by the sorcerer Lagen in the ''Slayers Special'' story "Mirror, Mirror", there is also a copy of Naga called '''Shadow Naga''' that does have her skills, but has a completely opposite personality (a meek and extremely modest girl). Kanzaka said that Shadow Lina and Shadow Naga will both just live a quiet and peaceful life.&lt;ref name=ss8&gt;''Slayers Special'' Vol.8 pp 191–196.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

==Reception and cultural impact==
Naga the Serpent was originally planned to be featured only in one ''Slayers'' story ("Naga's Challenge"), but a very positive response from readers turned her into the franchise's major recurring character. In 2000, she won the "Best of ''Dragon Magazine''" popular vote in two categories, including first place for the best supporting role in the magazine's history.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Magazine'' January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1999, [[Dave Halverson]] called Lina and Naga "two of anime [medium]'s brightest stars in both Japan and the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;''Gamers' Republic'' issue 7 page 120.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "perhaps the best character designs in the anime universe."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson|first=Dave|date=|title=Anime Republic 02|url=|journal=Gamers' Republic|volume=09|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Maria Kawamura's original Japanese voice of Naga and the English dubbing by Kelly Manison were both acclaimed by anime critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/slayers-great_article_76719.html |title=Slayers Great |publisher=Mania.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105144950/http://www.mania.com/slayers-great_article_76719.html |archivedate=2014-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/01.02/reviews/2/index.php3 |title=Reviews - Slayers: The Book of Spells DVD |publisher=Animefringe |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/slayers-return/dvd |title=Slayers Return DVD - Review |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gamers' Republic'' issue 4 page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; with Halverson calling Manison and Cynthia Martinez (as Lina) the best voice acting duo he has heard in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kawamura's portrayal of Naga, including her notorious cackling laughter, is considered her most famous role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-07-06/ax-2002-anime-expo-opening-ceremonies |title=AX 2002: Anime Expo Opening Ceremonies - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2002-07-06 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/08/30/video-long-awaited-full-sized-gothicmade-anime-movie-trailer |title=VIDEO: Long Awaited Full-Sized "Gothicmade" Anime Movie Trailer |publisher=Crunchyroll |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2015/10/03/geekology-summer-2015-anime-season-final-review-technobubble/73286202/ |title=Geekology: Summer 2015 Anime Season Final Review &amp;#124; Technobubble |website=Rgj.com |date=2015-10-03 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naga was described as "walking [[fanservice]]" by Citlin Donovan from [[The Mary Sue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donovan |first=Caitlin |url=http://www.themarysue.com/leading-ladies-shonen-anime-pt-1/ |title=Six Leading Ladies of Shonen Anime Part 1: The ’90s |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "a definite favourite for almost all of male part of the audience" by Polish magazine ''Kawaii''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuma-chan &amp; BEK, "Slayersowy who's who". ''Kawaii'' 36 (February–March 2002), p.10-13. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen McCarthy wrote in 2006, "Naga and her breasts have become three very popular characters in the series, and long-term fans of the series wait eagerly to see how the writers can explain not only her disappearance between the end of ''Special'' and the beginning of the original series, but also why she is never even mentioned after the events of the videos."&lt;ref name=tae/&gt; In 2006, Chris Beveridge of Mania.com listed the absence of Naga in the ''Slayers'' TV series as one of the ten reason it "will always suck," stating that "besides her wonderful costume that brings about a lot of great eye-candy when it comes to [[cosplay]]ers, she typified the kind of 'anime laugh' that only a precious few have. She was also the perfect foil when it came to dealing with Lina, something that the TV series never had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ten-reasons-slayers-will-always-suck_article_116277.html |title=Ten Reasons Why Slayers Will Always Suck |publisher=Mania.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060724/http://www.mania.com/ten-reasons-slayers-will-always-suck_article_116277.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crunchyroll]]'s Nate Ming noted Naga for her "incredibly dominant, overbearing presence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2015/06/26/feature-fanart-friday-not-quite-royalty-edition |title=FEATURE: Fanart Friday - Not Quite Royalty Edition |website=Crunchyroll.com |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Krzysztof Wojdyło of Polish magazine ''Otaku'' placed her first of his 2012 ranking of top ten buxom characters in all manga and anime, noting that how despite her "rather dark past hidden under her constant smile and somewhat psychotic behavior," she has still remained "probably the most fun and memorable character" on that list.&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Wojdyło, "Top 10: Gdy rozmiar ma znaczenie". ''Magazyn Otaku'' 42 (9/2012), p.77. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Anime News Network]]'s Lynzee Loveridge also included Naga's outfit among the most impractical fighting regalia for her spaulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-list/2012-09-01 |title=8 Most Impractical Fighting Regalia - The List |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Wirtualna Polska]] ranked Naga's bust as the ninth most beautiful pair of breasts in pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komiks.wp.pl/img,16129406,gid,16129403,title,Najpiekniejsze-piersi-popkultury,tpl,4,galeria.html?ticaid=1168e3&amp;_ticrsn=3 |title=Najpiękniejsze piersi popkultury - Komiks – WP.PL |website=Komiks.wp.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 first edition cover of American role-playing game ''[[Ironclaw]]'' shows Lina and Naga cameo role. The protagonists of the 2002 anime miniseries ''[[Cosplay Complex]]'', Chako and Reika, dress up as Naga and Lina respectively in the third episode. Lina and Naga also made a cameo appearance in French comic book series ''Les Légendaires Origines'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otakia.com/61449/produit/bd/les-legendaires-origines-tome-3-gryfenfercritique-resume-anecdote-analyse/ |title=Les Légendaires Origines – Tome 3 – Gryfenfer |website=Otakia.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|lat=27.06246|long=85.35599|width=230}}
It is widely known by the name 'vegetarian village.'  

== Demographics ==
The population of the village is about 500 with about 110 houses.  

The heart of the village is a notable Hindu temple. All the villagers are strong supporters of [[Pranami Sampraday|Shree Krishna Pranami Sampradaya]] and are [[vegetarians]]. The local authority prohibits smoking, gambling and drinking. 

== Toponymy==
The village was named Najarpur because this place was selected for settlements by most of the groups who migrated to [[Terai]] during 1950s. 'Najar' is a Nepali word meaning 'look' and 'pur' means 'place' in Nepali. Able to gain attention of many migrants for settlement who looked for new places to settle, this place was named 'Najarpur'.

=== Shree Krishna Pranami Mandir Nijananda Dham===
[[File:Mandir Front View.JPG|thumb|Front view of main temple.]]
The Najarpur [[mandir]] (also known as Pukhraj Dham, Sundar Dham and Pranami Mandir Najarpur) is an important place of pilgrimage for [[Nijananda sampradaya|Shree Krishna Pranami Sampradaya]].  It was built by new settlers who migrated to Najarpur during 1950s. Over time, many reforms took  place. By local standards, the temple has a magnificent structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nijanandadham.org.np|title=NijanandaDham Najarpur|work=NijanandaDham Najarpur|language=Hindi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Najarpur: A unique village|url = http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=92790|website = www.myrepublica.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925092000/http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=92790|archivedate = 2015-09-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple's structure is adjacent to "Pukhraj Parbat" -one of the peaks in "Paramdham" as described in the holy book "Shree Tartam Sagar" of [[Nijananda sampradaya]]. The design was suggested and implemented by Pandit Shree Hem Prasad Dahal- a resident of the village and popular teacher of Nijananda sampradaya around Nepal.

=== Shree Krishna Pranami Community Primary School ===
[[Shree Krishna Pranami Community Primary School]] was established under the Najarpur mandir in 1999. It was the first school in the district to implement [[Montessori education|Montessori]] teaching method. It provides quality education and won many awards and prizes. It is considered to be the best school in [[Rautahat District]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4245">The '''National Statement on Religious Diversity''' is a  [[New Zealand]] statement of intent in the field of [[religious diversity]],
it is intended to provide ''“a framework for the recognition of [[New Zealand]]'s diverse faith communities and their harmonious interaction with each other, with government and with other groups in society.”''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/document/28196/statement-on-religious-diversity Statement on religious diversity] Ethnic and religious intolerance&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The statement was prepared by the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] [[Religious Studies]] Programme and authored by Programme Director [[Paul Morris (religious studies professor)|Professor Paul Morris]].  The statement was the subject of a national process of public consultation coordinated by the [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]], and was endorsed by the National Interfaith Forum in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in February 2007 as a basis for ongoing public discussion.

== Government ratification ==
[[Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] presented the statement to the third ''Asia-Pacific Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation'' to be held at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] from May 29–31, 2007.

== Controversy ==
[[Brian Tamaki]], a Bishop of the [[Destiny Church (New Zealand)|Destiny Church]] stated: "That [Christianity] is the chosen religion of the [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. For us to depart from that, don't you think that that is bordering on creating some type of treason, religious treason anyhow?".&lt;ref name="tamaki_statement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=301&amp;objectid=10424395 |title=Denying state religion like treason, says Brian Tamaki - ''New Zealand Herald'' February 17, 2007 |author=Collins, Simon |accessdate=2007-04-20 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=17 February 2007}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll of 501 New Zealanders by Research New Zealand in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Research New Zealand]]|url=http://www.researchnz.com/pdf/Media%20Releases/RNZ%20Media%20Release%20-%20Xtiannation.pdf|title=Limited Support for Christianity as Official Religion|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=2007-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709233131/http://www.researchnz.com/pdf/Media%20Releases/RNZ%20Media%20Release%20-%20Xtiannation.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of controversy has been the fact that the composition of the working group managing the formulation of the National Statement and its endorsement was limited to representatives of religious groups. Consequently, while extending some rights to non-religious people the Statement did omit to extend the right of safety (clause 3). This has led to some, such as the [[New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists]], to criticise the National Statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzarh.org.nz/faq.htm#14|title=NZARH - Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9410">A number of writers, some of whom were connected with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], have claimed that [[Francis Bacon]] (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626), the [[England|English]] [[philosopher]], [[politician|statesman]], [[scientist]], [[jurist]] and [[author]], was a member of secret societies; a smaller number claim that he would have attained the Ascension and became the [[Ascended Master]] [[St._Germain_(Theosophy)|Saint Germain]].

==Secret societies==
Francis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''Theatre of the World'', London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon's alleged connection to the [[Rosicrucians]] and the [[Freemasons]] has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Bevan, ''The Real Francis Bacon'', England: Centaur Press, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; However others, including Daphne du Maurier (in her biography of Bacon), have argued there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians.&lt;ref&gt;Daphne du Maurier, ''The Winding Stair, Biography of Bacon'' 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Dame Frances Yates&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age'', pages 61 - 68, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's ''The New Atlantis'' portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London and Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1618 Francis Bacon decided to secure a lease for [[York House, Strand|York House]]. This had been his boyhood home in London next to the Queen's [[York Place]] before the Bacon family had moved to Gorhambury in the countryside. After Lord Egerton (Lord Keeper of the [[Great Seal of England]]) died, it became available for Bacon to lease.  During the next four years this mansion on the Strand (so large that it had 40 fireplaces) served as the home for Francis and Alice Bacon. Over the next four years Bacon would host banquets at York House that were attended by the leading men of the time, including poets, scholars, authors, scientists, lawyers, diplomats, and foreign dignitaries. Within the banquet hall, Francis gathered the greatest leaders in literature, art, law, education, and social reform.  On 22 January 1621 in honour of Sir Francis Bacon's sixtieth birthday, a select group of men assembled in the large banquet hall in York House without fanfare for what has been described as a Masonic banquet.&lt;ref name="Spear-Shaker"&gt;Helene H. Armstrong, ''Francis Bacon - The Spear Shaker'', San Francisco, California: Golden Gate Press, 1985 {{ISBN|0-9616288-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This banquet was to pay tribute to Sir Francis Bacon. Only those of the Rosicrosse (Rosicrucians) and the Masons who were already aware of Bacon's leadership role were invited.&lt;ref name="Dodd-Life-Story"&gt;Alfred Dodd, ''Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story', Volume 2 - The Age of James'', England: Rider &amp; Co., 1949, 1986. pages 157 - 158, 425, 502 - 503, 518 - 532&lt;/ref&gt; The tables were T-tables with gleaming white drapery, silver, and decorations of flowers. The poet [[Ben Jonson]], a long-time friend of Bacon, gave a Masonic ode to Bacon that day. 

There was a depth of love by a large body of men toward Bacon, similar to some degree in the manner that disciples love a Master.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Veale, ''Son of England'', India: Indo Polish Library, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when taking into account his membership (and some say leadership) of secret societies such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons.&lt;ref name=Spear-Shaker /&gt; In the inner esoteric membership, which included Francis Bacon, vows of celibacy for spiritual reasons were encouraged.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Light"&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''Dedication to the Light'', England: Francis Bacon Research Trust, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faked death theory==
Various authors&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Henry Pott ''Francis Bacon and His Secret Society'', (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smedley-Mystery"&gt;William T. Smedley ''Mystery of Francis Bacon'', London, 1912 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; have written that there were indications that Francis Bacon had gone into debt while secretly funding the publishing of materials for the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, "Spear-Shakers", "Knights of the Helmet", as well as publishing, with the assistance of [[Ben Jonson]], a selection of the plays that they believe [[Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship|he had written under the pen name]] of "[[William Shakespeare|Shake-Speare]]" in a "[[First Folio]]" in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Bowditch,  ''The Connection of Francis Bacon, with the First Folio of Shakespeare's Plays and with the Books on Cipher of his Time'', Cambridge, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Jackson, ''Shaker of the Speare: The Francis Bacon Story'', The Book Guild Ltd. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Pares, ''Knights of the Helmet'', 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. F. Wigston, ''Bacon, Shakespeare and the Rosicrucians'', London England, 1888 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) {{ISBN|978-1-56459-338-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they allege that Bacon faked his own death, crossed the English Channel, and secretly traveled in disguise after 1626 through [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungary]], and other areas utilizing the secret network of Freemasons and Rosicrucians that he was associated with. It is alleged that he continued to write under pseudonyms, as he had done before 1626,&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Theobald, ''Enter Francis Bacon. The Case for Bacon as the True "Shakespeare"'', England: Cecil Palmer, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; continuing to write as late as 1670 (using the pseudonym "Comte De Gabalis").&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Walter Gibson, ''Francis Bacon: A Bibliography of His Works and Baconiana to the Year 1750'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Elinor Von Le Coq, wife of [[Albert von Le Coq|Professor Von Le Coq]] in Berlin, stated that she had found evidence in the German Archives that Francis Bacon stayed after 1626 with the family of [[Johannes Valentinus Andreae]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Theobald, ''Francis Bacon Concealed And Revealed'', London: Cecil Palmer, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Parker Woodward ''Francis Bacon'' London: Grafton &amp; Co. 1920. pages 13, 121 - 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Maurice Bucke,  ''Cosmic Consciousness, A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind'', Philadelphia,  1901. Contains an excellent chapter on Bacon's qualities, consciousness and experiences and how they may have influenced his writings.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basil Montagu]], a biographer of Bacon, states in his "Essays and Selections":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of his funeral no account can be found, nor is there any trace of the scite of the house where he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montagu|first=Basil|title=Essays and Selections|year=1837|isbn=978-1-4368-3777-4|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning early in the 20th century in the [[United States]], a number of [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organizations&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life — Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 - 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; began making the claim that Francis Bacon had never died. They believed that soon after completing the "Shake-Speare" plays, he had feigned his own death on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1626 - doing so in Easter Sunday as a symbolism &lt;ref&gt; Peter Dawkins, Dedication to the Light, England: Francis Bacon Research Trust, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; -  and then traveled extensively outside England, eventually attaining his physical Ascension to another [[Plane (metaphysics)|plane]] on May 1, 1684 in a castle in [[Transylvania]] owned by the [[Rakoczi]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 - 255&lt;/ref&gt; Their belief is that Bacon took on the name "[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]]" on that date, May 1, 1684, and became an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]].

'''Patriota''' ('''PATRI''', {{IPA-pt|patɾiotɐ|}}, "Patriot"), formerly the '''National Ecological Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Ecológico Nacional}}, '''PEN'''), is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Brazil]]. It was registered in the [[Supreme Electoral Court]] in the summer of 2012. The President of the party is the former State Deputy of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] Adilson Barroso, who before creating PEN was a member of the [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]]. The party's TSE (Supreme Electoral Court) Identification Number is 51.

Its platform involves support for [[Conservatism|conservative]] policies, a strong national [[Military policy|policy of defense]], [[zero tolerance]] politics regarding violence and crime, support for the Brazilian [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] sector, the rejection of social and indigenous movements like [[Landless Workers' Movement|MST]], as well as an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance.
It is against corruption, and seeks to uphold traditional values based on [[Christian ethics]]. The party has links with the [[Assemblies of God]], the largest evangelical denomination in Brazil.

==History==
The party was originally founded as National Ecologic Party (PEN) in 2011. The party was a center-right environmentalist party, originally meant to attract environmentalist politician [[Marina Silva]] in case her party didn't get the authorization to take part in the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 Brazilian general election]]. But this proposal failed and the party obtained a small quantity of votes in the 2014 elections, while endorsing then presidential candidate [[Aécio Neves]].

===2017–present===

In 2017, the PEN changed when [[Jair Bolsonaro]] announced he would enter the party, in a bid to run for President in the [[Brazilian general election, 2018|2018 Brazilian general election]]. PEN changed its name to Patriota (PATRI) and abandoned its former environmentalist ideals to become a right-wing [[Conservatism|conservative]] party pursuing a [[right-wing populist]] agenda, influenced by [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] and [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/lauro-jardim/post/pen-sera-patriota-para-dar-candidatura-jair-bolsonaro.html|title=PEN sera Patriota para dar candidatura Jair Bolsonaro|date=August 8, 2017|accessdate=October 15, 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriota has renounced its green and pro-ecologist policies in favor of its conservative and nationalist policies; it has maintained and strengthened its religious opposition to [[abortion]], [[same-sex marriage]] and other [[socially progressive]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/lauro-jardim/post/pen-sera-patriota-para-dar-candidatura-jair-bolsonaro.html|title=PEN será Patriota para dar candidatura a Jair Bolsonaro {{!}} Lauro Jardim - O Globo|last=Góes|first=Bruno|website=Lauro Jardim - O Globo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pagina3.com.br/politica/2017/jul/31/5/bolsonaro-escolhe-o-pen-para-se-lancar-a-presidencia-em-2018|title=Bolsonaro escolhe o PEN para se lançar à Presidência em 2018|last=3|first=Jornal Página|website=www.pagina3.com.br|access-date=2017-09-27|date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The acronym PEN was also seen as an abbreviation of [[Pentecostalism]], the evangelical current of PEN founders, than a coherent ideological current. Since the refoundation as Patriota, the party are making more efforts to appeal for a broader Christian electorate, like socially conservative [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and traditional Protestants like [[baptists]] and [[Presbyterianism|presbyterians]], instead to be a mere political arm of a single church. Not only the acronym was changed, but the ideology was changed too, due to the fact that Bolsonaro sees environmentalists as part of a "conspiracy against Brazil" while his sons [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]] and [[Flávio Bolsonaro]] are [[Climate change denial|global warming deniers]]. These two reasons forced the party to change its name and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/no-pen-o-cobicado-jair-bolsonaro-mira-2018/|title=No PEN, o cobiçado Jair Bolsonaro mira 2018 - EXAME|website=exame.abril.com.br|date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an internal conflict, in January 2018 Jair Bolsonaro gave up on joining Patriota and chose to join the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]]. Nevertheless, the party maintained the proposal of change of name and statute and the party have spoken in the possibility of two other members of the party applying for the candidacy to the presidency of the republic, these include Adilson Barroso himself and the plastic surgeon Dr. [[Roberto M. Rey Jr.]], affiliated to the party since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/bolsonaro-desiste-do-patriota-e-disputara-eleicao-por-outro-partido-ah7bth3ttucu381vly0cctapt|title=Bolsonaro desiste do Patriota e disputará eleição por outro partido|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Patriota launched former firefighter and evangelical pastor [[Cabo Daciolo]] as their presidential nominee, without partnering any political party. Daciolo is known for his controversial political views, which include turning Brazil into a Christian theocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/politica/noticia/7564951/quem-cabo-daciolo-candidato-nacionalista-que-quer-transformar-brasil-uma|title=Quem é Cabo Daciolo, o candidato nacionalista que quer transformar o Brasil em uma teocracia|date=9 August 2018|access-date=8 September 2018|author=Umpieres, Rodrigo Tolotti|work=InfoMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and policies==

===Religious policies===
Due to most members and militants of Patriota being from different Christian branches and racial backgrounds, the party condemns racism and promotes Christian [[ecumenism]], despite this, the party opposes integration with non-Christians, mainly atheists and [[Muslim]]s.
The party follows a deep conservative and fundamentalist orientation, being against [[secularism]], [[abortion]], [[same-sex marriage]], [[LGBT adoption]] and pro-[[gender identity]] policies while referring to it as "gender ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/blog-do-moreno/post/filho-de-bolsonaro-ridiculariza-ideologia-de-genero.html|title=Filho de Bolsonaro ridiculariza ideologia de gênero  - Blog do Moreno - O Globo|website=Blog do Moreno - O Globo}}&lt;/ref&gt; But ever since, the party has adopted more controversial stances, including turning Brazil into a theocratic state and replacing the secular 1988 constitution for a religious-oriented one.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Economic policies===
The party has ambiguous economic policies.{{According to whom|date=September 2018}} While embracing [[economic liberalism]], the party opposes foreign interference, mainly by Chinese companies, in the Brazilian economy.
The party supports the privatization of most Brazilian state-owned companies, but also promotes more Brazilian government interference in some sectors, like the mining sector, and opposes the privatization of [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/novo-partido-de-bolsonaro-vai-se-chamar-patriota-3zvu9gar1luf2g7ba80hlcf8z|title=Novo partido de Bolsonaro vai se chamar Patriota|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's economic policy can be seen as supporting a [[mixed economy]].

===National security policies===
Patriota supports a hard approach against crime and drug trafficking, supporting the lowering of the minimum penal age and favoring [[life imprisonment]] and [[capital punishment]].
The party also supports liberal gun policies, favoring the open carry of weapons and favors large investments on the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]].

Father '''Paul Morgan''' (born 1964) is the former superior of the British district of the [[Society of St Pius X]], a [[traditionalist Catholic]] organisation in irregular canonical standing with the [[Holy See]].

==Biography==
Morgan was ordained by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] at [[Écône]] in 1988.  He has served in the United States and the Philippines, served as Principal of St. Michael's, the Society's school, and was Superior of the SSPX between 2003 and 2015.  He is the son of William J. Morgan, a [[lay theologian]] who was an advocate of the [[sedevacantist]] theory.  He is strongly opposed to the [[Second Vatican Council]] which he claims contain "modernist errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfnews.org/morgan-sspx.htm |title=On the Doctrinal Discussions with Rome |publisher=Cfnews.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220030440/http://www.cfnews.org/morgan-sspx.htm |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan vociferously opposed the decision of the small traditionalist community known as the [[Transalpine Redemptorists]] (who had previously been associated with the [[Society of St. Pius X]]) to reconcile with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Morgan is also opposed to any reconciliation by the SSPX with Rome, until they repudiate what he sees as their errors.

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F. J. (2007). Rational choice and religious economies. Beckford, J. e Demmerath III. NJ (0rgs.) The Sage Handbook of the Sociology of Religion. London: Sage, 81-97.[http://www.sociology.emory.edu/flechner/Rational%20Choice%20and%20Religious%20Economies.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work is inclined to define the concept in terms of Bourdieu's conception of 'capital' in relation to a particular (religious) field.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM., Trzebiatowska, M. &amp; Brittain, CC. (2011). 'Bourdieu, Capital and Conflict in a Religious Field: The Case of the ‘Homosexuality’ Conflict in the Anglican Communion'. Journal of Contemporary Religion, vol 26, no. 3, pp. 355-370.[http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/4260/1/Religiousfields_author_non_format.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verter, B. (2003). Spiritual capital: Theorizing religion with Bourdieu against Bourdieu. Sociological Theory, 21(2), 150-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theologians]] however have questioned the utility of an approach to religion by way of a so-called instinct;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Berkhof, ''Systematic Theology'' (1996) p. 111-2&lt;/ref&gt;[[psychologists]] have disputed the existence of any such specific [[instinct]];&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Pratt, ''The Religious Consciousness'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  while others would point to the advance of [[secularization]] in the modern world as refuting the assumption of a specific religious instinct inevitably leading to the establishment of religion as a fundamental human institution.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
{{main|Paleolithic religion}}
There are no religious [[ritual]]s observed in animals, including our close relatives, chimpanzees and other apes, although chimps were observed to have sometimes collective excitements for no reason.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/Alcorta_Sosis,_Signals_and_rituals_of_humans_and_animals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologists have established the existence of [[Funeral|burial rituals]] among [[Neanderthal]]s some 50,000 years ago:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDHsE_Efy0EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=NEANderthal+religious+rituals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiAUESD11q&amp;sig=Wc-0NamAlVujLYC6fwaxW9ku6ZM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZFu4TMDmHMP38AaX8I3DDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Prayer: A History| authors=Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-618-77360-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their appearance has sometimes been taken as evidence of the human capacity to ''transform'' instinct, rather than to be driven by it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and Jung==
[[Sigmund Freud]] saw human weakness and helplessness as a fundamental force behind the establishment of religion&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; - a view which might seem to draw support from the [[World Values Survey|Inglehart-Welzel]] thesis that links the insecurities of traditional economies to a search for spiritual certainty, the affluence of modernisation to a declining stress on religion.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Foster, ''Luck of the Irish'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) theorized the existence of a [[collective unconscious]], as a residue of what has been learned in humankind's evolution and ancestral past, which contains the instinctual potential for [[creativity]] as well as the spiritual heritage of mankind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22596676/Jung-and-Religion-The-Opposing-Self| title=Jung and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which unconsciously dictates our behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=John |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780892540495 |title=Jung's Thoughts on God: The Religious Depths of Our Psyches (Jung on the Hudson Book Series) by Donald Dyer - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he recognized in man a genetic predisposition to order experience in mythological, religious or symbolic terms,&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Jung reserved judgement as to what bearing this had for the truth-value of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 75-82&lt;/ref&gt; 

He never ceased however to stress the important challenge all such factors presented to any shallowly rationalistic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p.90-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Durkheim]] saw the social, not the instinctual side of mankind as the key to their religious experience.&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse (–Saint Bertrand de Comminges–Rieux)''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Tolosana (–Convenarum–Rivensis)}}; [[French language|French]]: ''Archidiocèse de Toulouse (–Saint-Bertrand de Comminges–Rieux-Volvestre)''; [[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Archidiocèsi de Tolosa (–Sent Bertran de Comenge–Rius (Volvèstre))'') is an [[archdiocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] in France. The diocese comprises the [[Departments of France|Department]] of [[Haute-Garonne]]. Its see is [[Toulouse Cathedral]], in the city of [[Toulouse]], and the current archbishop is Robert Jean Louis Le Gall, appointed in 2006 and [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translated]] from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mende|Diocese of Mende]].

==Suffragans==
The Archdiocese has 7 suffragan dioceses and archdioceses: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Albi|Archdiocese of Albi]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Auch|Archdiocese of Auch]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cahors|Diocese of Cahors]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Montauban|Diocese of Montauban]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pamiers|Diocese of Pamiers]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rodez|Diocese of Rodez]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes|Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes]].

==Jurisdiction==
As re-established by the [[Concordat of 1802]], it included the departments of Haute-Garonne and [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], at which time, the archbishop joined to his own the title of Auch, jurisdiction over Auch being given to the [[Diocese of Agen]], also the title of Narbonne, an archdiocese over which jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the [[Diocese of Carcassonne]], and the title of Albi, over which, though formerly an archdiocese, jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the [[See of Montpellier]]. In consequence of the creation of the [[Archdiocese of Auch]] and [[Archdiocese of Albi]] under the Restoration, the Archbishop of Toulouse only styled himself Archbishop of Toulouse and Narbonne, and when the [[Diocese of Pamiers]] was created the limits of the Archdiocese were restricted to the Department of Haute-Garonne. As thus marked off by the Bull ''Paternae Caritatis'', July, 1822, the Archdiocese of Toulouse includes almost the whole of the ancient [[Diocese of Toulouse]], [[Diocese of Rieux]], and [[Diocese of Comminges]], and a few small portions of the ancient [[Diocese of Montauban]], [[Diocese of Lavaur]], [[Diocese of St-Papoul]], [[Diocese of Mirepoix]], and [[Diocese of Lombez]].

==History==
Toulouse, chief town of the [[Tectosagi]], at the end of the second century B.C. tried to shake off the yoke of Rome during the invasion of the [[Cimbri]], but at the beginning of the empire it was a prosperous Roman civitas with famous schools in which the three brothers of the [[Emperor Constantine]] were pupils. In the fourth century it was reckoned the fifteenth town in importance in the empire.

In 413 it was taken by [[Astulph]], the Goth, and in 419 under [[Wallia]] it became the capital of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. In 508 after conquest by [[Clovis I|Clovis]] it became Frankish. Legends of more or less recent date claim that it was evangelized by [[St. Martial]], but as far as historical evidence goes the see seems to have been founded by [[Saturnin|St. Saturninus]] (Sernin) in the middle of the third century. The ''Passio Sancti Saturnini'' corroborates this date as that of his incumbency and martyrdom. Subsequent tradition claims that he was a disciple of [[St. Peter]]. [[St. Papoul]] was his companion and like him a martyr.

St. Honoratus, given in some lists as St. Saturninus's successor, is recognised as a pre-Schism Western saint by the Orthodox Church and it is therefore wrong to suggest that he seems just to have crept in through error from the fabulous legend of [[St. Firminus of Amiens]].

Among the bishops of Toulouse may be mentioned: [[Rhodanius]] (350-58), exiled by [[Constantius II|Constantius]] to [[Phrygia]] because of his efforts against [[Arianism]] at the [[Council of Béziers]] in 356; [[Hilary of Poitiers|St. Hilary]], whom some historians place before Rhodanius, but who is placed after him by Duchesne; [[St. Sylvius]] (360-400); [[St. Exuperius]] (c. 400), who drove from his diocese in 405 the heretic [[Vigilantius]], saved Toulouse from the Vandals, and was the friend of [[St. Jerome]]; [[St. Germerius]] (Germier), whose episcopate (c. 541) is questioned by Duchesne; [[Magnulphus]] (c. 585), exiled by King [[Gundoald]]; {{Interlanguage link multi|St. Erembert|fr|3=Érembert de Toulouse}}(657), a monk of [[Abbey of Saint Wandrille|Fontenelle]] who returned to his monastery to die.

From being the capital of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]], from 631, Toulouse became in 778 the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] created by [[Charlemagne]], and which in the tenth century was one of the main [[fief]]s of the crown. [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], known as Raymond de Saint Gilles (1042–1105), was one of the leaders of the [[First Crusade]].

[[Raymond VI]] and [[Raymond VII]], Counts of Toulouse, had leanings towards the [[Cathars]]. [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon of Montfort]] in 1218 died under the walls of Toulouse, At this time Toulouse had as bishop [[Fulk of Marseilles]] (1206–1231), who fought against Raymond VI and protected the [[Friars-Preachers]] in their early days. The marriage (1249) of Jeanne, daughter of Raymond VII, with [[Alphonse de Poitiers]], brother of [[Louis IX of France]], led to the uniting in 1271 of the County of Toulouse to the Crown of France, and Toulouse became the capital of the [[Province of Languedoc]].

The See of Toulouse was for a time made famous by [[St. Louis]] (1296–97), son of [[Charles II, King of Naples]] and the Two Sicilies, and of Mary, daughter of the King of Hungary: he was nephew of [[St. Elizabeth of Hungary]] and grand-nephew of [[St. Louis, King of France]]. Louis had resigned to his brother Robert all rights over the Kingdom of Naples, and had accepted from [[Pope Boniface VIII]] the See of Toulouse after becoming a [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan friar]]. His successor was [[Peter de la Chapelle Taillefer]] (1298–1312) who was created cardinal in 1305.

To this epoch belongs a change that took place in the history of the Diocese of Toulouse. It decreased in size but increased in dignity. Before 1295 the Diocese of Toulouse was very extensive. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Bishop Fulk had wished to divide it into several dioceses. In 1295 a portion of territory was cut off by Boniface VIII to form the [[Diocese of Pamiers]]. Then in 1319 John XXII cut off the Diocese of Toulouse from the metropolitan church of Narbonne and made it a metropolitan with the Sees of Montauban, Saint-Papoul, Rieux, and Lombez as suffragans; a little later Lavaur and Mirepoix also became suffragans of Toulouse. The majority of these sees were composed of territory cut off from the ancient See of Toulouse itself. According to Pope John XXII, not only was the diocese too large and too populated for a single bishop to carry out all of his necessary functions, but also it was immensely rich and did not spend its wealth for the growth of the faith, but on luxuries and disspation of every sort.&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Vidal, "Les origines de la province ecclésiastique de Toulouse," ''Annales du Midi'' [https://archive.org/details/annalesdumidi15univuoft 15 (1903)], pp. 469-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXII]] offered the [[See of Riez]] in Provence to [[Gaillard de Preyssac]], Bishop of Toulouse since 1305, whom he suspected of having conspired against him with [[Hugues Giraud]], [[Bishop of Cahors]]. Gaillard refused the offer, and retired to Avignon where he died in 1327.

The first archbishop was [[Raymond de Comminges]], [[Bishop of Maguelonne]] from 1309, who, when created cardinal in 1327, resigned the See of Toulouse in order to take up his duties at the Papal Curia in Avignon, where he died in 1348. He left a book on the "Passion of the Saviour", and some "Sermons for Festival Days". Among his successors were: the Dominican [[William de Laudun]] (1327–1345), previously [[bishop of Vienne]]; [[Raymond de Canillac]] (1345–50), who resigned upon being named a cardinal in 1350; Cardinal [[Francis de Gozie]] (1391–92); [[Bernard du Rosier]] (1451–1474), author of two treatises on the temporal power of the pope and on the liberty of the Church, and who founded at Toulouse the [[College de Foix]] for the support of twenty-five poor scholars, where he collected one of the first libraries of the period; [[Jean d'Orléans-Longueville|John of Orléans]] (1503–1533), cardinal in 1533.

Protestantism entered Toulouse in 1532 through foreign students. As early as 1563 the Catholics of Toulouse founded a league to uphold the prerogatives of Catholicism, protected by the Parlement but jeopardized by certain Protestant town-councillors. From 1586 to 1595 the League party under Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, and the [[Duc de Joyeuse]] held control in Toulouse. The rule of [[Henry IV of France]] was definitively recognized there in 1596. During this period of religious unrest Toulouse had many notable archbishops: [[Gabriel de Gramont]] (1533–34), cardinal in 1530; [[Odet de Coligny|Odet de Châtillon, Cardinal de Coligny]] (1534–1550), who became a Calvinist, married in 1564, and died in 1571; [[Anthony Sanguin]] (1550–1559), Cardinal de Meudon in 1539; [[Georges d'Armagnac]] (1562–1577), cardinal in 1544; [[François de Joyeuse]] (1584–1605), cardinal in 1583 and who conducted the negotiations between Henry IV and the Holy See.

Among subsequent archbishops we may mention: [[Louis de Nogaret]] (1614–1627), Cardinal de Lavalette in 1621, but who never received orders and from 1635 to 1637 led part of the French troops in the [[Thirty Years War]]; [[Charles de Montchal]] (1628–1651), who in 1635 upheld the decision of the Holy See, against the opinion of the majority of the Assembly of Clergy, that the marriages of princes of blood contracted without royal consent were not null; [[Pierre de Marca]] (1652–1662), who under [[Louis XIII]] aided largely in the re-establishment of Catholicism in [[Béarn]], in 1621 became president of the Parlement of Béarn, was afterwards made Councillor of State by Louis XIII, and wrote a work of [[Gallican]] tendency "De concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii", a voluminous work on Spain and especially on the [[Province of Tarragona]], and a commentary on the [[Psalms]]; he was secretary to the [[Assembly of the Clergy of France]] of April, 1656, which drew up a formula condemning the Five propositions drawn from the "Augustinus", and he died in 1662 just as he was about to take possession of the [[See of Paris]]; [[Pierre de Bonzy]] (1672–1673), cardinal in 1672; [[Charles Antoine de Laroche Aymon]] (1740–1752), cardinal in 1771; [[Etienne Charles de Lomenie]] (1763–1789), Cardinal de Brienne in 1788; [[Anne de Clermont Tonnerre]] (1820–1830), cardinal in 1822; [[Paul d'Astros]] (1830–1851), cardinal in 1850; [[Julien Desprez]] (1859–1895), cardinal in 1879; [[François-Désiré Mathieu]] (1896–1899), cardinal in 1899, was a member of the [[French Academy]], wrote the history of Lorraine under the ancien regime, of the Concordat of 1801–2, and of the [[conclave of 1903]]; he died in 1908.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">The '''[[Church of Scientology]]''' has no official presence in '''[[Egypt]]''' and there are no known membership statistics available. In 2002, two members were detained by Egyptian authorities under the charges of "contempt of religion". However, some books by the founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], have started to appear in several Egyptian bookstores in the late 2000s, and were even approved by [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], the highest [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] learning institution in the Muslim world. Egypt is listed on an official Scientology website as being a country "in which Dianetics and Scientology services are ministered". [[Narconon]], an organization which promotes Hubbard's drug abuse treatment, has a branch in [[Faiyum|Fayoum]].&lt;ref name="Egypt Independent"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/scientology-rears-head-egypts-bookstores | title=Scientology rears head in Egypt's bookstores | publisher=Egypt Independent | date=7 March 2010 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | author=El Dahshan, Mohamed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detention of two members ==
On December 24, 2001, Egyptian authorities arrested two members of the Church of Scientology: Mahmoud Massarwa, a 28-year-old Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin, and his Palestinian wife Wafaa Ahmad. They were charged with "contempt of religion" and were accused of trying to establish a branch in Egypt and harm the country's two main religions "with the aim of sparking riots". Two months later, a court extended their custody for 30 days to allow further police questioning, adding that they have confessed to have come to Egypt in order to spread their doctrine. Human rights director of the Church of Scientology, [[Leisa Goodman]], denied these claims on behalf of the church and said that the couple was in the country representing the Italian branch of [[New Era Publications]], a firm that publishes the works of L. Ron Hubbard, to promote Hubbard's book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', stressing that the authorities had allowed the book's entry to Egypt. "We are greatly concerned at their prolonged detention, which appears to be a violation of their right to freedom of expression," Goodman said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2002/03/05/Egypt-jails-two-Scientologists/UPI-20001015320937/ | title=Egypt jails two Scientologists | publisher=United Press International | date=5 March 2002 | accessdate=28 August 2014 | author=El Amrani, Issandr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were finally released the next month and the court ruled that condemning people for adopting new ideas is a violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wwrn.org/articles/10373/ | title=Scientology followers released from Egyptian jail | publisher=Worldwide Religious News | work=Channel Africa | date=28 March 2002 | accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology books in Egypt==
Arabic-language translations of books by L. Ron Hubbard, such as ''Dianetics'' and ''[[The Way to Happiness]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/17340 | title=Lebanon Cruises on Scientology’s “Way to Happiness” | publisher=Al-Akhbar | date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | author=Al-Saadi, Yazan}}(→ [http://english.al-akhbar.com/sites/default/files/Al-Azhar-Al-Sharif-Validation-Letter-with-Countries-Approving-T.pdf Al-Azhar Validation Letter])&lt;/ref&gt; have been sold in several book stores in Egypt and were made available at the annual [[Cairo International Book Fair]]. The books bore the approval stamp of Al-Azhar, the Muslim world's highest Sunni learning institution. They were printed in Denmark, both in English and Arabic, and shipped to Egypt by New Era Publications. Ahmed Abdel Khalek, a professor at [[Al-Azhar University]] who has served as chief-of-staff and translator to the [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]], said that he had no objections to the approval of the books unless they violated "morality and traditions". "We should be open-minded and listen to the other. After all, if I disagree with something in a book, I should write a rebuttal," he said. New Era Publications' public relations office said that Al-Azhar's move was essential and insisted that there was nothing religious about the books' nature.&lt;ref name="Egypt Independent"/&gt;

==Narconon==
Narconon Egypt, a drug abuse treatment center based in Fayoum, is the Egyptian branch of the global [[Narconon]] organization. The branch's executive director, Mohamed Nour Salah, said that there is no connection between Narconon Egypt and the Church of Scientology, stressing that it is a non-profit organization and that none of the staff are Scientologists. Nevertheless, Narconon Egypt's website mentions Hubbard's work as an inspiration for its founding.&lt;ref name="Egypt Independent"/&gt;

[[File:Bugaku(Naiku) 02.JPG|thumb|Ise Shrine was one of the first to isolate its ''kami'' from Buddhism.]]
The term {{nihongo|'''''shinbutsu kakuri'''''|神仏隔離|isolation of ''[[kami]]'' from [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]]}} in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency in medieval and early modern Japan to keep some ''kami'' separate from Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"&gt;Rambelli and Teeuwen (2002:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; While some ''kami'' were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same ''kami'' in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It should not be confused with ''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'' ("separation of ''kami'' and buddhas") or with [[haibutsu kishaku]] ("abolish Buddhas and destroy Shākyamuni"), which are phenomenons recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.

== History ==
When foreign Buddhism arrived in Japan it became necessary to harmonize it with local ''kami'' beliefs. This was done in a number of ways, among them ''[[shinbutsu shūgō]]'', or "[[syncretism]] of ''kami'' and buddhas", and its opposite, ''shinbutsu kakuri''.

===Fusion of ''kami'' and buddhas===
{{main|Shinbutsu shūgō}}
After Buddhism arrived in Japan, the Japanese developed a syncretism of local ''kami'' beliefs and foreign Buddhism called [[shinbutsu shūgō]]. When Buddhism was introduced through [[China]] in the late [[Asuka period]] (6th century), rather than discard the old belief system the Japanese tried to reconcile it with the new, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist [[temples]] were attached to local [[Shinto shrines]] and vice versa; both were devoted to both ''kami'' and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on the local religion can be seen for example in the fact that the type of shrine we see today, with a large worship hall and images, is itself of Buddhist origin.&lt;ref name="Tamura21"&gt;Tamura, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; The influential {{nihongo|''[[honji suijaku]]''|本地垂迹}} theory, common in Japan until the [[Meiji period]], even states that Buddhist gods choose to appear to the Japanese as native ''kami'' in order to save them.&lt;ref name="BT95"&gt;Breen and Teeuwen (2000:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to ''shinbutsu shūgō''===
While in popular practice ''kami'' and buddhas were both mixed and combined in a "common religion", they were at the same time isolated and separated in various ways elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;Satō Makoto;&lt;/ref&gt; The two religions never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity inside a difficult, largely unsystematized and tense relationship.&lt;ref name="sueki7"&gt;Sueki (2007:7-8)&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship was, rather than between two systems, between particular ''kami'' and particular buddhas.&lt;ref name="sueki7"/&gt; The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Besides ''shinbutsu shugo'' there was always the other side of the coin, the ''shinbutsu kakuri''.&lt;ref name="sueki7"/&gt; For example, at [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]] some rites were ''kami'' rites, other were Buddhist, and were therefore conducted by different people.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; There was in the Japanese a strong resistance to the complete assimilation of their ''kami'' with foreign gods.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;

This visible resistance to Buddhism can be traced all the way back to the [[Nihon shoki]]'s sixth-century account of the first introduction of Buddhism to Japan.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Later history is dotted with accounts of friction between some ''kami'' and Buddhist temples that lie in their territories.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;

At [[Ise Shrine|Ise Jingū]], for example, the {{nihongo|''Ise Daijingūji''|伊勢大神宮寺}} shrine-temple was moved twice because of the incessant rain caused by the ''kami'' angered by its excessive proximity to the shrines.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; An 804 book, the {{nihongo|''Kōtaijingū Gishikichō''|皇太神宮儀式帳}}, stipulates that on Ise lands some Buddhist words (buddha, [[sūtra]], [[pagoda|gojūnotō]], monk, temple or vegetarian food) cannot be uttered and must be replaced with others.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; The book even specifies these replacement words ({{nihongo|''imikotoba''|忌み言葉}}) to be used instead of proscribed ones: ''nakago'' ("middle child") for a buddha, ''kawarabuki'' ("tile-roofed building" for "temple," and ''somegami'' ("stained paper") for ''sūtra''.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;

There was therefore a conscious desire to keep the ''kami'' away from Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Toward the end of the ninth century the practice spread to other shrines.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; The Jōgan shiki (871) prohibits all Buddhist rites at court offices and at all province offices during the imperial enthronement period, or {{nihongo|''daijōe''|大嘗会}}.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; Also, monks and nuns couldn't enter the imperial palace during the abstinence before, during and after some ''kami'' rituals at court.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; The [[Engi shiki]] says that, in some periods of the year, monks and nuns may not enter the imperial palace.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; In the Heian period this kind of separation became a common practice with many well-attested practical consequences.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; This taboo was rigorously observed at the imperial palace for centuries.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; It not only lasted, but gained new force during the [[Edo period]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]].&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It is important to note that Buddhism was proscribed only insofar as the emperor was concerned and during the periods prescribed by the rites, but otherwise the usual mixing of ''kami'' and ''buddhas'' would take place.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;

=== Origins of the ''shinbutsu kakuri'' ===
The precise origin of the phenomenon does not appear to be related to the Buddhist special relationship with death.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Direct contact with death was forbidden in temples too, and Buddhism was not outlawed at most shrines.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; ''Shinbutsu kakuri'' originated within rituals and shrines like Ise Jingū with deep ties which had profound ties with the emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Ise Jungū is the imperial household's shrine. According to the Encyclopedia of Shinto article [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=781 Ise Shinkō], Ise Jungū is dedicated specifically to the emperor, and in the past even his mother, wife and grandmother needed his permission to worship there.&lt;/ref&gt; and always remained strictly tied to him and to the ceremony of his enthronement.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It later spread to other official ceremonies.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It has been argued that it was a reaction against Buddhist political interference that peaked with the [[Dōkyō]] incident of 768 in which [[Empress Kōken|empress Shotoku]] wanted to give the throne to monk Dōkyō.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It seems therefore that imperial ritual was isolated from Buddhism to protect the principle of hereditary imperial rule.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;

The practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of ''kami'' practices into Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and [[Kamo Shrine]]s allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of ''kami''.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;

'''Taegeuk''' ({{Korean|태극|太極}}, {{IPA-ko|tʰɛgɯk̚}}) is the Korean form of the Chinese term  ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' (old spelling "Taichi"), meaning "supreme ultimate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gukgiwon (국기원)|title=Taekwondo textbook|date=2005|publisher=오성출판사|location=Seoul|page=303|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=cCY2AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=taegeuk&amp;dq=taegeuk&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpl-iZlaPLAhUBUaYKHf1lAAY4ChDoAQg2MAQ|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=William Elford|title=Interpreting Interpretation: Textual Hermeneutics as an Ascetic Discipline|date=1994|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa|isbn=9780271010618|page=303|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=baCoPZPE1bQC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=taegeuk+chinese+word&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI2s7omKPLAhXDIaYKHcXqCYcQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=taegeuk%20chinese%20word&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Korean term more specifically refers to the graphical symbol (''[[taijitu]]'') composed of interlocking semi-circles composing a [[sinusoid]] design.
The symbol was chosen for the design of the [[flag of South Korea|national flag]] in the 1880s, known as ''{{transl|ko|taegeukgi}}'' (Hangul: {{lang|ko|태극기}}, with ''gi'' meaning "flag").&lt;ref name="KOIS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korean overseas information service|title=Handbook of Korea.|date=2003|publisher=Korean Overseas Information Service|location=Seoul|isbn=9788973750054|page=568|edition=11.|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=IBpxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=taegeuk+7th+century&amp;dq=taegeuk+7th+century&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1zZTWmqPLAhUlqqYKHR96CTwQ6AEILTAC|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taegeuk is commonly associated with [[Korean Taoism|Korean Taoist]] philosophical values&lt;ref name="taeguek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Sang Yil|last2=Ro|first2=Young Chan|title=Hanism as Korean mind : interpretation of Han philosophy|date=1984|publisher=Eastern Academy of Human Sciences|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=0932713009|page=66|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=EfTWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=taegeuk+taoism&amp;dq=taegeuk+taoism&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1gLbzmaPLAhVD26YKHRJNCRUQ6AEIHzAB|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Korean shamanism]].&lt;ref name="sanshin"&gt;[http://www.san-shin.org/Sacred-Mtns-01.html Korea's Sam-Taegeuk Symbol]. san-shin.org, dedicated to the sacred mountains of Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pakua.svg|thumb|230px|The Pal Gwae ([[Bagua]]) from [[Taoism|Daoism]] &lt;br /&gt;
(palgwae = "eight trigrams", {{hangul|팔괘}}, {{hanja|八卦}})]]

The Taegeuk has been in use for the majority of written [[history of Korea]].&lt;ref name="Islam"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Islam|first1=M. Rafiqul|title=Unconventional Gas Reservoirs: Evaluation, Appraisal, and Development|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780128005941|page=352|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2zJdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The origins of the interlocking-[[sinusoid]] design can be traced to as early as the [[Goguryeo]] or [[Silla period]], e.g. in the decoration of a sword, dated to the 5th or 6th century, recovered from the grave of [[Michu of Silla]],&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the International Symposium on Cultivation and Utilization of Asian, Sub-tropical, and Underutilized Horticultural Crops: Seoul, Korea, August 13-19 2006'' (2011), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; or an artifact with the a Taegeuk pattern of similar age found in the Bogam-ri tombs of [[Baekje]] at [[Naju]], [[South Jeolla Province]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.dongascience.com/PHP/NewsView.php?kisaid=20090604100000000166 국내 最古 태극무늬, 1400년 만에 햇빛] Dong-A Science, Yoon wan-jun, 2009-06-04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/05/135_46228.html |title=Oldest Taegeuk Pattern Found in Naju |publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the compound of Gameunsa, a temple built in AD&amp;nbsp;628 during the reign of [[Jinpyeong of Silla|King Jinpyeong of Silla]], a stone object, perhaps the foundation of a pagoda, is carved with the Taegeuk design.&lt;ref name="KOIS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0002819 경주감은사지] Encyclopedia of Korea&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Gojoseon]], that is the ancient kingdom of Joseon, the design was used to represent [[Korean Taoism|Daoism in Korea]] and to express the hope for harmony of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="KOIS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Illustrated Guide to Korean Culture - 233 traditional key words by The National Academy of the Korean Language&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korean flag==
[[File:Flag of South Korea.svg|thumb|265px|[[Flag of South Korea|Republic of Korea's National Flag]]&lt;br /&gt;({{hangul|태극기}}) ]]
The Taegeuk symbol is most prominently displayed on [[Flag of South Korea|South Korea's]] [[national flag]], called the ''taegeukgi'' (along with four of the eight [[Bagua#Trigrams|trigrams]] used in divination). Because of the Taegeuk's association with the national flag, it is often used as a patriotic symbol, as are the colors red, blue, and black. The “geon” trigram (☰) represents the heaven, spring, east, and justice. The “gon” trigram (☷) symbolizes the earth, summer, west, and vitality, the “gam” trigram (☵) the moon, winter, north, and wisdom, and the “ri” trigram (☲) the sun, autumn, south, and fruition. The four trigrams supposedly move in an endless cycle from “geon” to “ri” to “gon” to “gam” and back to “geon” in their pursuit of perfection.&lt;ref name="Ken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ludden|first1=Ken|title=Mystic Apprentice Volume 3: Meditative Skills with Symbols and Glyphs Supplemental|date=2010|isbn=9780557728503|page=131|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=USQqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=south+korean+national+flag+taegeuk&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA8p-NnqPLAhUGI6YKHaRfAFoQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20korean%20national%20flag%20taegeuk&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white background symbolizes the homogeneity, integrity and peace-loving nature of the Korean people. Traditionally, Koreans often wore white clothing, earning the nickname “white-clothed people” and therefore the color white epitomizes the Korean people.&lt;ref name="Islam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ken" /&gt;

==Variants==

===Tricolored Taegeuk===
[[File:SamTaegeukFan.jpg|thumb|upright|Hand fan with a three-color Taegeuk Design]]
A popular variant in Korea is the tricolor Taegeuk (''samsaeguitaegeuk'' {{lang|ko|삼색의태극}} or ''samtaegeuk'' {{lang|ko|삼태극}}), which adds a yellow lobe or "pa" ({{hanja|巴}} {{hangul|파}}).
The yellow is taken as representing humanity, in addition to the red and blue representing earth and heaven respectively. This version is related to the Buddhist symbol of [[Gankyil]].

A rendition of the tricolored Taegeuk also appeared in the official logo of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] accompanied by the five Olympic rings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aldaver.com/Images/Os/lg1988sm.gif&lt;/ref&gt; A [https://web.archive.org/web/20160112125448/http://www.prestigiousbeautypageants.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Logo_of_Miss_Asia_Pacific_World.png similar symbol] is used by the [[Miss Asia Pacific World]] [[Beauty pageant|Beauty Pageant]], which was hosted in South Korea from its inception in 2011 until 2014, and most recently hosted in Australia in 2018.

Taeguk is a Legendary Gem in Diablo III. It can only be socketed into Amulets and Rings, and drops from Greater Rift Guardians.
This gem gradually increases damage as the player casts channeled skills (even if they do not hit anything), although for a very brief time, stacking multiplicatively with other similar modifiers. The buff stacks up to 10 times. Upgrading only increases the damage bonus per stack.
At rank 25, it also causes adds an Armor bonus for every active stack.
Due to the way this gem works, it is mostly useful to builds with channeled skills. Note that Electrocute and Blood Siphon are not affected. The following skills are empowered: Whirlwind, Rapid Fire, Strafe, Tempest Rush, Firebats, Arcane Torrent, Disintegrate, and Ray of Frost.

===Paralympics symbol===
{{see|Paralympic symbols}}
[[File:Paralympics logo 1988-94.svg|150px|thumb|First Paralympic symbol (1988-1994) used five ''pa''.]]
The first designated [[Paralympic]] logo, created for the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], was based on the traditional ''pa'' ({{hangul|파}} {{hanja|巴}}), the spiral or [[sinusoid]] components making up the Taegeuk symbol.
In March 1992,&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.sportmuseum-leipzig.de/Ablage-Zeitung/1+2-2003/Seite6.htm Vom Rehabilitationssport zu den Paralympics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305103827/http://www.sportmuseum-leipzig.de/Ablage-Zeitung/1+2-2003/Seite6.htm |date=2012-03-05 }} ([[German language|German]]), Sportmuseum Leipzig&lt;/ref&gt; the Paralympic symbol was changed to a version utilizing only three ''pa''. This was not fully adopted until after the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]], since the Lillehammer Paralympic Organizing Committee had by then already started a marketing program based on the five-pa version. The three-''pa'' version remained in place from the close of the Lillehammer Games through the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=psm&gt;{{cite web|title=New Logo and Motto for IPC|url=http://www.paralympic.org/paralympian/20032/20030201.html|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=18 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406004147/http://www.paralympic.org/paralympian/20032/20030201.html|archivedate=6 April 2008|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flags&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/oly@ipc.html International Paralympic Committee - The IPC logo, motto and flag], CRWFlags.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
God lives in an apartment in Brussels which he shares with his meek wife and his 10-year-old daughter [[Enki|Ea]], to whom he is emotionally and physically abusive. God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well. 

The first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, when he discovered he had only days left to live, decided to live them as a girl. Ea encourages him to live each day as the equivalent of one month. 

God is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world He suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations He created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and He is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.

Ea and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune. God reaches Uzbekistan where he works on an assembly line manufacturing washing machines. He keeps on searching without success for the washing machine with the escape hatch that will take him back to his apartment.

In promoting the book, Hannah described how the inspiration for the nominal story came from an incident where, visiting a friend at her home, she was asked to sign a visitors book, a request she found strange given the everyday surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97KIeiPKneM|title=Visitor’s Book promo video|first=|last=Sort of Books|date=27 July 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tegoborze Prophecy''' (Polish: ''Przepowiednia z Tegoborza'') is a verse composition, which describes post-World War One and post-World War Two fate of [[Poland]]. Its origins date back to late 19th century, however, its author and exact date of creation have not been confirmed so far.

== History ==
The history of the [[prophecy]] begins in 1893 in Tegoborze, a village located in southern [[Lesser Poland]]. The village belonged to Count [[Wladyslaw Wieloglowski]], who was keenly interested in [[paranormal]] activities, [[occultism]] and [[clairvoyance]]. Wieloglowski frequently invited there various fortune tellers and other persons who claimed magical abilities. 

On September 23 of that year, a mysterious woman appeared in Wieloglowski’s house. She stated she was a medium and offered to foresee future. Apparently, she got into touch with a ghost, which left her a message concerning Poland’s fate. Wieloglowski, who was present during the session, wrote everything in his diary.

A few years later, after the Count’s death, the house was inherited by his relative Aleksander Wieloglowski, who decided to remodel the complex and found an archive, with words of the prophecy. Since he was not interested in it, he decided to hand it to the [[Ossolineum]] library in [[Lwow]], where it was carefully stored as the Tegoborze Prophecy. 

At first, the composition did not raise interest and was not taken seriously. In 1912, the Gazeta Narodowa newspaper published it, together with a Russian translation. In the following years, the prophecy was forgotten, but this changed on March 27, 1939, a few months before [[Polish September Campaign|German and Soviet invasion on Poland]]. The popular [[Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny]] daily published the text, together with an article about its history. Thousands of readers got to know the composition, and it became extremely popular during the war, when Poland was occupied by the two powers - [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]]. It raised spirits of the oppressed Poles, giving them hope for a better future of their homeland.

Current whereabouts of the original text of the prophecy are not known. It was lost during the war and has not been found.

== The author ==
Name of the author of the prophecy is not known. In the Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny, it was signed as an anonymous medium, while the 1912 Gazeta Narodowa wrote that it was written by a ghost of [[Adam Mickiewicz]], which appeared in the house of Count Wieloglowski in 1893. 

[[Stanislaw Hadyna]], a journalist and composer, came up with a different author. According to him, the author of the prophecy is [[Agnieszka Pilchowa]], a popular interbellum period clairvoyant. However, considering Pilchowa’s date of birth, it is not likely.

{{unreferenced|date=August 2008}}

'''Virgin of Azahar''' is one of the [[invocation]]s of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], having her origin in the Spanish city of [[Beniaján]], near [[Murcia]]. Beniaján is known worldwide by the abundant production of [[citrus]] fruits that its factories [[export]] around the world. Citrus is the most important industrial activity in this town.

The [[sculpture]] receives [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] in a small [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] erected in city's outskirts, in a fecund place called ''Rincón de Villanueva''. Her name comes from the natural citrus blossom branch (''Azahar'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) which is on the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]]'s hands. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] citrus and [[lemon]] trees are around this small church.

== Festivity ==
The festivity date is the 1st of May. The sculpture is carried from Beniaján to the hermitage, crossing gardens and fields, in a folk procession.
