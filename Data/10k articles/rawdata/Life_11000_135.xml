[[Image:Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh Coin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coin struck in the name of Abdallah.]]
'''Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh''' was a [[Persian people|Persian]] general and governor for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

He was the son of Khordadbeh, a [[Zoroastrian]] from [[Khurasan]] who converted to [[Islam]]. By ca. 815, Abdallah served as the governor of [[Tabaristan]], and conquered the mountainous regions of Tabaristan from the local [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Sharwin I]]. During the same year, he campaigned in [[Daylam]], where he conquered two cities and captured its ruler [[Abu Layla]]. In 817, he aided [[Mazyar]], an Iranian prince, to escape from Tabaristan and reach the court of the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]]. Abdallah was also a friend of the Persian musician [[Ishaq al-Mawsili]].

Not much more is known about Abdallah; he had a son named Abu'l-Qasim Ubaydallah, better known as [[Ibn Khordadbeh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pX5eDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Abdallah+ibn+Khordadbeh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjos5im7JPdAhWKwI8KHQqOC20Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abdallah%20ibn%20Khordadbeh&amp;f=false|title=Jews and the Sea|last=Zendle|first=Tony|date=2018-05-19|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780244949136|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in 820 in Khurasan and was later raised in [[Baghdad]], where Abdallah probably then resided. He thereafter disappears from sources, and later died at an unknown date in the 9th-century.

'''Abgar II''' (ruled 68&amp;ndash;53 BC) was a [[Arab people|Arab]] king of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in [[Osroene]] (today part of eastern [[Turkey]]). In 64, he sided with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] helping [[Pompey]]'s [[legatus|legate]] [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] when the latter occupied northern [[Mesopotamia]], but it is alleged that he helped to betray [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Marcus Crassus]] by leading him out onto an open plain, resulting in 53 in the [[Battle of Carrhae]], which destroyed an entire [[Roman army]]. What is certain is that he gained no benefits from the battle, since shortly after he was deposed by [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]] in a move to strengthen [[Parthia]]n control over the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1207">'''Abishabis''' or '''Small Eyes''' (died 30 August 1843) was a religious leader of the [[Cree]] [[First Nation]] who became the prophet of a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] religious movement that swept through the Cree communities of northern [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]] during the 1840s.  The religious philosophy of this movement was an admixture of [[Christianity]] and Cree beliefs.  However, after losing much of his influence, Abishabis murdered a First Nations family living near [[York Factory]].  Following his arrest and imprisonment at [[Fort Severn, Ontario|Fort Severn]], a group of three irate Cree forcibly removed him from his jail cell and took their revenge by smashing out his brains with an axe and burning his body.

During the [[Expedition of Bir Maona|expedition of Bi'r]], four months after the [[Battle of Uhud]], a delegation of Banu 'Amir came to Muhammad and presented him with a gift. Abu Bara' stayed in [[Medina]]. Muhammad declined to accept that gift because it was from a [[polytheist]] and asked Abu Bara' to embrace Islam. In response, Abu Bara' requested that Muhammad send some Muslims to the people of [[Najd]] to invite them to convert to Islam. At first, Muhammad was quite apprehensive of this, as he feared that some harm might befall on these Muslim missionaries. Yo assuage Muhammad’s hesitation, Abu Bara' guaranteed the safety of the Muslim emissaries. He stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;"I will protect them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ibn Ishaq's Biography claims that forty men were sent to them; but [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that there were seventy — Al-Mundhir bin ‘Amr, one of Banu Sa‘ida, nicknamed ‘Freed to die’ — commanded that group, who were the best and most learned in the Qur'an and jurisprudence.

Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.

Abuse of authority is separated from [[abuse of power]] in that the act is originally condoned, but is extended beyond that initially conceived and is in not all cases

===Alcohol abuse===
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Alcohol abuse, as described in the [[DSM-IV]], is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s despite its negative consequences.&lt;ref name="pubs.niaaa"&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. [http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa30.htm "Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence"] ''Alcohol Alert,'' No. 30 PH 359, October 1995.&lt;!--Retrieved 17 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol abuse is sometimes referred to by the less specific term [[alcoholism]]. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking for long periods of time but are unable to control themselves once they start.&lt;ref name="Neil R 2010, p.572"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Neil R. |author2=Heth, C. Donald |title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour |publisher=Pearson Canada Inc. |year=2010 |page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binge drinking]] is another form of alcohol abuse. Frequent binge drinking or getting severely drunk more than twice is classed as alcohol misuse.&lt;ref name="Michaud-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | date=February 2007 | first1=PA. | last1=Michaud | title=Alcohol misuse in adolescents – a challenge for general practitioners | journal=Ther Umsch | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=121–6 | doi=10.1024/0040-5930.64.2.121 | pmid=17245680}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research done through international surveys, the heaviest drinkers happen to be the United Kingdom's adolescent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McArdle |first=Paul |title=Alcohol abuse in adolescents |journal=[[Archives of Disease in Childhood]] |date=27 February 2008 |volume=93 |issue=6| doi = 10.1136/adc.2007.115840 |pages=524–527 |pmid=18305075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal abuse===
{{Main|Cruelty to animals}}
{{See also|:Category:Cruelty to animals}}
Animal abuse is the infliction of [[suffering]] or [[harm]] upon animals, other than [[human]]s, for purposes other than self-defense. More narrowly, it can be harm for specific gain, such as killing animals for fur. Diverging viewpoints are held by jurisdictions throughout the world.

===Anti-social behavior===
{{Main|Anti-social behavior}}
{{See also|Incivility}}
Anti-social behavior is often seen as public [[behavior]] that lacks judgement and consideration for others and may damage them or their property. It may be intentional, as with [[vandalism]] or [[graffiti]], or the result of [[negligence]]. Persistent anti-social behavior may be a manifestation of an [[antisocial personality disorder]]. The counterpart of anti-social behavior is [[social behavior|pro-social behavior]], namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.&lt;ref&gt;

It typically involves subtle methods of [[coercion]] such as [[intimidation]]. Bullying can be defined in many different ways. Although the UK currently has no legal definition of bullying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2755 |title=The University of Manchester : Dignity at Work and Study Procedure for Students |publisher=Documents.manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some US states have laws against it. Bullying is usually done to coerce others by [[fear]] or [[Coercion|threat]].

===Character assassination===
{{Main|Character assassination}}
Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's [[reputation]]. It may involve [[exaggeration]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of [[defamation]] and can be a form of an [[ad hominem]] (to the person) argument.

Child abuse is the physical or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements |date=1 January 2008 |author1=Leeb, R.T. |author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5=Arias, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016225901/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |archivedate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most child abuse occurs in a child's home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organisations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]], [[psychological abuse|psychological/emotional abuse]], and [[sexual abuse]].

Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a "care institution", such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol, England|Bristol]], leading to its closure and suspension or firing of staff members.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

===Discriminatory abuse===
{{Main|Discrimination|:Category:Discrimination| Template:Discrimination|Template:Discrimination sidebar|Prejudice|Religious discrimination}}
Discriminatory abuse involves picking on or treating someone unfairly because something about them is different; for example concerning:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[ageism|age]]
* clothing or appearance
* [[ethnic discrimination|ethnicity]], nationality or culture including traits like [[language]]
* [[Sexism|gender]], including gender-related traits (e.g., Pregnancy)
* health (such as HIV/AIDS) or [[disability]] (e.g., [[mental disorders]])

* lifestyle or occupation
* [[racism|race]] or skin colour
* [[religious persecution|religion]] or political affiliation
* [[Homophobia|sexuality]] and [[sexual orientation]]
* social class or creed
* weight or height
}}

Discriminatory laws such as [[redlining]] have existed in many countries. In some countries, controversial attempts such as [[racial quota]]s have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination.

Other acts of discrimination include [[political libel]], [[defamation]] of groups and [[stereotype]]s based on [[exaggeration]]s.

Domestic abuse can be broadly defined as any form of abusive behaviours by one or both partners in an [[intimate relationship]], such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends. It is important to remember that abuse is always intentional, and can not happen by accident.
Domestic violence has many forms, including:
* physical aggression (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, throwing objects), or threats thereof
* [[sexual abuse]]
* [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]
* financial abuse (withholding money or controlling all money, including that of other family members)
* social abuse (restricting access to friends and/or family, insulting or threatening friends and/or family), controlling or domineering
* [[intimidation]]
* [[stalking]]

Flag abuse (or flag desecration) is a term applied to various acts that intentionally destroy, damage or mutilate a flag in public, most often a national flag. Often, such action is intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries. Countries may have laws protecting the right to burn a flag as free speech.

Group psychological abuse refers to groups where methods of [[psychological abuse]] are frequently or systematically used on their members. Such abuse would be practices that treat the members as objects one is free to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] instead of respecting their autonomy, human rights, identity and dignity. In a group they may also play [[mind games]] with another person that can make the victim seem like they are accepted, but in actuality are [[backstabbing]] the person when his/her back is turned. When the victim requests assistance from the abusing group it is not given.

{{See also|:Category:Substance abuse}}
'''Substance abuse''', also known as '''drug abuse''', is a patterned use of a drug in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others, and is a form of [[substance-related disorder]]. Widely differing definitions of drug abuse are used in public health, medical and criminal justice contexts. In some cases criminal or [[anti-social behavior]] occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well.&lt;ref name=Ksir&gt;{{cite book|last=Ksir|first=Oakley Ray; Charles|title=Drugs, society, and human behavior|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0072319631|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFBHAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=antisocial}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="mosby"&gt;(2002).

===Surveillance abuse===
{{Main|Surveillance abuse}}
Surveillance abuse is the use of [[surveillance]] methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the [[social norm]]s or laws of a society. [[Mass surveillance]] by the state may constitute surveillance abuse if not appropriately regulated. Surveillance abuse often falls outside the scope of [[lawful interception]]. It is illegal because it violates peoples' [[right to privacy]].

===Taunting===
{{Main|Taunting}}
A taunt is a [[battle cry]], a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or [[insult]] intended to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist as a form of social competition to gain control of the target's [[cultural capital]] (i.e. [[social status|status]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In [[sociological]] theory, the control of the three social capitals{{refn|Economic capital, cultural capital, and social capital, according to sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forms of Capital|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=11 March 2014|author =Pierre Bourdieu|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly [[bullying]], or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to [[fighting words]] and [[trash-talk]].

===Teasing===
{{Main|Teasing}}
Teasing is a word with many meanings. In human interactions, teasing comes in two major forms, ''playful'' and ''hurtful''. In mild cases, and especially when it is reciprocal, teasing can be viewed as playful and friendly.
However, teasing is often unwelcome and then it takes the form of [[harassment]]. In extreme cases, teasing may escalate to actual violence, and may even result in abuse. Children are commonly teased on such matters as their [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], weight, [[behaviour]], [[Skill|abilities]], and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0146167200264009 | last1 = Kowalski | first1 = R. | year = 2000 | title = I was only kidding:Victim and perpetrators' perceptions of teasing | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 231–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of teasing is often hurtful, even when the teaser believes he or she is being playful. One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognise this as play; but in humans, teasing can become hurtful and take the form of [[bullying]] and abuse.

Verbal abuse is a pattern of behaviour that can seriously interfere with one's positive emotional development and can lead to significant detriment to one's [[self-esteem]], emotional [[Quality of life|well-being]], and physical state. It has been further described as an ongoing emotional environment organised by the abuser for the purposes of control.

===Whispering campaign===

== Abusive power and control ==
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) is the way that abusers gain and maintain [[Power (social and political)|power]] and control over a victim for an [[abusive]] purpose such as [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[financial abuse|financial]] abuse. The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[envy]], or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism|economic abuse]] thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

In their review of data from the [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]] (a longitudinal birth cohort study; n = 941) Moffitt et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moffitt, T.E. |author2=Caspi, A. |author3=Rutter, M. |author4=Silva, P.A. |year=2001 |title=Sex differences in antisocial behavior: Conduct Disorder, Delinquency, and Violence in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression (in American society, females are, on average, excused when violent against males). Moffitt et al. also argue that [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2625">'''Amanieu II''' (after 1230 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1318) was the [[Archbishop of Auch]]. Elected in 1261, he received consecration at [[Rome]] from [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1263.

Amanieu was the third son of Roger, viscount of [[Fezensaguet]], and Pucelle d'Albret, and thus a descendant of the [[Count of Armagnac|Counts of Armagnac]] and the [[Albret|Sires of Albret]]. Amanieu's eldest brother was [[Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac|Geraud VI of Armagnac]]. In 1278 Geraud and Amanieu signed a treaty sharing jurisdiction in [[Barran]], where the bishop had his summer residence, between the Church and the County. The village was fortified as a [[bastide]] the next year (1279).

In 1268 Amanieu purchased the hospital of [[Pont d'Artigues]] from the [[Order of Santiago]] for the [[Order of the Faith and Peace]], a [[Military order (society)|military order]] founded by his predecessor to keep the peace in [[Gascony]]. He also appointed his nephew master of the order, but it did not stave off the order's decline, which had been apparent from the early 1260s. [[Pope Gregory X]] dissolved the order in 1273 and its possessions ended up largely in the hands of the Order of Santiago and the church of Auch, though [[Les Feuillants Abbey]] laid claim to some.

      <comment>/* Classification of stroke models according to different etiologies */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">'''Animal models of stroke''' are procedures undertaken in [[animal]]s (including non-human [[primate]]s) intending to provoke pathophysiological states that are similar to those of human [[stroke]] to study basic processes or potential therapeutic interventions in this disease. Aim is the extension of the knowledge on and/or the improvement of medical treatment of human stroke.

==Classification by cause==
The term [[stroke]] subsumes [[cerebrovascular disorder]]s of different [[etiology|etiologies]], featuring diverse pathophysiological processes. Thus, for each stroke etiology one or more [[animal model]]s have been developed:
*[[Animal models of ischemic stroke]]
*[[Animal models of intracerebral hemorrhage]]
*[[Animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm]]
*[[Animal models of sinus vein thrombosis]]

==Transferability of animal results to human stroke==
Although multiple therapies have proven to be effective in animals, only very few have done so in human patients. Reasons for this are (Dirnagl 1999):
*Side effects: Many highly potent neuroprotective drugs display side effects which inhibit the application of effective doses in patients (e.g. [[MK-801]])
*Delay: Whereas in animal studies the time of incidence onset is known and therapy can be started early, patients often present with delay and unclear time of symptom onset
*“Age and associated illnesses: Most experimental studies are conducted on healthy, young animals under rigorously controlled laboratory conditions. However, the typical stroke patient is elderly with numerous risk factors and complicating diseases (for example, diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases)” (Dirnagl 1999)
*Morphological and functional differences between the brain of humans and animals: Although the basic mechanisms of stroke are identical between humans and other [[mammal]]s, there are differences.
*Evaluation of efficacy: In animals, treatment effects are mostly measured as a reduction of lesion volume, whereas in human studies functional evaluation (which reflects the severity of disabilities) is commonly used. Thus, therapies might reduce the size of the cerebral lesion (found in animals), but not the functional impairment when tested in patients. 

==Ethical considerations==
Stroke models are carried out on animals which inevitably suffer during the procedure. These encumbrances are e.g. social stress during single or multiple animal caging (depending on the species), transport, animal handling, food deprivation, pain after surgical procedures, neurological disabilities etc. Thus, according to general consensus, these experiments require ethical justification. The following arguments can be produced to give reason for the conduction of animal experiments in stroke research:
*Stroke is very frequent in humans.
*Stroke is the third leading [[cause of death]] in the [[developed country|developed countries]].
*Stroke is the leading cause of permanent [[disability]] in the developed countries.
*Yet there is no effective treatment available for the majority of stroke patients.
*Currently there are no [[in vitro]] methods that could satisfactorily simulate the complex interplay of vasculature, brain tissue, and blood during stroke, and thus could replace the greater part of animal experiments.
&lt;br&gt;
During animal experimentation the following prerequisites have to be fulfilled to maintain the ethical justification (“the three Rs”):
*Reduction: Animal numbers have to be kept as little as possible (but as high as necessary - to avoid underpowered studies -) to draw scientific conclusions.
*Refinement: Experiments have to be best planned and to be conducted by trained personnel to minimize the suffering of animals on the one hand and to gain as much knowledge as possible out of the utilized animals.
*Replacement: Whenever possible animal experiments have to be replaced by other methods (e.g. cell culture, computed simulations etc.).

[[Image:The Bocksten Bog Man 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Bocksten Man]]
The '''Bocksten Man''' ({{lang-sv|Bockstensmannen}}) is the remains of a [[medieval]] man's body found in a [[bog]] in [[Varberg Municipality]], [[Sweden]]. It is one of the best-preserved finds in Europe from that era and is exhibited at the [[Varberg County Museum]]. The man had been killed and impaled to the bottom of a lake which later became a bog. The bog where the body was found lies in Rolfstorp about {{convert|24|km|mi}} east of Varberg on the west coast of Sweden, close to the most important medieval road in the area: the [[Via Regia]]. He was recently reconstructed to show what he may have looked like when he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindh|first=Nic|title=Murdered 600 years ago|url=http://thecoredump.org/2006/06/murdered-600-years-ago/|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The discovery==
In the 1880s a farm called "Bocksten" was established near a [[bog]]. The bog was then regularly drained, and a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]] used to gather [[peat]]. Albert Johansson had previously found a leather shoe in the wetland and gave it to the Varberg museum. A shoe sole was found in the bog in summer of 1934, but the curator of the local museum, Albert Sandklef, did not recognize its importance.

The body was found while gathering peat on 22{{nbsp}}June 1936 by Johansson. His harrow apparently caught on [[sackcloth]]. On examination Johansson saw parts of a skeleton. The next day, Johansson and his father contacted the local police and a doctor. On investigation, they realized it was too old to be of criminal interest.

Sandklef was contacted again. He took charge, inviting others — among them the well-known geologist [[Lennart von Post]]. The group visited on 24{{nbsp}}June. They measured and photographed the find before excavating it. The upper parts of the man had passed through the harrow and were badly damaged while the lower parts were intact.

The [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] was consulted after the midsummer weekend to assist with conservation. Curator Gillis Olson and their textile expert [[Agnes Geijer]] took part in the conservation and evaluation. They came to Varberg on 9{{nbsp}}July, assisting Sandkelf in the documentation and giving conservation advice.

The Bocksten Man has been part of the museum's exhibition since 1937.

==Description==
The man was {{convert|170|-|180|cm|in|0}} tall and of slender build. There is an injury covering about {{convert|8|x|5|cm|in|0}} on the right side of the cranium. Of the inner organs, parts of the lungs, liver and brain as well as cartilage are preserved.

The tunic is among the best-preserved medieval tunics in Europe, and made of [[wool]]len fabric. He was wearing a [[gugel]] hood with a {{convert|90|cm|in}} long and {{convert|2|cm|in}} wide [[liripipe]] ("tail"). On his upper body he wore a shirt and a cloak, while his legs were covered by hosiery.

Apart from the clothing he had a fabric bag, foot coverings, leather shoes, a belt, a leather [[Scabbard|sheath]] and two knives.

The leather sheath was {{convert|40|mm|in}} wide and {{convert|62|mm|in}} long, composed of three layers with a combined [[saltire]] and [[St George's Cross]] (thus giving a pattern similar to [[Union Jack]]) carved on the outer layer. On the inner layer a similar pattern was carved, though this time a pole was added to the symbol.

The man had been impaled to the lake bed with two poles; one of [[oak]] that hit his heart and one of [[beech]] which went through his back.

==Interpretations==
Several people have evaluated the finding, among them Albert Sandklef, Margareta Nockert and Owe Wennerholm.

===Date===
The find is generally dated to the 14th century. The dating is based on the clothing, especially the type of hood he wore. Albert Sandklef specified the date of the find to the 1360s, while Margareta Nockert suggests the 1330s. Owe Wennerholm argues that the hood he wore was used over a much larger time frame and only limits the date of the find to between 1250 and 1520. He does however put forward the [[hypothesis]] that the man might be Simon Gudmundi,&lt;!-- this name redirects here --&gt; a 15th-century priest, known to have died in 1491.

A bit of the cloth was [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] in the late 1980s. It gave as result a 68 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1410 and a 95 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1430. Some uncertainties do however arise as the conservation process might have affected the result. The fact that the find came from a bog is also of concern, as bog finds are known to be hard to date.

===Age===
Based on the teeth, [[forensic]] [[odontology|odontologist]] Gunnar Johansson has concluded that the man was between 25 and 35 years old when he died. [[Osteology|Osteologist]] Nils-Gustaf Gevall has, based on the skeleton, come up with an age of between 35 and 40 years, though the man might have been up to 60 years old.

===Social group===
Depending on the interpretation of the clothing, and in particular the hood, different conclusions can be made about the man's social background.

The hood he wore was usually worn by the more prosperous classes and it has therefore been suggested that he was a tax collector or a soldier recruiter.

The type of hood was also used within the church. Based on this and a symbol on a shield-shaped pendant, it has been suggested by Owe Wennerholm that the man belonged to the Ordo Sanctus Spiritus.

===Local legend===
Some days after the find was revealed a local farmer (''Karl Andersson'') told Albert Sandklef of a legend he had heard as a child. Two old people from Åkulla had told his father about a man who was recruiting soldiers in the area. He had been killed by the peasants and buried in a bog. He would start haunting late at night, and in order to stop this, poles were struck through his body, whereafter the haunting stopped. As far as the farmer could remember they mentioned ''Store Mosse'', a bog about 10 miles from the find, close to Nackhälle village, though he acknowledged that his memory might fail him as he had grown up in the vicinity of that bog.

The farmer and Albert Sandklef went to Nackhälle and questioned several older people in the area. However, nobody recognized the legend.

===Cause of death===
It has been a matter of some discussion what actually caused the death of the man. In January 2006 a professor and a doctor at [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital]] performed an "operation" on a plastic model of the body, based on [[computed tomography]] of the body. As a result, they concluded that he had first been hit at the lower jaw, then at the right ear and finally a lethal hit further towards the back of his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larsson|first=Micke|title=Bockstensmannen blev mördad|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/bockstensmannen-blev-mordad/|accessdate=1 April 2012|author2=Karin Olander|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
A hypothesis has been presented that the person was Simon Gudmundi, the [[Dean (religion)|dean]] of the [[Diocese of Linköping]] who died on 12 May 1491.
In his 1998 book, ''Vem var Bockstensmannen?'' (''Who was the Bocksten Man?''), Owe Wennerholm reasoned that Gudmundi's name fit with what might be initials found on what might be a micro shield. It is also likely that Gudmundi visited the area. He worked with a group which tried to get [[Catherine of Vadstena]] canonized. One of her reputed miracles had taken place in the neighboring village. Speculation was that he was killed by order of Hemming Gadh so that Gadh could assume the post of dean of the Diocese of Linköping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wem Var Bockstenmannen? |url=http://www.svtplay.se/klipp/100360/vem-var-bockstensmannen |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140325164837/http://www.svtplay.se/klipp/100360/vem-var-bockstensmannen |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
The bog in which the man was found is close to the border between [[Himle Hundred|Himle]] and [[Faurås]] [[Hundred (division)|hundred]]s. It is also close to the border between [[Rolfstorp]], [[Sibbarp]], [[Köinge, Falkenberg Municipality|Köinge]] and [[Svartrå]] parishes. The [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] were responsible for the handling of murders, which meant that in this case there might be some confusion over the correct hundred to handle the case, to the advantage of the killer(s). It has therefore been assumed that the killer(s) had good local knowledge.

[[Image:Boltysh crater location map.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of the Boltysh Crater]]

The '''Boltysh Crater''' (Bovtyshka Crater) is an [[impact crater]] in the [[Kirovohrad Oblast]] of [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Earth Impact DB | name = Boltysh | accessdate = 2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the village of Bovtyshka. The crater is {{convert|24|km|mi}} in [[diameter]] and its age of 65.17 ± 0.64 million years, based on [[Argon-argon dating|argon]] dating techniques, is within error of that of [[Chicxulub Crater]] in Mexico, and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–Pg boundary). The Chicxulub impact is believed to have caused the [[mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, which included the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s. The Boltysh impact likely occurred several thousand years before Chicxulub, suggesting the extinction event may have been driven by multiple meteor strikes over an extended period of time about 65 million years ago.&lt;ref name="doublestrike"&gt;{{cite web|title=Double meteorite strike 'caused dinosaur extinction|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11112417 |publisher= [[BBC News]]|date = 2010-08-27|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Boltysh Crater is located in central Ukraine, in the basin of the [[Tiasmyn River]], a tributary of the [[Dnieper River]].  It is {{convert|24|km|mi}} in diameter, and is surrounded by an ejecta blanket of [[breccia]] preserved over an area of {{convert|6500|km2|sqmi}}.  It is estimated that immediately after the impact, ejecta covered an area of {{convert|25,000|km2|sqmi}} to a depth of {{convert|1|m|ft}} or greater, and was some {{convert|600|m|ft}} deep at the crater rim.

The crater contains a central uplift about {{convert|6|km|mi}} in diameter, rising about {{convert|550|m|ft}} above the base level of the crater.  This uplift currently lies beneath about {{convert|500|m|ft}} of sediment deposited since the impact, and was discovered in the 1960s during [[oil shale]] deposits exploration.

==Age==
When first identified, the age of the crater could only be roughly constrained between the age of the impacted rocks (the target) and the age of overlying sediments.  The target rocks date from the [[Cenomanian]] (98.9 to 93.5 million years ago) and [[Turonian]] (93.5 to 89 million years ago) epochs. Bore samples of sediments overlying the crater contain fossils dating from the [[Paleocene]] epoch, 66 to 54.8 million years ago. The age of the crater was thus constrained to between 54 and 98 million years.

Subsequent [[radiometric dating]] reduced the uncertainty. The concentration of {{chem|U|238|link=uranium-238}} decay products in impact glasses from the crater were used to derive an age of 65.04 ± 1.10 million years. Analysis of [[argon]] radioactive decay products yielded an age of 65.17 ± 0.64 million years. These ages are similar to that of Chicxulub Crater. An August 2010 study of ancient [[fern]] spikes suggests the Boltysh impact likely occurred several thousand years before Chicxulub.&lt;ref name="doublestrike"/&gt;

==Likelihood of multiple impact==
Although the ages derived for Chicxulub and Boltysh are the same to within their [[Errors and residuals in statistics|statistical error]]s, it does not necessarily follow that they formed at exactly the same time.  At the estimated rate of impacts on the Earth, it would not be extremely unusual{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} for a Boltysh-sized crater to be formed within half a million years of Chicxulub. The dating of these impact craters is not yet accurate enough to establish whether the impactors arrived thousands of years apart, perhaps as part of a generally elevated rate of impacts at that time, or were almost simultaneous, like the impacts of the fragments of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] on [[Jupiter]] in 1994.

The discovery of the unconfirmed [[Silverpit crater]] and the early report of its age as 65–60 million years&lt;ref name="sa02"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Stewart SA| author2=Allen PJ|title=A 20 km-diameter multi-ringed impact structure in the North Sea|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=418 | issue=6897 | date=2002 | pages=520–3 | pmid=12152076|doi=10.1038/nature00914|bibcode=2002Natur.418..520S}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; initially gave greater weight to the hypothesis that the Earth was struck by multiple impactors at this time, however, the age estimate has now been broadened to 74–45 million years.&lt;ref name="sa05"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Stewart, S. A.| author2=Allen, P. J.| last-author-amp=yes | title=3D seismic reflection mapping of the Silverpit multi-ringed crater, North Sea | journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | date=2005 | volume=117 | issue=3 | pages=354–368|doi=10.1130/B25591.1|url=http://bulletin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/3-4/354 | bibcode=2005GSAB..117..354S}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial [[Shiva crater]] is claimed to have formed around the same time, but its status as an impact crater is disputed.

The availability of '''bomb-making instruction on the Internet''' has been a [[cause célèbre]] amongst lawmakers and politicians anxious to curb the [[Internet]] frontier by [[Internet censorship|censoring]] certain types of information deemed "dangerous" which is available online. "Simple" examples of explosives created from cheap, readily available ingredients are given.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John. "The Psychology of Terrorism", p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] reports that there were 1,699 criminal bombings in 1989 and 3,163 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=75LraX59rXcC&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=instructions+on+the+internet+Bomb-making&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=instructions%20on%20the%20internet%20Bomb-making&amp;f=false ''The psychology of terrorism'', John Horgan, Routledge, 2005] {{ISBN|0-7146-5262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral philosophy==
Supporters of [[digital rights]] argue that managers of Internet traffic do not have a right to [[deep packet inspection]], the automated system of analyzing what information is being transmitted, for example refusing to deliver a packet with the words "bomb instructions" and alerting authorities to the [[ISP]] that requested the information.&lt;ref&gt;Stair, Ralph M. et al. "Principles of Information Systems", p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that "we never seem to hear" about how the same instructions, including those for building nuclear devices,&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt; have been available in [[public library|public libraries]] for decades without calls for censorship.&lt;ref name="omgitswikiquotingwiki"&gt;[[Mike Godwin|Godwin, Mike]]. "Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age", p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, [[Johann Most]] compiled Austrian military documents into a booklet demonstrating the use of explosives and distributed it at anarchist picnics without repercussion.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;Anna Larabee, "Bombs: It's Not the How, but the Why," Star-Telegram, August 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Godwin]], then of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], claimed that journalists have played a key role in linking the creation of "bombs" with "the Internet" in the public conscious.&lt;ref name="omgitswikiquotingwiki"/&gt;

Critics of the prosecution of [[Sherman Austin]], an American anarchist charged with publishing instructions on the Internet, have pointed out that the [[Wikipedia]] article on [[Molotov cocktail]]s contains more detailed instructions on the construction of homemade explosives, than Austin's website did.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Caslon Analytics, [http://www.caslon.com.au/bombsnote1.htm Bomb info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015121015/http://www.caslon.com.au/bombsnote1.htm |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touretzky, David S. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/raisethefist/ What the FBI Doesn't Want You to See]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American websites offering bomb-making instructions would not face [[civil liability]], since ''[[Hess v. Indiana]]'' and ''[[Waller v. Osbourne]]'' determined that [[free speech]] restrictions can only be applied if the goal was "producing [[Imminent lawless action|imminent lawless conduct]]" among a single target group – which is not the case for a website available to a large swath of the population – making the situation comparable to music advocating violence or suicide in its lyrics.&lt;ref name="mtt"&gt;Weissblum, Lonn. [http://www.mttlr.org/volsix/Weissblum_art.html#VA Incitement to violence on the world wide web] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020742/http://www.mttlr.org/volsix/Weissblum_art.html#VA |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Internet}}
In 1986, prior to the widespread use of the Internet, police investigated the sharing of a computer print-out from a digital manual titled the "Complete Book of Explosives" written by a group calling itself "Phoenix Force", as students shared the list with classmates and experimented with building many of the bombs it listed.&lt;ref name="hern"&gt;Hegarty, Stephen. [[Hernando TImes]], "Bomb-making instructions circulate in Pasco school", November 13, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], anonymous [[usenet]] posts criticised the construction of the bomb, and offered suggestions on how to overcome the failure of the bomb to do its maximum intended damage.&lt;ref name="steger"/&gt; On March 23, 1996, the full text of the ''Terrorist Handbook'' was published online, including instructions on building the bomb used in the bombing, with the suggested upgrades.&lt;ref name="steger"&gt;Steger, Manfred B. "Violence and Its Alternatives", p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mohammed Usman Saddique]] was arrested in 2006, he was charged with "possessing a document or record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism" for having a copy of the manual on [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7080258/Terror-suspect-had-bomb-making-manuals-court-told.html Terror suspect had bomb-making manuals, court told], January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1994, a thread was made on the [[National Rifle Association]]'s [[bulletin board]] by a user named ''Warmaster'' that detailed how to make bombs out of [[baby food]] jars.&lt;ref name="steger"/&gt;

A 1996 copy of the left-wing online German magazine ''Radikal'' hosted on a Dutch server provided detailed instructions of how to sabotage railroad lines.&lt;ref name="COE"/&gt; In March of that year, a [[New South Wales]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] called for legislation regarding internet access for youth, following reports of a boy injuring himself while trying to follow a bomb recipe online.&lt;ref&gt;Everard, Jerry. "Virtual States: The Internet and the Boundaries of the Nation-State"&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1998, the common view of the instructions was that they were used by curious youth anxious to build explosives simply as a dangerous experiment "with no intention of hurting anybody".&lt;ref&gt;Tri City Herald, "Bomb making instructions on internet", October 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the availability of this information on the internet started as a result of the [[Columbine High School Shooting]].

The '''Bradburn Affect Balance Scale''' is a [[self-report]] measure of [[quality of life]]. The scale consists of ten mood states (for example, item one is "particularly excited  or  interested  in something"), and the subject must report if they have been in that state in the last week.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schuur, Wijbrandt H., and Martine Kruijtbosch. "Measuring subjective well-being: Unfolding the Bradburn affect balance scale." Social Indicators Research 36.1 (1995): 49-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale was included in the 1978-1979 [[Canada Health Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;McDOWELL, I. A. N., and E. D. Praught. "ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HAPPINESS AN EXAMINATION OF THE BRADBURN SCALE IN THE CANADA HEALTH SURVEY." American journal of epidemiology 116.6 (1982): 949-958.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Branko Miljković''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Бранко Миљковић; 29 January 1934 – 12 February 1961) was an iconic [[Serbia]]n [[poet]].&lt;ref name="Kako je stradao Branko Miljković"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/166819/Kako-je-stradao-Branko-Miljkovic |author=''[[Politika]]'' |title=Kako je stradao Branko Miljković |accessdate=2017-07-24 |date=2011-10-02 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was best known throughout [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Soviet Union]] and other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] for his influential writings. At a time when no one could have foreseen anything but a bright future for the poet, he died prematurely in 1961 at the age of 27. He was found hanging from a tree in [[Zagreb]], today's [[Croatia]]. This controversial incident was officially recorded as a suicide.&lt;ref name="Izložba o Branku Miljkoviću"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/193201/Izlozba-o-Branku-Miljkovicu |author=''[[Politika]]'' |title=Izložba o Branku Miljkoviću |accessdate=2017-07-24 |date=2011-03-10 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his one-line poem "Epitaph," he writes ''"Ubi me prejaka reč"'' ("I was killed by a word too strong") almost sensing his premature end of life. During the last years of his life, he published five books of poetry (''I Wake Her in Vain'', ''Death against Death'', ''The Origin of Hope'', ''Fire and Nothing'', ''The Shining Blood'', criticism, and translations of the French Symbolists and Russian poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. He continues to influence poets to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22146">'''Caregiver burden''' is the stress which is perceived by [[caregiver]]s due to the [[home care]] situation. This subjective burden is one of the most important predictors for negative outcomes of the care situation – for the caregivers themselves as well as for the one who requires care.

Caregivers are all persons who support and help a person in need of care regularly because of personal – not professional – reasons. That means every kind of help and support. It doesn’t need to be [[health care]] in the narrow sense. The caregiver doesn’t need to be akin with the person they support. Often friends, neighbors or acquaintances provide support, too.

== Theory ==
From a scientific perspective, caregiver burden is a theoretical [[construct (philosophy)|construct]]. The conceptual basis for the appraisal of the care situation is the [[stress management#Transactional model|Transactional Model]] of Lazarus and Folkman.&lt;ref name="lazarus1984"&gt;R. S. Lazarus, S. Folkman: ''Stress, appraisal, and coping''. Springer, New York 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
The subjective evaluation of the care situation (stressor) by the caregivers is critical for the development and maintenance of subjective burden.

According to the Transactional Model, people deal with stressful situations by appraisals of stressor and resources. The primary appraisal deals with the individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual [[coping (psychology)|coping]] efforts are used to deal with the stressful situation. As per Carver,&lt;ref name="carver1997"&gt;C. S. Carver: ''You want to measure coping but your protocol's too long: Consider the brief COPE.'' In: ''International Journal of Behavioral Medicine.'' 1997, 4(1), pp. 92–100.&lt;/ref&gt; these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies&lt;ref name="cooper2008"&gt;C. Cooper, C. Katona, M. Orrell, G. Livingston: ''Coping strategies, anxiety and depression in caregivers of people with alzheimer's disease.'' In: ''International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.'' 2008, 23(9), pp. 929–936. {{doi|10.1002/gps.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dimattei2008"&gt;V. E. Di Mattei, A. Prunas, L. Novella, A. Marcone, S. F. Cappa, L. Sarno: ''The burden of distress in caregivers of elderly demented patients and its relationship with coping strategies.'' In: ''Neurological Sciences.'' 2008, 29(6), pp. 383–389. {{doi|10.1007/s10072-008-1047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don’t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).

The (dis)balance between burden/[[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] and resources of the caregiver determines the consequences of a care situation.&lt;ref name="graessel2011"&gt;E. Gräßel, R. Adabbo: ''Perceived burden of informal caregivers of a chronically ill older family member: Burden in the context of the transactional stress model of Lazarus and Folkman.'' In: ''Journal of Gerontopsychology and Geriatric Psychiatry.'' 2011, 24(3), pp. 143–154. {{doi|10.1024/1662-9647/a000042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home care can result in positive as well as negative experiences.

Regardless of the caregiver burden, relatives can experience benefits - positive consequences - of the home care situation.&lt;ref name="liew2010"&gt;T. M. Liew, N. Luo, W. Y. Ng, H. L. Chionh, J. Goh (2010): ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150732 Predicting gains in dementia caregiving.]'' In: ''Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 29''(2), pp. 115-122. {{doi|10.1159/000275569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the feeling of being needed or the knowledge that they have acquired new skills etc.&lt;ref name="baronet2003"&gt;A. M. Baronet (2003): ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00137.x/abstract The impact of family relations on caregivers' positive and negative appraisal of their caregiving activities.]'' In: ''Family Relations, 52''(2), pp. 137-142. {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triggers for caregiver burden ==
Caregiver burden comes out when the caregiver perceives the home care situation as a negative experience. Caregivers are typically not trained. Caring is a serious challenge for them. An intensive adaptiation to the care situation is necessary.&lt;ref name="graessel2011" /&gt;

The caregiver burden can be based on a variety of aspects of the care situation (e.g. lack of recovery time, challenging behavior of the care requiring person, limitation of social activities and contacts). Studies&lt;ref name="graessel1997"&gt;E. Gräßel: ''Belastung und gesundheitliche Situation der Pflegenden. Querschnittuntersuchung zur häuslichen Pflege bei chronischem Hilfs- oder Pflegebedarf im Alter.'' Hänsel-Hohenhausen, Egelsbach/ Frankfurt am Main/ Washington 1997. ''German Study: Burden and health situation of caregivers. A cross-sectional examination about the home care of chronically care requiring elderlies.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="graessel2009"&gt;E. Gräßel: ''Subjektive Belastung und deren Auswirkungen bei betreuenden Angehörigen eines Demenzkranken - Notwendigkeit der Entlastung.'' In: G. Stoppe, G. Stiens (Eds.): ''Niedrigschwellige Betreuung von Demenzkranken. Grundlagen und Unterrichtsmaterialien.'' 2009, pp. 42–47. ''German book section: Subjective burden and its effects in caring relatives of dementia patients - Need for relief. In: Low-threshold care of people with dementia. Basics and teaching materials.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grossfeld2010"&gt;M. Grossfeld-Schmitz, C. Donath, R. Holle, J. Lauterberg, S. Ruckdaeschel, H. Mehlig, P. Marx, S. Wunder, E. Gräßel: [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/10/24 ''Counsellors contact dementia caregivers - predictors of utilisation in a longitudinal study.''] In: ''BMC Geriatrics.'' 2010, 10:24. {{doi|10.1186/1471-2318-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that four aspects are particularly burdensome:
* Care costs much energy
* Desire for recovery
* Too little time for own interests
* Sadness over the fate of the supported person

== Meaning of subjective burden ==
Negative outcomes are often not determined by the care situation per se but by the caregiver burden. So the subjective burden is one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes of the home care situation.&lt;ref name="graessel2011" /&gt; All types of caregiver inventions should have a positive impact on that burden.&lt;ref name="sorensen2002"&gt;S. Sörensen, M. Pinquart, P. Duberstein: [http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/3/356.long ''How effective are interventions with caregivers? An updated meta-analysis.''] In: ''The Gerontologist.'' 2002, 43(3), pp. 356–372. {{doi|10.1093/geront/42.3.356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on health ===
Pinquart and Sörensen (2003)&lt;ref name="pinquart2003"&gt;M. Pinquart, S. Sörensen: [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/18/2/250 ''Differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in psychological health and physical health: A meta-analysis.''] In: ''Psychology and Aging.'' 2003, 18(2), pp. 250–267. {{doi|10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; researched the health of caregivers compared to not caregiving relatives. Referring to the physical health status, the caregivers were only little impaired. But referring to the psychological health status, there was a clear difference: Caregivers reported significantly more often depressive symptoms than not caregiving relatives. Unfortunately, this meta-analysis did not consider the impact of subjective burden.

In another extensive meta-analysis&lt;ref name="pinquart2007"&gt;M. Pinquart, S. Sörensen: [http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/2/P126.long ''Correlates of physical health of informal caregivers: A meta-analysis.''] In: ''Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences.'' 2007, 62B(2), pp. 126–137.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinquart and Sörensen could show that the subjective burden is an important predictor of the health of carers.

=== Risk of mortality ===
Studies&lt;ref name="schulz1999"&gt;Schulz, R., Beach, S. R. (1999). [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=282&amp;page=2215 ''Caregiving as a risk factor for mortality: The caregiver health effects study.''] In: ''The Journal of the American Medical Association.'' 1999, 282(23), pp. 2215–2219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perkins2013"&gt;M. Perkins, V. J. Howard, V. G. Wadley, M. Crowe, M. M. Safford, W. E. Haley, G. Howard, D. L. Roth (2013).

This effect was only found for spouses who felt burdened due to the care situation. Thus, not the home care per se is a risk but the subjective burden.

Without consideration of the caregiver burden, the mortality of caregivers is even slightly reduced compared to non-caregivers.&lt;ref name="oreilly2008"&gt;D. O'Reilly, S. Connolly, M. Rosato, C.

(2015). {{doi|10.1093/geront/gnu177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caring style ===
The behavior towards the person in need of care can range from loving devotion to abusive behavior which can manifest in neglecting to mistreatment. The most common form of abusive behavior is verbal aggression,&lt;ref name="cooney2008"&gt;C. Cooney, R. Howard, B. Lawlor (2008). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.1525/abstract ''Abuse of vulnerable people with dementia by their carers: Can we identify those most at risk?''] In: ''International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 21''(6), pp. 564-571. {{doi|10.1002/gps.1525}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to [[challenging behaviour]] of the person in need for care.&lt;ref name="hansberry2005"&gt;M.

''German Study: Subjective evaluation and perception of caregivers and cared persons in the spouse care setting.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ending home care ===
The subjective burden is an important factor that influences the passing into the nursing home (institutionalization). Particularly the care of people with dementia is associated with challenging behavior and caregiver burden. Both increases the likelihood of institutionalization.&lt;ref name="kurasawa2012"&gt;S. Kurasawa, K. Yoshimasu, M. Washio, J. Fukumoto, S. Takemura, K. Yokoi, Y. Arai, K. Miyashita (2012): [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493627/ ''Factors influencing caregivers’ burden among family caregivers and institutionalization of in-home elderly people cared for by family caregivers.''] In: ''Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine. 17''(6), pp. 474-483. {{doi|10.1007/s12199-012-0276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the care of people with dementia, there is consistent [[empirical evidence|evidence]]: The higher the caregiver burden, the more likely is the institutionalization.&lt;ref name="eska2013"&gt;K. Eska, E. Gräßel, C. Donath, L. Schwarzkopf, J. Lauterberg, R. Holle: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3843910 ''Predictors of institutionalization of dementia patients in mild and moderate stages: A 4-year prospective analysis.''] In: ''Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders Extra.'' 2013, 3(1), pp. 426–445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hirono2002"&gt;N.

== Measuring caregiver burden ==
The assessment of caregiver burden enables to judge the situation of the caregiver. The correct measurement of subjective burden is necessary to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of family interventions.

The care situation is an important, highly specific [[stressor]] which should be treated with specific interventions. A measurement with general stress-scales is therefore not useful, because in this case the score represents all kind of stress, indiscriminately of its origin. Valid, economic and internationally standardized measurement tools for the specific stressful situation of family caregivers are therefore inevitable.

In Anglo-American countries, a number of burden scales have been developed; e.g. the Burden Interview,&lt;ref name="zarit1980"&gt;S. H. Zarit, K. E. Reever, J. Bach-Peterson: [http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/6/649.long ''Relatives of the impaired elderly: Correlates of feelings of burden.''] In: ''The Gerontologist.'' 1980, 20(6), pp. 649–655.&lt;/ref&gt; the Caregiver Strain Index&lt;ref name="robinson1983"&gt;B. C. Robinson: [http://geronj.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/3/344.long ''Validation of a caregiver strain index.''] In: ''Journal of Gerontology.'' 1983, 38(3), pp. 344–348.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cost of Care Index.&lt;ref name="kosberg1990"&gt;J. I. Kosberg, R. E. Cairl, D. M. Keller: [http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/2/236.long ''Components of burden: Interventive implications.''] In: ''The Gerontologist.'' 1990, 30(2), pp. 236–242.&lt;/ref&gt; The Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, which has been developed in Germany, is now available in 20 languages.

=== Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC) ===
The BSFC exists in a detailed version with 28 items, and in a short, more efficient version (BFSC-s) with ten items.

Compared to other burden scales, the BSFC has two benefits. There is a long and a short version, both validated in separate studies. Furthermore, both versions are free in 20 languages inclusive introduction for evaluation and interpretation.

==== Development ====
A first, reliable and valid version of the German version was published in 1993.&lt;ref name="graessel1993"&gt;E. Gräßel, M. Leutbecher: ''Häusliche Pflege-Skala HPS zur Erfassung der Belastung bei betreuenden oder pflegenden Personen.'' Vless, Ebersberg 1993. ''German publication: Burden Scale for Family Caregivers to measure the burden of caregivers.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the validity was tested and confirmed to a large sample of both dementia and for other causes of care requirement again.&lt;ref name="graessel2001"&gt;E. Gräßel: ''Häusliche Pflege-Skala HPS zur Erfassung der Belastung bei betreuenden oder pflegenden Personen.'' 2nd, revised edition. Vless, Ebersberg 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the English version has been validated.&lt;ref name="graessel2003"&gt;E. Gräßel, T. Chiu, R. Oliver: ''Development and validation of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers.'' Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Mental Health Services, Toronto (Canada) 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the validation study for the short version&lt;ref name="graessel2014"&gt;E. Gräßel, H. Berth, T. Lichte, H. Grau: [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/14/23 ''Subjective caregiver burden: Validity of the 10-item short version of the burden scale for family caregivers BSFC-s.''] In: ''BMC Geriatrics.'' 2014, 14, S. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and an extended validation of the original version&lt;ref name="grau2014"&gt;H. Grau, E. Gräßel, H. Berth: ''The subjective burden of informal caregivers of persons with dementia: extended validation of the German language version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC).'' In: ''Aging &amp; Mental Health.'' 2014, pp. 1–10, {{DOI|10.1080/13607863.2014.920296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have been published.

==== Scale ====
The BSFC consists of 28 items in the detailed or 10 items in the short version. The caregivers have to rate these items on a four-point scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”.

An evaluation is possible both on item level and on score level. A differentiated detection of the critical aspects of home care is possible with the analysis on item level. The score measures the total burden. This is an important factor to judge the caregiver's situation.

== Interventions ==
Due to the high importance of the caregiver burden with regard to the care giving process, it is necessary to develop interventions to reduce this burden and to examine their effectiveness. Successful interventions should be available to as many caregivers as possible. "The usefulness of an intervention is the multiplication of effectiveness and usage.” (Elmar Gräßel&lt;ref name="graessel2011" /&gt;) It is therefore both necessary to develop interventions and to improve and to find ways to strengthen the awareness and use of these interventions.

===Interventions and services===
Unburdening interventions for caregivers should consider four central aspects:&lt;ref name="silva2013"&gt;A. L. Silva, H. J. Teixeira, M. J. Teixeira, S. Freitas (2013). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23289859 ''The needs of informal caregivers of elderly people living at home: An integrative review.''] In: ''Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences. 27''(4), pp. 792-803. {{doi|10.1111/scs.12019}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Information and training
# Professional support
# Effective communication
# Public and financial support
There are different supporting services, e.g. caregiver counselling, professional training, self-help groups, ambulant nursing services or technical help like intelligent light to preserve the autonomy of the person in need of care.&lt;ref name="mollenkopf2007"&gt;H. Mollenkopf (2007): ''Technik hilft pflegen - Möglichkeiten technischer Unterstützung.'' In: ''Demenz'', 4/2007, pp. 7-11. ''German publication: Technology helps to care - possible technical assistance.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effective relief is the support given to caregivers by family members, friends and acquaintances. They provide emotional and instrumental support and are an important source to access supporting services.&lt;ref name="lamura2006"&gt;G. Lamura, E. Mnich, B. Wojszel, M. Nolan, B. Krevers, L. Mestheneos, H. Döhner (2006). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00391-006-0416-0 ''Erfahrungen von pflegenden Angehörigen älterer Menschen in Europa bei der Inanspruchnahme von Unterstützungsleistungen: Ausgewählte Ergebnisse des Projektes EUROFAMCARE.''] In: ''Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Geriatrie. 39''(6), pp. 429-442. {{doi|10.1007/s00391-006-0416-0}}. ''German publication: The experience of family carers of older people in the use of support services in Europe: selected findings from the EUROFAMCARE project.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications to strengthen and develop the informal caregiving===
# Services should be made better known.
# The regional availability of support services should be made increased.
# Case management services should increase the effectivity of unburdening concepts.
# Public financial support should be made more available.
# The basic conditions of caregiving should allow the combination of care and occupation.
# Job conditions should be developed. No disadvantages should arise for caregivers who restrict the scope of their employment or temporarily give it up completely.
# Language barriers should be reduced. Low-threshold offers in information, counselling and support should be intercultural orientated.
# Internet based support should be extended.
# There is a lack of qualitative empirical studies on the impact of unburdening interventions. Evidence based health services research should focus on that point.&lt;ref name="pflegebericht2015"&gt;E. Gräßel, E.-M. Behrndt: ''Belastungen und Entlastungsangebote für pflegende Angehörige.''

[[File:Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen 1869 by Peter Most.jpg|thumb|185px|Carl Rasmussen (1869)]]
'''Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen''' (31 August 1841, [[Ærøskøbing]] – 1 October 1893, at sea, between [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]) was a Danish painter, known for his [[marine art|maritime scenes]] and views of Greenland. 

== Biography ==
He was the eldest of eleven children born to a master tailor who later became City Treasurer.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Carl_Rasmussen Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; At fifteen, he went to Copenhagen to learn the [[hosiery]] trade and completed his training in 1861. While there, however, he was attracted to the art works he saw and took drawing lessons with the architects [[Hans J. Holm]] and {{ill|C.V. Nielsen|da}}. Later, he took lessons with the animal painter [[Didrik Frisch]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=443 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Rasmussen-Yacht.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Shipwrecked Yacht]]
In need of some immediate income, he took passage as a [[cabin boy]] on a relative's merchant ship and visited Scotland; painting several works along the way. Upon returning, he enrolled in courses at the [[Copenhagen Technical College]] to improve his understanding of [[Perspective (art)|perspective]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

At that time, he was able to obtain a scholarship to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], where he studied until 1866 with the landscape painter, [[Carl Frederik Aagaard|C.F. Aagaard]]. His first showing was at the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1863. He would exhibit there regularly until his death.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

Inspired by his sailing experience, he visited Greenland in 1870-71, making sketches that later became paintings, one of which was purchased for the [[National Gallery of Denmark|Royal Collection]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; By 1880, he had become successful enough to get married, buy a home and establish a studio in [[Marstal]] on [[Ærø]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; His first work there was a large mural at Marstal Church, depicting Jesus calming the waters, which featured portraits of prominent local citizens. 

In 1893, he was returning from Greenland on the [[brig]] ''Peru'' when he apparently fell overboard and drowned. He was last seen by the [[helmsman]], standing aft with his easel. When he was reported missing, an extensive search of the area was conducted, but they were unable to find him.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

His life became the subject of a novel: ''Sidste rejse'' (''Last Journey'', 2007) by [[Carsten Jensen]]. The largest collection of his works is at the Marstal Maritime Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">'''Dan Deșliu''' (August 31, 1927 &amp;ndash; September 4, 1992) was a [[Romania]]n poet.

Born in [[Bucharest]], his parents were Ștefan Deșliu, an accountant at the Bulandra theatre company and later administrator of the Workers' Theatre, and his wife Elena (''née'' Săndulescu). He began secondary school at [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab Lyceum]] in his native city, followed by the [[Mediaș]] aeronautics school and the Bucharest industrial and building high school. He then attended the [[Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography|Dramatic Arts Conservatory]] under [[Maria Filotti]]. From 1946 to 1948, he appeared as an actor at [[Petroșani]] and Bucharest, also working as an editor for ''[[Flacăra]]'' magazine. He was later an editor at ''[[Scînteia]]'' and, between 1961 and 1962, was editor-in-chief at [[Luceafărul (magazine)|''Luceafărul'']]. His first published work was the sonnet "Paseri", which appeared in [[George Călinescu]]'s ''Lumea'' in 1945; his first book was the 1949 ''Goarnele inimii''. He won the State Prize in 1949, 1950 and 1951, and in 1974 was awarded the [[Romanian Writers' Union]] Prize for his book ''Cetatea de pe aer''. In 1978, he took the same prize for ''Un haiduc pe bicicletă''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Together with [[Eugen Frunză]], he composed the lyrics for "[[Te slăvim, Românie]]", which served as Romania's national anthem from 1953 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/Triumful+unei+natiuni/POVESTEA+IMNULUI+Romania+a+avut+sase+imnuri+de+stat "România a avut șase imnuri de stat"], Digi 24, December 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and '50s, he quickly came to the literary forefront as a representative poet of his era, much lauded for his militant [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realist]] poetry that enthusiastically chronicled the events of the day. This was embodied by his first book as well as the ones that followed across the next decade: ''Lazăr de la Rusca'' (1949), ''Minerii din Maramureș'' (1951), ''Cântec de ruină'' (1957) and ''Ceva mai greu'' (1958). Afterwards, he attempted a shift toward a skeptically elegiac, obsessive lyricism that dealt with regret and lack of fulfillment (''Cercuri de copac'', 1962; ''Drumul spre Dikson'', 1969; ''Cetatea de pe aer'', 1974).&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">'''Denial of pregnancy''' (also called '''pregnancy denial''') is a rare form of [[denial]] exhibited by women to either the fact or the implications of their own [[pregnancy]]. One study found that women who denied their pregnancy represented 0.26% of all deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Susan Hatters |last2=Heneghan |first2=Amy |last3=Rosenthal |first3=Miriam |title=Characteristics of Women Who Deny or Conceal Pregnancy |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |year=2007 |pmid=17329604 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.48.2.117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A later study cited that at 20 weeks gestation approximately 1 in 475 pregnant women denied their pregnancy, and said the proportion of cases persisting even until delivery is about 1 in 2500 refusing to acknowledge that they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="pmid21725094"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jenkins A, Millar S, Robins J | title = Denial of pregnancy: a literature review and discussion of ethical and legal issues | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 104 | issue = 7 | pages = 286–91 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21725094 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.100376 | pmc=3128877}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Psychotic denial==
This is a form of denial that is so extreme as to fall under the category of [[delusion]]. While physical symptoms of pregnancy do usually occur, they are sometimes misinterpreted by the woman. Some women interpret the sensation of something growing inside them as cancer, or a blood clot. Some women might believe fetal movements are their organs coming loose inside her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Laura J. |chapter=Denial of Pregnancy |pages=81–104 |chapterurl={{Google books|i4XqOuxjzvIC|page=81|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-last=Spinelli |editor1-first=Margaret G. |year=2008 |title=Infanticide: Psychosocial and Legal Perspectives on Mothers Who Kill |publisher=American Psychiatric |isbn=978-1-58562-754-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the psychotic denial pregnancy, women tend to hide their pregnancy from everyone and put their fetus at a high risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Laura J. |title=Psychotic Denial of Pregnancy: Phenomenology and Clinical Management |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1233–7 |year=1990 |pmid=2249803 |doi=10.1176/ps.41.11.1233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Druidry''', sometimes termed '''Druidism''', is a modern [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] movement that generally promotes harmony, connection, and reverence for the natural world. This commonly is extended to include respect for all beings, including the environment itself. Many forms of modern Druidry are [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religions, although most of the earliest modern Druids identified as [[Christianity|Christians]]. Originating in Britain during the 18th century, Druidry was originally a cultural movement, only gaining religious or spiritual connotations in the 19th century.

The core principle of Druidry is respect and veneration of nature, and as such it often involves participation in the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]]. Another prominent belief among modern Druids is the veneration of ancestors, particularly those who belonged to prehistoric societies.

Arising from the 18th century [[Romanticism|Romanticist movement]] in Britain, which glorified the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], the early neo-Druids aimed to imitate the Iron Age priests who were also known as [[druid]]s. At the time, little accurate information was known about these ancient priests, and the modern Druidic movement has no direct connection to them, despite contrary claims made by some modern Druids.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |quote=Modern Druids have no direct connection to the Druids of the Iron Age. Many of our popular ideas about the Druids are based on the misunderstandings and misconceptions of scholars 200 years ago. These ideas have been superseded by later study and discoveries. |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/article_index/d/the_druids.aspx |publisher=The British Museum |title=The Druids |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, modern Druids developed fraternal organizations modeled on [[Freemasonry]] that employed the romantic figure of the British Druids and [[Bard|Bards]] as symbols of indigenous British spirituality. Some of these groups were purely fraternal and cultural, creating traditions from the national imagination of Britain. Others, in the early 20th century, merged with contemporary movements such as the [[physical culture]] movement and [[naturism]]. Since the 1980s, some modern druid groups have adopted similar methodologies to those of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]] in an effort to create a more historically accurate practice. However, there is still controversy over how much resemblance modern Druidism may or may not have to the Iron Age druids.

==Definition==

[[File:An Arch Druid in His Judicial Habit.jpg|thumb|Modern Druidry takes its name from the Iron Age druids referred to in various Greco-Roman sources, as depicted here in a nineteenth-century illustration.]]

Modern Druidry derives its name from the magico-religious specialists of Iron Age Western Europe who were known as [[druids]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=351}} There is no real historical continuity between the druids of Iron Age Europe and the modern Druids.{{sfnm|1a1=Butler|1y=2005|1p=94|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=351}} However, some Druids nevertheless regard modern Druidry as a genuine continuation of the practices of the Iron Age druids.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=88}} The concerns of modern Druidry—which include healing the planet and seeking connections with the natural world—are likely very different from those of the Iron Age societies in which the original druids lived.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=96}}

Everything presently known about the Iron Age druids derives from archaeological evidence and Greco-Roman textual sources, rather than material produced by these druids themselves.{{sfn|Cooper|2009b|pp=41–42}} Due to the scarcity of knowledge about the Iron Age druids, their belief system cannot be accurately reconstructed.{{sfn|Butler|2005|pp=94–95}} Some Druids incorporate everything that is known about Iron Age druids into their practices.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=97}} However, as noted by scholar of religion Jenny Butler, the historical realities of Iron Age religion are often overlooked by Druids in favour of "a highly romanticised version".{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=96}}
Many Druids believe that the practices of the Iron Age druids should be revived yet modified to meet current needs.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=91}}
In Ireland, some Druids have claimed that because the island was never conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], here the Iron Age druids survived and their teachings were passed down hereditarily until modern times, at which modern Druids can reclaim them.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=92}} Some Druids claim that they can [[Mediumship#Channeling|channel]] information about the Iron Age druids.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=93}}

Druidry has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=59}} a [[new religious movement]],{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=60}} a "spiritual movement",{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=55}} and as a [[nature religion]].{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=55}} It has been described as a form of contemporary Paganism,{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=59}} and on the contemporary Pagan spectrum between reconstructionism and eclecticism, Druidry sits on the latter end.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=348}} Various Druidic groups also display [[New Age]] and [[Neo-shamanism|neo-shamanic]] influences.{{sfn|Anczyk|2015|p=20}}
The Druidic community has been characterised as a [[Neotribalism|neo-tribe]], for it is disembedded and its membership is elective.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=25}}
Druidry has been described as a form of [[Celtic spirituality]],{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=78}} or "Celtic-Based Spirituality".{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=87}} Scholar of religion Marion Bowman described Druidry as the "Celtic spirituality ''par excellence''.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=78}} Some practitioners regard Druidry as a form of "native spirituality",{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=83}} and it displays an affinity with [[folk religion]]s.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=59}}
In defining Druidry as a "native spirituality", some Druids seek to draw elements from other [[native religions]], such as the belief systems of Australian Aboriginal and Native American communities.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=83}} Practitioners differ in the levels of formality and seriousness that they bring to their adherence.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=82}} Some groups use the word ''Druid'' for both male and female practitioners, eschewing the term ''Druidess'' for female followers.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=103}}

[[File:Druid Order Spring Equinox Ceremony Tower Hill 2010.JPG|thumb|left|The Druid Order Ceremony at Tower Hill, London on the Spring Equinox of 2010]]

Following terms devised by the Druid [[Philip Carr-Gomm]], a distinction has been drawn between "cultural" Druids, who adopt the term as part of their Welsh and Cornish cultural activities, and "esoteric" Druids who pursue the movement as a religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Hale|1y=2000|1p=189|2a1=Bowman|2y=2002|2p=79}} The scholar of religion Marion Bowman suggested "believing" as an alternative term to "esoteric".{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=79}} There are also individuals who cross these two categories, involving themselves in cultural Druidic events while also holding to modern Pagan beliefs.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=79}} Some cultural Druids nevertheless go to efforts to disassociate themselves from their esoteric and Pagan counterpart; the [[Cornish Gorseth]] for example has publicly disassociated any links to Paganism.{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=189}}
Some Druids identify as Pagan, others as Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Bowman|1y=2002|1p=82|2a1=Butler|2y=2005|2p=88}} Some practitioners merge Pagan and Christian elements in their own personal practice,{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=88}} in at least one case identifying as a "Christodruid".{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=63}} Other practitioners adopt additional elements; for instance there are self-described "[[Zen Buddhism|Zen]] Druids" and "[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Druids".{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=82}} The Berengia Order of Druids drew upon elements from [[science fiction]] television shows like ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Babylon 5]]''.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=82}}

The earliest modern Druids aligned themselves with Christianity.{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=188}}
In the early eighteenth-century, early Druidic writers like [[William Stukeley]] regarded the Iron Age druids as proto-Christians who were monotheists worshipping the Christian God.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=85}} In a similar vein, some modern Druids believe that ancient druidic wisdom was preserved through a distinct [[Celtic Christianity]].{{sfn|Bowman|2002|pp=85–86}} Over the course of the twentieth century, and particularly since the early 1960s, Druidry increasingly came to be associated with the modern Pagan movement.{{sfn|Hale|2000|pp=188–189}}

==Beliefs==
[[File:Tribann.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Awen]] symbol of [[Iolo Morganwg]].]]
Druidic beliefs vary widely, and there is no set dogma or belief system followed by all adherents.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=30}}

Druidry also draws upon the legends surrounding [[King Arthur]].{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=193}} One of the clearest links between Arthuriana and Druidry is through the [[Loyal Arthurian Warband]], a Druidic group that employs Arthurian symbolism as part of its environmental campaigns.{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=193}}

===Nature-centered spirituality===

Druidry has been described as a nature venerating movement.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=60}}
Druidry conceives of the natural world as being imbued with spirit, and thus regard it as alive and dynamic.{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=63}}
Because they view the natural world as sacred, many Druids are involved in [[environmentalism]], thereby acting to protect areas of the natural landscape that are under threat from development or pollution.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=31–32}}

Druids are generally critical of mainstream society, regarding it as being "governed by consumerism, environmental exploitation and the supremacy of technology."{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=62}} In contrast to this, Druids seek to establish a way of living that they regard as being more "natural".{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=62}} Through seeking a connection with nature, Druids pursue a sense of "cosmic belonging".{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=68}}

===Theology===

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Grant O Goddess, thy protection&lt;br/&gt;and in protection, strength&lt;br/&gt;and in strength, understanding&lt;br/&gt;and in understanding, knowledge&lt;br/&gt;and in knowledge, the knowledge of justice&lt;br/&gt;and in the knowledge of justice, the love of it&lt;br/&gt;and in the love of it, the love of all existences&lt;br/&gt;and in the love of all existences, the love of Goddess and all Goodness"|source="The Druid's Prayer", after Iolo Morganwg.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=30}} }}

By the end of the 19th century, Druidry was described as a "monotheistic philosophical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har07|Harvey 2007]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Druidry is now often described as [[polytheism|polytheistic]],{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=60}} although there is no set pantheon of deities to which all Druids adhere.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=68}} Emphasis is however placed on the idea that these deities predate Christianity.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=70}} These deities are usually regarded as being immanent rather than transcendent.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=69}} Some practitioners express the view that the real existence of these deities is less important to them than the impact that said belief has on their lives.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=69}}

With the increase in polytheistic Druidry, and the widespread acceptance of Goddess worship, "The Druid's Prayer", which had been originally written in the 18th century by Druid [[Iolo Morganwg]] and emphasises the unity of the supreme Deity, had the word "God" replaced with "Goddess" in common usage.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=30}}

Some Druids regard it as possible to communicate with various spirits during ritual.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=105}} Certain Druids in Ireland have for instance adopted belief in the [[Aos Sí|Sí]], spirits from Irish folklore, into their Druidic system, interpreting them as [[elementals]].{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=104}} They have adopted the folkloric belief that such spirits are repelled by iron and thus avoid bringing iron to their rituals, so as not to scare spirits away.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=105}}

====Awen====
{{Main|Awen}}
Awen is a concept of spirit or divinity in Druidry,{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=189}} which inspires poetry and art, and is believed to be a "flowing spirit" given by the Deity, which can be invoked by the Druid.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=20}} In many Druidic rituals, Awen is invoked by either chanting the word "Awen" or "A-I-O" three times, in order to shift the consciousness of the participants involved.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=21}} The word "Awen" derives from the Welsh and Cornish terms for "inspiration".{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=189}}

===Ancestor veneration===

A connection with ancestors is important in Druidry.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=71}} In some recorded examples, Druids regard the "ancestors" as an amorphous group, rather than as a set of named individuals.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=355}} The Druidic concept of ancestry is that of "ancestors of the land", rather than the "ancestors of the blood" venerated by some Heathen groups; they perceive a spiritual connection, rather than a genetic one, as being important.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=355}} Emphasising ancestors gives practitioners a sense of an identity which has been passed down from the past over the course of many centuries.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=71}}

Ancestor veneration leads many to object to the [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavation of [[Cadaver|human remains]] and their subsequent display in museums. Many have organised campaigns for their [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|reburial]]. For instance, in 2006, a neo-Druid called Paul Davies requested that the Alexander Keiller Museum in [[Avebury]], [[Wiltshire]] rebury their human remains, and that storing and displaying them was "immoral and disrespectful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consultation on ancient human remains ends Jan 31 |journal=British Archaeology |issue=104 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of this view has come from the archaeological community, with statements like "no single modern ethnic group or cult should be allowed to appropriate our ancestors for their own agendas. It is for the international scientific community to curate such remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites and practices==

Druidic groups are usually known as ''groves''.{{sfnm|1a1=Butler|1y=2005|1p=90|2a1=Harvey|2y=2007|2p=29}} Such a term reflects the movement's association with trees,{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=90}} and references the idea that Iron Age druids performed their rituals within tree groves.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=91}} Larger Druidic organisations are usually termed ''orders'',{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=29}} and those that lead them are often termed ''chosen chiefs''.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=32}}

Some British Druid orders divide membership into three grades, referred to as "bards", "ovates", and then "Druids".{{sfnm|1a1=Letcher|1y=2004|1p=24|2a1=Harvey|2y=2007|2p=32}} This three-tier system mirrors the three degrees found in [[British Traditional Wicca]].{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=24}} Other groups eschew any division into bard, ovate, and druid.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=19–20}} OBOD primarily educates its members in its form of Druidry through a correspondence course.{{sfn|Anczyk|2015|p=17}}

===Ceremonies===
[[File:Druids, in the early morning glow of the sun.jpg|thumb|right|A group of druids of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids in the early morning glow of the sun, shortly after having welcomed the sunrise at Stonehenge on the morning of the summer solstice.]]

Each Druidic grove conducts its rituals and ceremonies in a unique way.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=88}} Druidic rituals are designed to align their participants with the spirit imbuing nature.{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=63}} According to the anthropologist Thorsten Gieser, Druidic rituals are best seen not as a set of formalised actions but as "a stance, an attitude, a particular mode of experience and perception which gives rise to a feeling of being-in-the-world, of being part of Nature."{{sfn|Gieser|2016|p=63}}
The practices of modern Druids typically take place outside, in the daylight, in what is described as "the eye of the sun", meaning around midday.{{sfnm|1a1=Bowman|1y=2002|1p=81|2a1=Harvey|2y=2007|2p=20}} In some cases, they instead perform their rites indoors, or during the night.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=20}} Druidic rituals usually reflect on the time of year and the changing of the seasons.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}}

Druidic rituals often involve the participants standing in a circle and begin with a "calling of the quarters", in which a participant draws a circle in the air in a deosil direction to hail the north, south, east, and west, marking out the space in which the ceremony will take place.{{sfnm|1a1=Butler|1y=2005|1p=109|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2pp=361–362}} Libations may be poured onto the ground while a chalice of drink is passed around the assembled participants, again in a deosil direction. Food, often in the form of bread or cake, is also passed around the Druids and consumed.{{sfnm|1a1=Butler|1y=2005|1pp=109–110|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=362}} This may be followed by a period of meditation among those assembled.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=110}} A form of earth energy is then visualised, with participants believing that it is sent for a designated healing purpose.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=110}} This may be designed to help the victims of a particular event, such as a war or an epidemic, or it might be directed to assist individuals known to the group who are ill or requiring emotional support.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=112}} After the end of the ceremony, the Druids may remain together to take part in a meal,{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=111}} or visit a nearby [[pub]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=362}}

There is no specific dress code for ritual within the Druidic movement; some participants wear ordinary clothes, others wear robes.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}} Some groups favour earth-coloured robes, believing that this links them to the natural world and that it aids them in traveling unnoticed when going about at night.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=93}} "Celtish" language is often employed during ceremonies,{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}} as are quotations and material from the ''[[Carmina Gadelica]]''.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}} Most use some form of Morganwg's Gorsedd Prayer.{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=189}}

Some Druids also involve themselves in spell-casting, although this is usually regarded as a secondary feature among their practices.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=112}}

====Locations for ritual====

Rituals commonly take place at formations in the natural landscape or at prehistoric sites, among them [[megalith]]ic constructions from the Neolithic and Bronze Age or earthworks from the Iron Age.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=96}} Druids often believe that, even if the Iron Age druids did not build these monuments, they did use them for their rites.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=97}} Performing rituals at said sites allows many Druids to feel that they are getting close to their ancestors.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=98}} Druids regard them as [[sacred sites]] in part as recognition that prehistoric societies would have done the same.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=358}}
Druids in various parts of Ireland and Britain have reported such sites being home to a "Spirit of the Place" residing there.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=358}}
Many Druids also believe that such sites are centres of [[Energy (esotericism)|earth energy]] and lie along [[ley lines]] in the landscape.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=356}} These are ideas that have been adopted from [[Earth mysteries]] writers like [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=357}}

[[File:Druids celebrating at Stonehenge (0).png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Druidic ritual at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, southern England]]

In the popular imagination, Druids are closely linked with [[Stonehenge]]—a Neolithic and Bronze Age site in [[Wiltshire]], southern England.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=80}} Although Stonehenge predates the Iron Age and there is no evidence that it was ever used by Iron Age druids, many modern Druids believe that their ancient namesakes did indeed use it for their ceremonies.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=80}} Druids also use many other prehistoric sites as spaces for their rituals, including [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles]] like that at [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}} Some Druids have erected their own, modern stone circles in which to perform their ceremonies.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=106}} 
Druidic practices have also taken place at Early Neolithic [[chambered long barrow]]s such as [[Wayland's Smithy]] in [[Oxfordshire]],{{sfn|Gieser|2016|pp=60–61, 64, 67}} and the [[Coldrum Long Barrow]] in [[Kent]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=349}}
In Ireland, Druids perform ceremonies at one of the island's best known prehistoric sites, the [[Hill of Tara]].{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=95}} In 2000, scholar of religion Amy Hale noted that Druidic rituals at such prehistoric sites were "increasingly more common".{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=192}} She regarded the stone circle as "a symbol of an imagined Celtic past" shared by both Druids and Gorseth Bards.{{sfn|Hale|2000|p=193}} As well as performing group rituals at sites, Druids also visit them alone to meditate, prayer, and provide offerings.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=360}} Aside from Sabbat rituals, [[rites of passage]] can also take place at such sites, such as a Druidic baby-naming ceremony which took place at Kent's [[Chestnuts Long Barrow]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=363}}

Attitudes to land and environmental conservation are important to the Druidic world-view.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=114}} 
In 2003, Druids performed a ritual at the Hill of Tara to heal the location after road construction took place in the adjacent landscape.{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=95}} Others have carried out rituals at Coldrum Long Barrow to oppose [[fracking]] in the landscape.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=368}} Druids have also involved themselves in tree planting projects.{{sfn|Butler|2005|pp=121–122}}

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the use of a ritual based on the [[sweat lodge]] became increasingly popular among some Neo-druids in Ireland and the U.K.{{sfnm|1a1=Bowman|1y=2002|1p=83|2a1=Harvey|2y=2007|2pp=26–27}} Some Druids regard these sweat lodges as "initiatory and regenerative opportunities to rededicate oneself to honouring the Earth and the community of life."{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=26–27}} This practice is regarded differently by different individuals. Some practitioners regard it as a "revival" of genuine pre-Christian druidic practices, others see it a creative and respectful borrowing from one "native spirituality" into another, and a third school of thought regards it as a form of cultural theft.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=83}} Native Americans who preserve the sweat lodge ceremonies for their communities have protested the appropriation of the ceremony by non-Natives,&lt;ref name="Taliman2"&gt;{{citation | first = Valerie |last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasingly so now that people have been injured, and some have [[Sweat lodge#Risks|died]], in fraudulent [[sweat lodge]] ceremonies performed by non-Natives.&lt;ref name="Taliman2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16121078&amp;dopt=Abstract|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Bob |last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url =http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hocker, Lindsay.

===Arts and poetry===

[[File:ArthurPendragonStonehengeSummerSolstice2010.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Uther Pendragon attending 2010 Summer Solstice ceremony at Stonehenge.]]

In Druidry, a specific ceremony takes place known as an ''[[Eisteddfod]]'', which is dedicated to the recitation of poetry and musical performances.{{sfnm|1a1=Letcher|1y=2004|1pp=16–17|2a1=Harvey|2y=2007|2p=22}} Within the Druidic community, practitioners who are particularly skilled in their recitation of poetry or their performance of music are referred to as Bards.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=20}} Although bardism can also be found in other Pagan traditions such as [[Eco-Paganism]], it is of particular importance within Druidry.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} Bards perform at ''Eisteddfod'' at various occasions, from formal rituals to pub get-togethers and summer camps and environmental protests.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=22}} Among the Druidic community, it is often believed that bards should be divinely inspired in producing their work.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=17}}

Storytelling is important within Druidry,{{sfn|Butler|2005|p=121}} with stories chosen often coming from the vernacular literature of linguistically Celtic countries or from Arthurian legend.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} Musical performances typically draw from the folk musical traditions of [[Irish traditional music|Ireland]], [[Scottish folk music|Scotland]], [[Folk music of England|England]], [[French folk music|France]], and [[Music of Brittany#Traditional Breton music|Brittany]].{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} 
Instruments used commonly include [[lap harp]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[whistle]]s, [[bag pipes]], and [[guitar]]s.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} Bards utilise archaic words such as "t'was", "thence", and "deeds", while speaking in a grandiose manner of intonation.{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} The general purpose of bardism, according to scholar of religion and bard Andy Letcher, is to create an "ambience" of "a catchall ahistorical past; a Celtic, medieval, Tolkienesque, once-upon-a-time enchanted world".{{sfn|Letcher|2004|p=16}} Instruments commonly used by Druidic Bards include acoustic stringed instruments like the guitar and the [[clarsach]], as well as the [[bodhran]], bagpipe, rattle, flute and whistle. The scholar of religion Graham Harvey believed that these specific instruments were preferred by modern Druids because many of them were Irish in origin, and therefore gave a "Celtic flavour, seemingly invoking the Iron Age", the period during which the ancient druids lived.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=22}}

Groups like the [[British Druid Order]] have established their own ''[[gorseddau]]''.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}} Unlike the Welsh cultural gorseddau, these Druidic events often allow anyone to perform as a bard if they are inspired to do so.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}}

Druids have participated in other musical genres and with more technological instruments, including the [[blues]] and [[rave]] music, and one British club, Megatripolis, opened with the performance of a Druidic ritual.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=23–24}}

===Other practices===
[[File:Druidess.png|thumb|A female Druid at Stonehenge]]

Among many Druids, there is a system of tree lore, through which different associations are attributed to different species of tree, including particular moods, actions, phases of life, deities and ancestors.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=25}} Different species of trees are often linked to the [[ogham]] alphabet, which is employed in divination by Druids.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=25}} Rather than ogham, some practitioners favour [[Coelbren y Beirdd|coelbren]]—an alphabet likely devised by [[Iolo Morganwg]]—for their divinatory practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=26}}

Many Druids engage in a range of healing therapies, with both [[herbalism]] and [[homeopathy]] being popular within the Druidic community.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=26}}

Druids often revive older folk customs for use on their practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=203}} The England-based Secular Order of Druids for instance possess a [[hobby horse]] based on that used in the [['Obby 'Oss festival]] of [[Padstow]], [[Cornwall]].{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=23}}

===Festivals===
Druids generally observe eight spiritual festivals annually, which are collectively known as the [[Wheel of the Year]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bowman|1y=2002|1p=81|2a1=Butler|2y=2005|2p=108|3a1=Cooper|3y=2009|3p=66}} These are the same festivals usually celebrated by Wiccans.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=66}} In some cases groups attempt to revive folkloric European festivals and their accompanying traditions.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=23}} In other cases the rites are modern inventions, inspired by "the spirit of what they believe was the religious practice of pre-Roman Britain."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = Eugene V. | last2 = Ashcraft | first2 = W. Michael | title = Introduction to new and alternative religions in America | year = 2006 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | isbn = 978-0-275-98713-8 | pages = 178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons of practicality, such celebrations are not always held on the specific date of the festival itself, but on the nearest weekend, thus maximising the number of participants who can attend.{{sfn|Bowman|2002|p=81}}

Four of these are solar festivals, being positioned at the solstices and equinoxes; these are largely inspired by [[Germanic paganism]]. The other four are the "[[Celts|Celtic]]" festivals, the crossquarter days inspired by modern interpretations of ancient [[Celtic polytheism]]. The idea of the Wheel of the Year was introduced into Druidry by [[Ross Nichols]], who founded the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]] in 1964, and he had gained this idea from his friend [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who had implemented it in his [[Bricket Wood coven]] of [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian Witches]] in 1958.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Stukeley William.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|An illustration of William Stukeley. One of the primary figures in the development of Druidry, he was also a significant influence on modern [[archaeology]].]]
The Druidic movement originated among the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] ideas of the ancient druids that had begun to be developed in the 17th and 18th centuries. While many Early Mediaeval writers, particularly in Ireland, had demonised the ancient druids as barbarians who had practiced [[human sacrifice]] and tried to suppress the coming of Christianity, certain Late Mediaeval writers had begun to extol what they believed were the virtues of the druids, and reinvented them as national heroes, particularly in Germany, France and Scotland. It was also during this period that [[Conrad Celtis]] had begun to propagate the image of the druids as having been bearded, wise old men wearing white robes, something that would prove highly influential in future centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the Iron Age druids as national heroes would later begin to emerge in England during the Early Modern period, with the [[antiquarian]] and Anglican vicar [[William Stukeley]] (1687–1765) proclaiming himself to be a "druid" and writing a number of popular books in which he claimed that prehistoric [[megalithic|megaliths]] like [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] were temples built by the druids, something now known to be incorrect. Stukeley himself, being a devout but unorthodox Christian, felt that the ancient druids had been followers of a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] faith very similar to Christianity, at one point even stating that ancient druidry was "so extremely like Christianity, that in effect, it differed from it only in this; they believe in [[Jesus Christ|a Messiah]] who was to come into the world, as we believe in him that is come".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 86–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the publication and spread of Stukeley's writings, other people also began to self-describe themselves as "druids" and form societies: the earliest of these was the Druidic Society, founded on the Welsh island of [[Anglesey]] in 1772. Largely revolving around ensuring the continued financial success of business on the island, it attracted many of Anglesey's wealthy inhabitants into it, and donated much of its proceeds to charity, but was disbanded in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar Welsh group was the Society of the Druids of Cardigan, founded circa 1779, largely by a group of friends who wished to attend "literary picnics" together.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; The third British group to call itself Druidic was English rather than Welsh, and was known as the [[Ancient Order of Druids]]. Founded in 1781 and influenced by [[Freemasonry]], its origins have remained somewhat unknown, but it subsequently spread in popularity from its base in London across much of Britain and even abroad, with new lodges being founded, all of which were under the control of the central Grand Lodge in London. The Order was not religious in structure, and instead acted as somewhat of a social club, particularly for men with a common interest in music. In 1833 it suffered a schism, as a large number of dissenting lodges, unhappy at the management of the Order, formed their own United Ancient Order of Druids, and both groups would go on to grow in popularity throughout the rest of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 132–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of religious Druidry ===

None of the earliest modern Druidic groups had been religious in structure; however, this was to change in the late 18th century, primarily because of the work of a Welshman who took the name of [[Iolo Morganwg]] (1747–1826). Born as Edward Williams, he would take up the cause of [[Welsh nationalism]], and was deeply opposed to the British monarchy, supporting many of the ideals of the [[French revolution]], which had occurred in 1789. Eventually moving to London, he began perpetuating the claim that he was actually one of the last initiates of a surviving group of druids who were descended from those found in the Iron Age, centred on his home county of [[Glamorgan]]. He subsequently organised the performing of Neo-druidic rituals on [[Primrose Hill]] with some of his followers, whom he categorised as either Bards or Ovates, with he himself being the only one actually categorised as a Druid. He himself practiced a form of religion he believed the ancient druids had, which involved the worship of a singular monotheistic deity as well as the acceptance of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 146–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Wales, Druidry had taken on an explicitly religious formation by the 1840s.{{sfn|Hutton|2009b|p=314}}

[[File:William Price painting (2).jpg|thumb|left|The Welsh socialist and nationalist [[William Price (doctor)|Dr. William Price]], a prominent modern Druid.]]

Morganwg's example was taken up by other Welshmen in the 19th century, who continued to promote religious forms of Druidry. The most prominent figure in this was [[William Price (doctor)|William Price]] (1800–1893), a physician who held to ideas such as vegetarianism and the political [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement. His promotion of cremation and open practice of it led to his arrest and trial, but he was acquitted, achieving a level of fame throughout Britain. He would declare himself to be a Druid, and would do much to promote the return of what he believed was an ancient religion in his country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 253–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, [[Robert Wentworth Little]], a Freemason who achieved notoriety as the first Supreme Magus of the occult [[Societas Rosicruciana]], allegedly founded the [[Ancient and Archaeological Order of Druids]], which, like the Societas Rosicruciana, was an esoteric organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at the start of the 20th century, Druidic groups began holding their ceremonies at the great megalithic monument of [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England: the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] would later remark that "it was a great, and potentially uncomfortable, irony that modern Druids had arrived at Stonehenge just as archaeologists were evicting the ancient Druids from it" as they realised that the structure dated from the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]], millennia before the Iron Age, when the druids first appear in the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

One member of the Ancient Order of Druids was the English [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who later established [[Gardnerian Wicca]].{{sfn|Lewis|2009|p=480}}

===Pagan Druidry in Europe===
The most important figure for the rise of Neopagan Druidry in Britain was [[Ross Nichols]]. A member of [[The Druid Order]], in 1964 he split off to found the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]] (OBOD). In 1988 [[Philip Carr-Gomm]] was asked to lead the Order.

Nichols drew upon ideas from the [[Earth mysteries]] movement, incorporating many of its ideas about Glastonbury into his interpretation of Druidry.{{sfn|Hutton|2009b|p=324}}

Between 1985 and 1988, the Druid [[Tim Sebastion]] campaigned for religious access to Stonehenge, forming the [[Secular Order of Druids]] (SOD) around him.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=250}} In the late 1980s, SOD's campaign was joined by another group focused on Stonehenge access, led by a Druid calling himself King Arthur Pendragon; by 1993, his group had formalised as the Loyal Arthurian Warband.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|pp=252–253}} In 1988, a Druid order was also established in Glastonbury, Somerset, under the leadership of [[Rollo Maughfling]].{{sfn|Hutton|2003|pp=251–252}}
In the late 1970s, the former [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n high priest [[Philip Shallcrass]] established the [[British Druid Order]] (BDO) to create a more explicitly Pagan form of Druidry. Fellow Druid [[Emma Restall Orr]] became co-leader of the group in the mid-1990s.{{sfnm|1a1=Shallcrass|1y=2002|1p=83|2a1=Hutton|2y=2003|2p=249}} Feeling the system of Orders too limiting, in 2002 Orr created [[The Druid Network]], which was officially launched in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avalonia.co.uk/books/author_interviews/bobcat_interview.htm interview (Avalonia)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1990s were—according to the historian [[Ronald Hutton]]—"boom years" for British Druidry.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=255}} In 1989, the [[Council of British Druid Orders]] was established to co-ordinate the activities of different Druid groups at the national level.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=255}} Further reflecting this spirit of unity, in 1992 a rite took place on London's [[Primrose Hill]] in which various Druid orders participated.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=255}} That year, two new Druidic magazines began publication Shallcrass' ''Druid's Voice'' and Steve Wilson's ''Aisling''.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=255}} However, arguments between different groups persisted and in 1996, the AOD, OBOD, and BDO withdrew from the Council of British Druid Orders.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=256}} In the late 1990s, [[English Heritage]] relented to pressure and agreed to allow Druidic and greater public access to Stonehenge.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=254}}
During the 1990s, Pagan Druidic groups were also established in Italy, with British Druids like Carr-Gomm visiting the country to give talks to the Pagan community.{{sfn|Howell|2015|pp=272–273}}

===Druidry in North America===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Isaac Bonewits the Druid.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Isaac Bonewits, a prominent American Druid.]] --&gt;

The earliest American Druid organizations were fraternal orders such as the [[United Ancient Order of Druids]] and the [[American Order of Druids]]. The former was a branch of a British organization that had split from the Ancient Order of Druids, while the latter was founded in [[Massachusetts]] in 1888. Both were forms of fraternal benefit societies rather than religious or neo-pagan groups.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin J. Schmidt ''Fraternal Orders'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the [[Reformed Druids of North America]] (RDNA) was founded by students at [[Carleton College]], [[Northfield, Minnesota]], a liberal arts college that required its members to attend some form of religious services. As a form of humorous protest against this rule, a group of students, who contained Christians, Jews and agnostics within their ranks, decided to create their own, non-serious religious group. Their protest was successful, and the requirement was scrapped in 1964. Nonetheless, the group continued holding services, which were not considered Neopagan by most members, but instead thought of an inter-religious nature. From its beginning, the RDNA revolved around the veneration of the natural world, personified as [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]], holding that religious truth could be found through nature. They had also adopted other elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance celebrating the festivals of the [[Wheel of the Year]], which they had borrowed from the Neopagan religion of [[Wicca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl06|Adler 2006]]. pp. 337–339.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cooper|2009b|p=44}}

While the RDNA had become a success, with new branches or "groves" being founded around the United States, the many Neopagan elements of the RDNA eventually rose to prominence, leading several groves to actively describe themselves as Neopagan. This was opposed by several of the group's founders, who wanted it to retain its inter-religious origins, and certain groves actually emphasized their connection to other religions: there was a group of [[Zen]] Druids in Olympia and [[Hassidic]] Druids in St. Louis for instance. Among those largely responsible for this transition towards Neopaganism within the organisation were [[Isaac Bonewits]] and Robert Larson, who worked in a grove located in [[Berkeley, California]]. Believing that the Reformed Druidic movement would have to accept that it was essentially Neopagan in nature, Bonewits decided to found a split-off group known as the New Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA), which he defined as an "Eclectic Reconstructionist Neo-Pagan Priestcraft, based primarily upon Gaulish and Celtic sources".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl06|Adler 2006]]. p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonewits still felt that many in the RDNA were hostile towards him, believing that he had infiltrated their group, and so in 1985 he founded a new, explicitly Neopagan Druidic group, [[Ár nDraíocht Féin]] (Our Own Druidism; a.k.a. ADF) and began publishing a journal, ''The Druid's Progress''. Arguing that it should draw from pan-European sources, rather than just those that were considered "Celtic", he placed an emphasis on academic and scholarly accuracy, taking a stand against what he perceived as the prevalent pseudo-historical ideas of many Neopagans and Druids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl06|Adler 2006]]. p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1986, several members of Ár nDraíocht Féin openly criticized Bonewits for his pan-European approach, wishing modern Druidism to be inspired purely by Celtic sources, and so they splintered off to form a group called the [[Henge of Keltria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), currently headed by Pagan author and druid [[John Michael Greer]], was founded as the Ancient Order of Masonic Druids in America in 1912 in Boston, Mass. The founder, James Manchester had obtained a charter from the Ancient Order of Masonic Druids of England (AOMD). AOMD started in 1874 as the Ancient Archaeological Order of Druids (AAOD) by Robert Wentworth Little, the founder of [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] (SRIA). SRIA is the immediate predecessor organization of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] (HOGD). In 1972, the Ancient Order of Masonic Druids in America changed its name to the current name the Ancient Order of Druids in America and started initiating women, which it had not done so previously because of its masonic origin. It was also at this time that AOMD denied ever having recognized AOMDA and wasn't interested in doing so at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://aoda.org/AODA_History.html|title= AODA History|publisher= Ancient Order of Druids in America|access-date= 8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pagan Census project led by [[Helen A. Berger]], Evan A. Leach, and Leigh S. Shaffer gained responses from Druids in the U.S. Of these respondents, 49.7% were male and 48.2% female (2% did not answer), which reflected a greater proportion of men than the American Pagan community as a whole, which had a female majority.{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=97}} 73.6% of Druid respondents described themselves as heterosexual, with 16.2% as bisexual, 3% as gay men and 1.5% as lesbian. This reflected a greater proportion of heterosexuals than in the broader American Pagan community.{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=97}} The median income of these Druids was between $20,000 and $30,000, which was lower than the average for Pagans.{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|pp=97–98}} They project revealed that 83.8% of Druid respondents were registered to vote, which was lower than the proportion across the broader Pagan community (87.8%).{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=100}} Among these Druids, 35.5% were registered independents, 31% [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 5.1% [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarians]], 4.6% [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and 3.6% [[Green Party of the United States|Greens]].{{sfn|Berger|Leagh|Shaffer|2003|p=99}}

'''Feed-forward''', sometimes written '''feedforward''', is a term describing an element or pathway within a [[control system]] that passes a controlling signal from a source in its external environment to a load elsewhere in its external environment. This is often a command signal from an external operator.

A control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has [[feedback]], which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.

In a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haugen|first=F.|title=Basic Dynamics and Control|year=2009|isbn=978-82-91748-13-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available, and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called 'ballistic', because once a control signal has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast, 'cruise control' adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.

These systems could relate to [[control theory]], [[physiology]], or [[computing]].

== Overview ==
With feed-forward or Feedforward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a feed-forward system may measure the fact that the door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with feed-forward control is that the effects of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window was opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might let the house cool down.

The term has specific meaning within the field of CPU-based [[automatic control]]. The discipline of “feedforward control” as it relates to modern, CPU based automatic controls is widely discussed, but is seldom practiced due to the difficulty and expense of developing or providing for the [[mathematical model]] required to facilitate this type of control. [[Open-loop controller|Open-loop control]] and [[Feedback controller|feedback control]], often based on canned [[PID controller|PID control]] algorithms, are much more widely used.&lt;ref name="ISA1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Motion Control|url=http://www.isa.org/Content/ContentGroups/Motion_Control2/Departments1/Motion_Fundamentals/200227/20020421.pdf|publisher=ISA|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Book, W.J. and Cetinkunt, S.|title=Optimum Control of Flexible Robot Arms OR Fixed Paths|journal=IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|date=December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Oosting, K.W. and Dickerson, S.L.|title=Control of a Lightweight Robot Arm|journal=IEEE International Conference on Industrial Automation|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Control Systems.png|thumb|300px|The Three types of Control System
(a) Open Loop
(b) Feed-forward
(c) Feedback (Closed Loop)

Based on Hopgood (2002)]]

There are three types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. 
An example of a pure open loop control system is manual non-power-assisted steering of a motor car; the steering system does not have access to an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, [[power steering]] has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism.  This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See [[Model predictive control]].

If you include the driver in the system, then he does provide a feedback path by observing the direction of travel and compensating for errors by turning the steering wheel. In that case you have a feedback system, and the block labeled "System" in Figure(c) is a feed-forward system.

In other words, systems of different types can be nested, and the overall system regarded as a [[black-box]].

Feedforward control is distinctly different from open loop control and [[teleoperator]] systems. Feedforward control requires a mathematical model of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant's relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither open loop control nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the [[physical system]] or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model of the system is a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.&lt;ref name=onote1/&gt;&lt;ref name=onote25/&gt;

== History ==
Historically, the use of the term “feedforward” is found in works by D. M. MacKay as early as 1956. While MacKay’s work is in the field of biological control theory, he speaks only of feedforward systems. MacKay does not mention “Feedforward Control” or allude to the discipline of “Feedforward Controls.” MacKay and other early writers who use the term “feedforward” are generally writing about theories of how human or animal brains work.&lt;ref name=onote37/&gt;

The discipline of “feedforward controls” was largely developed by professors and graduate students at [[Georgia Tech]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]]. Feedforward is not typically hyphenated in scholarly publications. Meckl and Seering of MIT and Book and Dickerson of Georgia Tech began the development of the concepts of Feedforward Control in the mid 1970s. The discipline of Feedforward Controls was well defined in many scholarly papers, articles and books by the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=onote1/&gt;&lt;ref name=onote2&gt;Alberts, T.E., Augmenting the Control of A Flexible Manipulator with Passive Mechanical Damping, PhD. Thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote31/&gt;&lt;ref name=onote33&gt;Bruno Siciliano and [[Oussama Khatib]], ''Springer Handbook of Robotics'', Springer-Verlag, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The benefits of feedforward control are significant and can often justify the extra cost, time and effort required to implement the technology. Control accuracy can often be improved by as much as an [[order of magnitude]] if the mathematical model is of sufficient quality and implementation of the feedforward control law is well thought out. [[Energy consumption]] by the feedforward control system and its driver is typically substantially lower than with other controls. Stability is enhanced such that the controlled device can be built of lower cost, lighter weight, springier materials while still being highly accurate and able to operate at high speeds. Other benefits of feedforward control include reduced wear and tear on equipment, lower maintenance costs, higher reliability and a substantial reduction in [[hysteresis]].  Feedforward control is often combined with feedback control to optimize performance.&lt;ref name=onote1&gt;Oosting, K.W., Simulation of Control Strategies for a Two Degree-of-Freedom Lightweight Flexible Robotic Arm, Thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feedforward control|url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/chem_eng/pages/Courses/oren%20courses/Chapter_9.pdf|publisher=Ben Gurion University|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote3&gt;Hastings, G.G., Controlling Flexible Manipulators, An Experimental Investigation, Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Mech. Eng., Georgia Institute of Technology, August, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote30&gt;Oosting, K.W. and Dickerson, S.L., “Low-Cost, High Speed Automated Inspection”, 1991, Industry Report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote31&gt;Oosting, K.W. and Dickerson, S.L., “Feed Forward Control for Stabilization”, 1987, ASME&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==
The mathematical model of the plant (machine, process or organism) used by the feedforward control system may be created and input by a [[Control engineering|control engineer]] or it may be learned by the control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learned Feed Forward - Innovations in Motion Control|url=http://www.tagonline.org/articles.php?id=42|publisher=Technology Association of Georgia|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems capable of learning and/or adapting their mathematical model have become more practical as [[microprocessor]] speeds have increased. The discipline of modern feedforward control was itself made possible by the invention of microprocessors.&lt;ref name=onote1/&gt;&lt;ref name=onote25&gt;Alberts, T.E., Sangveraphunsiri, V. and Book, Wayne J., Optimal Control of a Flexible Manipulator Arm: Volume I, Dynamic Modeling, MHRC Technical Report, MHRC-TR-85-06, Georgia Inst, of Technology, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedforward control requires integration of the mathematical model into the control algorithm such that it is used to determine the control actions based on what is known about the state of the system being controlled. In the case of control for a lightweight, flexible [[robotic arm]], this could be as simple as compensating between when the robot arm is carrying a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] and when it is not. The target joint angles are adjusted to place the payload in the desired position based on knowing the deflections in the arm from the mathematical model’s interpretation of the disturbance caused by the payload. Systems that plan actions and then pass the plan to a different system for execution do not satisfy the above definition of feedforward control. Unless the system includes a means to detect a disturbance or receive an input and process that input through the mathematical model to determine the required modification to the control action, it is not true feedforward control.&lt;ref name=onote38/&gt;&lt;ref name=onote13&gt;Book, W.J., Modeling, Design and Control of Flexible Manipulator Arms, PhD. Thesis, MIT, Dept. of Mech. Eng., April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote14&gt;Maizza-Neto, 0., Modal Analysis and Control of Flexible Manipulator Arms, PhD. Thesis-, MIT, Dept. of Mech.

===Open system&lt;!--'Open system (control theory)' redirects here--&gt;===
In [[systems theory]], an '''open system''' is a feed forward system that does not have any [[feedback loop]] to control its output. In contrast, a [[closed system (control theory)|closed system]] uses on a feedback loop to control the operation of the system.  In an open system, the output of the system is not fed back into the input to the system for control or operation.

== Applications ==

===Physiological feed-forward system===
In [[physiology]], feed-forward control is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion.  Feed-forward control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues. Feedback regulation of the heartbeat provides further adaptiveness to the running eventualities of physical exertion.

Feedforward systems are also found in biological control by human and animal brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feedback Feedforward control |url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/1155/feedback-feedforward.html|publisher=Psychology Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the case of biological feedforward systems, such as in the [[human brain]], knowledge or a [[mental model]] of the plant (body) can be considered to be mathematical as the model is characterized by limits, rhythms, mechanics and patterns.&lt;ref name=onote37&gt;MacKay, D. M. (1966): "Cerebral organization and the conscious control of action". In: J. C. Eccles (Ed.), Brain and conscious experience, Springer, pp. 422–440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=onote38&gt;Greene, P. H. (1969): "Seeking mathematical models of skilled actions". In: H. C. Muffley/D. Bootzin (Eds.), Biomechanics, Plenum, pp. 149–180&lt;/ref&gt;

A pure feed-forward system is different from a [[homeostatic]] control system, which has the function of keeping the body's internal environment 'steady' or in a 'prolonged steady state of readiness.' A homeostatic control system relies mainly on feedback (especially negative), in addition to the feedforward elements of the system.

===Gene regulation and feed-forward===
The cross regulation of genes can be represented by a graph, where genes are the nodes and one node is linked to another if the former is a [[transcription factor]] for the latter. A motif which predominantly appears in all known networks ([[E. coli]], [[Yeast]],...) is A activates B, A and B activate C. This motif has been shown to be a feed forward system, detecting non-temporary change of environment. This feed forward control theme is commonly observed in [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cell lineage]] development, where irreversible commitments are made.

===Feed-forward systems in computing===
{{main|Perceptron}}

In [[computing]], feed-forward normally refers to a [[perceptron]] network in which the outputs from all [[neuron]]s go to following but not preceding [[layer (abstraction)|layers]], so there are no [[feedback loop]]s.  The connections are set up during a training phase, which in effect is when the system is a feedback system.

===Long distance telephony===
In the early 1970s, intercity coaxial transmission systems, including [[L-carrier]], used feed-forward amplifiers to diminish linear distortion.  This more complex method allowed wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than earlier [[feedback]] systems.  [[Optical fiber]], however, made such systems obsolete before many were built.

===Automation and machine control===
Feedforward control is a discipline within the field of automatic controls used in automation.

{{basic forms of government}}
'''Feudalism''' was a combination of legal and military customs in [[medieval Europe]] that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour.
Although  derived from the Latin word ''feodum'' or ''feudum'' (fief),&lt;ref&gt;''feodum'' – see [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 ''The Cyclopedic Dictionary of Law''], by Walter A. Shumaker, George Foster Longsdorf, pg. 365, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; then in use, the term ''feudalism'' and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal [[political system]] by the people living in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noble | first = Thomas | title = The Foundations of Western Civilization | publisher = [[The Teaching Company]] | location = Chantilly, VA | year = 2002 |isbn = 978-1565856370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its classic definition, by [[François-Louis Ganshof]] (1944),&lt;ref name=ganshof&gt;[[François Louis Ganshof]] (1944). ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité''.  Translated into English by [[Philip Grierson]] as ''Feudalism'', with a foreword by [[F. M. Stenton]], 1st ed.: New York and London, 1952; 2nd ed: 1961; 3rd ed.: 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; ''feudalism'' describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s.&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt;

A broader definition of feudalism, as described by [[Marc Bloch]] (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but also those of all three [[estates of the realm]]: the nobility, the [[clergy]], and the [[peasant]]ry bound by [[manorialism]]; this is sometimes referred to as a "feudal society". Since the publication of [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]'s "The Tyranny of a Construct" (1974) and [[Susan Reynolds]]'s ''Fiefs and Vassals'' (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=reynolds/&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034347/http://www.wku.edu/~rob.harbison/projects/Gfeudal.html "The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay"], by Robert Harbison, 1996, [[Western Kentucky University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles West, ''[[Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800–c. 1100]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

There is no commonly accepted modern definition of feudalism, at least among scholars.&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034150/feudalism "Feudalism"], by [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1i.html#Feudalism "Feudalism?"], by [[Paul Halsall]]. [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjective ''feudal'' was coined in the 17th century, and the noun ''feudalism'', often used in a political and propaganda context, was not coined until the 19th century,&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt; from the French ''féodalité'' (''feudality''), itself an 18th-century creation.

In a classic definition by [[François-Louis Ganshof]] (1944),&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; ''feudalism'' describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s,&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; though Ganshof himself noted that his treatment related only to the "narrow, technical, legal sense of the word".

A broader definition, as described in [[Marc Bloch]]'s ''Feudal Society'' (1939),&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt; includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but those of all three [[estates of the realm]]: the nobility, the [[clergy]], and those living by their labour, most directly the [[peasant]]ry bound by [[manorialism]]; this order is often referred to as "feudal society", echoing Bloch's usage.

Since the publication of [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]'s "The Tyranny of a Construct" (1974)&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt; and [[Susan Reynolds]]'s ''Fiefs and Vassals'' (1994),&lt;ref name=reynolds/&gt; there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Outside a European context, the concept of feudalism is often used only by [[analogy]] (called ''semi-feudal''), most often in discussions of [[feudal Japan]] under the ''[[shōgun]]s'', and sometimes medieval and [[Gondar]]ine [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=hmco/&gt;  However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing feudalism (or traces of it) in places as diverse as [[Spring and Autumn period]] in [[China]], [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], the [[Indian feudalism|Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] and [[Jim Crow|Jim Crow American South]].&lt;ref name=hmco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/mil/html/mh_017900_feudalism.htm |title=Reader's Companion to Military History |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041112062036/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/mil/html/mh_017900_feudalism.htm |archivedate = 2004-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''feudalism'' has also been applied—often inappropriately or pejoratively—to non-Western societies where institutions and attitudes similar to those of [[medieval]] Europe are perceived to prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example: {{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians and political theorists believe that the term ''feudalism'' has been deprived of specific meaning by the many ways it has been used, leading them to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebrown/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Codex Manesse Reinmar von Zweter.jpg|thumb|Herr [[Reinmar von Zweter]], a 13th-century [[Minnesang|Minnesinger]], was depicted with his noble arms in [[Codex Manesse]].]]
The term "féodal" was used in 17th-century French legal treatises (1614)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/feudal |title=Feudal (n.d.) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=September 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Civilization of the Middle Ages |publisher= |last=Cantor |first=Norman F. |author-link=Norman F. Cantor |year=1994 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into English legal treatises as an adjective, such as "feodal government".

In the 18th century, [[Adam Smith]], seeking to describe economic systems, effectively coined the forms "feudal government" and "feudal system" in his book ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776).&lt;ref name=cheyette/&gt; In the 19th century the adjective "feudal" evolved into a noun: "feudalism".&lt;ref name=cheyette&gt;Fredric L. Cheyette. "FEUDALISM, EUROPEAN." in ''New Dictionary of the History Of Ideas'', Vol. 2, ed. Maryanne Cline Horowitz, Thomas Gale 2005, {{ISBN|0-684-31379-0}}. pp. 828–831&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''feudalism'' is recent, first appearing in French in 1823, Italian in 1827, English in 1839, and in German in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=cheyette /&gt;

The term "feudal" or "feodal" is derived from the [[medieval Latin]] word ''feodum''. The etymology of ''feodum'' is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an [[Arabic]] origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a ''beneficium'' (Latin).&lt;ref name=lubetski&gt;Meir Lubetski (ed.). ''Boundaries of the ancient Near Eastern world: a tribute to Cyrus H. Gordon''. "Notices on Pe'ah, Fay' and Feudum" by Alauddin Samarrai. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dO4rbfA_WVIC&amp;pg=PA248 Pg. 248–250], Continuum International Publishing Group, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term ''feudum'', or ''feodum'', began to replace ''beneficium'' in the documents.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; The origin of the ''feudum'' and why it replaced ''beneficium'' has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;

The most widely held theory was proposed by [[Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern]] in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;"fee, n.2." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Kern, '[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_taa005187001_01/_taa005187001_01_0032.php Feodum]', ''De taal- en letterbode'', 1( 1870), pp. 189-201.&lt;/ref&gt; being supported by, amongst others, [[William Stubbs]]&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stubbs]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'' (3 volumes), 2nd edition 1875–78, Vol. 1, pg. 251, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marc Bloch]].&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1&gt;Marc Bloch. ''Feudal Society'', Vol. 1, 1964. pp.165–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2&gt;Marc Bloch. ''Feudalism'', 1961, pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term ''*fehu-ôd'', in which ''*fehu'' means "cattle" and ''-ôd'' means "goods", implying "a moveable object of value."&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2/&gt; Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as ''feos'', a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word ''feos'' meaning movable property changed little by little to ''feus'' meaning the exact opposite: landed property.&lt;ref name=bloch-ety1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch-ety2/&gt;

Another theory was put forward by [[Archibald R. Lewis]].&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt; Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not ''feudum'' (or ''feodum''), but rather ''foderum'', the earliest attested use being in [[Astronomus]]'s ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' (840).&lt;ref name=arlewis&gt;[[Archibald R. Lewis]]. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718–1050'', 1965, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; In that text is a passage about [[Louis the Pious]] that says ''annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant'', which can be translated as "Louis forbade that military [[provender]] (which they popularly call "fodder") be furnished.."&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;

Another theory by [[Alauddin Samarrai]] suggests an Arabic origin, from ''fuyū'' (the plural of ''fay'', which literally means "the returned", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').&lt;ref name=lubetski/&gt;&lt;ref name=samarrai&gt;[[Alauddin Samarrai]]. "The term 'fief': A possible Arabic origin", ''Studies in Medieval Culture'', 4.1 (1973), pp. 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include ''feo'', ''feu'', ''feuz'', ''feuum'' and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a [[loanword]]. The first use of these terms is in [[Languedoc]], one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of ''feuum'' (as a replacement for ''beneficium'') can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at [[Fraxinetum]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]) in [[Provence]] was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the Arabic word ''fuyū'' (the plural of ''fay''), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms – ''feo, feu, feuz, feuum'' and others – from which eventually ''feudum'' derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically "fanciful roots" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.&lt;ref name=samarrai/&gt;

==History==
{{English Feudalism}}

Feudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the [[decentralization]] of an empire: especially in the [[Carolingian]] empires, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure{{clarify|date=September 2012}} necessary to support cavalry without the ability to allocate land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.&lt;ref name="Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332"&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. pp. 332–343&lt;/ref&gt;

These acquired powers significantly [[federation|diminished unitary power]] in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary power—as with the European monarchies—did feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.&lt;ref name="Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332"/&gt;

===Classic feudalism===
:''See also [[Feudalism in England]], [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Examples of feudalism]]''
The classic [[François-Louis Ganshof]] version of feudalism&lt;ref name=ebo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt; describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of  service to the lord. There were many varieties of [[feudal land tenure]], consisting of  military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.&lt;ref name=ganshof/&gt;

===Vassalage===
[[File:Hommage du comté de Clermont-en-Beauvaisis.png|thumbnail|[[Homage (feudal)|Homage]] of [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]]]
Before a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a [[commendation ceremony]],  which was composed of the two-part act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and oath of [[fealty]]. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. ''Fealty'' comes from the Latin ''fidelitas'' and denotes the [[fidelity]] owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. "Fealty" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.&lt;ref name=stephenson&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism ''Medieval Feudalism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083705/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism |date=2012-02-09 }}, by [[Carl Stephenson (historian)|Carl Stephenson]]. Cornell University Press, 1942. Classic introduction to Feudalism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to "aid", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed [[court baron]], or at the king's court.&lt;ref&gt;Encyc. Brit. op.cit. It was a standard part of the feudal contract (fief [land], fealty [oath of allegiance], faith [belief in God]) that every tenant was under an obligation to attend his overlord's court to advise and support him; [[Sir Harris Nicolas]], in ''Historic Peerage of England'', ed. [[William Courthope (officer of arms)|Courthope]], p.18, quoted by Encyc. Brit, op.cit., p. 388: "It was the principle of the feudal system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|France in the late 15th century: a mosaic of feudal territories]]
It could also involve the vassal providing "counsel", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the [[manor]] this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see [[examples of feudalism]].

===The "Feudal Revolution" in France===
In its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of "politics of land" (an expression used by the historian [[Marc Bloch]]).  The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a "feudal revolution" or "mutation" and a "fragmentation of powers" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 522-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as [[castellan]]s and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; (what [[Georges Duby]] called collectively the "''seigneurie banale''"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;).  Power in this period became more personal.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p.522.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "fragmentation of powers" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, p.523.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords.  In response to this, the idea of a "[[liege lord]]" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Hallam. ''Capetian France 987–1328'', p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of European feudalism (1500–1850s)===
{{Further|Abolition of feudalism in France}}

Feudalism effectively ended by about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;"The End of Feudalism" in J.H.M. Salmon, ''Society in Crisis: France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) pp 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the [[Black Death]] reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the Feudal system hung on in France until the French Revolution, and the system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Russia finally abolished [[serfdom]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon'' (1996) pp 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Topolski, Continuity and discontinuity in the development of the feudal system in Eastern Europe (Xth to XVIIth centuries)" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1981) 10#2 pp: 373–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] explains how at an early stage of the [[French Revolution]], on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, "The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely." Lefebvre explains:

{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude — which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office, conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices.... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P,|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, "The survival of the nobility during the French Revolution." ''Past and Present'' (1967): 71–86 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650023 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Hanson, ''The A to Z of the French Revolution'' (2013) pp 293–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudal society==
{{main|Manorialism}}
[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[socage]] on the royal [[demesne]] in  feudal England, c. 1310]]
The phrase "feudal society" as defined by [[Marc Bloch]]&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;Bloch, Marc, ''Feudal Society.'' Tr. L.A. Manyon. Two volume. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 {{ISBN|0-226-05979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the [[peasant]]ry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the "powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classical feudal hierarchy.

==Historiography==
The idea of ''feudalism'' was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.

===Evolution of the concept===
The concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] ''De L'Esprit des Lois'' (1748; published in English as ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), and [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]]’s ''Histoire des anciens Parlements de France'' (1737; published in English as ''An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom'', 1739).&lt;ref name=cheyette/&gt; In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', or French monarchy. This was [[the Age of Enlightenment]] when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the "Dark Ages" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Robert Bartlett]]. "Perspectives on the Medieval World" in ''Medieval Panorama'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them "feudalism" meant [[Fiefdom|seigneurial]] privileges and prerogatives. When the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|French Constituent Assembly]] abolished the "feudal regime" in August 1789 this is what was meant.

[[Adam Smith]] used the term "feudal system" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by [[serf]]s to landowning nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/Feudal.htm |title=Feudalism |author=Richard Abels |date= |work= |publisher=usna.edu |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal [[mode of production]]) as the order coming before [[capitalism]]. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) in their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]] and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.

He also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: ‘in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny — under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs’.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) [first published 1980], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. [[Eric Wolf]]) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.

===Later studies===

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[John Horace Round]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (Holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).

In the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian [[Marc Bloch]], arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian.,&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in ''Feudal Society'' (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection – both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on "lordship", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt;

In contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian [[François-Louis Ganshof]] defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité?'' ("What is feudalism?", 1944; translated in English as ''Feudalism''). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,&lt;ref name=daileader&gt;[[Philip Daileader]], "Feudalism", ''The High Middle Ages'', Course No. 869, [[The Teaching Company]], {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.

Although he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] that came to be known as the [[Annales School]], [[Georges Duby]] was an exponent of the ''Annaliste'' tradition. In  a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled ''La société aux XIe et XIIe siècles dans la région mâconnaise'' (''Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the [[Mâconnais]] region''), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian [[Cluny Abbey|monastery of Cluny]], as well as the dioceses of [[Ancient Diocese of Mâcon|Mâcon]] and [[Dijon]], Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the [[Mâconnais]] region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions—particularly comital courts established under the [[Carolingian]] monarchy—that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.

===Challenges to the feudal model===
In 1974, U.S. historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]&lt;ref name=ebrown&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the label ''feudalism'' as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of ''feudalism'', she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back "tyrannically" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; In ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted'' (1994),&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;Reynolds, Susan, ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-19-820648-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Reynolds]] expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt; Reynolds argues:
:Too many models of feudalism used for comparisons, even by Marxists, are still either constructed on the 16th-century basis or incorporate what, in a Marxist view, must surely be superficial or irrelevant features from it.  Even when one restricts oneself to Europe and to feudalism in its narrow sense it is extremely doubtful whether feudo-vassalic institutions formed a coherent bundle of institutions or concepts that were structurally separate from other  institutions  and concepts of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''feudal'' has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See [[Examples of feudalism]]). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;John Whitney Hall, "Feudalism in Japan—a reassessment," ''Comparative studies in Society and History'' (1962) 5#1 pp: 15–51 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/177767 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Friday,  "The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan," ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term ''feudalism'' has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and [[political theorist]]s to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.&lt;ref name=daileader/&gt;

Richard Abels notes that "Western Civilization and World Civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abels, "The Historiography of a Construct: 'Feudalism' and the Medieval Historian." ''History Compass'' (2009) 7#3 pp: 1008–1031.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Garda '''Frank Hand''' was killed in the line of duty by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] on 10 August 1984.

==Background==
Born in 1958 of a family of seven from [[County Roscommon]], Hand joined the [[Garda Síochána]] in 1977, becoming a detective in 1981. He worked in [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] and [[Irishtown, Dublin|Irishtown]] in [[Dublin]], subsequently worked with the Drug Squad. Early in 1984 he was assigned to the Central Detective Unit at Harcourt Square. In July 1984 he married Ban Gharda Breda Hogan, returning from their honeymoon in Venice at the start of August. 

On 10 August 1984 he and Detective Garda Michael Dowd were escorting a cash delivery to a post office in [[County Meath]]. Hand was armed with a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special, Dowd with an [[Uzi]]. 

At Drumree Post Office they were attacked by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], who opened fire on the Gardaí. Both were injured, Detective Hand subsequently dying of his wounds. He was one of some sixteen members of an Garda Síochána killed by Irish republicans during [[The Troubles]], and one of thirty-five gardas killed while on duty, many by the IRA.

Patrick McPhilips, Thomas Eccles and Brian McShane were convicted and sentenced to death, which was commuted to 40 years imprisonment.

In 1998, his brother criticised the Irish government for not consulting his and other families about the release of the killers of his brother, pointing out that he had only found out about the potential releases by accident: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would accept that there has to be compromise and obviously Northern Ireland has been a very difficult problem. However, in my view the Republic of Ireland was a separate sovereign state; at the time Frank was shot the Republic of Ireland was not at war and I find it very hard to accept that Frank's killers, if you like, should be part of the agreement at all. It is a small comfort, but it is a comfort to know that people who were convicted were doing time ... that at least Frank's life and his work for the State had not been in vain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We gradually have resigned ourselves to the fact that we are a pebble on the beach, so to speak. There are bigger political agendas at work and we feel that we have no way of influencing these. We feel that the more we push, the more grief and hardship we're bringing on our individual family members and accordingly, I suppose, we have withdrawn, and we'd like to retain our dignity and not get involved in unseemly squabbles. ... one of our biggest gripes was the total lack of consultation and the minister and his officials did give us a firm commitment that there would be consultation and advice from here on out. However, that has not been the case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Freddie Prosser''' (July 28, 1938 - July 26, 1974) was a Canadian [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''Freddie Sweetan'''. He competed in certain North American regional promotions including the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] as well as [[Grand Prix Wrestling]], [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] and [[Stampede Wrestling]] during the 1960s and 1970s, most notably teaming with [[Paul Peller]] as the masked tag team '''The Butchers'''.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Shenstone, New Brunswick|Shenstone]], a small village in [[Albert County, New Brunswick]], Prosser met 7-year veteran Paul Peller who persuaded him to enter professional wrestling. Training under [[Emile Dupree]] in [[Shediac]], he eventually made his debut in 1968 teaming with Peller in [[Stu Hart]]'s Stampede Wrestling as '''The Butchers'''. During their time in the promotion, they proved a popular tag team headlining sold out events in Calgary and Edmonton four weeks straight, which included matches against football player [[Bob Luce]] and Emile Dupre.

The following year, he and Peller joined Dupre, [[Leo Burke]] and others to tour [[the Maritimes]] with [[Grand Prix Wrestling]] during the summer before returning to Calgary by the end of the year. Wrestling under the name '''Freddie Sweetan''', Prosser teamed with Stampede Wrestling veteran [[Bob Sweetan|"Bruiser" Bob Sweetan]] and eventually won the Stampede Wrestling Tag Team Championship before losing the titles to [[Bud Osborne|Bud]] &amp; [[Ray Osborne]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]] on April 18, 1969. He and Peller would later win the titles the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosP/peller_paul-can.html |title=SLAM!

Sports |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Wrestling Alliance===
In part to an agreement with Sweetan and Leo Burke, Prosser and Sweetan( being the same person) began wrestling in the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]-area as '''Killer Kox''' and '''K.O. Kox''' with [[Bob Geigel]]'s [[NWA Central States]]. Feuding with Bob Geigel &amp; [[The Stomper]] over the NWA Central States North American Tag Team titles, he later faced Geigel in a singles match the following year on November 5, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harleyrace.com/programs/kc110570.htm|title=Killer Cox - Bob Geigel renew their year-old feud|accessdate=|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=|year=|month=|work=|publisher=HarleyRace.com|pages=|language=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209101741/http://harleyrace.com/programs/kc110570.htm|archivedate=2005-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the United States, he would also team with fellow Canadians [[Yvon Cormier|The Beast]] in the [[Amarillo]] area and [[Alexis Smirnoff|Michel "Le Justice" Dubois]] in the Mid-Atlantic region &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garywill.com/wrestling/canada/dubois.htm |title=Gary Will's Canadian Pro Wrestling Page of Fame: Michel Dubois/Alexis Smirnoff |accessdate= |author=Will, Gary |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2000-05-25 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=GaryWill.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227085127/http://www.garywill.com/wrestling/canada/dubois.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who together faced [[Terry Kay|Terry]] &amp; [[Bobby Kay]], [[George Scott (wrestler)|George]] &amp; [[Sandy Scott]], [[Big Boy Brown]] &amp; [[Klondike Bill]], [[Les Thatcher]] &amp; [[Nelson Royal]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/smoke_filled_rooms/bourne01_spartanburg.htm |title=Giving Thanks in Spartanburg |accessdate= |author=Bourne, Dick |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=MidAtlanticGateway.com |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110200636/http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/smoke_filled_rooms/bourne01_spartanburg.htm |archivedate=2007-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most notably [[The Royal Kangaroos]] whom they had a five-week feud with in 1973. During their time in the Carolinas, they would also face [[J.J. Dillon]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Dillon|Dillon, J.J.]], Scott Teal and Philip Varriale. ''"Wrestlers Are Like Seagulls" from McMahon to McMahon''. Crowbar Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-9745545-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Canada and later career===
Returning to the Maritimes during the summer months, he also had a successful run with [[Eric Pomeroy]] feuding with The Beast, who enlisted Rudy Kay and Leo Burke, fighting over the ESA International Tag Team Championship throughout the early 1970s. He and The Beast would also engage in several single matches as well. He and Pomeroy would win the ESA International Tag Team titles three times before losing the titles to The Beast &amp; Rudy Kay in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] on October 12, 1971. He would later team with a number of tag team partners including [[Kurt Von Steiger]], Mr. X and J.J. Dillon defeating The Beast &amp; Bobby Kay in September 1973.

Losing single matches to [[Jacques Rougeau]] and [[Johnny Valentine]] at the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in February 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garywill.com/toronto/1974.htm |title=1974 Results: Sheik loses; last Tunney shows for Thesz, Brower |accessdate= |author=Will, Gary |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-02-02 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Gary Will's Toronto Wrestling History |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029232116/http://www.garywill.com/toronto/1974.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the titles were later vacated when Dillon did not return to the promotion the following summer. However, he and Michel Dubois would reunite to regain the titles defeating The Beast &amp; Bobby Kay in July 1974.

That same year, while visiting with Prosser and Pomeroy in their motor home, Prosser's father told Pomeroy that he was going to return to his house and commit suicide. After he had left, Pomeroy and Prosser returned to his house to find several [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) officers were already at the scene where they informed the two Prosser's father had killed himself with a shotgun from the house.

==Death==
After wrestling his last match in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], he held a party to celebrate his 36th birthday at his summer cabin at MacFarlane Bridge, 15 miles southeast of [[Moncton]]. Although it is unknown what happened during the hours after his friends had left the party, sometime during the night a fire broke out in the cabin resulting in Prosser's death. An investigation by the RCMP concluded that Prosser, whose body had been found near the front door, had been trapped in the cabin during the fire and died of [[smoke inhalation]]. The official cause of the fire was stated to have been accidental, and was most likely caused by Prosser having fallen asleep with a lit [[cigar]] in his hand.

However, wrestlers such as Emile Dupree have stated they believe the fire may have been started by a [[Barbecue#Charcoal|charcoal barbecue]]. Having been known to remain hot after being shut off, the grill may have either caused the fire or might have exploded. This theory was supported by news reports and, according to one news account, officials had ''"declined to reveal circumstances surrounding the blaze"'' although an autopsy was performed at a local Moncton hospital.&lt;ref name=Oliver/&gt;

Pomeroy, who had been unable to attend the party due to a prior commitment in Moncton, was asked by Prosser's mother to take over the funeral service. Prosser would later be cremated and buried alongside his father.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/01/09/868449.html |title=SLAM!

'''Gay bashing''' and '''gay bullying''' is [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]] against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be  [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], including persons who identify as  [[heterosexual]].

A "[[Bashing (pejorative)|bashing]]" may be a specific incident, and one could also use the verb ''to bash'' (e.g. "I was gay bashed."). A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, [[intimidation]], and threatened or actual violence. It also might take place in a political forum and include one or more common [[anti-gay slogan]]s.

Gay bullying involves intentional and unprovoked actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms such as ''lesbian bullying'', ''[[queer]] bullying'', and ''queer bashing'' may also be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay bashing has occurred worldwide for many decades and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Rogers|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/12/lgbt_bullying_interview/|title=Explaining American schools' gay bullying epidemic|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homophobia in the United States]] was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Brad|last2=Hunter|first2=Nan D.|last3=Mallory|first3=Christy|title=Documenting Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in State Employment|date=September 2009|publisher=The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law|location=Los Angeles|page=5–3|url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/5_History.pdf#page=3|quote=From 1947 to 1961, more than 5,000 allegedly homosexual federal civil servants lost their jobs in the purges for no reason other than sexual orientation, and thousands of applicants were also rejected for federal employment for the same reason. During this period, more than 1,000 men and women were fired for suspected homosexuality from the State Department alone—a far greater number than were dismissed for their membership in the Communist party. The Cold War and anti-communist efforts provided the setting in which a sustained attack upon gay men and lesbians took place. The history of this 'Lavender Scare' by the federal government has been extensively documented by historian David Johnson. Johnson has demonstrated that during this era government officials intentionally engaged in campaigns to associate homosexuality with Communism: 'homosexual' and 'pervert' became synonyms for 'Communist' and 'traitor.' LGBT people were treated as a national security threat, demanding the attention of Congress, the courts, statehouses, and the media.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As historian [[David K. Johnson]] explains:&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/404811in.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=An interview with David K. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Lavender Scare]] helped fan the flames of the [[Red Scare]]. In popular discourse, [[communist]]s and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden [[subculture]]s with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}

Johnson concludes that Senator [[Joe McCarthy]], notorious for his attacks on alleged communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; Using rumors collected by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one [[Nevada]] publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], were homosexuals.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After McCarthy called him an ex-Communist, [[Hank Greenspun]] wrote: "It is common talk among homosexuals in [[Milwaukee]] who rendezvous in the White Horse Inn that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged in homosexual activities." [[Las Vegas Sun]], October 25, 1952. McCarthy later explained he meant to call Greenspun an ex-convict (which was true), rather than an ex-Communist (which was false).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]] said, "There was a lot of time spent investigating" these allegations, "although no one came close to proving it."  No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allegations are specifically rejected in Richard Rovere, ''Senator Joe McCarthy'' (1969), p. 68; see also Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (2001) p. 149 (includes Bradlee quote); Kyle A. Cuordileone, ''Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War'' (2003), p. 94; Thomas Patrick Doherty, ''Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture,'' (2003), p. 228. Geoff Schumacher, ''Sun, Sin &amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas'' (2004), p. 144, concludes, "Greenspun descended into mud-spewing rhetoric that would make the [[National Enquirer]] blanch." Knowing that McCarthy would not dare enter Nevada, where he would be served with a lawsuit for defaming Greenspun, Greenspun punished McCarthy with his own weapon of anonymous, scandalous accusations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer bullying ===

[[Egale Canada]] conducted a survey of more than 3700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, "Every Class in Every School",&lt;ref&gt;[http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ Every Class in Every School], Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools, Egale Canada&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard "that's so gay" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard "faggot", "lezbo" and "dyke" daily. 58% or about 1400 of the 2400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting.
Further, EGALE found that students not directly affected by [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] or [[transphobia]] were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of [[Empathy gap|empathy gaps for social pain]] which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L.

A research study of 78 eleven to fourteen-year-old boys conducted in twelve schools in London, England between 1998 and 1999&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; revealed that respondents who used the word "gay" to label another boy in a derogatory manner intended the word as "just a joke", "just a cuss" and not as a statement of one's perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C.

== Causes of queer bullying ==

Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. In fact, 71.4% of LGBT folk experience major depression disorder (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in the LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem and pressure to conform go hand in hand. When an LGBT individual is told what to look like and who to love, it puts a toll on their self-esteem. When people make comments about who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. it begins to make them feel insecure. It makes them feel as though they aren't good enough the way they are. "Coming-out" is a terms that is used to describe when an LGBT individual makes it known that they are gay, lesbian, etc. Coming out is usually the first factor that will affect a person involved in the LGBT community because when they first discover who they really are, their instinct is to confide in their parents to help them through it (Markheim, Personal Interview). When they experience family rejection after coming out, they automatically feel unwanted and unloved. This can set them into a downward spiral of depression. Parenting and relationship formation are very closely related because usually, people feel more comfortable parenting with their significant other rather than alone, especially if they are involved in the LGBT community. Just recently, in March 2016, is became legal for LGBT parents to adopt in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Mollie|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children in All 50 States|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not being able to conceive their own child can already cause depression, but when they were denied the right to adopt, it caused even more pain. Minority stress is not the biggest of all the factors, but it doesn't make anybody feel better. Minority stress is defined as a stress experienced by LGBT individuals due to their sexual orientation/gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Ilan|title=Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date=March 1995|volume= 36|issue= 1|page=38 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15461517|accessdate=July 24, 2017|doi=10.2307/2137286|jstor=2137286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can slip anybody into a depressed state whether the violence is a type of physical abuse, mental abuse, or verbal abuse. A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes to much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.

== Effects of queer bullying ==

Queer bullying may make some victims feel sad and unsafe in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glew | first1 = G.

Some victims might feel paralyzed and withdraw socially as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Crozier" /&gt; Other victims of queer bullying may begin to live the effects of [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; Queer or [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] students may try to pass as heterosexual in order to avoid queer bullying. [[Passing (sexual orientation)|Passing]] isolates the student from other queer or questioning students, potential [[Straight ally|allies]], and support.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Adults who try to pass also may feel the effects emotionally and psychologically, of this effort to conceal their true identities.&lt;ref name="Herek" /&gt;

Queer bullying may also be seen as a manifestation of what American academic [[Ilan Meyer]] calls ''[[minority stress]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = I. H. | year = 1995 | title = Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 38–56 | doi=10.2307/2137286| pmid = 7738327 | jstor = 2137286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may affect sexual and ethno-racial minorities attempting to exist within a challenging broader society.

== Explicit and implicit homophobic and transphobic discriminatory behavior in educational settings ==

Homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve conflicts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems.&lt;ref&gt;GMR, UNESCO, and UNGEI, ‘School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all: Policy Paper 17 at 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City’, 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City. UNESCO, p. 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plan International, ‘A Girl’s Right to Learn Without Fear: Working to end gender-based violence at school’, Plan Limited, Surrey, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

Implicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;ICGBV, ‘Addressing School Related Gender Based Violence: Learning from Practice: Learning Brief No. 10’, Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence, Dublin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Leach, M. Dunne, and F. Salvi, ‘School-Related Gender based Violence: A global review of current issues and approaches in policy, programming and implementation responses to School-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) for the Education Sector’, UNESCO, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:

* Asserting that some subjects are better suited to students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression (for example, science for heterosexual male students and drama for gay male students).
* Suggesting that it is normal for heterosexual students to have greater agency or influence (for example, with the opinions of LGBTI students treated as marginal and unimportant).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in curriculum materials or teacher training, such as through images and discourse (for example, that refer to heterosexuality as ‘normal’).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in educational policies, rules and regulations (for example, by not even acknowledging that LGBTI students are part of the school community and by not specifying them in relevant policies).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Statistics and examples ==

Teens face harassment, threats, and violence. A 1998 study in the US by [[Mental Health America]] found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher=National Mental Health Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archivedate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word "gay" was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How 'gay' Became Children's Insult of Choice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in [[Great Britain|British]] schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the [[Schools Education Unit]] for [[LGBT|LGB]] activist group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing "a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Gay Bullying in Schools Common|date=June 26, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6239098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.&lt;ref name=Stonewall1&gt;{{cite web|title=Homophobic bullying|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/secondary_schools/homophobic_bullying/default.asp|website=stonewall.org.uk|publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of suicide is higher among LGBT people. According to a 1979 Jay and Young study, 40 percent of gay men and 39 percent of gay women in the US had attempted or seriously thought about suicide.&lt;ref name="ncmh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide |year=1989 |url=http://www.ncmhjj.com/resource_kit/pdfs/Special%20Issues/References/GayMaleLesSuic.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714161413/http://www.ncmhjj.com/resource_kit/pdfs/Special%20Issues/References/GayMaleLesSuic.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study conducted by the Schools Education Unit for LGB activist group Stonewall, an online survey reported that 71 percent of the girl participants who identified as LGBTQ, and 57 percent of the boy participants who identified as LGBTQ had seriously considered suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The School Report|url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/The_School_Report__2012_.pdf|publisher=Stonewall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, F.

The state of [[Illinois]] passed a law (SB3266) in June 2010 that prohibits gay bullying and other forms of bullying in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SB3266 Text |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=3266&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=51081&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311201259/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=3266&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=51081&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |archivedate=March 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], legislators implemented Republic Act No. 10627, otherwise known as the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, in schools. According to the said law, gender-based bullying is defined as ˮany act that humiliates or excludes a person on the basis of perceived or actual sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)ˮ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10627|url=http://www.gov.ph/2013/12/13/implementing-rules-and-regulations-of-republic-act-no-10627/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=Government of the Philippines|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to growing awareness of gay bashing and bullying, a number of support groups have been founded to help LGBT people cope with their abuse.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In Europe [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall UK]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Uk gay news|title=Stonewall, Mayor of London Launch Anti-Homophobic Bullying DVD|accessdate=August 21, 2011|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/2006july/0401.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328181745/http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/2006july/0401.htm|archivedate=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anti-Bullying Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antibullying.net/homophobicinfo3.htm|title=Information for Schools on Homophobic Bullying|website=www.antibullying.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; are active in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], while [[Russia]] has the [[Russian LGBT network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ilga |title=The Russian LGBT Network |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |url=http://ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/developing/projects/russian_project/the_russian_lgbt_network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320021122/http://ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/developing/projects/russian_project/the_russian_lgbt_network |archivedate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19805">'''Gomocup''' is a worldwide tournament of artificial intelligences (AI) playing [[Gomoku]] and [[Renju]]. The tournament has been played since 2000 and takes place every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gomoku AI programming tournament|url=http://gomocup.org/home/|website=Gomocup|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604205643/http://gomocup.org/home/|archivedate=2016-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gomocup 2016, the 17th tournament (April the 22nd-24th, 2016)|url=http://gomocup.org/results/gomocup-result-2016/}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the most famous and largest Gomoku AI tournament in the world, with around 40 participants from about 10 countries.

== Rules ==
Gomocup has been played in the freestyle Gomoku rule with the board size of 20 since it was started in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/detail-information/|title=Detailed Information|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the standard Gomoku rule was added into Gomocup as a tournament, in which the board size is 15 and more than five in a row is not considered to be a win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/results/gomocup-result-2009/|title=Gomocup 2009, the 10th tournament (April the 4th, 2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Renju rule was also added into Gomocup, with a board size of 15 and forbidden moves for black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/gomocup-2016-announcement/|title=Gomocup 2016 Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, since there are a large number of participants in the freestyle Gomoku tournament, the freestyle Gomoku tournament is divided into several leagues, and the fast game tournament is introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/results/gomocup-result-2005/|title=Gomocup 2005, the 6th tournament (April the 16th, 2005)|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get rid of the fact that there is a winning strategy for the player who plays first in Gomoku,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renju.nu/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2016/09/Go-Moku.pdf|title=Go-Moku and Threat Space Search}}&lt;/ref&gt; balanced openings have been prepared by Gomoku experts since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/results/gomocup-result-2006/|title=Gomocup 2006, the 7th tournament (April the 28th, 2006)|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games would be started from these balanced openings, and neither side would have a big advantage from the very beginning.

== AI vs. Human Tournament ==
There were two AI vs. Human tournaments held in the Czech Republic in 2006 and 2011.

In 2006, the top 3 programs in Gomocup had a tournament with 3 of the top 10 players in Piškvorky online. There were 2 games between each pair of AI and human players. The result was one win, one draw and one loss for AIs, and the total score was 3:3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/results/ai-human-2006/|title=The 1st tournament AI vs. Human (November the 11th, 2006)|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the tournament was between the top 4 programs in Gomocup and 4 players at the top of the Czech Gomoku rating list. Similar to the 1st tournament, there were 2 games between each pair of AI. This time there were 3 draws and 1 win for AIs, and the total score was 5:3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.piskvorky.cz/clanky/zajimavosti-ze-sveta-piskvorek-a-renju/ai-vs-clovek-2011-2/|title=AI vs. Člověk 2011 {{!}} Česká federace piškvorek a renju|website=www.piskvorky.cz|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elo Rating ==
The [[Elo rating system]] for Gomocup was built in 2016 and calculated with all the historical tournament results ever since.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomocup.org/elo-ratings/|title=Elo Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=Gomocup|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rating is calculated with the open-source tool BayesElo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/|title=Bayesian Elo Rating|last=Coulom|first=Rémi|website=www.remi-coulom.fr|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a few parameters modified to get adapted to the Gomoku game. There is a rating list for each game rule. The Elo ratings are updated every year after the Gomocup tournament finishes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17016">'''Immunosenescence''' refers to the gradual deterioration of the [[immune system]] brought on by [[Ageing|natural age advancement]]. It involves both the host’s capacity to respond to infections and the development of long-term immune memory, especially by [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Local and systemic immune response in nursing-home elderly following intranasal or intramuscular immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine|journal=Vaccine|year=2003|first=M|last=Muszkat|author2=E. Greenbaum |author3=A. Ben-Yehuda |author4=M. Oster |author5=E. Yeu'l |author6=S. Heimann |author7=R. Levy |author8=G. Friedman |author9=Z.

== Overview of the age-associated decline in immune function ==
Immunosenescence is a multifactorial condition leading to many pathologically significant health problems in the aged population. Some of the age-dependent biological changes that contribute to the onset of immunosenescence are listed below:
* [[Hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC), which provide the regulated lifelong supply of [[leukocyte]] progenitors that are in turn able to differentiate into a diversity of specialised immune cells (including [[lymphocytes]], [[Antigen-presenting cell|antigen-presenting]] [[dendritic cells]] and [[phagocytes]]) diminish in their self-renewal capacity. This is due to the accumulation of [[Oxidative stress|oxidative damage]] to [[DNA]] by aging and cellular metabolic activity&lt;ref&gt;
High frequency electromagnetic waves such as gamma and xrays can penetrate and damage DNA.

* There is a notable decline in the total number of [[phagocytes]] in aged hosts, coupled with an intrinsic reduction of their [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neutrophil ageing and immunesenescence|journal=Mech Ageing Dev|year=2001|first=J.M.|last=Lord|author2=S.

As age advances, there is decline in both the production of new naive [[lymphocytes]] and the functional competence of memory cell populations. This has been implicated in the increasing frequency and severity of diseases such as [[cancer]], chronic inflammatory disorders, [[breakthrough infection]]s and [[autoimmunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Immunosenescence: deficits in adaptive immunity in elderly|journal=Tissue Antigens|year=2007|first=F.T.|last=Hakim|author2=R.E.

In addition to changes in immune responses, the beneficial effects of [[inflammation]] devoted to the neutralisation of dangerous and harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic [[pleiotropy]] theory of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06651.x|title=Inflamm-aging: An Evolutionary Perspective on Immunosenescence|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2000|first=C.|last=Franceschi |author2=M.

Although myeloid cell production does not seem to decline with age, [[macrophages]] become dysregulated as a consequence of environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Immunosenescence: a problem of lymphopoiesis, homeostasis, microenvironment, and signaling|journal=Immunological reviews|year=2005|first=J.|last=Cambier|volume=205|issue=|pages=5–6|id= |url=|accessdate=|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2005.00276.x|pmid=15882340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== T-cell functional dysregulation as a biomarker for immunosenescence ==
The functional capacity of [[T-cells]] is most influenced by the effects of aging. In fact, age-related alterations are evident in all stages of T-cell development, making them a significant factor in the development of immunosenescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=T cell function in the aged: Lessons learned from animal models|journal=Clinical and Applied Immunology Reviews|year=2006|first=P.-J|last=Linton|author2=J. Lustgarten |author3=M. Thoman |volume=6|issue=2|pages=73–97|id= |url=|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cair.2006.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After birth, the decline of T-cell function begins with the progressive [[involution (medicine)|involution]] of the [[thymus]], which is the organ essential for T-cell maturation following the migration of precursor cells from the bone marrow. This age-associated decrease of thymic [[Epithelium|epithelial]] volume results in a reduction/exhaustion on the number of [[thymocytes]] (i.e. pre-mature T-cells), thus reducing output of peripheral naïve T-cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thymic involution in aging|journal=J Clin Immunol|year=2000|first=R.|last=Aspinall|author2=D. Andrew|volume=20|issue=4|pages=250–256|id= |url=|accessdate=|doi=10.1023/A:1006611518223|pmid=10939712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reduction in the developmental potential of intrathymic T cell progenitors with age|journal=J Immunol|year=2004|first=H.|last=Min|author2=E.

Together with the age-related thymic involution, and the consequent age-related decrease of thymic output of new T cells, this situation leaves the body practically devoid of virgin T cells, which makes the body more prone to a variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Franceschi2000" /&gt; T-cell components associated with immunosenescence include:

'''inspectIT''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[application performance management]] (APM) tool, which enables the diagnosis, analysis and monitoring of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications. inspectIT is developed by NovaTec Consulting GmbH, an IT consulting company from [[Stuttgart]] ([[Germany]]), but it has been made open-source in August 2015.

== Functionality ==
inspectIT follows a "user-transaction-centered” approach whereby the focus is on the analysis of concrete user requests. For each request against a system which is supervised by inspectIT, a detailed [[Call graph|call tree]], named ''invocation sequence'', is constructed. The ''invocation sequences'' contain the exact execution times of all invocations of instrumented methods. Using this information, user requests can be analyzed and root causes of potential problems can be discovered. Also included in the ''invocation sequences'' are all requests against [[database]]s which can be used to detect and solve problems in the database access layer or certain queries.

Since version 1.8.1, inspectIT offers functionality for [[real user monitoring]] that records user interaction with, for example, a website or web-based application.

== Architecture ==
The architecture of inspectIT consists of three main components:
* '''inspectIT Agent''' - it is integrated into the system which should be supervised, collects diagnostic information of the integrated measuring points and sends the gathered data to the central ''inspectIT Server''. The agent is designed to introduce as little as possible [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] into the target system, in terms of CPU and memory usage.
* '''inspectIT Server''' (also called ''centralized measurement repository'' (CMR)) - it receives, processes and stores the diagnostic information sent by the inspectIT agents and provides it to the inspectIT user interface.
* '''inspectIT User Interface''' - it is an [[Eclipse (software)#Rich Client Platform|Eclipse RPC]] based application and enables the analysis of the diagnostic information provided by the ''inspectIT Server''.

== Functioning ==
During the Java class loading process of the [[Java virtual machine|JVM]], a Java-based agent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html|title=java.lang.instrument (Java 2 Platform SE 5.0)|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html|title=Java Platform SE 6|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is integrated into the class loading process which is able to intercept and modify the [[Java bytecode|Java Bytecode]] of loaded [[Java class file|classes]]. Contrary to profilers, inspectIT injects measurement points only at specific locations to keep the [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] of the measurements at a minimum. Using this approach, it allows the user to transparently inject measurement points into an application without adapting its [[source code]].

== History and Naming ==
The development of inspectIT started in the year 2005 under the name NovaSpy as [[Proprietary software|closed source software]]. It was renamed into inspectIT in 2008 and the first major release (version 1.0) has been released in March 2010. Since then, new versions have been released on a regular basis.

=== Open Source ===
On August 14, 2015, inspectIT has been made available as [[open-source software]] under the [[Apache License|Apache License, Version 2.0]] (ALv2).

== Background ==
{{See also|Neuroinformatics}}

A key element to successfully understanding the [[nervous system]] is the integration of [[neuroscience]] with [[information science]]s. The field that studies the nervous system, neuroscience, has responded to the fantastic challenge of understanding how our brain works with the use of the most sophisticated technologies, from studies on the [[genome]] to those on [[brain imaging]] of behaviour in humans and other species, under different functional states, and at all intervening analytical levels. This effort has resulted in large quantities of data, which are ever increasing at higher levels of complexity. The data produced are heterogeneous, coming from different levels of study and modalities of analysis. To rise to this challenge of integration, and to ensure efficient and maximum use of these data, it is now necessary to develop and create these shared resources: 
# neuroscience data and knowledge databases; 
# analytical and modelling tools; and
# computational models.
This challenge is being met through the merging of neurosciences with information science – the field of neuroinformatics.

== History ==
=== Genesis ===
The recommendation to coordinate international efforts in the new field of neuroinformatics was first made in the report on [[bioinformatics]] elaborated under the aegis of the then OECD Megascience Forum in 1998.&lt;ref name=OECD_Megascience-1999&gt;{{cite report |author=Megascience Forum Working Group on Biological Informatics |date=January 1999 |title=Final Report |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |pages=3–4, 49–50, 70–72 |url=https://space.incf.org/index.php/s/GuZbEX4ZNlLiq9P |via=ICNF ownCloud |access-date=19 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following extensive discussions in the Neuroinformatics Working Group of the Global Science Forum chaired by Dr. Stephen H. Koslow, the proposal to create an International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Council and a system of grant funding for neuroinformatics research was then presented in 2002.&lt;ref name=OECD_Global_Science-2002&gt;{{cite report |author=Global Science Forum Neuroinformatics Working Group |date=June 2002 |title=Report on Neuroinformatics |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |pages=5, 11–15, 46 |url=https://space.incf.org/index.php/s/2fVbs4bMY71vZVU |via=ICNF ownCloud |access-date=19 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was endorsed by OECD science ministers at their meeting in January 2004. Sixteen countries (Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Victoria, Australia), as well as the European Commission, then elaborated the working documents that form the legal basis for the INCF and the Programme in International Neuroinformatics (PIN).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Establishment ===

The conditions laid out for the creation of the INCF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incf.org|title=Incf {{!}} INCF|website=www.incf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; were met in July 2005, seven countries (the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) having signed the Understanding document and pledged their financial contribution.  A bid to host the INCF Secretariat was launched. Two proposals were received and, as instructed by the Governing Board, on November 3, the OECD&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/|title=OECD.org - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; convened a panel of experts to review and rank the proposals. The panel assigned the higher ranking to the Swedish proposal, and this recommendation was endorsed by the INCF Governing Board when it met at OECD headquarters on November 28.  Following extensive international discussions, the INCF was officially inaugurated in February 2007, with headquarters at the [http://ki.se/en/startpage Karolinska Institute] in Stockholm.

'''IObox Oy''' was a [[Finland|Finnish]] mobile and [[web portal]] operator.  Formed in 1999, the [[dot-com company]] ended up as part of Telefónica Mobile.

At a sale price of [[USD|$]]250m (€230m) in 2000, IObox represented the largest venture capital [[Venture capital financing#The Bridge/Pre-public Stage|exit]] in Finland until the sale of [[MySQL AB]] in 2008 for $1[[1000000000 (number)|bn]] (€670m).&lt;ref&gt;Holtron Ventures, [http://holtronventures.com/?p=18 We Did It Again!], 2008-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
IObox was founded in January 1999 by Jari Ovaskainen (formerly of [[Andersen Consulting]]) and Henry Nilert (formerly of [[Credit Suisse First Boston]]).  Ovaskainen sold his car and used other assets including his life-savings to raise $120,000.  A round of funding in the first month brought in €3.1m and the opening of a [[Helsinki]] office in [[Finland]] followed.&lt;ref name="hut"/&gt;

In November 2000, the office in [[London]], [[England]] opened.  Second round financing in December 2001 brought another €13m. In January 2000, after offices in [[Munich]] and [[Stockholm]] had opened, London become the main company headquarters.&lt;ref name="hut"/&gt;  IObox acquired ''Futuron Wireless Solutions'' and with an [[Oulu]] office opening in March 2000 had brought the staff count to 70 persons.

At the point of sale in July 2000, the company had grown to 100 employees.  This expanded further to beyond 200 employees by near the end of the same year.&lt;ref name="hut"/&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt; is 404....
In Red Herring nominated IObox alongside fellow Finnish company [[Nokia]], as two of their top 50 private companies despiting IObox being less than a year old.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redherring.com/about/release043000.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

== Products ==
IObox operated mobile and [[web portal]]s, having as many as three million users.&lt;ref&gt;Curriculum Vitae, [http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~moo/cv/CV%20-%20Mikko%20Ohtamaa%20-%202005.pdf Mikko Ohtamaa].&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the company operated [[brand]]ed portal sites for customers such as the Swedish communications company [[TeliaSonera|Telia]], using software written in [[Java EE]].

In February 2000 IObox announced ''Wapagotchi'', a [[digital pet]] similar to the briefly popular [[Tamagotchi]] style toys.  The user ("owner") would control their pet using [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] pages.  If the virtual pet was neglected, or hadn't been cared for enough, the owner would receive [[SMS]] notifications, for example, stating that the pet was "hungry".&lt;ref&gt;Website, [http://virtualpet.com/vp/media/mpets/mpets.htm Wireless virtual pets for Mobile Phones], subtitled "an industry study".&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time from July 2000, IObox offered UK consumers a [[SMS gateway#Direct-to-SMSC gateway|SMS-to-email]] gateway costing 6[[British one penny coin|p]] per email( termed ''"m-Mail"''), despite other companies already having offered such as service for free.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Register]], [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/07/10/click_here_to_send/ Click here to send an email on your bog-standard phone], 2000-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, an announcement was made along with provider [[BEA Systems]] that their "global wireless portal" had scaled to 3.5 million users and up to 4,000 simultaneous connections.&lt;ref&gt;BEA Systems Press [http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=pr00545.htm&amp;FP=/content/news_events/press_releases/2001 BEA Systems Supports Growth of Terra Mobile-iobox, Europe's Leading Mobile Portal], 2001-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only a third of the registered users had visited more than once, often only signing up for free credits.&lt;ref name="hut"/&gt;

== Ownership ==
The company was originally backed by several [[venture capital]]ists, including CapMan Plc&lt;ref&gt;CapMan Plc Group, [http://www.capman.com/En/Media/Releases2001/CapMan_Plc_Group_Financial_Statements_Bulletin_1_Jan_31_Dec_2000.htm Financial Statements Bulletin 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2000], 2001-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; (listed on the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]]).  CapMan and others disposed all 100% of IOBox to the Spanish organisation Terra Mobile in July 2000 (just 19 months after founding&lt;ref name="hut"&gt;[[Helsinki University of Technology]], B-to-B Case: [http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Opinnot/Tik-109.501/2000/raportti72.doc Iobox], 2000-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;) for €230[[million|m]] cash.&lt;ref&gt;ZDnet News, [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,2080404,00.htm Terra hits WAP scene with iobox buyout], 2000-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Terra Mobile was itself a joint operation of [[Telefónica]] and [[Terra Networks]].&lt;ref name="Telefonica-Mobile-Inc-Jun-2003-20-F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/923/119312503014220/filing-main.htm |title=Telefonica Mobile Inc, Form 20-F, Filing Date Jun 27, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the dissolution of IObox Oy prior to December 2002, Telefónica were forced to [[write off#Writedown|write-down]] the "[[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]" associated with the purchase to the tune of €154m&lt;ref name="Telefonica-Mobile-Inc-Jun-2003-20-F"/&gt;

== New Iobox (2008) ==
In early 2007, Finnish company [http://www.lapitor.fi Lapitor Oy] acquired a large number of the old &lt;code&gt;iobox.*&lt;/code&gt; domain names.  The new company announced its intention to try to "carry on from the point where Spaniards left Iobox in 2002".  Lapitor stated that it hoped to publish the new Iobox portal venture across twelve European countries.&lt;ref name="lapitor"&gt;Satojen miljoonien Iobox irtosi ilmaiseksi (in finnish), [http://www.ilkka.fi/Article.jsp?article=324828&amp;Title=Satojen+miljoonien+Iobox+irtosi+ilmaiseksi].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trademark ===
In January 2008, Lapitor managed to acquire the European-wide trademark for "iobox", saying that they paid nothing for the trademarks.  Telefónica had gained the original trademark as part of the €230m buy-out in 2002.  As Telefónica has not defended the original, Lapitor has started a process to attempt to cancel Telefónica's trademark.&lt;ref name="lapitor"/&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In the fall of 2011, Suomen Kierrätyskone Oy acquired the Iobox trademark (EU-wide trademark number 005806609) and a large number of associated domain names. A mail service that accepts mail addressed to those domains was brought up in the beginning of February 2012.  During the month, it has received approximately 200,000 attempts each day to send email to old iobox addresses.  In the end of the year the figure has climbed, with the highest per-day figures seen being close to 4 million.

The '''''Kitāb al-Hayawān''''' (كتاب الحيوان; English: ''Book of Animals'') is an [[Arabic]] translation in 19 treatises (''maqālāt'') of the following [[Aristotle's biology|zoological texts]] by [[Aristotle]]:

''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' : treatises 1-10&lt;br /&gt;
''[[On the Parts of Animals|De Partibus Animalium]]'' : treatises 11-14&lt;br /&gt;
''[[Generation of Animals|De Generatione Animalium]]'' : treatises 15-19

While the book is often attributed to [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq|Yahyà bin al-Bitrīq]], the translator is unknown. However, from certain oddities in the Arabic, it has been deduced that it is a translation of a lost [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The complete text is available only in [[manuscript]] form (in [[Tehran]]), but treatises 11-14 (''De Partibus'') have been edited as ''Ajzā’ al-hayawān (The Parts of Animals)''&lt;ref&gt;Edited by ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Badawī. Kuwait: Wakālat al-matbū‘āt, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and 15-19 (''De Generatione'') as ''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)'' (Ed. J. Brugman and H.J. Drossaart Lulofs. Leiden: Brill, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in philosophy==
The first known mention of the book appears in a text by the [[Arab]] philosopher [[Al-Kindī]] (d. 850). Ibn Sīnā ([[Avicenna]]) seems to have had direct knowledge of the book, as he paraphrased and commented upon the full text in his encyclopedic [[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifā’]]. In Spain, the 12th-century philosopher Ibn Bājja ([[Avempace]]) wrote on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione''. It has been remarked that one usually finds references to the ''Historia'' in the Eastern Islamicate world, while the other two books are generally referred to in the West, and in conformity to this pattern, Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), like Ibn Bājja, wrote commentaries on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione'' (see below), in which he criticizes Ibn Sīnā’s interpretations.

==References in zoography==
[[File:Al-Jahiz - pages from Kitaab al Hayawaan 3.jpg|thumb|Page from the Kitāb al-Hayawān by [[Al-Jahiz]].]]

''Kitāb al-hayawān'' was known at least indirectly to several important zoographers including [[Al-Jahiz|Al-Jāhiz]] (''Kitāb al-hayawān''), Al-Mas‘ūdī (''Murawwaj al-dhahab''), [[Al-Tawhidi|Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī]] (''Al-Imtā‘ wa al-mu’ānasa''), Al-Qazwīnī (''‘Ajā’ib al-makhlūqāt''), and Al-Damīrī (''Hayāt al-hayawān''). They may have known the Aristotelian ''Kitāb al-hayawān'' at second hand from Arabic compendiums of selected passages from the book. The only extant compendium is the ''Maqāla tushtamalu ‘à la fusūl min kitāb al-hayawān'', attributed (probably falsely) to Mūsà bin Maymūn ([[Moses Maimonides]]), and the Greek ''Compendium'' of [[Nicolaus Damascenus]] was at least partially available by the 11th century.

==In the Christian West==
Finally, [[Michael Scot]]’s early 13th-century [[Latin]] translation of the ''Kitāb al-hayawān'', ''De Animalibus'', is worthy of mention as the vehicle of transmission into Western Europe. It was alleged by [[Roger Bacon]] that Scot "had appropriated to himself the credit of translations which more properly belonged to one Andreas the Jew." This may mean that he had help with the Arabic manuscript, or that he worked fully or in part from a [[Judaeo-Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]] version. Scot's ''De Animalibus'' is available in a partial edition.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Michael. ''De Animalibus''. Vols 1-3. Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lek paradox''' is the conundrum of how additive or beneficial genetic variation is maintained in [[lek mating]] species, in the face of consistent female preferences, [[sexual selection]].  While many studies have attempted to explain how the lek paradox fits into [[natural selection|Darwinian theory]], the paradox remains.  Persistent female choice for particular male [[trait (biology)|trait]] values should erode [[genetic diversity]] in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists.&lt;ref name="indirect genetic effects"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Miller | first1=Christine | last2=Moore | first2=Allen | year=2007 | title=A potential resolution to the lek paradox through indirect genetic effects | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176171/pdf/rspb20060413.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=274 | issue=| pages=1279–1286 | pmc=2176171 | pmid=17341455 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This paradox can be somewhat alleviated by the occurrence of [[mutation]]s introducing potential differences, as well as the possibility that traits of interest have more or less favorable recessive [[alleles]].

The basis of the lek paradox is continuous genetic variation in spite of strong female preference for certain traits. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises. The first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity.&lt;ref name="Paradox 1" &gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kirkpatrick | first1=M | year=1982 | title=Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Female Choice | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=36 | issue=| pages=1–12 | doi=10.2307/2407961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female choice should lead to directional [[Fisherian runaway|runaway selection]], resulting in a greater prevalence for the selected traits. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival, as it decreases genetic variance and ensures that more offspring have similar traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kirkpatrick | first1=M. | last2=Ryan | first2=M. | year=1991 | title=The evolution of mating preferences and the paradox of the lek | url=| journal=Nature | volume=350 | issue=| pages=33–38 | doi=10.1038/350033a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection.

In a lekking reproductive system, what male sexual characteristics can signal to females is limited, as the males provide no resources to females or parental care to their offspring.&lt;ref name="paradox"&gt;Tomkins, Joseph L. [http://www.biology.leeds.ac.uk/staff/tbt/Papers/JLTetal_TREE04.pdf "Genic capture and resolving the lek paradox"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321002708/http://www.biology.leeds.ac.uk/staff/tbt/Papers/JLTetal_TREE04.pdf |date=2006-03-21 }}. ''Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution''. Vol.19 No.6 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that females gain indirect benefits from her choice in the form of “good genes” for her offspring.&lt;ref name="condition dependent traits"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rowe | first1=Locke | last2=Houle | first2=David | year=1996 | title=The lek paradox and the capture of genetic variance by condition dependent traits | jstor=50503| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=263 | issue=| pages=1415–1421 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothetically, in choosing a male that excels at courtship displays, females gain genes for their offspring that increase their survival or reproductive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].

[[Amotz Zahavi]] declared that male sexual characteristics only convey useful information to the females if these traits confer a handicap on the male.&lt;ref name="handicap principle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zahavi | first1=A | year=1975 | title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap | url=http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/other/Zahavi%20sexual%20selection%20handicap%20model%20signal.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=53 | issue=| pages=205–214 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 | pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, males could simply cheat: if the courtship displays have a neutral effect on survival, males could all perform equally and it would signify nothing to the females. But if the courtship display is somehow deleterious to the male’s survival—such as increased predator risk or time and energy expenditure—it becomes a test by which females can assess male quality. Under the [[handicap principle]], males who excel at the courtship displays prove that they are of better quality and genotype, as they have already withstood the costs to having these traits.&lt;ref name="handicap principle"/&gt; Resolutions have been formed to explain why strong female mate choice does not lead to runaway selection. The handicap principle describes how costly male ornaments provide females with information about the male’s inheritable fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Iwasa | first1=Y. | last2=Pomiankowski | first2=A. | last3=Nee | first3=S. | year=1991 | title=The Evolution of Costly Mate Preferences&amp;nbsp;II: The 'Handicap' Principle | journal=Evolution | volume=45 | issue=| pages=1431–1442 | doi=10.2307/2409890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The handicap principle may be a resolution to the lek paradox, for if females select for the condition of male ornaments, then their offspring have better [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].

One potential resolution to the lek paradox is Rowe and Houle's theory of condition-dependent expression of male sexually selected traits. Similar to the handicap principle, Rowe and Houle argue that sexually selected traits depend on physical condition. Condition, in turn, summarizes a large number of genetic loci, including those involved in [[metabolism]], [[muscle|muscular]] mass, nutrition, etc. Rowe and Houle claim that condition dependence maintains [[genetic variation]] in the face of persistent female choice, as the male trait is correlated with abundant genetic variation in condition.&lt;ref name="condition dependent traits"/&gt; This is the [[genic capture]] hypothesis, which describes how a significant amount of the genome is involved in shaping the traits that are sexually selected.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; There are two criteria in the genic capture hypothesis: the first is that sexually selected traits are dependent upon condition and the second is that general condition is attributable to high genetic variance.&lt;ref name="Rowe2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rowe | first1=L. | last2=Houle | first2=D. | year=1996 | title=The Lek Paradox and the Capture of Genetic Variance by Condition Dependent Traits |  journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume=236 | issue=| pages=1415–1421 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic variation in condition-dependent traits may be further maintained through mutations and environmental effects. [[Genotypes]] may be more effective in developing condition dependent sexual characteristics in different environments, while mutations may be deleterious in one environment and advantageous in another.&lt;ref name="paradox"/&gt; Thus genetic variance remains in populations through [[gene flow]] across environments or generation overlap. According to the genic capture hypothesis, female selection does not deplete the genetic variance, as [[sexual selection]] operates on condition dependence traits, thereby accumulating genetic variance within the selected for trait.&lt;ref name="Rowe2"/&gt; Therefore, females are actually selecting for high genetic variance.

In an alternate but non-exclusionary hypothesis, [[W. D. Hamilton]] and M. Zuk proposed that successful development of sexually selected traits signal resistance to [[parasites]].&lt;ref name="parasites"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hamilton | first1=W. D. |authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | last2=Zuk | first2=M. | year=1982 | title=Heritable true fitness and bright birds: A role for parasites? | url=http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/wkoenig/wicker/NB4340/Hamilton%20and%20Zuk%201982.pdf | journal=Science | volume=218 | issue=| pages=384–387 | doi=10.1126/science.7123238 | pmid=7123238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parasites can significantly stress their hosts so that they are unable to develop sexually selected traits as well as healthy males. According to this theory, a male who vigorously displays demonstrates that he has parasite-resistant genes to the females. In support of this theory, Hamilton and Zuk found that male sexual ornaments were significantly correlated with levels of incidence of six blood diseases in North American [[passerine]] bird species. The Hamilton and Zuk model addresses the lek paradox, arguing that the cycles of [[co-adaptation]] between host and parasite resist a stable equilibrium point. Hosts continue to evolve resistance to parasites and parasites continue to bypass resistant mechanisms, continuously generating genetic variation.&lt;ref name="parasites"/&gt; The [[genic capture]] and parasite resistance hypotheses could logically co-occur in the same population.

One resolution to the lek paradox involves female preferences and how preference alone does not cause a drastic enough directional selection to diminish the genetic variance in fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pomiankowski | first1=A | last2=Moller | first2=A P | year=1995 | title=A Resolution of the Lek Paradox | url=| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=260 | issue=| pages=21–29 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conclusion is that the preferred trait is not naturally selected for or against and the trait is maintained because it implies increased attractiveness to the male.&lt;ref name="Paradox 1" /&gt; Thus, there may be no paradox.

'''''Missio Dei''''' is a [[Latin]]  [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Theology|theological]] term that can be translated as the "[[w:Mission (Christian)|mission]] of God," or the "sending of God." It is a concept which has become increasingly important in [[missiology]] and in understanding the mission of the church since the second half of the 20th century. Some of its key proponents include [[David Bosch]], [[Lesslie Newbigin]], and [[Darrell Guder]].

==History==
In 1934, the German missiologist Karl Hartenstein first coined the term ''missio Dei'' to distinguish it from the ''missio ecclesiae'', that is, the mission of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartenstein|first=Karl|title=Wozu nötigt die Finanzlage der Mission|journal=Evangelisches Missions-Magazin|volume=79|year=1934|pages=217-229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars holds that this coinage, which can be traced as far back as [[Augustine]], had a strong trinitarian basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engelsviken |first1=Tormod |title=Mission Dei: The Understanding and Misunderstanding of a Theological Concept in European Churches and Missiology |journal=International Review of Mission |date=October 2003 |volume=92 |issue=367 |pages=481–497 |doi=10.1111/j.1758-6631.2003.tb00424.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language, it is argued, was picked up at the 1952 Willingen conference of the International Missionary Council (IMC) and developed theologically by Lutheran theologian, Georg Vicedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vicedom|first=Georg F.|title=The Mission of God: An Introduction to a Theology of Mission|trans-title=Missio Dei: Einführung in eine Theologie der Mission|translator1=Gilbert A. Thiele|translator2=Dennis Hilgendorf|location=Saint Louis|publisher=Concordia|year=1965|orig-year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, John Flett maintains that while Hartenstein did introduce the actual term ''missio Dei'', he did not locate that mission in the doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flett|first=John G.|title=The Witness of God: The Trinity, Missio Dei, Karl Barth and the Nature of Christian Community|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=Eerdmans|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reference to the Trinity appeared in the "American report," a study document prepared for the 1952 Willingen conference, under the leadership of Paul Lehmann and H. Richard Niebuhr.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier version of Niebuhr's position see, Niebuhr, H. Richard. “The Doctrine of the Trinity and the Unity of the Church.” Theology Today 3, no. 3 (1946): 371-84. For the text which informed the American report see, Niebuhr, H. Richard. “An Attempt at a Theological Analysis of Missionary Motivation.” Occasional Bulletin of Missionary Research 14, no. 1 (1963): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=October 2018}}
The "American report" suggested a link between revolutionary movements in history and "God's mission." Many of the later contentions with ''missio Dei'' stem from these origins, and especially the failure to ground the concept in a robust account of the Trinity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The acknowledged concerns with ''missio Dei'' also meant that reference to the concept went through a hiatus until it was given concise description by David Bosch. According to [[David J. Bosch]], "mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute of God]]. God is a [[missionary]] God."&lt;ref name="Bosch" /&gt; [[Jurgen Moltmann]] says, "It is not the church that has a mission of salvation to fulfill in the world; it is the mission of the Son and the Spirit through the Father that includes the church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jurgen Moltmann]], ''The Church in the Power of the Spirit: A Contribution to Messianic Ecclesiology'', London: SCM Press, 1977, 64&lt;/ref&gt; According to one opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the past half a century or so there has been a subtle but nevertheless decisive shift toward understanding mission as God’s mission. During preceding centuries mission was understood in a variety of ways. Sometimes it was interpreted primarily in soteriological terms: as saving individuals from eternal damnation. Or it was understood in cultural terms: as introducing people from East and the South to the blessings and privileges of the Christian West. Often it was perceived in ecclesiastical categories: as the expansion of the church (or of a specific denomination). Sometimes it was defined salvation-historically: as the process by which the world—evolutionary or by means of a cataclysmic event—would be transformed into the kingdom of God. In all these instances, and in various, frequently conflicting ways, the intrinsic interrelationship between christology, soteriology, and the doctrine of the Trinity, so important for the early church, was gradually displaced by one of several versions of the doctrine of grace … 

Mission was understood as being derived from the very nature of God. It was thus put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of ecclesiology or soteriology. The classical doctrine on the missio Dei as God the Father sending the Son, and God the Father and the Son sending the Spirit was expanded to include yet another “movement”: The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit sending the church into the world. As far as missionary thinking was concerned, this linking with the doctrine of the Trinity constituted an important innovation … 

Our mission has not life of its own: only in the hands of the sending God can it truly be called mission. Not least since the missionary initiative comes from God alone … 

Mission is thereby seen as a movement from God to the world; the church is viewed as an instrument for that mission. There is church because there is mission, not vice versa. To participate in mission is to participate in the movement of God’s love toward people, since God is a fountain of sending love.&lt;ref name="Bosch"&gt;[[David J. Bosch]], ''Transforming Mission'', Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1991, 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speaking on behalf of ''The Gospel and Our Culture Network'', Darrell Guder writes, "We have come to see that mission is not merely an activity of the church.  Rather, mission is the result of God’s initiative, rooted in God’s purposes to restore and heal creation.  ‘Mission’ means ‘sending,’ and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God’s action in human history.... We have begun to learn that the biblical message is more radical, more inclusive, more transforming than we have allowed it to be.  In particular, we have begun to see that the church of Jesus Christ is not the purpose or goal of the gospel, but rather its instrument and witness.... God’s mission is calling and sending us, the church of Jesus Christ, to be a missionary church in our own societies, in the cultures in which we find ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Darrell L. Guder (editor), ''Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America'', Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans Publishing, 1998, 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Hirsch]] believes the word missional "goes to the heart of the very nature and purpose of the church itself."  He continues, “So a working definition of missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world.  In other words, the church’s true and authentic organizing principle is mission.  When the church is in mission, it is the true church.  The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible.  The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus.  To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through God’s people.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hirsch]], ''The Forgotten Ways'', Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2006, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters states that the Bible claims “the end result of such ''missio Dei'' is the glorification of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”&lt;ref&gt;George W. Peters, ''A  Biblical Theology of Missions'', Chicago: Moody Press, 1972, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Major Motoko Kusanagi'''|草薙 素子|Kusanagi Motoko|lead=yes}} is the main [[protagonist]] in [[Masamune Shirow]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|anime]] and [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|manga]] series. She is a [[Cyborg|synthetic "full-body prosthesis" augmented-cybernetic human]] employed as the field commander of [[Public Security Section 9]], a fictional law-enforcement division of the Japanese [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]]. Being strong-willed, physically powerful, and highly intelligent, she is well known for her skills in deduction, hacking and military tactics.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Conception and creation==
Motoko Kusanagi's body was designed by [[Masamune Shirow]] to be a mass production model so she would not be conspicuous. Her electrical and mechanical system within is special and features parts unavailable on the civilian market. Shirow intentionally chose this appearance so Motoko would not be harvested for those parts.&lt;ref name="dh1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ghost in the Shell | publisher=Dark Horse | author=Masamune, Shirow | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character===
In the film adaptation, character designer and key animator supervisor Hiroyuki Okiura, made her different from her original manga counterpart stating, "Motoko Kusanagi is a cyborg. Therefore her body is strong and youthful. However her human mentality is considerably older than she looks. I tried to depict this maturity in her character instead of the original girl created by Masamune Shirow".&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Ghost in the Shell - Production Report | publisher=Production I.G | year=1996 | medium=DVD | location=DVD Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nearly all portrayals, Kusanagi is depicted as a self-made woman. She is a fiercely independent and capable leader who has proven herself under fire countless times; a [[feminist]] role-model, a female who equals and surpasses her male counterparts in fair comparison. The ''Stand Alone Complex'' and ''Arise'' television series include numerous scenes in which Kusanagi plays practical jokes on her men (Batou in particular) or sarcastically illustrates her cynical sense of superiority.

[[Kenji Kamiyama]] had a difficult time identifying her and could not understand her motives during the first season of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]''. Due to this, he created an episode in the second season where he recounted her past. He was then able to describe her as a human who was chosen to gain this superhuman power; she probably believes that she has an obligation to use that ability for the benefit of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/02_/s08_/index.html | title = Interview: Kenji Kamiyama | publisher = [[Production I.G]] | accessdate = November 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English voice actor and director [[Mary McGlynn]] states she loved playing the role of Motoko Kusanagi and described her as "someone [who] was that strong, and still kind of feminine at times, but also kick-ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lytherus.com/2011/10/01/ndk-2011-interview-with-anime-voice-actor-and-director-mary-elizabeth-mcglynn/ | title = NDK 2011: Interview with Voice Actor and Director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn!| publisher = Lytherus.com| accessdate = November 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abilities===
Computer technology has advanced to such a point that most people possess "cyberbrains"—a technological "organic-synthetic" [[user interface]] implant that allows their minds to interact with machines or networks around them. In some cases of extreme trauma, it’s possible to replace large segments of the brain and body with prosthetic counterparts. Major Motoko Kusanagi is one such person, living in a full-body prosthesis after an accident as a child; her only organic parts are her [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. Being physically locked in her mid-twenties, Kusanagi's current body is amongst the most advanced models on the market, possessing 16²/cm² skin tactile elements, meaning she has a greatly heightened sense of touch.

In every anime iteration, [[Section 9]] has been all-male excepting the Major who leads the team. The ''Arise'' series details Kusanagi forming the current team roster to her own specifications. Kusanagi demonstrates her superiority by being a woman commanding her male co-workers. She forms and leads Section 9 because she’s the most capable member of the team. 

Kusanagi is a leading expert in cyberbrain combative warfare. As the most heavily mechanized member of Section 9, she is regarded amongst her peers as the best melee fighter and the most skilled "hacker and net diver". Chief Aramaki described her abilities as "...rarer than ESP"; the kind of person that government agencies hire to assassinate without leaving a trace. Considered a "Wizard Class" [[grey hat]], her [[security hacker|computer security hacking]] skills allows her [[brain–computer interface]] consciousness in controlling two-external humanoid "drone"-robots remotely with the ability to move from host to host. Kusanagi repeatedly demonstrates ability to hack people's cyber-brains, allowing her to "see through their eyes", or even take control of their bodies altogether. As a cyborg, Kusanagi is able to perform numerous superhuman feats, such as superhuman strength, leaping between skyscrapers, advanced acrobatics, or shooting down a bullet after it was fired at mid-range.

===Background===
{{See also|World of Ghost in the Shell}}
Little is known of Motoko Kusanagi's early history. Only hints at some of her background, usually through flashbacks, and nearly always from the points of view of others; rarely from Kusanagi's herself. The ''Stand Alone Complex'' television series, establishes that Motoko Kusanagi has lived within cyborg “shells” practically since birth.&lt;ref&gt;Stand Alone Complex, episodes number 8 "The Fortunate Ones – MISSING HEARTS" and episodes number 37 "Kusanagi's Labyrinth – AFFECTION"&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arise'' video series confirms that Motoko Kusanagi earned her military rank “Major” by serving in the army. Motoko Kusanagi earned her reputation as “Fire Starter,” a master computer hacker, through years of experience and activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenation.net/blog/what-killed-ghost-in-the-shell/&lt;/ref&gt; Kusanagi is often portrayed wearing provocative dress and attire (or lack of attire) and experiments with "human vices" in an attempt to understand that part of her humanity, and in particular her [[femininity]].

Kusanagi's various incarnations in the different manga or movies or TV series all portray her differently. In the original manga, Kusanagi's portrayal differs from that of the film-versions; she has a much more slapstick, vivacious, and sexy personality. Since each of these have independent storylines, the physical and mental characteristics of Motoko Kusanagi has been modified in different ways to reflect the focus of the story; these changes are reflected in the different ways that artists draw her.

In the ''2nd Gig'' episode "Kusanagi's Labyrinth – AFFECTION" portrays a youthful Kusanagi was involved in a plane crash, the only other survivor of which was Hideo Kuze who later became a member of the "Individual Eleven". After spending an undefined period of time in a coma Kusanagi's "ghost" was transferred into a fully cybernetic-prosthetic body without her prior consent. After this she visited Hideo Kuze in hospital since he was still paralysed from the injuries he had suffered in the crash and eventually convinced him to undergo the cyberization procedure himself.

At the end of the series Kusanagi confessed that she couldn't remember what her real name was, indicating that Motoko Kusanagi is actually only a pseudonym as Chroma, Fire Starter or Mira Killian; just as Hideo Kuze's name is as well.

===Relationships===
In ''Ghost in the Shell'', Kusanagi participates in a lesbian sex splash panel, involving [[List of Ghost in the Shell characters|Kurutan and Ran]], and has a boyfriend. The unnamed boyfriend works for ''Section One'', and they have been dating for seven months; to which [[Batou]] considers this "a new record". In Ghost in the Shell S.A.C. 2nd GIG, Episode 17 – "DI Mother and Child – RED DATA", having taken an adolescent male to a hotel after rescuing him from [[yakuza]], both share the same bed for the night, with Motoko attempting to seduce the boy and to gain his trust. The boy asks Motoko if cyborgs can still have sex, to which Motoko responds "You care to find out?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex#DI:_Repaired_Mother-Child_Relationship.3B_RED_DATA|title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Wikiquote|website=en.wikiquote.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ghost in the Shell (2017)'' film displays a  scene in which the Kusanagi silently examines a human prostitute that deftly implies a fascination with what makes humans human. The scene provokes viewers Kusanagi’s sexual orientation, her interest in sex at all, and more importantly her curiosity about life and what exactly constitutes a living human.

Heterosexual "E-sex" is rather painful, as depicted in the splash panel. It is also an illegal act and lucrative "side business" for Motoko, as stated by Masamune Shirow in the back of the manga collection. "Same gender/sex" cyborg-compatibility are rarely an issue, as the user(s)' interfaced nervous systems allow shared simultaneous sensations; such intimate connections have the potential for serious medical complications for user(s) of "Opposing sex/gender" compatibility, as illustrated by the accidental arrival of Batou (who is male). &lt;!--Heterosexual e-sex is especially illegal, because such acts entail immense pain, caused by the fact that nerves stimulated by one user are stimulated simultaneously and blindly in another user. Homosexual e-sex is safe because the participants has the same body parts being stimulated (in Motoko's three-way panel, the fondling of a breast). When Batou accidentally crashes Motoko's panel while trying to contact her, he experiences intense pain since he is receiving stimulation for organs and bodily parts which he does not possess.--&gt; Shirow stated in his poster-book, ''[[Intron Depot 1]]'', that "I drew an all-girl orgy because I didn't want to draw some guy's butt." The lesbian sex splash panel was cut from the original American release of the manga, as it would have entailed giving the book an "adults only" rating. Ultimately, Shirow decided it wasn't important to the plot. In the second edition, released on November 17, 2004, the scene is completely unedited.

==Appearances==

===In print===

====Manga series====
Motoko is a commanding presence when on assignment, but also trades insults with her troops. She constantly calls Aramaki "Ape Face" as well as other members in [[Public Security Section 9]], and when the Puppet Master reveals the "Motokos" that exist in the minds of those who know her, Aramaki's "Motoko" is sticking her tongue out. She is much more light-hearted and immature in some occasions. Due to the Puppeteer case, she started to change and became much more serious.

In the sequel, ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface]]'', a person known as Motoko Aramaki appears. She identifies herself as containing "Motoko Kusanagi" elements, along with Project 2501, the Puppeteer. She is also identified as "Motoko 11" hinting that there is more than one.

A second character is also introduced in ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface'' named Millennium, who controls a group named "Stabat Mater" that is researching a process known as "Brain Expansion". This research is apparently called off after Millennium is taken over by Motoko Aramaki. At this time Millennium is revealed to be "'No. 20' (Millennium)," indicating that Millennium is another of the Motoko Kusanagi/Project 2501 hybrid entities.

===In film===

====Animated films====
In the 1995 animated film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' by [[Mamoru Oshii]], the Major's design is significantly different from her original manga appearance. Unlike her manga counterpart, the Major has an [[androgynous]] face and rarely shows emotion. Like the manga, Public Security Section 9 investigate the crimes of a genius hacker called the Puppet Master. Kusanagi is frequently portrayed in the film as contemplative and brooding, in contrast to the down-to-earth nature of her partner [[Batou]]. Since she has a full cybernetic body, she is not certain her "ghost" retains any humanity and speculates on the possibility that she is entirely synthetic, with artificially generated memories designed to fool her into thinking she was once human. Throughout the movie, she seeks to find answers to her questions and finally meets the Puppet Master, a rogue AI who became [[sentient]] and who is also looking for existential meaning. In the climax of the film, Kusanagi and the Puppet Master "merge" to form an entirely new entity that exists free of physical boundaries and can propagate itself through the Net.

In the 2004 follow-up ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'', picking up three years after the events of the original movie, the Major herself does not make any sort of appearance. Throughout the film, the Major makes her first "true" appearance in Kim's manor, where she breaks into the hallway component of Kim's looping false memories and inserts herself (represented by the little girl prosthetic body she inhabited at the end of the first movie), and providing clues to alert Batou to Kim's attempted "ghost-hack" on himself and Togusa. The Major's "ghost" eventually returns in person to help Batou on the Locus Solus [[gynoid]] factory ship. Using a satellite transmission, she attempts to download her "ghost" into one of the Hadaly gynoid production models—however, due to the insufficient memory of the gynoid's e-brain, she is only able to download a fraction of her full "ghost" into the doll. (She notes with marked disdain that the gynoid had barely enough memory for her combat protocols.) Her personality has not changed much from the first movie—she still retains her fondness for philosophy and her considerable skills in battle, though she has also gained the Puppet Master's formidable hacking abilities. In a climactic sequence, she tears apart her mechanical body in the process of opening the ship's CPU hatch in order to hack into it. After successfully locking down the ship and uncovering the truth behind the conspiracy, Kusanagi prepares to once again disappear into the Net, but reassures a despondent Batou that whenever he logs in, she will always be beside him.

====Live-action film====
In the 2017 [[DreamWorks Pictures]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' live-action movie directed by [[Rupert Sanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evry|first=Max|title=Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie Gets a Trailer, Images and a Release Date|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/625029-ghost-in-the-shell-the-new-movie-gets-a-trailer-images-and-a-release-date#l2jWgKRIdVCboPAr.99/|website=Comingsoon|date=October 22, 2015| accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scarlett Johansson]] plays Motoko,&lt;!--Do not add your personal opinions on the matter here.

It is revealed at the end of the film that she was originally a teenage Japanese girl and activist named Motoko Kusanagi (portrayed by Kaori Yamamoto) who had run away from home one year prior to the events of the film. While living with other critics of cyborg technology in what is referred to as the Lawless Region, she is kidnapped by agents of the Hanka Robotics corporation, who perform experiments upon her and place her brain inside a cybernetic body. In effect, this makes her the first full-body cyborg to be successfully developed. Upon awakening inside her new body, Kusanagi is told that her name is Mira Killian and that her family was killed in a terrorist attack. She is also given false memories and subsequently employed by Section 9. Mira later discovers the secret behind her creation from the film's initial antagonist Kuze, who also underwent experimentation, as well as Dr. Ouelet, who played a primary role in developing her prosthetic body. With the help of Section 9, she consents to having Cutter, the Hanka executive trying to murder her, killed by her boss, Aramaki.

===In television===

====''Stand Alone Complex'' series====
[[File:Motoko Outfits.JPG|thumb|Motoko Kusanagi in her JGSDF [[khaki]] military uniform and form fitting combat suit]]

The Major retains much of her personality from the manga in the anime series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' and its followup ''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG]]'', although she is not disrespectful toward the Chief like she is in the manga. As in the manga and unlike the movies, where she had black hair and blue-grey eyes, she now has blue-purple hair and red-violet eyes. Throughout the series, The Major maintains her signature commanding presence and authority. Among the various members of Section 9, Kusanagi is usually the one Chief [[Daisuke Aramaki|Aramaki]] singles out to accompany him on official and off the record business. Kusanagi's personal life is not shown much in the first season. She underwent cyberization at a very early age and had trouble adapting to the use of her body which resulted in her inadvertently breaking one of her favorite dolls. She keeps a wrist watch as proof of her past.

In the first season, Kusanagi started questioning the use of the [[Tachikoma]] sentient tanks, due to them showing signs of individuality and curiosity not suited for combat. Ultimately, she decides to have them stripped of their weaponry and sent back to the lab that manufactured them for analysis and further work. When the Tachikoma sacrificed themselves to save Batou, Major Kusanagi understands that she was wrong in halting the usage of the Tachikoma and proposes that they might have evolved to have ghosts themselves.

In the second season her past was revealed. She was once a little girl who had been in a plane crash causing her to be in a coma. A boy who was also a victim of the plane crash continuously made origami cranes using only his left hand, as much of his body was paralyzed in the accident, in hopes of giving them to her when she woke up. Motoko was eventually taken away when medical complications occurred. The boy thought she had died, but she was actually being cyberized and given a full prosthetic body. When she returned to see the boy, the boy did not recognize her and ignored her. When she left the hospital, the boy realized she was the girl in the coma and made a decision to get cyberized and look for her, but he never saw her again. Throughout the second season, the Major and Section 9 go against a terrorist group called "The Individual Eleven". Believing it to be another ''stand alone complex'' they unwillingly teamed up with Kazundo Gouda in order to figure out their motive. When the 11 leaders of the individual eleven reveal themselves, they all kill each other except for Hideo Kuze. It was later revealed that Hideo Kuze was the little boy who Motoko once knew as a child; this discovery caused her some emotional confusion.

In the ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Solid State Society]]'' OVA, the Major has left Section 9 for two years and does not appear much in the first half of the film. She first appears on a building jumping off into the darkness. She shows up later as Chroma, to warn Batou to stay away from the "Solid State Society". She returns to her normal body after "Chroma" re-stores herself in the recharging chamber. She is suspected of being the Puppeteer, but is no longer suspected when she rescues Togusa from a (coerced) suicide attempt. She leads Section 9 on a raid to find the Puppeteer. At the end of Solid State Society, she repeats her famous line, "The net is truly vast and infinite."

====''Arise'' series====
In the ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise]] (2013)'' OVA series, Motoko is completely redesigned from her previous incarnations, as are all members of the main character cast. Her cybernetic body is shown as far younger in appearance and shorter in height to other versions, resembling a teenager or young adult and not much taller than Chief Aramaki. Her hair is blue and cut in a close, straight [[Bangs (hair)|bang]] form, and she is usually shown wearing full red leather pants and jackets and high heel boots.

===In video games===
Motoko is a player character in ''[[Ghost in the Shell (video game)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' (1997) for the [[PlayStation]], ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (PS2)|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' (2004) for the [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (PSP)|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' (2005) for the [[PlayStation Portable]], and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online]]'' (2016) for [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Critical reception==
Motoko Kusanagi was well received by media. Motoko ranked 13th in [[IGN]]'s list of the top anime characters of all time in 2009, commenting that "though she may be cool, professional, and mostly artificial, she's unquestionably human, and following her adventures through ''Ghost in the Shell'' was never less than fascinating".&lt;ref name="IGN-Top-25"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/21/top-25-anime-characters-of-all-time?page=3| title = Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time| publisher = IGN| accessdate = 2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IGN ranked her as the 11th greatest anime character of all time, saying that "Motoko was a stunning example of a strong female character that didn't need to have her feminism make a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/04/top-25-greatest-anime-characters?page=3 | title=Top 25 Greatest Anime Characters | author=Isler, Ramsey | date=February 4, 2014 | publisher=IGN | accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick L Tucker of ''THEM'' noted that the Stand Alone Complex version was easier to get attached to over her film counterpart due to her design and personality.&lt;ref name="THEM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=611|title=Review of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|last=Tucker|first=Derrick|work=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motoko's female identity and appearance is countered by the autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a "male" cyborg body which cannot menstruate.&lt;ref name=Orbaugh2 /&gt;{{refn|group=note|The English dubbed version changes the line to "Must be a loose wire." Orbaugh described this change as "sanitized".&lt;ref name=Orbaugh2 /&gt;}} The original film depicts Motoko's identity and ontological concerns with and ends with the evolution of the being, resulting in full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master.&lt;ref name="Orbaugh2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.depauw.edu/site/sfs/backissues/88/orbaugh.html | title=Sex and the Single Cyborg: Japanese Popular Culture Experiments in Subjectivity | publisher=Science Fiction Studies | work=Volume 88 | date=November 2002 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Orbaugh, Sharalyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The juxtaposition, in the first five minutes of the film, of her reference to menstruation with the scenes of her cyborgian replication, immediately underscores the fact that this film's theme is the problematic of reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject."&lt;ref name=Orbaugh2 /&gt;}} Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is "overtly feminine, and clearly non-female".&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jetpress.org/v20/corbett.htm | title=Beyond Ghost in the (Human) Shell | work=Journal of Evolution and Technology  -  Vol. 20  Issue 1 | date=March 2009 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | author=Corbett, Austin | pages=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
'''Negligent homicide''' is a criminal charge brought against a person who, through [[criminal negligence]], allows another person to die.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the crash of [[Aeroperu]] [[Aeroperu Flight 603|Flight 603]] near Lima, Peru. The accident was caused by a piece of duct tape that was left over the [[static ports]] (on the bottom side of the fuselage) after cleaning the aircraft, which led to the crash. An employee had left the tape on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World News Briefs; $29 Million for Victims Of 1996 Peru Air Crash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/22/world/world-news-briefs-29-million-for-victims-of-1996-peru-air-crash.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|agency=Reuters|publisher=New York Times|date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was charged with negligent homicide. Other times, an intentional killing may be negotiated down to the lesser charge as a compromised resolution of a murder case, as in the case of former UFC fighter [[Gerald Strebendt]]'s intentional shooting of an unarmed man after a traffic altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Man who shot and killed motorist pleads guilty to lesser charge|url = http://www.kval.com/news/local/Man-who-shot-and-killed-motorist-pleads-guilty-to--304599511.html|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, all [[U.S. state|states]] define negligent homicide by [[statute]], often defining the offense as [[Manslaughter (United States law)#Involuntary_manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; Negligent homicide may be a [[lesser included offense]] to [[First degree murder|first]] and [[second degree murder]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Saunders v.

[[Ant]]s are simple animals and their behavioural repertory is limited to somewhere between ten and forty elementary behaviours. This is an attempt to explain the different '''''patterns of [[self-organization]] in ants'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rennard.org/alife/english/antstxt/antstxtgb.html Social insects and self-organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ants as complex systems==
Ant colonies are self-organized systems: complex collective behaviors arise as the product of interactions between many individuals each following a simple set of rules, not via top-down instruction from elite individuals or the queen. No one worker has universal knowledge of the colony's needs; individual workers react only to their local environment. Because of this, ants are a popular source of inspiration for design in software engineering, robotics, industrial design, and other fields involving many simple parts working together to perform complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, C. T., Clark, M. R., Moore, D., &amp; Overson, R. P. (2010). Social insects inspire human design. Biology Letters, 6(4431-433).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular current model of self-organization in ants and other social insects is the response threshold model. A threshold for a particular task is the amount of stimulus, such as a pheromone or interactions with other workers, necessary to cause the worker to perform the associated task. A higher threshold requires a stronger stimulus, and thus translates into less preference for performing a specific task. Different workers have different thresholds for different tasks, allowing certain workers to function as specialists that preferentially perform one or more tasks. Threshold levels can be affected by several factors: worker age, since workers frequently switch from within-nest work to outside-nest work with age;&lt;ref name="Moron D. 2008 pp. 345-350"&gt;Moron D., Witek M., Woyciechowski M.  Division of labour among workers with different life expectancy in the ant Myrmica scabrinodis  (2008)  Animal Behaviour,  75  (2) , pp. 345-350.&lt;/ref&gt; size, since larger workers often perform different tasks, such as defense or seed processing; caste; health, since injuries can encourage young workers to switch to outside-nest work earlier;&lt;ref name="Moron D. 2008 pp. 345-350"/&gt; or be randomly distributed. As demand for a task increases, so does the proportion of workers whose thresholds are met; as demand decreases, fewer workers' thresholds are met and fewer workers are allocated to that task. In this way, simple individual rules allow for the regulation of work on a large scale in diverse settings. This system can also evolve in response to different environments and life history strategies, leading to the immense variation observed in ants.

==Bifurcation==
This is an instant transition of the whole system to a new stable pattern when a threshold is reached.  [[Bifurcation theory|Bifurcation]] is also known as multi-stability in which many stable states are possible.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Detrain, C., and J. L. Deneubourg. 2006. "[http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/use/publications/JLD/221.pdf Self-Organized Structures in a Superorganism: Do Ants "Behave" Like Molecules?]" ''Physics of Life Reviews'' ({{ISSN|1571-0645}}). 3, no. 3: 162-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of pattern types:
# Transition between disordered and ordered pattern
# Transition from an even use of many food sources to one source.
# Formation of branched nest galleries.
# Group preference of one exit by escaping ants.
# Chain formation of mutual leg grasping.

==Synchronization==
Oscillating patterns of activity in which individuals at different activity levels stimulate one another emerging from mutual activation.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Examples of pattern types:
# Short scale rhythms arising from mechanical activation from physical contact.
# Long scale rhythms in which temporal changes in food needs and larvae stimulate changes in the reproductive cycle.

==Self organized waves==
Traveling waves of chemical concentration or mechanical deformation.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Examples of pattern types:
# Alarm waves propagated by physical contact.
# Rotating trails from spatial changes in food resources acting on trail laying activity.

==Self-organized criticality==
[[Self-organized criticality]] is an abrupt disturbance in a system resulting from a buildup of events without external stimuli.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Examples of pattern types:
#Abrupt changes in feeding activity.
#Mechanical grasping of legs forming ant droplets.

==Family Origins==

"The van Rheedes are one of the old families of Europe, descending from Bitter Van Reede, mentioned between 1344 and 1372, who himself was probably descendent of Wernerus de Rethe, knight, mentioned between 1223 and 1236. Godard VAN Reede (10th generation) accompanied William III of Orange to England and became Earl of Athlone on 14th March 1691 (branch extinct 7 Jan 1897). Another branch, Van Reede de Parkeren en Aa, became extinct in 1879. The Van R(h)eede van Oudsthoorns are, therefore, the only surviving branch of the family, both in the Netherlands and in South Africa. Van Ooudsthoorn was added to the original surname of Van Reede because for a period they were squires of that village in Holland.

After the Napoleonic wars and the establishment of a monarchy in the Netherlands, the old nobility of the family, and the title of Baron, was confirmed by Royal Decrees of 2nd April and 14th June 1822."&lt;ref&gt;Heraldry of South African Families / Coats of arms, crests, ancestry by C.PAMA/ A.

'''''Pithovirus''''', first described in a 2014 paper, is a genus of [[giant virus]] known from one species, '''''Pithovirus sibericum''''', which infects [[amoeba]]s.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yong |first=Ed |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14801 |title=Giant virus resurrected from 30,000-year-old ice |journal=Nature |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2014"&gt;{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Morelle |title=30,000-year-old giant virus 'comes back to life' |date=3 March 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26387276 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[base pair|double-stranded]] DNA virus, and is a member of the [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] [[clade]]. The 2014 discovery was made when a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old [[ice core]] harvested from [[permafrost]] in [[Siberia]], Russia.

==Description==
The genus name ''Pithovirus'', a reference to large storage containers of ancient Greece known as [[pithos|pithoi]], was chosen to describe the new species. A specimen of ''Pithovirus'' measures approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] (1500 [[nanometre|nm]]) in length and 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm (500&amp;nbsp;nm) in diameter, making it the largest virus yet found. It is 50% larger in size than the [[Pandoraviridae]], the previous largest known viruses,&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient "Giant Virus" Revived From Siberian Permafrost |work=National Geographic |date=3 March 2014 |last=Sirucek |first=Stefan |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140303-giant-virus-permafrost-siberia-pithovirus-pandoravirus-science/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is larger than ''[[Ostreococcus]]'' the smallest eukaryotic cell, although ''Pandoravirus'' has the largest viral genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 [[megabase]]s of [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="Brumfiel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/18/203298244/worlds-biggest-virus-may-have-ancient-roots |title=World's Biggest Virus May Have Ancient Roots |work=National Public Radio |date=18 July 2013 |last=Brumfiel |first=Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pithovirus'' has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end. Internally, its structure resembles a [[honeycomb]].&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

The [[genome]] of ''Pithovirus'' contains 467 distinct [[gene]]s, more than a typical virus but far fewer than the 2556 putative protein-coding sequences found in ''[[Pandoravirus]]''.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; Thus, its genome is far less densely packed than any other known virus. Two-thirds of its [[protein]]s are unlike those of other viruses. Despite the physical similarity with ''Pandoravirus'', the ''Pithovirus'' genome sequence reveals that it is barely related to that virus, but more closely resembles members of ''[[Marseilleviridae]]'', ''[[Megaviridae]]'', and ''[[Iridoviridae]]''.&lt;ref name="Virology Blog"/&gt; These families all contain large [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] viruses with DNA genomes. The ''Pithovirus'' genome has 36% [[GC-content]], similar to the ''Megaviridae'', in contrast to greater than 61% for pandoraviruses.&lt;ref name="Legendre2014"/&gt;

===Replication===
''Pithovirus''' [[genome]] is one circular, double-stranded DNA ([[dsDNA]]) chromosome of about 610,000 [[base pair]]s (bp), encoding approximately 467 [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs), which translate into 467 different proteins.&lt;ref name='SIB'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/4237.html |title= Pithovirus sibericum |accessdate= 2014-03-10 |work= Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genome encodes all the proteins needed to produce [[mRNA]]; these proteins are present in the purified virions.&lt;ref name="Virology Blog"/&gt; ''Pithovirus'' therefore undergoes its entire replication cycle in its host's [[cytoplasm]], rather than the more typical method of taking over the host's nucleus.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virology Blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coghlan"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Coghlan |title=Biggest-ever virus revived from Stone Age permafrost |date=3 March 2014 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25151-biggestever-virus-revived-from-stone-age-permafrost.html |work=NewScientist |archivedate=2014-03-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305155750/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25151-biggestever-virus-revived-from-stone-age-permafrost.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
''Pithovirus sibericum'' was discovered in a 30,000-year-old sample of [[Siberia]]n [[permafrost]] by Chantal Abergel and Jean-Michel Claverie of [[Aix-Marseille University]].&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pappas |first=Stephanie |url= https://news.yahoo.com/frozen-giant-virus-still-infectious-30-000-years-173243936.html |title=Frozen Giant Virus Still Infectious After 30,000 Years |work=Yahoo News |date=16 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus was discovered buried {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} below the surface of a late [[Pleistocene]] sediment.&lt;ref name="BBC 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virology Blog"&gt;{{cite news |first=Vincent |last=Racaniello |title=Pithovirus: Bigger than Pandoravirus with a smaller genome |date=4 March 2014 |url=http://www.virology.ws/2014/03/04/pithovirus-bigger-than-pandoravirus-with-a-smaller-genome/ |work=Virology Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found when riverbank samples collected in 2000 were exposed to [[amoeba]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news |title=Out of Siberian Ice, a Virus Revived |work=The New York Times |date=3 March 2014 |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/out-of-siberian-ice-a-virus-revived.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amoebas started dying and when examined were found to contain giant virus specimens. The authors said they got the idea to probe permafrost samples for new viruses after reading about an experiment that revived a similar aged seed of ''[[Silene stenophylla]]'' two years earlier.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; The ''Pithovirus'' findings were published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in March 2014.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;&lt;ref name="Legendre2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1320670111 |title= Thirty-thousand-year-old distant relative of giant icosahedral DNA viruses with a pandoravirus morphology |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

Although the virus is harmless to humans, its viability after being frozen for millennia has raised concerns that global [[climate change]] and [[tundra]] drilling operations could lead to previously undiscovered and potentially pathogenic viruses being unearthed.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; However, other scientists dispute that this scenario poses a real threat.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

==Evolution==

The [[Mutation rate|rate of mutation]] of the genome has been estimated to be 2.23 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; subsitutions/site/year.&lt;ref name=Duchêne2018&gt;Duchêne S, Holmes EC (2018) Estimating evolutionary rates in giant viruses using ancient genomes. Virus Evol 4(1):vey006. doi: 10.1093/ve/vey006&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have suggested that these viruses evolved at least hundreds of thousands of years ago.

==Other viruses in this genus==
A second virus in this genus, ''Pithovirus massiliensis'', has been isolated.&lt;ref name=Levasseur2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levasseur A, Andreani J, Delerce J, Bou Khalil J, Robert C, La Scola B, Raoult D |title=Comparison of a modern and fossil Pithovirus reveals its genetic conservation and evolution |journal=Genome Biol Evol |volume= 8|issue= |pages= 2333–9|date=July 2016 |pmid=27389688 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evw153 |pmc=5010891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison of the genes between the two species suggests a mutation rate of 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; per life.

Born at [[Torringford (now part of Torrington), Connecticut]], his father was [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] minister Samuel John Mills (1768–1833) and mother was Esther Robbins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Annals of the American Pulpit: Trinitarian Congregational |author1= William Buell Sprague |author2= Noah Porter |chapter= Samuel John Mills |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KBESAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA672 |volume=1  |year=1857 |publisher=Robert Carter and brothers |pages= 672–677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He attended [[Williams College]] in [[Massachusetts]] and there organized the prayer group that held the [[Haystack Prayer Meeting|Haystack prayer meeting]].  He entered [[Andover Theological Seminary]] in 1810, and was licensed to preach in 1812.  While he was one of the group that led to the formation of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] his missionary service was confined to the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley.  He suggested the formation of a National Bible Society.  In May, 1816, thirty-five different bible societies met at New York and organized the [[American Bible Society]].  He also played a leading role in the formation of the [[American Colonization Society]] in 1817.

In 1818, following a brief stay in England, he sailed to the west coast of [[Africa]] to purchase land for the American Colonization Society, then embarked for the [[United States]] on May 22, and died at sea.  His associate, Dr. [[Robert Finley]], the founder of the ''National Colonization Society'' had died in 1817.

'''Sauron''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. An enemy of the [[X-Men]], Sauron is the [[alter ego]] of physician '''Karl Lykos'''. In his initial appearances Karl Lykos was portrayed as an evil man and Sauron was simply Lykos in a different physical form, but later stories increasingly depicted Sauron as sharing a [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll and Hyde]] relationship with Lykos. He is an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who resembles a [[humanoid]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'' after feeding. He often inhabits the hidden prehistoric jungle of the [[Savage Land]].

==Creation and conception==
The character was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Neal Adams]], though the two differ in their accounts of which of them were responsible for specific aspects of the character.&lt;ref name="OriLegends"&gt;Cronin, Brian (11 February 2010). [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/11/comic-book-legends-revealed-247/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #247], [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt; He first fully appeared as Sauron in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #60 (September 1969).

Thomas and Adams originally envisioned Sauron as a bat-like creature, but when they consulted with the [[Comics Code Authority]], they were told that an [[energy vampire]] with a bat body might fall under the Code's prohibition on the use of [[vampire]]s.&lt;ref name="ThomasMania"&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = '60s Mutant Mania: The Original Team | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get around this problem, Thomas and Adams tweaked his appearance to that of the most bat-like animal they could think of—a [[pterodactyl]]—which in turn led them to have Sauron inhabit the hidden prehistoric jungle of the [[Savage Land]].&lt;ref name="OriLegends" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThomasMania" /&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Karl Lykos was the son of an explorer's guide. As a teenager, he accompanied his father to [[Tierra del Fuego]] as the elder Lykos guided a wealthy client named Mr. Anderssen and Anderssen's young daughter, Tanya. While defending Tanya from mutant pterodactyls, Karl was bitten by one of the creatures. During his recovery, he discovered that he could now drain the life-force of other organisms. He found himself repeatedly tempted to use his new power, feeling that he needed to drain life energy from other humans or animals to survive.&lt;ref name="X-Men' 1969"&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #60 (September 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Karl's father died, Mr. Anderssen took Karl into his home in thanks for rescuing Tanya. As the years passed, Karl and Tanya fell in love, but Tanya's wealthy father would not allow her to date Karl because of his lack of wealth. In an effort to win Mr. Anderssen's support, Karl went to medical school and became a physician, geneticist, and hypnotherapist. He treated patients through hypnosis, but secretly robbed them of energy at the same time.&lt;ref name="X-Men' 1969" /&gt;

Dr. Lykos became a colleague of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], and first encountered the X-Men when they sought treatment for [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]. Absorbing Havok's mutant energy transformed him into a vampiric, pterodactyl-like monster with human intelligence and superhuman hypnotic powers. He named himself Sauron, after [[Sauron|J.R.R. Tolkien's villain]] (also reminiscent of the word ''saurus'', [[Latin]] for lizard),&lt;ref name="X-Men' 1969"/&gt; and battled the X-Men, as a would-be conqueror.&lt;ref name="X-Men #61 October 1969"&gt;''X-Men'' #61 (October 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; When he realized that his transformation would threaten Tanya, he fled to [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Without energy to absorb, Sauron turned back into Karl. When Tanya tracked him down, Karl threw himself off a cliff to avoid harming her.&lt;ref name="X-Men #61 October 1969"/&gt;

Karl was presumed dead, but had survived unconscious on a ledge below. He journeyed to the [[Savage Land]] and survived in human form by only draining less developed animals. He befriended [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and used his medical skills over many months to care for Ka-Zar's allies. But when several X-Men were stranded in the Savage Land, Lykos was overwhelmed with the desire to absorb the powerful life energy of mutants. He transformed into Sauron once again after absorbing [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s energy.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #114 (October 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; He reverted to human form during a battle with the X-Men, and Ka-Zar explained that Lykos was an ally.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #115 (November 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanya learned that Karl had survived the leap from the cliff. She joined [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] on a journey to find Karl in the Savage Land. They found Karl, however the [[Savage Land Mutates]] used a Genetic Transformer to mutate Angel, Spider-Man and Tanya into animal-like forms. The destruction of the machine forced Lykos to drain energy from the three in an attempt to restore their true forms. Although his gambit succeeded, he subsequently reverted to his Sauron form and joined the Mutates and [[Zaladane]]. The X-Men traveled to the Savage Land, and Sauron helped to capture them. However, the X-Men escaped and defeated Sauron and the Mutates. They brought Lykos back to the United States, and at the [[X-Mansion]] Professor X seemingly cured Lykos of his condition. Karl and Tanya decided to resume their relationship and a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Lykos was again transformed into Sauron when the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] used a device of his own design to force Lykos to drain the life energy of Tanya, which killed her in the process. Sauron then joined the Toad's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], despite the fact that he is not a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. Alongside them, he battled [[X-Force]], and slew [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. Sauron was apparently shot dead by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and his body was thrown by Cable to the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #5-11 (December 1991-June 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron was later revealed to have survived the gunshot wound, and battled [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #82&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron went on to menace the X-Men and other heroes on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #69-71 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Sauron had the Savage Land Mutates kidnap Havok, hoping to use his energy to satiate his hunger. When his teammates Cyclops, Phoenix, and Polaris came to the rescue, Sauron had both Summers brothers placed in an energy-transferring machine, and the mix of energy mutated Sauron even further, making him larger and stronger than ever. Phoenix tried to engage Sauron on the Astral Plane, but it was Lykos' personality who prevailed, making a suicide leap into the abyss of his own mind, taking his hated alter ego with him. As a result, Sauron's mind appeared to be stuck in an animalistic state.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Unlimited'' #06&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauron became a prisoner of the Weapon X program jumpstarted by director [[Malcolm Colcord]]. Being held there against his will, Sauron started up a revolution with fellow agent [[Brent Jackson]] and dethroned Colcord as director, giving that position to Jackson. Sauron in return became a more powerful villain on the team, but vanished after Weapon X rival [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|John Sublime]] launched an attack on Weapon X, and the group had to go underground.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After being imprisoned in the Raft for refusing to participate in any more Weapon X assignments, Sauron escaped during a jailbreak concocted by the Skrulls. For a time the Avengers believed he and the Mutates were responsible for the breakout, and pursued him to the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron and his allies there briefly held the new team of Avengers hostage, but the team freed itself thanks to [[Iron Man]]'s voice-activated armor, and were about to interrogate him, when he was shot through the head by the second [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow]]. Sauron had absorbed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s regenerative healing factor and recovered from his injury, just in time to be soundly defeated by the New Avengers. He was taken back into custody, but not before returning the favor to Black Widow by burning her with his fiery breath. Sauron was placed in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody and [[Maria Hill]] planned to return him to [[Weapon X]].&lt;ref name="NE6"&gt;''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauron allied with Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], [[Zabu]], and the natives when the Skrulls were invading the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #41&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron was among the villains analyzed by [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] for [[Norman Osborn]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign Files''&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron later had a fight with Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''Rampaging Wolverine'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibius later tells Sauron and the other Savage Land Mutates that Magneto's Asteroid M has risen from the sea, but they didn't want to go find him. Worm took control of Barbarus, Lupo, and Sauron and commandeered a ship to go find Magneto. When threatened by the Japanese military, Sauron attacked an armored car, causing an international incident. Cannonball, Sunspot and Warlock investigated and found the Savage Land Mutates on the deck of the ship. Cannonball managed to defeat Sauron while the other New Mutants defeated the Savage Land Mutates. Upon learning why the Savage Land Mutates were on the ship, Karma told Worm, Sauron, Barbarus and Lupo that they were in charge of Asteroid M and Magneto. Worm then orders the Savage Land Mutates to return to the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 4 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon becoming the new leader of the Japanese underworld, Sabretooth held a party that Sauron attended with other enemies of Wolverine. Wolverine arrived and beat them up.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #304&lt;/ref&gt;

Kade Kilgore of the seventh incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] recruited Sauron to become a staff member at the Hellfire Academy.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauron later collaborates with [[Stegron]] in a plan to turn humanity into dinosaurs where they fought Spider-Man and the mutant students from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The duo's plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their mutual attraction to Shark Girl, who caused their powers to neutralize each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 10 December 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 28 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lykos returns working in a military laboratory to enhance his powers, until one of his colleagues is contacted by the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; Now able to store mutant energy to trigger his transformations at will, Lykos turns into Sauron and attacks the vigilante, but although he wounds the man the Spider came to the base to collect, Sauron is defeated and webbed up to be taken away.&lt;ref&gt;''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
In human form Karl Lykos is a normal human, although an accomplished medical doctor, geneticist, and psychotherapist employing hypnotism. He possesses an M.D. and Ph.D. in genetics and psychology.

As the result of mutation through infection with a genetic virus by mutant pteranodons, Lykos gained the ability to absorb the life forces of other living things into his body. When Lykos absorbs the energies of superhuman mutants, he transforms into Sauron, and gains a portion of that mutant's powers temporarily. Lykos' Sauron form resembles a large crested pteranodon, extinct except in the Savage Land. Unlike true pteranodons, Sauron has a toothed beak and orange eyes and a basically humanoid build, with legs as long as a human being's. Sauron has a wingspread of twelve feet, and razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet. In Sauron form he has superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, stamina, and durability and is capable of flight. Sauron has to absorb the life energies from living victims to sustain his life. He would revert to human form if he didn't regularly absorb the life force from superhuman beings. The Toad's technology could transform Lykos into Sauron by draining life energy from Tayna Andersson, who is apparently not superhuman.

Lykos also has a powerful hypnotic ability that requires direct eye contact to complete. He frequently uses his hypnotic power to give his victims terrifying delusions that allies have become monsters. He can also mentally enslave people to do his bidding, although his control is not perfect, as [[Portal (comics)|Portal]] is resistant to his commands.

Due to manipulation by the Weapon X program, Sauron can expel the life force energy in concussive bursts from his hands.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point prior to his New Avengers appearances, he acquires an additional ability to breathe fire, which he uses to burn the second Black Widow in revenge for shooting him.&lt;ref name="NE6" /&gt;

By the time he confronts the Scarlet Spider, Lykos has developed his powers to the point where he can essentially store mutant energy to trigger his transformation into Sauron without the need for contact with mutants.{{issue|date=July 2018}}

==Other versions==

===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' universe, Sauron, redubbed '''Soaron''' is a more heroic figure, though he is extremely bad-tempered and reclusive, and he is never seen in human form. He is a member of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]'s group of Outcasts alongside Forge, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], [[Sunder (comics)|Brute]], [[Siryn|Sonique]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] and [[Nate Grey]]. The group traveled the countryside posing as a circus troupe, protected by Mastermind's illusions, in order to keep attention away from them while Forge trained Nate. Soaron would often make sarcastic remarks about the situations the group found themselves in, and constantly referred to Nate as a "whelp". In a mission where the group rescued a large number of humans from a prison train, one of Soaron's wings was seared off, grounding him. He bitterly remarked about this to Forge later, demanding to know if his wing was enough reason to avoid suicidal missions.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and her team attacked the group, Soaron was noticeably absent, but after Nate went to challenge [[Mister Sinister]], who had been hiding with the team attempting to manipulate Nate, Soaron and Sonique, the only survivors, arrived on the scene to save the young mutant. Nate accepted that he must challenge Apocalypse, and told Soaron to look after Sonique. Soaron replied by somewhat fondly advising him, "Don't concern yourself with us, just worry about yourself, whelp."&lt;ref&gt;''X-Man'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited, Soaron appeared along with Sonique, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and a revived [[Jean Grey]] as a member of Sinister's team known as the [[Sinister Six]], a group meant to aid Sinister in destroying the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Age of the Apocalypse'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Sinister apparently still in the guise of Essex approached both Soaron and Sonique, and with Jean Grey's assistance, brainwashed them into becoming members of his new team - the Sinister Six. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Soaron failed in his attempt to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. At the last moment, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] prevented his father's death by sacrificing himself. Enraged at the sight of his dead son, Magneto used his powers to thrust the [[Silver Samurai]]'s sword straight through Soaron, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Earth X''===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' universe, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] claims that, after accidentally killing [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] with a kiss, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] sought to rid herself of her powers through Sauron's draining abilities, but ended up losing her life as well.{{issue|date=July 2018}}

===''House of M''===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' universe, Sauron became a member of Magneto's palace guard on Genosha. He takes part in the battle against the heroes whose memories have been restored.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power Pack (Marvel Adventures)===
In the mini-series ''Wolverine and [[Power Pack#Marvel Adventures|Power Pack]]'', Sauron was the first villain faced by Logan and the Power children. The kids would have succumbed to Sauron's mind control without Wolverine's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and Power Pack'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* Sauron appeared in a few episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Robert Bockstael (actor)|Robert Bockstael]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This version of Sauron did not possess the fire breath or sonic scream of his comic book counterpart. Also, Lykos was apparently an inhabitant of the Savage Land, as he knew and was friendly with Ka-Zar. Lykos was the victim of [[Mister Sinister]]'s experiments, forced to feed on energy and transformed into Sauron upon mutant contact. Sauron aided Mister Sinister in his efforts to destroy the X-Men. He later attempted to conquer the Savage Land for himself, but was ultimately defeated. With no mutants left in the Savage Land, Lykos was free to live in peace and welcomed into Ka-Zar's tribe.
* Sauron appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Savage Land", voiced by [[Steven Blum]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. arrive in the Savage Land, Sauron leads an army of laser-mounted Pteranodons in an attack upon their jump jet. During the fight, Sauron drains the energy from one of the Pteranodons where he manages to knock [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] off the jump jet. Saruon states that he and his dinosaurs survived extinction and that man's time on Earth will be at its end. While Sauron controls Devil Dinosaur into attacking A-Bomb and [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], She-Hulk and Skaar find Sauron's lizardmen allies using a special drill in the super volcano. Sauron is alerted about the situation at the super volcano and commands Devil Dinosaur into finishing the job. Sauron engages Skaar in battle as he tries to mind control him and drains the energies of him and She-Hulk. Hulk, Red Hulk, A-Bomb, and Devil Dinosaur arrive where Hulk fights Sauron while the others work to stop the drill. Sauron then tries to drain Hulk's energy which doesn't work. After the drill was destroyed, a weakened Sauron flees from the Pteranodons. In the episode "Into the Negative Zone," it is revealed that the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] supplied the weapons and technology for Sauron's plot to cause the super volcano to erupt. In the episode "Mission: Impossible Man," Sauron leads an army of prehistoric sea creatures to attack a seaside amusement park. He ended up fighting the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and [[Impossible Man]]. When Impossible Man manages to trap Sauron, his powers end up absorbed by Sauron who uses them to attack the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. As the Two-Headed Compound Hulk (Impossible Man's combining of Hulk and Red Hulk) is punching Sauron, he sprouts three more heads. Sauron even summoned [[Fin Fang Foom]] (who was the only reptile that Sauron couldn't control) to help him. After his absorption of Impossible Man's powers wore off, Sauron tried to absorb Fin Fang Foom's powers only to be knocked out to sea. Following the Two-Headed Compound Hulk punching Fin Fang Foom out to sea, it landed on Sauron who was still in the water. In the episode "Monsters No More," Sauron appears as a member of Leader's Agents of C.R.A.S.H. In the episode "Days of Future Smash: The Dino Era," Sauron was the king of the dinosaur-dominated timeline caused by Leader. He is served by an Ankylosaurus called General Thunder Lizard Rossasaurus in his plot to exterminate the primitive humans. With help from El Diablo and Spider-Raptor, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. freed the primitive humans and overthrew King Sauron which ended with him falling into a pit of giant spiders. After Hulk thwarted Leader's plans in the Mesozoic era, the dinosaur-dominated timeline shifted to the next timeline.

A [[ship burial]] or boat-shaped burial is a burial in which the [[coffin]] or container of the dead is shaped like a boat. At times, the container of the dead is boat-shaped in itself, and sometimes grave goods shaped like boats are also present in the [[burial site]]. This kind of burial was common among Germanic peoples, including the Vikings and Scandinavians. But archaeological evidence has shown the presence of these kinds of burials in both mainland and insular [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]].

== East Asia ==

=== China ===
The [[Bo people (China)|Bo people]] China's [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan province]]s are known for their hanging coffins.

The ancestors of the Bo people were instrumental in helping the [[Western Zhou]] overthrow the ruling Yin at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]]. Apart from this, the Bo people differed from other ethnic minorities in China through their burial traditions. Instead of the more common burial on the ground, the coffins of the Bo people were found hanging on cliffs. These coffins were also boat-shaped. Grave goods found in the coffins included blue and white porcelain bowls dated back from the [[Ming dynasty]], iron knife, another smaller knife and two iron [[spear point]]s. The Bo people were massacred by the Imperial Army in the later years of the Ming dynasty, and those who survived changed their names in order to escape oppression. Scenes of the typical daily life of the Bo people can also be seen through the cliff and wall paintings they have left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Li Jinhui. [http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/55407.htm "Mysterious Hanging Coffins of the Bo"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of Sichuan several [[Chengdu ancient boat-shaped coffins|boat-shaped coffins]] have been found and dated to the [[Eastern Zhou Period]] (770–255&amp;nbsp;BC). The tombs also contains a big amount of ritual objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5816/ |title=Archaeological Sites of the Ancient Shu State: Site at Jinsha and Joint Tombs of Boat- shaped Coffins in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province; Site of Sanxingdui in Guanghan City, Sichuan Province 29C.BC-5C.BC |date= |language=English |website=UNESCO |accessdate=23 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-03/15/content_28571199.htm |title=Ancient boat-shaped coffins found in Sichuan |date= |language=English |website=China Daily |accessdate=23 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
A boat-shaped coffin was found in Japan during the construction of the [[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita Ward]] of [[Nagoya]]. This coffin was found to be older than any other previously found in Japan. Another boat-shaped coffin was found in the tomb of the [[Ohoburo Minami Kofun-gun]] in Northern [[Kyoto]], dated to the latter half of the [[Yayoi Period]] (4 B.C.-4 A.D.). The tomb contained grave goods including a [[cobalt blue glass]] bangle, an iron bangle, and several iron swords. Boat-shaped coffins called [[haniwa]] were more common during the [[Kofun period]], and these coffins were seen in paintings along with the representation of the sun, moon, and the stars. This suggests the ritual symbols associated with boats even in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritageofjapan.wordpress.com/yayoi-era-yields-up-rice/lifestyle-and-society-of-the-land-of-wa/days-of-mourning-and-ways-of-burying/why-were-some-of-the-yayoi-coffins-boat-shaped/|title=Why were some of the Yayoi coffins boat-shaped?|work=Heritage of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===

The [[Dong Son culture]] in [[Vietnam]] is known by archaeologists due to a great concentration of boat-shaped coffins. 171 boat-shaped coffins were recovered from 44 sites in Vietnam, and most of these were found from Dong Son sites. Some of these burials included carefully arranged grave goods inside the coffin along with the corpse of the dead. Also, the coffins were found strategically close to water, either rivers or small streams of sea.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Van Liem.[http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/view/11923/10549 "A STUDY OF BOAT-SHAPED COFFINS FROM DONGSON SITES IN VIETNAM"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===

There are numerous burial sites in the Philippines that include boat burials and boat-shaped burials. In fact, present-day coffins in the Philippines still resemble canoes made from hollowed out logs. There are two famous sites of burials, the jar burials in [[Batanes]] and in [[Catanauan]].The burial markers in Batanes are shaped like a boat, with the bow and stern appearing prominently. The markers were made from stone, and were made to appear like the outline of the traditional boat ''[[tataya]]''. Inspection of the Chuhangin and Nakamaya sites in Batanes reveals that the markers were oriented in a Northwest-Southeast direction. Principal site investigators also discovered that the bow of the markers pointed towards the sea. But apparently, when the storms cease to pound on the islands of Batanes, the bow of the boats align with the appearance of the band of the Milky Way Galaxy. This further increases the possibility that the burials were made to align with the cosmos in belief that the boats will carry the dead to the heavens and the stars.

Some 1500 kilometers from Batanes, the Tuhian beach in Catanauan, Quezon lies another boat-shaped burial site. The boats in Catanauan are also oriented in a Northwest-Southeast direction, with the bow pointing towards the sea. The only difference is that the markers in Batanes were made from [[andesite]] and [[limestone]], while those present in Catanauan were made from [[coral]] slabs. Also, while the markers in Batanes contained a single burial, the Catanauan markers were multiple burials.&lt;ref&gt;Dy-Liacco, Rafael. [http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/4370/3966] "The Last Voyage of the Dead: The Milky Way and the Boat-Shaped Burial Markers of the Philippines Archipelago"&lt;/ref&gt;

The alignment of both of these burial sites served as evidence that people from both sites believed in the idea of the [[afterlife]]. Also, the boats were thought as a vessel for “sailing” to the heavens and the stars. This belief is a widespread idea all around the world, as we know from different burial sites all throughout Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Another burial site in [[Bohol]] was observed by the Spanish during the 16th century One account of the burial states:

“In some places, they kill slaves and bury them with their masters in order to serve them in the afterlife, this practice is carried out to the extent that many load a ship with more than sixty slaves, fill it up with food and drink, place the dead on board, and the entire vessel including live slaves buried in the earth (Quirino and Garcia, 1958)”&lt;ref&gt;Tenazas, Rose.[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/29791037?uid=3738824&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104847243821 "THE BOAT-COFFIN BURIAL COMPLEX IN THE PHILIPPINES AND ITS RELATION TO SIMILAR PRACTICES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous boat-shaped burial found in the Philippines is the [[Manunggul Jar]]. The jars were excavated from a [[Neolithic]] [[burial site]] in [[Manunggul cave]] of [[Tabon Caves]] at [[Lipuun Point]] at [[Palawan]]. The jars were found to be from 890–710 B.C. The main feature of the Manunggul jar is the two human figures seated on a boat at the top handle of its cover. The figures represent the journey of the soul to the afterlife, with another figure serving as his oarsman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Manunggul.html "Manunggul Jar"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial jar with a cover featuring a ship-of-the-dead […] is perhaps unrivaled in Southeast Asia; the work of an artist and master potter. This vessel provides a clear example of a cultural link between the archaeological past and the ethnographic present. The boatman […] is steering rather than paddling the “ship”. The mast of the boat was not recovered. Both figures appear to be wearing bands tied over the crowns of their heads and under their jaws; a pattern still found in burial practices among the indigenous peoples in the Southern Philippines. The manner in which the hands of the front figure are folded across the chest is also a widespread practice in the islands when arranging the corpse.

The carved prow and the eye motif of the spirit boat is
still found on the traditional watercraft of the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, and
Malaysia. Similarities in the execution of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth of
the figures may be seen today in the wood carving of Taiwan, the Philippines,
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robert B. ''The
Tabon Caves: archaeological explorations and excavations on Palawan Island,
Philippines.'' Manila : National Museum, 1970. (112,114)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tea and toast syndrome''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] commonly experienced by elderly people who are unable to prepare meals and tend to themselves. Their diets often dwindle to [[tea]] and [[toast]] resulting in a deficiency of [[vitamins]] and other nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = Senior Citizens Suffer From 'Tea and Toast Syndrome'| work =| website = prnewswire.com| publisher = | date = 28 February 2011 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20110301/Tea-and-Toast-Syndrome-leads-to-loss-of-wellness-and-muscle-in-seniors.aspx| format = | doi =| accessdate = 28 September 2015| archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome often manifests itself as [[hyponatremia]], a low concentration of the [[electrolyte]] [[sodium]] in the bloodstream, due to the lack of salt in the diet.  

The syndrome often occurs once children have moved away, and a partner has died or is dying. An elderly person with nobody left to cook for, or without the skills to cook, will revert to a diet of simple foods such as bread, cheese and crackers, and tinned foods. According to the [[New York Times]], as many as 60% of seniors living at home are either malnourished or at risk of becoming malnourished. In addition to the problems lack of nutrients will cause, this state also means that the complications of other illnesses, even the common cold, can be much more severe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/job%20market/health/health-tea-and-toast-and-a-danger-that-can-be-hard-to.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Anderson| first = Olwen| authorlink =| title = Avoiding the 'tea &amp; toast' syndrome as you age| work =| website = | publisher = | date = 25 December 2010 | url = https://olwenanderson.worldsecuresystems.com/_blog/Olwen_Anderson's_Blog/post/Avoiding_the_'tea_toast'_syndrome_as_you_age| format =| doi =| accessdate = 28 September 2015| archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that lead to the syndrome include social isolation, psychological issues such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], illness, and physical limitations. Though less of a factor than psychological issues, the increased number of medications often taken by elderly people can also affect eating habits. These medications may suppress appetite, make food taste different, or affect how nutrients are absorbed, making it even less likely seniors will get the required nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Myer| first = Cara| authorlink =| title = The Tea and Toast Syndrome: Psychosocial Aspects of Congregate Dining | journal = Generations| volume = 28| issue = 3| pages = | publisher = | location =| date = 2003| language = | url =| jstor =| issn =| doi = | id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical laboratory findings for tea and toast syndrome include a low serum [[osmolality]] ([[Tonicity|hypotonicity]]) with a normal urine osmolality since [[antidiuretic hormone]] levels are normal.

On 14 January 2015, more than one hundred unidentified dead bodies were found floating in the [[River Ganges]] in [[Unnao district]] in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-unidentified-corpses-send-up-government-in-a-tizzy-2052594|title=Unidentified corpses send UP government in a tizzy|publisher=dnaindia.com|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dead bodies are believed to be of mostly unmarried girls and children. They were later buried at the riverbank.&lt;ref name="Unnao row"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofindia.com/india/100-bodies-recovered-from-Ganga-Centre-seeks-info-from-UP-govt/articleshow/45888140.cms|title=100 bodies recovered from Ganga|work=Times of India|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
The bodies, which were mostly of children and unmarried girls, were first noticed on 14 January 2015 by some villagers at [[Ganga Ghat Shuklaganj balu ghat]] in Unnao district when crows and dogs were feeding on them. The area was cordoned off by officials and 104 dead bodies were retrieved from the river. Samples were taken for forensic [[DNA profiling]], as, according to officials, postmortem was not possible. Without going for cremation the dead bodies were buried at the riverbank. On the same day, six more dead bodies were found floating in the river and retrieved from the neighbouring district of [[Jhansi]].&lt;ref name="Unnao row"/&gt; 

One of the explanations given by the officials was that since the river had changed its course due to the construction of a new [[barrage (dam)|barrage]], the water level became lower and the bodies surfaced. A magisterial enquiry was ordered by the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh [[Akhilesh Yadav]] to uncover the facts of the incident.&lt;ref name="Unnao row"/&gt; The chairperson of [[Bahujan Samaj Party]], [[Mayawati]], demanded [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] enquiry into the incident and said that it "has infused fear among people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samacharplus.com/index.php/en/cities/36-up-uttarakhand/lucknow/1628-mayawati-demands-cbi-probe-into-unnao-dead-bodies-issue|title=Mayawati demands CBI probe into Unnao dead bodies issue|publisher=Samacharplus.com|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azam Khan (politician)|Azam Khan]], a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh government, has accused [[Sakshi Maharaj]] of being responsible for the incident; {{quote|I have come to know that Sakshi Maharaj brought a truck loaded with bodies to the spot and unloaded it into the river to defame the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofindia.com/india/Sakshi-Maharaj-threw-bodies-into-Ganga-Azam-Khan/articleshow/45904995.cms|title=Sakshi Maharaj threw bodies into Ganga-Azam Khan|work=Times of India|accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Location==
The dead bodies were found floating in a canal at [[Ganga Ghat Shuklaganj balu ghat]], which connects to the Ganges and is 60&amp;nbsp;km southwest from [[Lucknow]], the state capital of Uttar Pradesh and 30&amp;nbsp;km northeast from [[Kanpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/topic/unnao|title=Unnoa|publisher=ndtv.com|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==River==
The Ganges River is regarded as a holy river by Hindus and many crematory [[ghats]] are on its banks. Police officials of Unnao have offered an explanation that the bodies were of "people who were dumped in the river or buried on the banks after their families could not afford a proper cremation."

}}'''Wild Field''' ({{lang-ru|Дикое поле}} ''Dikoe pole'') is a 300 [[Hectare|ha]] (740 [[Acre|ac]]) [[nature reserve]] near the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in [[Tula Oblast]] in the European part of [[Russia]], approximately 250&amp;nbsp;km (150&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Moscow.&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt;  It was established in 2012 by Russian scientists [[Sergey Zimov]] and Nikita Zimov as a companion to [[Pleistocene Park]] in Siberia.&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;

Unlike Pleistocene Park, Wild Field’s primary purpose is not scientific research but public outreach, i.e. it will provide a model of what an unregulated [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe ecosystem]] looked like before the advent of humans.&lt;ref name="Eli Kintisch: Born to Rewild. 2015" /&gt; It is situated near a federal road and a railway station and is accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;

==The reserve==
Wild Field comprises 300 [[Hectare|ha]] (740 [[Acre|ac]]) of which at first 150 ha were fenced off and stocked with animals.&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;  In 2017 the fenced area was increased to 280 hectares.&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 04 June 2017" /&gt;

The area of the reserve will be increased to 500 ha in 2018/2019.&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 06 September 2017" /&gt;  For the future, plans call for a continuous increase of the area in relation to the increasing population of animals in the reserve.&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 06 September 2017" /&gt;

==Animals==
Introduced between 2012 and 2015 were
* [[Bashkir Pony|Bashkir horse]]s (a strain of ''[[Equus ferus caballus]]''), from a [[Feral horse|feral]] herd in the southern part of the Ural Mountains,&lt;ref name="TNF 4 March 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Wild Field" /&gt; 
* [[Altai maral]]/[[Altai wapiti]] (''[[Cervus canadensis sibiricus]]''),&lt;ref name="pp Wild Field" /&gt; 
* [[Edilbaevskaya sheep]] (a strain of ''[[Ovis orientalis aries]]''),&lt;ref name="pp Wild Field" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 14 December 2017" /&gt; 
* [[Roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus|Capreolus spec.]]''),{{refn|group=note|These are the roe deer of the Tula region, which were already present on the site of Wild Field reserve. The species is not certain, as roe deer were absent in much of European Russia throughout the 20th century and only reoccupied the area in the last decades. Judging by the [[IUCN]] distribution maps,&lt;ref name="IUCN maps roe deer" /&gt; the roe deer of the Tula region should be [[European roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus capreolus]]''), with the westernmost extension of the range of the [[Siberian roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus pygargus]]'') ending approximately 500 km (300 mi) to the east.}}&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp wild field 245" /&gt; 
* [[Kalmyk cattle|Kalmykian cattle]] (a strain of ''[[Bos primigenius taurus]]''),&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First Tula Telechannel 3-2015" /&gt; 
* [[Yak#Domesticated yaks|Domestic yaks]] (''[[Bos mutus grunniens]]''), both [[Polled livestock|polled]]&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First Tula Telechannel 3-2015" /&gt; and unpolled.&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt; 
The total number of large herbivores in Wild Field Park numbered around 150 in April 2015.&lt;ref name="Jake Kong 11 April 2015" /&gt;

In 2016, several [[wild boar]]s (''[[Sus scrofa]]'')&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 29 April 2017" /&gt; and a female [[Alces|elk]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[British English|BE]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Alces|moose]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[American English|AE]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (''[[Alces alces]]'') entered the reserve through special one-way entrances built into the fences.&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt;  Several young [[wild boar]]/[[domestic pig]] hybrids (''[[Sus scrofa]] × [[Sus scrofa domesticus|domesticus]]'') have also been purchased to be released into the park upon maturing.&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt;

In 2017, four [[reindeer]] (''[[Rangifer tarandus]]'')&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 24 May 2017" /&gt; and 73 domestic [[Pridonskaya goat]]s (a strain of ''[[Capra aegagrus hircus]]'')&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 04 June 2017" /&gt; were added.

A herd of 20 [[plains bison]] (''[[Bison bison bison]]'') which was to be delivered in March 2014 by the True Nature Foundation, a European organization for ecological restoration and rewilding,&lt;ref name="TNF 4 March 14" /&gt; could not be imported due to a blanket import ban on cattle from countries affected by the [[Schmallenberg virus#Import bans|Schmallenberg virus]].&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;

The introduction of a test group of [[camel]]s (''[[Camelus|Camelus spec.]]''{{refn|group=note|This must be either ''[[Camelus ferus]]'' or ''[[Camelus bactrianus]]'', as ''[[Camelus dromedarius]]'' is not adapted to the climate of the region.}}) is under consideration.&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt; Further plans call for the introduction of [[bison]], [[saiga antelope]]s, [[vulture]]s, [[bobak marmot]]s and [[speckled ground squirrel]]s.&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 31 January 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 04 June 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 29 August 2017" /&gt;

'''William Bell''', born about 1734/5, was an English portrait painter originally from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|first=A.|last=Nisbet|title=Bell, William (1734/5–1794)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2032|accessdate=2015-10-02|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/2032}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; In around 1768 he moved to London, to be a student in the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. While there, in the year of 1771, he received a gold medal for his painting of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] entreating [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] to forge arms for her son [[Aeneas|Æneas]].&lt;ref name="Dictionaryof"&gt;Dictionary of National Biography, Volumes 1-20, 22&lt;/ref&gt; William Bell's best-known works were the portraits painted for the family of Delaval, of [[Seaton Delaval Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Art UK bio|retrieved=2013-11-20|oxbio=1|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings earned Bell the patronage of [[John Delaval, 1st Baron Delaval|Lord Delaval]], and in 1775 he exhibited two views of Delaval Hall. A portrait he painted of Robert Harrison, 1715-1802, is displayed in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp06669/william-bell|title=National Portrait Gallery - Person - William Bell|publisher=National Portrait Gallery|location=London|accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bell died on 8 June 1794 and was buried on 10 June, in [[St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne]]; his death was reported in the ''Newcastle Courant'' (14 June 1794) thus: "DIED, Sunday morning, Mr William Bell, an eminent Portrait Painter, whose memory will be esteemed at long as his animated productions remain, many of which bear testimony to his abilities in this part of the kingdom".&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

'''William Cuthbert Faulkner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔː|k|n|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Faulkner, William|us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|Faulkner}}&lt;/ref&gt; September 25, 1897&amp;nbsp;– July 6, 1962) was an [[American literature|American writer]] and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate from [[Oxford, Mississippi]]. Faulkner wrote novels, short stories, screenplays, poetry, essays, and  a play. He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]], based on [[Lafayette County, Mississippi]], where he spent most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', July 11, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in [[American literature]] generally and [[Southern United States literature|Southern literature]] specifically. Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner was not widely known until receiving the 1949 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], for which he became the only [[Mississippi]]-born Nobel winner. Two of his works, ''[[A Fable]]'' (1954) and his last novel ''[[The Reivers]]'' (1962), won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked his 1929 novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' sixth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]; also on the list were ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930) and ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932). ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936) appears on similar lists. 

==Life and career==
Born William Cuthbert Falkner in [[New Albany, Mississippi]], William Faulkner was the first of four sons of Murry Cuthbert Falkner (August 17, 1870&amp;nbsp;– August 7, 1932) and Maud Butler (November 27, 1871&amp;nbsp;– October 16, 1960).&lt;ref name="Ole Miss"&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william/ MWP: William Faulkner (1897–1962)], OleMiss.edu; accessed September 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three younger brothers: Murry Charles "Jack" Falkner (June 26, 1899 – December 24, 1975), author [[John Faulkner (author)|John Faulkner]] (September 24, 1901&amp;nbsp;– March 28, 1963), and Dean Swift Falkner (August 15, 1907&amp;nbsp;– November 10, 1935).

Soon after his first birthday, his family moved to [[Ripley, Mississippi]], where his father Murry worked as the treasurer for the family-owned Gulf &amp; Chicago Railroad Company. Murry hoped to inherit the railroad from his father, John Wesley Thompson Falkner, but John had little confidence in Murry's ability to run a business and sold it for $75,000. Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher. Maud disagreed with this proposition, however, and they moved instead to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Minter, David L. ''William Faulkner, His Life and Work''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980; {{ISBN|0-8018-2347-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, four days prior to William's fifth birthday, the Falkner family settled in Oxford, where he lived on and off for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Ole Miss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html|title=William Faulkner biodate|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family, particularly his mother Maud, his maternal grandmother Lelia Butler, and Caroline "Callie" Barr (the African American nanny who raised him from infancy) crucially influenced the development of Faulkner's artistic imagination. Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers, educating him in visual language. While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church. She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Faulkner's lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels' preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race.&lt;ref name="Sensibar"&gt;Sensibar, Judith L. ''Faulkner and Love: The Women Who Shaped His Art, A Biography'', Yale University Press, 2010; {{ISBN|0-300-16568-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a schoolchild, Faulkner had success early on. He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and did well through the third and fourth grades. However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, instead taking interest in studying the history of Mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade. The decline of his performance in school continued, and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade, never graduating from high school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Faulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the Civil War, slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Falkner family. Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and Civil War hero. Telling stories about "Old Colonel", as his family called him, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to one of Faulkner's biographers, by the time William was born, his great-grandfather had "been enshrined long since as a household deity."&lt;ref name="Coughlan, Robert 1953a"&gt;Coughlan, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 17, Faulkner met Philip Stone, who became an important early influence on his writing. Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Mississippi]]. Faulkner also attended the latter, joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and pursued his dream to become a writer. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.&lt;ref name="Coughlan, Robert 1953"/&gt;
[[File:William Faulkner in Toronto, Canada (1918).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cadet Faulkner in [[Toronto]], 1918]]
The younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived. Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic position of "black and white" Americans, his characterization of Southern characters, and his timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the façades of [[good ol' boy]]s and simpletons. Unable to join the [[United States Army]] due to his height (he was 5' 5½"), Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the [[British Army]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|title=U of T Back Campus Debate Invokes William Faulkner, Morley Callaghan|publisher=Toronto Star|date=June 9, 2013|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/06/09/u_of_t_back_campus_debate_invokes_william_faulkner_morley_callaghan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his claims, records indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and never saw service during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Faulkner: Self-Presentation and Performance|last=Watson|first=James G.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-79151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Faulkner's surname went from "Falkner" to '''Faulkner'''. According to one story, a careless typesetter simply made an error. When the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book, Faulkner was asked whether he wanted the change. He supposedly replied, "Either way suits me."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters'' Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: pp. 63–64. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adolescence, Faulkner began writing poetry almost exclusively. He did not write his first novel until 1925. His literary influences are deep and wide. He once stated that he modeled his early writing on the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in late 18th- and early 19th-century England.&lt;ref name="Ole Miss"/&gt; He attended the [[University of Mississippi]] ("Ole Miss") in Oxford, enrolling in 1919, going three semesters before dropping out in November 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william|title=University of Mississippi: William Faulkner|publisher=Olemiss.edu|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William was able to attend classes at the university because his father had a job there as a business manager. He skipped classes often and received a "D" grade in English. However, some of his poems were published in campus publications.&lt;ref name="Coughlan, Robert 1953"&gt;Coughlan, Robert.

Although Faulkner is identified with Mississippi, he was residing in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], in 1925 when he wrote his first novel, ''[[Soldiers' Pay]].''&lt;ref name="Ole Miss"/&gt; After being directly influenced by [[Sherwood Anderson]], he made his first attempt at fiction writing. Anderson assisted in the publication of ''Soldiers' Pay'' and ''[[Mosquitoes (novel)|Mosquitoes]]'', Faulkner's second novel, set in New Orleans, by recommending them to his publisher.&lt;ref name="Faulkner 2004"&gt;Hannon, Charles.

During the summer of 1927, Faulkner wrote his first novel set in his fictional Yoknapatawpha County, titled ''[[Flags in the Dust]].'' This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth. He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels. However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni &amp; Liveright. Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was published in 1929 as ''[[Sartoris]].''&lt;ref name="Porter, Carolyn 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faulkner 2004"/&gt; (The original version was issued as ''[[Flags in the Dust]]'' in 1973.)

In the autumn of 1928, just after his 31st birthday, he began working on ''The Sound and the Fury''. He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style. In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, ''"One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists. I said to myself, 'Now I can write.'"''&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Carolyn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=awt9X0cAC40C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''William Faulkner''], New York: Oxford University Press, 2007; {{ISBN|0-19-531049-7}}, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; After its completion, Faulkner insisted that Ben Wasson not do any editing or add any punctuation for clarity.&lt;ref name="Porter, Carolyn 2007"/&gt;

In 1929, Faulkner married Estelle Oldham, Andrew Kuhn serving as best man at the wedding. Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to [[Cornell Franklin]] and Faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer. He began writing ''As I Lay Dying'' in 1929 while working night shifts at the [[University of Mississippi Power House]]. The novel would be published in 1930.&lt;ref name="1parini"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parini|first1=Jay|title=One matchless time: a life of William Faulkner|date=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-093555-3|page=142|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1930, Faulkner sent out some of his short stories to various national magazines. Several of his stories were published, which brought him enough income to buy a house in Oxford for his family to inhabit, which he named Rowan Oak.&lt;ref name="Williamson, Joel 1993"&gt;Williamson, Joel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''William Faulkner and Southern History''], New York: Oxford University Press, 1993; {{ISBN|0-19-510129-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He made money on his 1931 novel, ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'', which was widely reviewed and read (but widely disliked for its perceived criticism of the South).

By 1932, Faulkner was in need of money. He asked Wasson to sell the serialization rights for his newly completed novel, ''Light in August'', to a magazine for $5,000, but none accepted the offer. Then MGM Studios offered Faulkner work as a screenwriter in Hollywood. Although not an avid moviegoer, he needed the money, and so accepted the job offer and arrived in Culver City, California, in May 1932. There he worked with director [[Howard Hawks]], with whom he quickly developed a friendship, as they both enjoyed drinking and hunting. Howard Hawks' brother, [[William Hawks]], became Faulkner's [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] agent. Faulkner would continue to find reliable work as a screenwriter from the 1930s to the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Faulkner 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson, Joel 1993"/&gt;

Faulkner served as Writer-in-Residence at the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] from February to June 1957 and again in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Blotner, J. and Frederick L. Gwynn, (eds.) (1959) ''Faulkner in the University: Conferences at the University of Virginia, 1957–1958''.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
As a teenager in Oxford, Faulkner dated Estelle Oldham (1897–1972), the popular daughter of Major Lemuel and Lida Oldham, and believed he would some day marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Parini (2004) pp. 22–29&lt;/ref&gt; However, Estelle dated other boys during their romance, and in 1918 one of them, [[Cornell Franklin]], proposed marriage to her before Faulkner did. Estelle's parents insisted she marry Cornell, as he was an Ole Miss law graduate, had recently been commissioned as a major in the Hawaiian Territorial Forces, and came from a respectable family with which they were old friends.&lt;ref&gt;Parini (2004) pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Estelle's marriage to Franklin fell apart ten years later, and they divorced in April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Padgett|first=John|title=Mississippi Writers' Page: William Faulkner|publisher=The University of Mississippi|date=November 11, 2008|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william/index.html|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, Faulkner and Estelle wed in June 1929 at [[College Hill Presbyterian Church]] just outside [[Oxford, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Parini (2004) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; They honeymooned on the Mississippi Gulf Coast at [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], then returned to Oxford, first living with relatives while they searched for a home of their own to purchase. In 1930, Faulkner purchased the [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] home [[Rowan Oak]], known at that time as The Shegog Place from Irish planter Robert Shegog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peek|first=Charles A.|title=A William Faulkner encyclopedia|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0-313-29851-3|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Estelle and their daughter, Jill, lived at Rowan Oak until Estelle's death in 1972. The property was sold to the [[University of Mississippi]] that same year. The house and furnishings are maintained much as they were in Faulkner's day. Faulkner's scribblings are preserved on the wall, including the day-by-day outline covering a week he wrote on the walls of his small study to help him keep track of the plot twists in his novel, ''[[A Fable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Block |first1=Melissa |title=William Faulkner's Home Illustrates His Impact On The South |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/13/515043640/william-faulkners-home-illustrates-his-impact-on-the-south |website=NPR.org |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality and quantity of Faulkner's literary output were achieved despite a lifelong [[alcoholism|drinking problem]]. He rarely drank while writing, preferring instead to binge after a project's completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/wf-faq.html#alcoholic|title=Was Faulkner an alcoholic?|work=William Faulkner: Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 31, 2010|publisher=Ole Miss|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805032644/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/wf-faq.html#alcoholic|archivedate=August 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulkner had several extramarital affairs. One was with [[Howard Hawks]]'s secretary and [[script supervisor|script girl]], Meta Carpenter,&lt;ref&gt;Parini (2004) pp. 198–99&lt;/ref&gt; later known as Meta Wilde.&lt;ref name=Meta/&gt; The affair was chronicled in her book ''A Loving Gentleman''.&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Meta Wilde, 86, Faulkner's Lover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/obituaries/meta-wilde-86-faulkner-s-lover.html|accessdate=February 23, 2016|work=New York Times|date=October 21, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, from 1949–53, was with a young writer, Joan Williams, who made her relationship with Faulkner the subject of her 1971 novel, ''The Wintering''.&lt;ref&gt;Parini (2004) pp. 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

When Faulkner visited [[Stockholm]] in December 1950 to receive the Nobel Prize, he met Else Jonsson (1912–1996), widow of journalist Thorsten Jonsson (1910–1950), reporter for ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' in New York from 1943–46, who had interviewed Faulkner in 1946 and introduced his works to Swedish readers. Faulkner and Else had an affair that lasted until the end of 1953. At the banquet where they met in 1950, publisher Tor Bonnier introduced Else as the widow of the man responsible for Faulkner's winning the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/en-karlekshistoria-i-nobelprisklass-1.1023972|language=sv|place=Sweden|title=En kärlekshistoria i Nobelprisklass|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=January 9, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On June 17, 1962, Faulkner suffered a serious injury in a fall from his horse, which led to [[thrombosis]]. He suffered a fatal heart attack on July 6, 1962, at the age of 64 at Wright's Sanatorium in [[Byhalia, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Ole Miss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"/&gt; Faulkner is buried with his family in St. Peter's Cemetery in Oxford, alongside the grave of an unidentified family friend, whose stone is marked only with the initials "E.T."&lt;ref name="Grave Site"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ciotta|url=http://www.literarytraveler.com/travel/travel_tour_profiles/tour_oxford_mississippi.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721091708/http://www.literarytraveler.com/travel/travel_tour_profiles/tour_oxford_mississippi.aspx|archivedate=July 21, 2011|title=Touring William Faulkner's Oxford, Mississippi|publisher=Literarytraveler.com|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
From the early 1920s to the outbreak of World War II, Faulkner published 13 novels and many short stories. Such a body of work formed the basis of his reputation and earned him the Nobel Prize at age 52. Faulkner's prodigious output includes his most celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). Faulkner was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].

His first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including "[[A Rose for Emily]]", "[[Red Leaves]]", "[[That Evening Sun]]", and "[[Dry September]]". Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat. Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's "postage stamp", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

His short story "A Rose for Emily" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.

Faulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]. In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of "[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.

In an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that "the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down".&lt;ref&gt;Levinger, Larry. "The Prophet Faulkner." ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924),&lt;ref&gt;This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).

== Legacy ==
Faulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives.

The [[New Criticism|New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''. Since then, critics have looked at Faulkner's work using other approaches, such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods.&lt;ref name="Faulkner 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner-Martin, Linda. ''William Faulkner: Six Decades of Criticism''. East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-87013-612-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Faulkner's works have been placed within the literary traditions of [[Literary modernism|modernism]] and the [[Southern Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Abadie, Ann J. and Doreen Fowler.

Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 1982 {{ISBN|1-60473-201-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic and translator [[Valerie Miles]], Faulkner's influence on [[Latin American fiction]] is considerable, with fictional worlds created by [[Gabriel García Márquez]] ([[Macondo]]) and [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] (Santa Maria) being "very much in the vein of" Yoknapatawpha: "[ [[Carlos Fuentes]]'] ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz]]'' wouldn't exist if not for ''[[As I Lay Dying]]''".&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/04/09/the-forest-of-letters-an-interview-with-valerie-miles/|title=The Forest of Letters: An Interview with Valerie Miles|last=Kan|first=Elianna|date=April 9, 2015|work=[[The Paris Review]]|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of William Faulkner are a clear influence on the French novelist [[Claude Simon]].

==Awards==
Faulkner was awarded the 1949 [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] for "his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel".&lt;!-- Nobel Prize was for 1949, but not actually awarded until 1950, due to discussions in the Swedish Academy carried over to 1950 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949|work=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded at the following year's banquet along with the 1950 Prize to [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/award-docu.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Documentary|work=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=July 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831134036/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/award-docu.html|archive-date=August 31, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faulkner detested the fame and glory that resulted from his recognition. His aversion was so great that his 17-year-old daughter learned of the Nobel Prize only when she was called to the principal's office during the school day.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Debra. "Faulkner, William". In Bloom, Harold (ed.) ''William Faulkner, Bloom's BioCritiques''. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishing, 2002 {{ISBN|0-7910-6378-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He donated part of his Nobel money "to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers", eventually resulting in the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]], and donated another part to a local Oxford bank, establishing a scholarship fund to help educate African-American teachers at [[Rust College]] in nearby [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]]. The government of France made Faulkner a [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]] in 1951.

Faulkner was awarded two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for what are considered "minor" novels: his 1954 novel ''[[A Fable]]'', which took the Pulitzer in 1955, and the 1962 novel, ''[[The Reivers]]'', which was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer in 1963.&lt;ref name="pulitzer"&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction "Fiction"].

The [[United States Postal Service]] issued a 22-cent postage stamp in his honor on August 3, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott catalogue]] #2350.&lt;/ref&gt; Faulkner had once served as Postmaster at the University of Mississippi, and in his letter of resignation in 1923 wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As long as I live under the capitalistic system, I expect to have my life influenced by the demands of moneyed people. But I will be damned if I propose to be at the beck and call of every itinerant scoundrel who has two cents to invest in a postage stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, sir, is my resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Faulkner Quits His Post Office Job in Splendid Fashion with a 1924 Resignation Letter|publisher=Openculture|date=September 30, 2012|url=http://www.openculture.com/2012/09/william_faulkner_tells_his_post_office_boss_to_stick_it_1924.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Collections==
The manuscripts of most of Faulkner's works, correspondence, personal papers, and over 300 books from his working library reside at the [[Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library]] at the [[University of Virginia]], where he spent much of his time in his final years. The library also houses some of the writer's personal effects and the papers of major Faulkner associates and scholars, such as his biographer Joseph Blotner, bibliographer Linton Massey, and Random House editor Albert Erskine.

[[Southeast Missouri State University]], where the [[Center for Faulkner Studies]] is located, also owns a generous collection of Faulkner materials, including first editions, manuscripts, letters, photographs, artwork, and many materials pertaining to Faulkner's time in Hollywood. The university possesses many personal files and letters kept by Joseph Blotner, along with books and letters that once belonged to Malcolm Cowley, another famous editor for William Faulkner. The university achieved the collection due to a generous donation by Louis Daniel Brodsky, a collector of Faulkner materials, in 1989.

Further significant Faulkner materials reside at the [[University of Mississippi]], the [[Harry Ransom Center]], and the [[New York Public Library]].

The Random House records at Columbia University also include letters by and to Faulkner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079581|title=Random House records, 1925-1999.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaillant (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sultan Zainul Abidin''' (died 5 October 1579) was the seventh [[sultan of Aceh]] in northern [[Sumatra]]. His reign was the last of three brief ones in the year 1579.

Zainul Abidin was the son of Sultan Ghori alias Abdullah, who was the vassal ruler of Aru ([[Deli (sultanate)|Deli]]) and died in battle in 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Djajadiningrat (1911), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of Sultan [[Alauddin al-Kahar]]. After the rapid deaths of the sultans [[Ali Ri'ayat Syah I]], [[Sultan Muda]] and [[Sri Alam]], he was placed on the throne of Aceh in 1579. However, according to the chronicles he was only interested in pleasures and especially enjoyed animal fights and life-and-death fights between humans.&lt;ref&gt;Iskandar (1958), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It was even alleged that he had no appetite before he had seen blood flowing.&lt;ref&gt;Djajadiningrat (1911), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He also behaved in a tyrannical way towards his ''uleëbalangs'' (chiefs). The chiefs therefore resolved to get rid of him. The plotters put him on an elephant and brought him to Makota Alam where he was murdered. This happened on 5 October 1579. He was succeeded by [[Alauddin Mansur Syah]] who did not belong to the old sultan's family.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedie (1917), Vol. 1, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
