== Biography ==
Born on 2 December 1944 in [[Kolkata]], in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] to Bhabaranjan-Malancha couple, Bhattacharyya graduated in chemistry from the [[University of Calcutta]] and secured his master's degree in physical chemistry from the same university.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt; Subsequently, he joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata and pursued his doctoral studies to secure the degree under the guidance of Uma Shankar Nandi of the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. Moving to the US, he completed his post-doctoral studies at the laboratory of Jan Wolff of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. He returned to India in 1976 to join [[Bose Institute]] as a [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] pool officer where he shifted to academics as a lecturer in 1978 and continued his service till his superannuation as a professor and head of the department of biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Fellow profile - Indian Academy of Sciences"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/fellow/Bhattacharyya,_Prof._Bhabatarak | title=Fellow profile - Indian Academy of Sciences | publisher=Indian Academy of Sciences | date=2016 | accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been associated with [[Presidency College, Calcutta]] as a professor at their Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/chemistry.php | title=Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry | publisher=Presidency University | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhattacharyya's early work during his post-doctoral studies at Jan Wolff's laboratory were on [[tubulin]] and its binding mechanism with [[antimitotic]] drugs.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt; Later, he focused his researches on colchicine-tubulin interaction and elucidated the effect of the ''carbonyl group on the side chain of B-ring'' in the irreversible binding of [[colchicine]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csirhrdg.res.in/ssb.pdf | title=Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners | publisher=Council of Scientific and Industrial Research | date=1999 | accessdate=28 September 2016 | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated the fluorescence of colchicine-tubilin bind which is reported to have offered an alternative to radio-labeled colchicine in pharmacological [[assays]] and made the study of the kinetics of colchicine binding easier. He studied the ''mechanism of chaperone-like activity of tubulin and microtubule associated proteins'' and his studies have known to be of significance in the design of lead compounds as well as new drugs for the treatment of cancer.&lt;ref name="Faculty Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bic.boseinst.ernet.in/biochem/bablu.html | title=Faculty Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya | publisher=Bose Institute | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published several articles detailing his research findings,&lt;ref name="Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya on Microsoft Academic Search"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://65.54.113.26/Author/11083556/bhabatarak-bhattacharyya | title=Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya on Microsoft Academic Search | publisher=Microsoft Academic Search | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has registered patents for his work&lt;ref name="Patents by Inventor Abhik Saha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/abhik-saha | title=Patents by Inventor Abhik Saha | publisher=Justia Patents | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has mentored many scholars in their doctoral studies.&lt;ref name="Dr. Gopa Mitra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sjri.res.in/mmkeyperson/560 | title=Dr. Gopa Mitra | publisher=St. John's Research Institute | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Fellow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wellcomedbt.org/fellowsprofile/dr-abhik-saha-222 | title=About Fellow | publisher=Wellcome Trust | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scientific career has been documented in an article, ''Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin'', published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jpp.org.in/index.php/jpp/article/view/133 | title=Dr. Bablu Bhattacharyya: A Journey of Four Decades with Tubulin | author=Dulal Panda, Tapas K Manna | journal=Journal of Proteins and Proteomics | year=2015 | volume=6 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been associated with the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref name="Isothermal Titration Calorimetry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caluniv.ac.in/seminar/Workshop_Proteomics.pdf | title=Isothermal Titration Calorimetry | publisher=Calcutta University | date=2016 | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]] as a member of their various technical committees.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt;

'''Abbot Bonanat de Vilaseca''' was one of the more important abbots in [[Santes Creus]] monastery (Catalonia).

In this period, the monastery was a center of intellectual and political activity and was comparable to the [[Poblet Monastery]].

Abbot Bonanat de Vilaseca founded also the subsidiaries of Santa Maria de Valldigna in 1298 and the Monastery of Altofonte ([[Sicily]]) in 1308, when [[James II of Aragon|Jaume II el Just]] was reigning.

==Early life==

Pugh was born in [[Richmond, Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Traudi|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pugh-clifton-ernest-15045|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Pugh's parents were amateur painters, and as a young man during the 1940s Pugh attended evening classes at the [[Swinburne Technical College]] to study cartoon drawing.&lt;ref name="bank"&gt;{{cite book|title=The seventies: Australian paintings and tapestries from the collection of National Australia Bank|year=1982|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-909873-34-9|author=National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia|pages=28, 46, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian painters: Forty profiles|year=1964|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson|author=John Aikman Hetherington|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later whilst living in [[Adelaide]] he took evening classes in [[Figure drawing|life drawing]] at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts.&lt;ref name="bank"/&gt;

Pugh served with the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] in [[New Guinea]] during World War II and with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in [[Japan]] after the war.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerster|first=Robin|title=Six Inch Rule: Revisiting the Australian Occupation of Japan 1946-1952|journal=History Australia|year=2007|volume=4|issue=2|pages=42.8|url=http://journals.publishing.monash.edu/ojs/index.php/ha/article/view/307|accessdate=8 October 2012|publisher=Monash University Press|doi=10.2104/ha070042}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Japanese soldiers surrendered to the unit with which Pugh was fighting during a lull in fighting, and on receiving orders to proceed Pugh and others shot and killed them.&lt;ref name="afterfire"/&gt; This incident and the guilt he felt affected his attitude to war (he became a pacifist) and his painting.

==Career==

After serving in [[World War II]], with the financial support of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme, Pugh returned to [[Melbourne]] and enrolled in the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]].&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt;

Pugh was heavily influenced by German Expressionism.  He read [[Sheldon Warren Cheney|Sheldon Cheney's]] ''The Story of Modern Art'' (1941) while recuperating in hospital in New Guinea during World War II.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt; Pugh's primary influence was [[Wassily Kandinsky]]: "I can see Kandinsky in everything I do."&lt;ref name="influences"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pugh|first=Clifton|title=Australian landscape painter Clifton Pugh cites the painters who have influenced him|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/clifton-pugh/clip2/|publisher=Australian National Film and Sound Archive|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His training at the National Gallery School gave him a strong foundation in drawing and he learned the tonal painting technique, but when he took his teacher William (Bill) Dargie to see the first of Sidney Nolan's Kelly and Dargie's attitude was dismissive, Pugh left the school to develop his own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|title=Unstill Life|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Pugh bought {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of bushland near [[Cottles Bridge, Victoria|Cottles Bridge]], {{convert|50|km|mi}} northeast of Melbourne, which he named ''Dunmoochin''.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bick"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bick|first=David|title=Dunmoochin – Clifton Pugh's Studio Residence and All Structures Built By and for Pugh|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/55217|work=Victorian Heritage Database|publisher=Heritage Victoria|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pugh at first camped on the site, then built a [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] shack.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bick"/&gt;

Artists, potters and others also settled at the site.&lt;ref name="bick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailan"/&gt; In order to protect and jointly control the area they formed the Dunmoochin Artists Co-operative with a constitution of 13 articles.&lt;ref name="bick"/&gt; It was not a [[commune]] in any sense of the word except that the [[Torrens title|titles]] were communally held.&lt;ref name="bick"/&gt;
When the co-operative eventually disbanded each member took a section of the land.&lt;ref name="dailan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-imagining Utopia 3 - Art Is Life|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s853520.htm|publisher=Radio National: ABC|accessdate=26 August 2010|author=Kath Duncan|author2=Dailan Pugh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who worked or resided at Dunmoochin have included

Pugh travelled across the [[Nullarbor Plain]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1954 then the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] in 1956.  These journeys led to radical changes in his style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeking the centre: the Australian Desert in literature, art and film|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57111-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9R6Tjwd1_4C&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clifton%20pugh%20nullarbor%201954&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=clifton%20pugh%20nullarbor%201954&amp;f=false|author=Roslynn D.

In 1959 Pugh wrote to Bernard Smith:
{{quotation|Art must be indigenous...arising out of the environment and background of a particular place and time.  This could be nationalistic but I prefer to call it geographical art.  For instance, Chinese and Mexican art reflect the background and the 'soul' of the country but are also universal...

Close observation of nature and its cyclical and savage rhythms became a constant theme in Pugh's painting.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="printmaker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Painting, 1788-2000|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-551554-1|author=Bernard Smith|author2=Terry E.

[[File:Gough Whitlam by Clifton Pugh 1972.png|thumb|200px|''The Hon E G Whitlam'' (1972)]]

Pugh held his first solo show in 1957 at the [[Victorian Artists Society]] Gallery, where he displayed landscapes and portraits. The show was well received by critics.&lt;ref name="printmaker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Clifton Pugh: Printmaker|publisher=La Trobe University Art Museum|url=http://www.artmuseum.qut.edu.au/downloads/Clifton_Pugh_Education_Kit.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2010|pages=6, 11, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubrey Gibson|Col.

Pugh had consistent official support in the crucial early stages of his career. His inclusion in the 1961 [[Whitechapel Art Gallery|Whitechapel]] and 1963 [[Tate]] exhibitions of [[Visual arts of Australia|Australian art]] gave him international exposure.&lt;ref name="portrait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunmoochin"/&gt; In 1966 Komon arranged a one-man show for Pugh at the Artists' Guild Gallery in [[St Louis]] in the United States;&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;  The [[Commonwealth Institute]] staged a [[retrospective#Visual arts|retrospective]] of his work in 1970.&lt;ref name="portrait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt; He was represented in London by Andre Kalman, who showed him in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1979, and with the Athol Gallery on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="dunmoochin"&gt;{{cite web|title=RESUME OF THE ARTIST|url=http://www.dunmoochin.org/history.htm|publisher=The Dunmoochin Foundation|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Gallery of Australia#Establishment|Historic Memorials Committee]] bought his 1964 portrait of the [[William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle|Governor-General Lord De L'Isle]] and his 1972 portrait of [[Gough Whitlam]].&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Memorials Committee|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/naaresources/publications/research_guides/fedguide/legacy/act/act40.htm|publisher=Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pugh's fame as an artist grew in the 1970s following the print publication of two radio plays by Ivan Smith: ''Death of a Wombat'' and ''Dingo King'', both of which featured Pugh's drawings and paintings.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt;

===Printmaker===

Pugh worked with the [[Printmaking|printmaker]] [[Stanley William Hayter|Stanley Hayter]] for three months in Paris in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teeming with Life: John Olsen.

===Politics and Art===

Pugh chaired the Victorian ALP Arts Policy Committee from 1971, and Gough Whitlam appointed Pugh to the [[Australia Council for the Arts]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt; Pugh made public his disagreements with Council chairman [[H. C. Coombs|H C "Nugget" Coombes]] who refused to implement the policy Pugh and his fellow committee members had crafted and then taken through the processes of the Victorian and Federal ALP conferences to become official ALP arts policy. Pugh resigned from the Council in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nugget Coombs: A Reforming Life|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67783-7|pages=298–299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UT1sM6_KoS8C&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=clifton%20pugh%20%22arts%20policy%20committee%22&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q=clifton%20pugh%20%22arts%20policy%20committee%22&amp;f=false|author=Tim Rowse|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protanope colour vision deficiency===

Pugh's brother and grandnephew had [[protanope]] colour vision deficiency and it is probable that he did on biographical, gene pedigree inheritance and other grounds (such as failing the colour vision test when endeavouring to enlist in the Navy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cole BL, Harris RW |title=Colour blindness does not preclude fame as an artist: celebrated Australian artist Clifton Pugh was a protanope |journal=Clin Exp Optom |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=421–8 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19515095 |doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2009.00384.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

[[File:Portrait of Marlene 1956.png|thumb|150px|''Portrait of a Woman (Marlene Pugh)'' 1956, oil on hardboard]]

Pugh married three times: to June Byford, Marlene Harvey and Judith Ley.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 9096 Papers of Clifton Pugh (1924 - 1990)|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/9096.html|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pugh had two sons with Marlene, Shane and Dailan.&lt;ref name="forty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailan"/&gt;

Pugh became a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] during World War II, while on active service, and retained this position during the Vietnam War. He joined the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt; to campaign for the end of Australia's involvement in that War.&lt;ref name="judith"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unstill Life: Art, Politics and Living with Clifton Pugh|year=2008|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74175-477-3|author=Judith Pugh|pages=131, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The marriage to Marlene ended in 1969, they divorced in 1971.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt; In 1970 Pugh met Judith. He became very well known, as he and Judith used his status as a painter to improve that of the ALP. They did this in order to ensure the election of the ALP as Pugh was an anti war activist.&lt;ref name="judith"/&gt;  They separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judith Pugh v Sally Morrison &amp; Anor|url=http://www.courts.act.gov.au/resources/attachments/Pugh.htm|publisher=Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|accessdate=27 November 2011|location=Canberra|date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived for some years with Adrianne Strammp, who trained as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of Australian art|year=1994|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1688-9|author=Alan McCulloch|author2=Susan McCulloch|page=585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Pugh returned to painting full-time after his experience with the Australia Council, and despite suffering three heart attacks&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Diaries of Donald Friend: 1967-1999|year=2006|publisher=Antipodes Books and Beyond, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-642-27644-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkTCZIK5-VIC&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=clifton%20pugh%20heart%20attack%20bali&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q=clifton%20pugh%20heart%20attack%20bali&amp;f=false|author=Donald Friend|editor=Paul Hetherington|accessdate=27 August 2010|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minor ischaemic episodes, continued to paint and make prints until his fatal heart attack in 1990. Pugh established the Dunmoochin Foundation which now forms part of his legacy, and provides residences for artists in his bush property.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunmoochin"/&gt;

Pugh also donated Dunmoochin land to the Victorian Conservation Trust (now [[Trust for Nature]]) in 1989.&lt;ref name="afterfire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=Port Phillip &amp; Westernport properties |url=http://www.trustfornature.org.au/content.asp?PageId=81|publisher=Trust for Nature (Victoria)|accessdate=2 September 2010|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two plants of national significance have been recorded on this land.&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

'''Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard''' (also known as '''Lotus Ray King'''&lt;ref name="Calisphere"/&gt;) (June 25 1886 - February 10 1971) was an American [[occultist]] who co-founded the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] and served a co-leader of the [[I AM Movement]] with her husband, [[Guy Ballard]]. In 1944, Ballard and her son, Donald Ballard, were charged with [[mail fraud]] and their court case would eventually be ruled by the [[US Supreme Court]] as ''[[United States v. Ballard]]''. Ballard's work with the I AM Movement is considered a predecessor to the current [[new age movement]].&lt;ref name="Christopher1998"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Edna Anne Wheeler was born in 1886 in [[Burlington, Iowa]]. Her mother was Anna Hewitt Pearce and her father was Edward G. Wheeler, a railway clerk.&lt;ref name="ANBLocked"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ballard, Edna Anne Wheeler (25 June 1886–10 February 1971), controversial founders of the "I Am" movement {{!}} American National Biography |url=http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0801884 |website=American National Biography |accessdate=28 November 2018 |language=en |doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0801884}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballard became a concert [[harpist]] in 1912. In 1916, Ballard married [[Guy W. Ballard]]. Two years later, in 1918, she had a child with Guy, named Donald.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt;

==I AM Movement==

The couple resided in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Ballard began working at the Philosopher's Nook, an [[occult]] bookstore. She also served as an editor of ''American Occultists.''&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt;  Guy was also interested in the occult,&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt;  and while hiking at [[Mt. Shasta]] in California in September 1931 he met an individual who claimed to be [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref name="Christopher1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Christopher|title=Alien Intervention: The Spiritual Mission of UFOs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E4kBeK0UrYC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1998|publisher=Huntington House Publishers|isbn=978-1-56384-148-4|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballard called Saint Germain an "ascended master." Guy wrote back to Ballard, telling her about his interaction(s) with St. Germain. In 1931, the couple founded the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] and Saint Germain Press in Chicago. The called the umbrella over the two organizations the [[I AM Movement]].&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt; 

Ballard's role within the Movement was as "accredited messenger of the ascended masters," alongside Guy. However, Ballard eventually took a step back as Guy led the organizations, serving as the primary messenger for St. Germain and other masters, including [[Jesus]]&lt;ref name="Christopher1998"/&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt; The Ballard's believed in [[Reincarnation|past lives]] with Ballard believing she was [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Joan of Arc]] in her past lives.&lt;ref name="Orlando2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Orlando|title=The Book of Apocalypse explained by Archangel Michael and the Family of Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYinMeJFp7IC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|isbn=978-88-88768-17-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Guy died and their son, Donald Ballard became the leader of the I AM Movement.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt; Prior to his father's death, Donald also served as a messenger per the wishes of St. Germain.&lt;ref name="Christopher1998"/&gt; However, both he and Ballard did not serve as primary messenger. Shortly thereafter, Ballard, Donald and other staff members were charged with [[mail fraud]], with the charge being that the Movement was attempting to defraud mail recipients into joining a religion that was known to be false. Ballard was convicted twice, the second time after a ruling was overturned. The case went to the [[US Supreme Court]] and was ruled as ''[[United States v. Ballard]]''.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt; 

Ballard eventually began serving as a messenger for St. Germain and other masters in the fifties and in the sixties she hosted a radio show.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt; 

==Later life and legacy==

Ballard died in February 1971 in Chicago. After her death, the Saint Germain Foundation and press were operated by the board of directors and select "appointed messengers." Additionally, no other Movement members, including appointment messengers, have served as direct messengers of the masters, including St. Germain. During her role as messenger, Ballard left over 2,000 recordings of messages from St. Germain and the masters.&lt;ref name="Ency"/&gt;

This article describes the conventions for using people's '''names in [[France]]''', including the norms of custom and practice, as well as the legal aspects.

==Styles and forms of address==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}

===Madame, Mademoiselle, Monsieur===
In normal polite usage, a person's name is usually preceded by:
* ''Monsieur'', for males (etymologically, ''monsieur'' means "my lord", cf. English "[[:wikt:sir|sir]]"); pronounced {{IPA-fr|məsjø|}}; plural: ''messieurs'', pronounced {{IPA-fr|mesjø|}}; abbreviation: singular ''M.''; plural: ''MM.''. The singular form ''M&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' is very often found, but is considered incorrect by purists, although it appears (together with its rare plural form ''M&lt;sup&gt;rs&lt;/sup&gt;'') in some dictionaries.
* ''Madame'', for females (etymologically, ''madame'' means "my lady", cf. English "[[:wikt:dame|dame]]"); pronounced {{IPA|[madam]}}; plural: ''mesdames'', pronounced {{IPA|[medam]}}; abbreviation: ''M&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt;''; plural: ''M&lt;sup&gt;mes&lt;/sup&gt;''. ''Madame'' must also be used in the case where one does not know whether the addressed woman is married or not and in the case where one does not know whether the addressed woman consider the usage as discriminating or disrespectful.
* ''Mademoiselle'', for an unmarried female (cf. English "[[:wikt:damsel|damsel]]"); pronounced {{IPA|[madmwazɛl]}}; plural: ''mesdemoiselles'', pronounced {{IPA|[medmwazɛl]}}; abbreviation: ''M&lt;sup&gt;lle&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''M&lt;sup&gt;le&lt;/sup&gt;''; plural: ''M&lt;sup&gt;lles&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''M&lt;sup&gt;les&lt;/sup&gt;''. Etymologically, this means "my damsel". This form of address is informal and is now tending to be less used in favour of "madame" by some groups such as women's rights movements,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} because they consider the usage to be discriminating and disrespectful.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, one tendency that remains fairly common is the addressing of young-looking females ''mademoiselle'', and older females ''madame''. Actresses are usually always styled ''mademoiselle'', especially in film or theatre credits, regardless of their age or personal situation; one would thus read ''mademoiselle [[Catherine Deneuve|Deneuve]] est habillée par Soandso''.
Since 2013, French administration does not use the term ''mademoiselle'' anymore for its documents in favour of ''madame'' regardless of the status and the age of the woman addressed.
*''Mondamoiseau'' is an archaic term historically used for a gentleman that had not yet reached the status of ''[[knight|chevalier]]'', and was used in a similar fashion as the modern ''mademoiselle''; plural: ''mesdemoiseaux''. The term has not been in common use since the 17th century, but it can be found in works of classic French literature, such as [[Molière]]'s ''L'Avare''.
*''Maître'', for males and females (etymologically, ''maître'' means "master"); this title is used by lawyers and few other juridical professions, while carrying out their duties, and for some mature male artists; plural: ''maîtres''; abbreviation: M&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;; there is no abbreviation for ''maîtres'', one should use M&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; X and M&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Y.
*''[[Doctor (title)#France|Docteur]]'', for males and females (etymologically, ''docteur'' means "doctor"); this title is reserved for people having a doctorate but tend to be mostly used in everyday language for physician and dentists while carrying out their duties, even when still students thus not having yet a doctorate; plural: ''docteurs''; abbreviation: ''D&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''.

During the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', a female commoner was always addressed as ''mademoiselle'', even when married, ''madame'' being limited to women of the high nobility, even if they were not married. This practice ceased after the [[French Revolution]].

A traditional address to a crowd of people is ''Mesdames, Messieurs'' or ''Mesdames, Mesdemoiselles, Messieurs'' — whose order of words represents decreasing degrees of respect. An informal variant is ''Messieurs-Dames''; it is considered as ill-mannered by purists.

It is normally impolite to address people by their [[given name]]s unless one is a family member, a friend or a close colleague of comparable hierarchic importance. One also does not address people by their last name only unless in a work environment. Also, contrary to English or German usage, it is considered impolite to address someone as ''monsieur X'' when talking to that person: a mere ''monsieur'' should be used, ''monsieur X'' being reserved for talking about M. X to another person.

When speaking of someone, ''monsieur/madame given name [[family name]]'', by far the most polite form of address, is generally reserved for the most solemn occasions. ''Monsieur/madame family name'' or ''given name family name'' is polite and used in normal formal occasions, as well as in the formal quality press (''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', for example). By contrast, in colloquial usage the family names of personalities are used alone. Formally, a married or widowed woman can be called by the given name of her husband (''madame (given name of husband) family name'' or ''madame veuve (given name of husband) family name''); this is now slightly out of fashion, except on formal invitation cards (in France, on a formal invitation card, the traditional formula is always a variant of ''"Madame Jean Dupont recevra..."''. The traditional use of the first name of the woman's husband is now felt in this context as a way to include the husband as equally inviting alongside his wife, while keeping the tradition of reception being formally held by the wife.

In the workplace or in academic establishments, particularly in a male-dominated environment, it is quite common to refer to male employees by their family name only, but to use ''madame'' or ''mademoiselle'' before the names of female employees.

===Military===
{{See also|Ranks in the French Navy|Ranks in the French Army}}

A military officer is addressed by his rank (and under no circumstance by ''monsieur'', but a group of officers can be addressed by plural  ''messieurs''). Male officers of the [[French Army|Army]], the [[Gendarmerie]] and the [[French Air Force|Air Force]] are addressed as ''Mon [rank]'' by inferior ranks and deferential civilians. This usage is said not to be the possessive pronoun ''mon'', but an abbreviation of ''monsieur'': consequently, women are not referred to with ''mon'', but with the rank alone (for example ''Général'' rather than ''mon Général''). Superiors address their inferiors by their rank only, never with ''Mon''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

As a punishment by [[Napoléon Bonaparte]], [[French Navy|Navy]] officers have not been addressed as ''mon'' since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Confusingly, the title generally does not match the rank, but rather an equivalent rank in other forces:  ''lieutenant'' is the form of address for an ''enseigne de vaisseau'', ''capitaine'' for a ''lieutenant de vaisseau'', and ''commandant'' for a ''capitaine de corvette'', ''frégate'', or ''vaisseau''.

In everyday written contexts, ranks are abbreviated.

==Given names==
French people have one, two or more given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost always the first, in the past often the last) is used in daily life (but someone can also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for official documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of ''[[Jacques Chirac]]'' and never of ''Jacques René Chirac''; and ''Henri Philippe Pétain'' is always referred to as [[Philippe Pétain]] (or Marshal Pétain), because ''Philippe'' was the given name that he used in daily life. [[Middle name]]s in the English sense do not exist, and [[middle initial]]s are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite [[Claude Allègre]] as ''Claude J. Allègre'', this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a compound name was fairly common until the early 20th century.

Traditionally, most people were given names from the [[Roman Catholic]] calendar of saints. Common names of this type are ''Jacques'' ([[James (name)|James]]), ''Jean'' ([[John (given name)|John]]), ''Michel'' ([[Michael]]), ''Pierre'' ([[Peter (name)|Peter]]), or ''Jean-Baptiste'' ([[John the Baptist]]) for males; and ''Marie'' ([[Mary (given name)|Mary]]), ''Jeanne'' ([[Jane (given name)|Jane]]), ''Marguerite'' ([[Margaret (name)|Margaret]]), ''Françoise'' ([[Francis (given name)|Frances]]), or ''Élisabeth'' ([[Elizabeth (given name)|Elizabeth]]) for females. In certain regions such as [[Brittany]] or [[Corsica]], more local names (usually of local saints) are often used (in Brittany, for instance, male ''Corentin'' or female ''Anne''; in Corsica, ''Ange'' (suitable both for males and females, French version corresponding to [[Corsican language|Corsican]] ''Angelo'', ''Angela''). However, given names for French citizens from immigrant communities are often from their own culture, such as ''Mohammed, Karim'', ''Saïd'', ''Toufik'', ''Jorge'', etc. for males, ''Fatima'', ''Fatoumata'', etc. for females. Furthermore, in recent decades it has become common to use first names of English or other foreign origin, mainly in the popular classes of the society, such as ''Kevin'', ''Enzo'', or ''Anthony'' (instead of ''Antoine'' in the upper classes) for males; for females, ''Jessica'', ''Jennifer'', ''Karine'' or ''Barbara'' (instead of ''Barbe'', now out-of-fashion, because it sounds exactly the same as ''barbe'' "beard" as in the expression ''la barbe!'' "What a drag! / How boring!"). Also, females are often given names like [[Jacqueline (name)|Jacqueline]] and [[Gerald|Gérald]]ine that are feminine forms of traditional common masculine French names.

The prevalence of given names follows [[Fads and trends|trends]], with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, few children born since 1970 would bear the name ''Germaine'', which is generally associated with the idea of an elderly lady. However, as noted above, such old-fashioned names are frequently used as second or third given names, because in France the second or further given names are traditionally those of the godparents or the grandparents. Some older names, such as ''Suzanne'', ''Violette'', and ''Madeleine'', have become fashionable again in the upper class and in the upper middle class. Others such as ''Jean'', ''Pierre'', ''Louis'', and ''François'' never really went out of fashion. ''Alexandre'' (Alexander) was never very popular, but is not uncommon in middle and upper classes.

Almost all traditional given names are gender-specific. However, a few given names, such as ''Dominique'' (see above: completely gender-neutral), ''Claude'' (traditionally masculine), and ''Camille'' (traditionally masculine, now mostly feminine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/femmes/prenoms/enfant/2009/|title=Les prénoms les plus donnés en 2009|work=linternaute.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), are given to both males and females; for others, the pronunciation is the same but the spelling is different: ''Frédéric'' (m) / ''Frédérique'' (f). In medieval times, a woman was often named ''Philippe'' (Philippa), now an exclusively masculine name (Philip), or a male ''Anne'' (Ann), now almost exclusively feminine (except as second or third given name, mostly in Brittany). From the middle 19th-century into the early 20th-century, ''Marie'' was a popular first name for both men or women, however, before and after this period it has been almost exclusively given to women as a first given name, even if the practice still exists to give it to males as second or third given name, especially in devout Catholic families.

Compound given names, such as ''Jean-Luc'', ''Jean-Paul'', or ''Anne-Sophie'' are not uncommon. These are not considered to be two separate given names. The second part of a compound name may be a given name normally used by the opposite sex. However, the gender of the compound is determined by the first component. Thus, [[Marie-George Buffet]] has a given name considered as female because it begins with ''Marie'', and ''George'' is spelled with a final ''-e'' like all the traditional French female given names, instead of ''[[Georges (disambiguation)|Georges]]'' with ''-es'' for a male. The feminine component in male compound names is mostly ''Marie'', as in [[Jean-Marie Vianney]]. In the past, some Frenchmen would have ''Marie'' or ''Anne'' as first name (example: [[Anne du Bourg]]), which is still nowadays in  practice in rare traditional Catholic families (but then the man will have other given names and one of those will be used in everyday life). Second or third given names, which usually are kept private, may also include names normally used by the opposite gender. For instance, in 2006, 81 Frenchmen have ''Brigitte'' among their given names, 97 ''Catherine'', 133 ''Anne'', and 204 ''Julie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meilleursprenoms.com/stats/histogram.php3?recherche=julie&amp;sexe=1 male INSEE stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320213611/http://meilleursprenoms.com/stats/histogram.php3?recherche=Julie&amp;sexe=1 |date=2007-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the above-described custom of using ''Marie'' for males, this is due to the habit of traditional Catholic French families to give children the names of their godmother and godfather: if there is no counterpart of the opposite gender for the name of the godparent who is not of the same sex as the child, generally the name of the godparent will be left as such. For instance, a male child born to a traditional Catholic family choosing for him the name ''Nicolas'' and whose godparents are called ''Christian'' and ''Véronique'' could be called ''Nicolas Christian Marie Véronique''.{{dubious|date=December 2013}}

First names are chosen by the child's parents. There are no legal ''a priori'' constraints on the choice of names nowadays, but this has not always been the case. The choice of given names, originally limited only by the tradition of naming children after a small number of popular saints, was restricted by law at the end of the 18th century, could be accepted.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10619062"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10619062 |title=Double--hyphen surname law gets both barrels |author=Lichfield, John |date=January 8, 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, actually in 1966, a new law permitted a limited number of mythological, regional or foreign names, substantives (Olive, Violette), diminutives, and alternative spellings.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the birth registrar thinks that the chosen names (alone or in association with the last name) may be detrimental to the child's interests, or to the right of other families to protect their own family name, the registrar may refer the matter to the local prosecutor, who may choose to refer the matter to the local court. The court may then refuse the chosen names. Such refusals are rare and mostly concern given names that may expose the child to mockery.

To change a given name, a request can be made before a court (''juge des affaires familiales''), but except in a few specific cases (such as the Gallicization of a foreign name), it is necessary to prove a legitimate interest for the change (usually that the current name is a cause of mockery or when put together with the surname, it creates a ridiculous word or sentence, e.g.: ''Jean Bon'' sounds ''jambon'' "ham", or ''Annick Mamère'' = ''A nique ma mère'', slang for "she f**ks my mother").

==Family names==
In France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. If the father was unknown, the child was given the family name of the mother. Since 1 January 2005, article 311-21 of the French [[Civil code]] permits parents to give their children the name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both - although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both parents' family names are hyphenated, in alphabetic order, with only the first of their names, if they each have a hyphenated name themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006424849&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid|title=Code civil - Article 311-21 - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1978 declaration by the [[Council of Europe]] requires member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was repeated by the United Nations in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cdw.html|title=U.N. Convention on Discrimination against Women|work=hrweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar measures were adopted by [[Germany]] (1976), [[Sweden]] (1982), [[Denmark]] (1983), [[Spain]] (1999), and [[Austria]] (2013).

In France, a person may use a name of a third party (called the common name)&lt;ref&gt;[http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000685234 Circular of 26 June 1986 implementing Article 43 of Law No. 85-1372 of 23 December 1985.], [[Journal officiel de la République française|JORF]] No. 153 of 3 July 1986, pp. 8245–8247, sur [[Légifrance]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the following circumstances:

*anyone – to add or use the name of a parent whose name he does not bear. This results from the application of Article 43 of Law No. 85-1372 of 23 December 1985. For example, in the case of children of divorced and remarried parents, to help differentiate the family composition.
*married people or widows – by adding or substituting the name of their spouse. Substituting the name of the husband is an established custom but has never been enshrined in law. For example, social security laws require the wife and husband to provide the "maiden name" or birth name. This right also applies to divorced couples, provided that the ex-spouse does not object and the other has a legitimate interest, such as because they have custody of the couple's children.

Since Law No. 2003-516 of 18 June 2003 on the devolution of family names, there is no longer any distinction between the name of the mother and the father. A child may receive the family name of one or the other, or both family names. Decree No. 2004-1159 of 29 October 2004 implemented Law No. 2002-304 of 4 March 2002, provided that children born on or after 1 January 2004 and children changing names, may have or use only the family name of the father or the mother or both family names. However, whichever form is used, a person's name must be used consistently on all identification documents, such as a passport or identity card.

The ratio of the number of family names to the population is high in France, due to the fact that most [[surnames]] had many orthographic and dialectal variants (more than 40 for some), which were registered as separate names around 1880 when "[[:fr:Livret de famille|family vital records booklets]]" were issued. According to the French Institute for Statistics [[INSEE]], more than 1,300,000 surnames were registered in the country between 1891 and 1990, and about 200,000 have disappeared (mainly orthographic variants). It is believed that the number of family names at any time since 1990 hovers between 800,000 and 1,200,000. Not all family names are of French origin, as many families have some immigrant roots.

According to different estimates, 50 to 80 percent of French citizens may bear rare family names (fewer than 50 bearers alive at the census time).

===Particles===
Some French last names include the word ''De-'' ("of") or ''Du-'' (contraction for ''de'' + ''le'' = "of the"), when it is masculine and ''De la-'' when it is feminine, but there are regional variations : in the North of France ''Du-'' is often rendered by ''Dele-'' and in the South of France ''Del-''. When ''de'' is separated, it is known as a [[nobility particle|particle]]. A particle ''de'' should '''not''' be alphabetized in name lists, {{cns|text=whereas a particule ''du'' should be because it results from the contraction of an article.|date=August 2018}} The ''particule'' generally indicates some land or [[feudalism|feudal]] origin of the name, being associated with claims to a place, but this is not always the case. The name [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]], for example, is not a traditional French name with a ''particule'', but a Flemish Dutch name that evolved from a form of ''De Walle'' meaning "the wall". 	

A popular misconception is that the ''particule'' ''De-'' included in the name always indicates membership of the [[nobility]], that is to say, an original separated ''de'' that was linked to the name during the French revolution as ''De-''. That is sometimes true. Almost all nobility titles are of the form [title] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[nobility particle|particle]] [name of the land]: for instance, ''[[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis, duc d'Orléans]]'' ("Louis, [[duke]] of [[Orléans]]"), or simply ''Louis d'Orléans''. However, many non-noble people also have ''particules'' in their names, simply because they indicate some geographic origin or property. An example from current political life is [[Dominique de Villepin]]. Former president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s father had his surname legally changed from "Giscard" to "Giscard d'Estaing" in 1922, claiming the name of a family line extinct since the [[French Revolution]]. 	

Adding a ''particule'' was one way for people of non-noble origins to pretend they were nobles. In the 19th century wealthy commoners buying nobility titles were derisively called ''Monsieur de Puispeu'', a pun on ''depuis peu'' meaning "since recently". Similarly, during the [[French Revolution]], when being associated with the nobility was out of favor and even risky, some people dropped the ''de'' from their name, or omitted the mention of their feudal titles (see image). 	

In some cases, names with ''particules'' are made of a normal family name and the name of an estate (or even of several estates). Thus, Dominique de Villepin is ''Dominique Galouzeau de Villepin''; [[Hélie de Saint Marc]] is ''Hélie Denoix de Saint Marc'' (in both cases, omitting second or other given names). As in these examples, most people with such long family names shorten their name for common use, by keeping only the first estate name (such as Viscount Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon, assuming in everyday life the name of Philippe de Villiers) or, in some cases, only the family name. Whether the family name or the estate name is used for the shortened form depends on a variety of factors: how people feel bearing a ''particule'' (people may for instance dislike the connotations of nobility that the ''particule'' entails; on the other hand, they may enjoy the impression of nobility), tradition, etc. For instance, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is never referred to as "d'Estaing", probably because his ''particule'' is a recent addition to the family surname by his father. On the contrary, he is often simply referred to in the press as "Giscard".

Traditionally, the ''particule'' ''de'' is omitted when citing the name of a person without a preceding given name, title (''baron'', ''duc'' etc.), job description (''général'', ''colonel'', etc.) or polite address (''monsieur'', ''madame'', ''mademoiselle''). Thus, one would say ''Monsieur de La Vieuville'', but if calling him familiarly by his last name only, ''La Vieuville'' (note the initial capital letter); the same applies for ''[[Gérard de La Martinière]]'', who would be called ''La Martinière''. Similarly, [[Philippe de Villiers]] talks about the votes he receives as ''le vote Villiers''. However, this usage is now losing ground to a more egalitarian treatment of surnames; it is, for instance, commonplace to hear people talking of ''de Villiers''. 	
 		
Note that [[American English]] language [[camel case|medial capital]] spellings such as ''DeVilliers'' are '''never''' used in France.

===Changes of names===       &lt;!--  a redirect target  for links from other articles   --&gt;
Contrary to popular belief, and also contrary to the practice of some other countries, French women do not legally change names when they marry. However, it is customary that they take their husband's name as a "usage name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.218.5543&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The surname of married women in the European Union}} [[:fr:Population &amp; Sociétés]] No. 367 of April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a legal obligation (it is a ''contra legem'' custom, as French law since the Revolution requiring that no one may be called by any other name than that written on their birth certificate), and not all women decide to do so. However, if they do, they may retain the use of this name, depending on circumstances, even after a divorce. In some cases, the wife, or both spouses, choose to adopt a double-barreled, hyphenated surname made from joining the surnames of both partners.  Thus, both partners' surnames coexist with whatever usage name they choose.

This distinction is important because many official documents use the person's maiden, or legal or true surname, rather than their usage name.

People may also choose to use other names in daily usage, as long as they are not impersonating others and as long as their usage name is socially accepted. One example of this is the custom of actors or singers to use a [[stage name]]. However, identity documents and other official documents will bear only the "real name" of the person.

In some cases, people change their real name to their stage name; for example, the singer [[Patrick Bruel]] changed his name from his birth name of ''Benguigui''. Another example of aliases being turned into true names: During [[World War II]], some [[French Resistance|Resistance]] fighters (such as [[Lucie Aubrac]]) and Jews fleeing persecution adopted aliases. Some kept the alias as a legal name after the war or added it to their name ([[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]]' name was ''Delmas'', and ''Chaban'' was the last of his wartime aliases; his children  were given the family surname Delmas).

Truly changing one's last name, as opposed to adopting a usage name, is quite complex. Such changes have to be made official by a [[decree|''décret en Conseil d'État'']] taken by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] after approbation by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]]. Requests for such changes must be justified by some legitimate interest, for instance, changing from a foreign name difficult to pronounce in French to a simpler name, or changing from a name with unfavorable connotations.

'''Fritz Yngvar Moen''' (17 December 1941 &amp;ndash; 28 March 2005) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] man [[Miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of two distinct [[felony murder]]s, serving a total of 18 years in prison. After the convictions were quashed, an official inquiry was instigated to establish what had gone wrong in the authorities' handling of the case, and on 25 June 2007 the commission delivered harsh criticism to the [[Norwegian Police Service|police]], the prosecution and the [[Courts of Justice of Norway|courts]] in what was immediately termed Norway's worst [[miscarriage of justice]] of all time.

Moen was deaf and had a severe speech impediment. He was also partially paralysed, but had normal intelligence and good memory.

== Initial conviction and sentencing ==

Moen was convicted for two separate rapes and murders, both in [[Trondheim]]:
* Torunn Finstad, who was reported missing on 4 October 1977 and found dead two days later, having been raped and strangled. Moen was indicted by a [[Frostating]] court for the crime on 11 April 1978. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on 29 May the same year. This sentence was reduced to 16 years on appeal.
* Sigrid Heggheim, who was found dead in September 1976. She had been strangled and an attempt had been made to rape her. The same court indicted Moen for murder and attempted rape on 15 September 1981, and on 19 December he was convicted and sentenced to an additional 5 years. An appeal was rejected.

The prosecuting authorities relied on Moen's confession to the murders, which appears to have been coerced by way of intimidation.

Biological samples were collected at both crime scenes and tested with technology available at the time, but the samples were then lost and destroyed for reasons that remain unclear.

When Moen was convicted, his defence lawyer, Olav Hestenes, announced: "For the first time at this desk, I allow myself to say that a travesty of justice has been committed."

The judge, Karl Solberg, reacted furiously and later applauded the court's verdict. Solberg has become notorious for miscarriages of justice, having also been instrumental in the wrongful conviction of Atle Hage, a father who was convicted of incest, took his own life after his release from prison, and was cleared ten years later when his children testified on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forejustice.org/db/Hage--Atle.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convictions quashed ==

Moen's lawyer requested a new trial for both cases on 2 January 2000. The court accepted the request for the Sigrid Heggheim case, and on 7 October 2004 judge [[Wenche Skjæggestad]] announced that the court had quashed the conviction and acquitted Moen for the rape and attempted murder of Sigrid Heggheim. The court found that the forensic evidence exonerated Moen, and that in any case reasonable doubt should have acquitted him in the first place. Among other things, he had an alibi for the most likely time of the crime. Also, the forensic evidence indicated that the perpetrator had pursued the victim across a field, knocked her down, and then tied her with her own clothes — Moen was partly paralysed and physically incapable of these actions.

The court rejected the appeal against Moen's conviction in the Torunn Finstad case, and on 13 October 2005, the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission received a preliminary application to review the case. When Moen died on 28 March 2005 of natural causes, it became known that he wanted the case on his behalf to continue.

In December 2005, it became known that Tor Hepsø, a convicted criminal with a long history of violence, had made a [[deathbed confession]] to killing both Sigrid Heggheim and Torunn Finstad. On 15 June 2006, the Criminal Cases Review Commission formally accepted the application, and on 24 August 2006, the Frostating court posthumously acquitted Fritz Moen for the rape and murder of Sigrid Heggheim. It found that the preponderance of evidence made Hepsø a more likely suspect, and that Moen's confession was likely coerced and only included information that had been made public. These two acquittals are widely attributed to the work of Moen's defence lawyer [[John Christian Elden]] and private investigator [[Tore Sandberg]].

In the aftermath of the acquittals, Fritz Moen's lawyers filed a civil suit against the Norwegian government seeking 28 million NOK (€3 million). The case was settled in April 2008 when the presiding judge awarded 20 million NOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forlik om Fritz Moen-erstatning|url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article1066854.ece|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case caused widespread public debate in Norway. There were calls for a formal inquiry into the conduct of the prosecutors and police, and in 2008 the newspaper [[Aftenposten]] proposed erecting a bust or statue of Moen in front of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police|Norwegian Ministry of Justice]] as a symbol of the responsibilities of the criminal justice system, although there so far has been no sign of this being taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moen-byste foran Justisdepartementet|url=https://www.nrk.no/arkiv/artikkel/humor/moen-byste-foran-justisdepartementet-1.3186958|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry ==

On 25 June 2007 a commission headed by Henry John Mæland, professor of law at the [[University of Bergen]], delivered its findings to the Norwegian Minister of Justice [[Knut Storberget]]. The commission stated that the [[Right to a fair trial|principle of objectivity]] was violated repeatedly by both the [[Norwegian Police Service|police]] and the [[Courts of Justice of Norway|courts]]. It also found that the most important lesson that could be learned from this case was that the [[presumption of innocence]] must be upheld by both the public prosecutors and the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Norwegian News Agency |author=Norwegian News Agency |title= Krass kritikk i Fritz Moen-saken |url=http://news.no.msn.com/domestic/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=5345945 |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2007 |language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mæland stated that witnesses had been coaxed by the Trondheim police force, while at the same time significant evidence proving Moen's innocence had been withheld from the defence and the courts. "Some of the evidence has basically been hidden within the police reports," Mæland concluded. The justice minister commented during the press conference that "the commission's report shows that grave errors have been committed leading to grave results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Børre O. |last=Haugli |author2=Ida Johansson |title=Politiet slaktes |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/article1150816.ece |work=[[Nettavisen]] |publisher=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2007 |language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was appointed on 8 September 2006 by the [[Council of State (Norway)|Norwegian cabinet]]. Besides Professor Mæland, it consisted of judge Inger Marie Dons Jensen and psychiatrist Ingrid Lycke Ellingsen. Its mandate was to "find out why Moen was wrongfully convicted and evaluate whether changes are needed in the criminal justice system to avoid wrongful convictions in the future".

A book called ''Overgrepet'' (Infringement)'','' by Tore Sandberg, the private investigator involved in Moen's case, was published in October 2007. The book names police officers and other public servants instrumental in Moen's prosecution.

On 5 February 2008, the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament's]] Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs recommended that a commission be appointed to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute for the [[Impeachment (Norway)|impeachment]] of three of the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Norwegian Supreme Court]] justices who presided over the Moen cases. The three were [[Magnus Matningsdal]], [[Karin Maria Bruzelius]] and [[Eilert Stang Lund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Gjerde |title=Stortinget må vurdere riksrett |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2238528.ece |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2008 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208113153/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2238528.ece |archivedate=8 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the case went to the Standing Committee on Justice, it was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Else Gro |last=Ommundsen |title=Høyesterettsdommere stilles ikke for riksrett |url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article348162.ece |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822053950/http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article348162.ece |archivedate=22 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Justice Denied|Justice:Denied]]'', the only wrongful conviction magazine in the United States, published an article about Fritz Moen's case in its Spring 2008 issue: [http://justicedenied.org/issue/issue_40/moen_i-40.pdf "Exonerated Of Two Murders, Fritz Moen Posthumously Awarded $4 Million"].

The conclusion of the inquiry recommended there be no investigation to label responsibility to individual police or judicial officers since "such action would probably lead to the pulverisation of responsibility".

A '''gardener''' is someone who practices [[gardening]], either professionally or as a [[hobby]].

==Description==
[[File:gardening.jpg|thumb|180px|A Gardener.]]
[[File:Royal Gardener John Rose and King Charles II - Hendrick Danckerts 1675.jpeg|thumb|180px|[[Hendrick Danckerts]], Royal Gardener John Rose and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], 1675]]

A gardener is any person involved in gardening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gardener|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gardener|publisher= [[The Free Dictionary]]|access-date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguably the oldest occupation, from the [[hobby]]ist in a [[Garden design|residential garden]], the homeowner supplementing the family food with a small [[Kitchen garden|vegetable garden]] or [[orchard]], to an employee in a [[plant nursery]] or the [[head gardener]] in a [[great house|large estate]].

==Garden design and maintenance==
The garden designer is someone who will design the garden, and the gardener is the person who will undertake the work to produce the desired outcome.

==Design==
The term gardener is also used to describe [[garden design]]ers and [[landscape architecture|landscape gardeners]], who are involved chiefly in the design of gardens, rather than the practical aspects of horticulture. [[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Gertrude Jekyll]] and [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] were garden designers as well as gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Allan Jellicoe|author2=Susan Jellicoe|title=The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TT2TkQEACAAJ|year=1987|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=978-0-500-27431-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garden design is the creation of a plan for the construction of a garden, in a design process. The product is the garden, and the garden designers attempt to optimize the given general conditions of the soil, location and [[climate]], ecological, and geological conditions and processes to choose the right plants in corresponding conditions. The design can include different themes such as perennial, butterfly, wildlife, Japanese, water, [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or shade gardens.  In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to design both private garden spaces, residential estates and parkland, public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks. Professional landscape designers are certified by the [[Association of Professional Landscape Designers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APLD|url=http://www.apld.org/|publisher= [[Association of Professional Landscape Designers]]|access-date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
The designer also provides directions and supervision during construction, and the management of establishment and maintenance once the garden has been created. The gardener is the person who has the skill to maintain the garden's design.

The gardener's labor during the year include planting flowers and other plants, [[weeding]], [[pruning]], [[grafting]], removal of dead flowers, mixing and preparation of [[insecticides]] and other products for treating pests, and tending garden [[compost]]. Weeds tend to thrive at the expense of the more refined edible or ornamental plants. Gardeners need to control weeds using physical or [[herbicide|chemical]] methods to stop weeds from reaching a mature stage of growth when they could be harmful to domesticated plants. Early activities, such as starting young plants from seeds for later transplantation, are usually performed in early spring.

'''Gaston Glock''' (born 19 July 1929) is an [[Austria]]n [[engineer]], and founder of the firearms company [[Glock Ges.m.b.H.|Glock]].

A book about Gaston Glock's life and his company, titled ''[[Glock: The Rise of America's Gun]]'', was published in 2012.

==Manufacturing==
Glock began as a manufacturer of curtain rods and knives for the Austrian military. He had not designed or manufactured a firearm until he was 52 years old. He was already an expert in polymers as a result of his previous business ventures.

In 1980 he bought an injection-moulding machine to manufacture handles and sheaths for the [[Glock knife|field knives]] he was making for the Austrian army in his garage workshop. His earliest employees were from the camera industry and were experts in producing polymer components. His first pistol took one year to produce from the design and concept stage to production, and he applied for an Austrian patent in April 1981 for the pistol known as the [[Glock|Glock 17]].&lt;ref name="Barrett2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Paul M.|title=Glock: The Rise of America's Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPNAkiAnm7cC|year=2013|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=978-0-307-71995-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Glock married Helga Glock in 1958, and they co-founded the family business in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/oct/13/guns-money-misery-gaston-glock-lawsuit|title=Guns, money and misery: billionaire Gaston Glock’s ex-wife sues for $500m|first=Mark|last=Hooper|date=13 October 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 2011 and have been in litigation since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-30/glock-defeats-ex-wife-s-500-million-shotgun-racketeering-suit|title=Glock Defeats Ex-Wife’s $500 Million ‘Shotgun’ Racketeering Suit|date=30 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glock supports different charities in Austria, having donated over one million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghpc.at/de/charity|title=Charity donations as documented by the Glock-organization GHPC|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018101929/http://www.ghpc.at/de/charity|archivedate=2012-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Glück für Glock | newspaper = [[Kleine Zeitung]] | date = 29 July 2011 | url = http://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/villachland/velden_am_woerther_see/2796737/glueck-fuer-glock.story | accessdate = 19 September 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110925113658/http://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/villachland/velden_am_woerther_see/2796737/glueck-fuer-glock.story | archivedate = 25 September 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Doppelte Hilfe für die Flutopfer| url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/wolfsberg/3160366/doppelte-hilfe-fuer-flutopfer.story| accessdate=7 January 2013| newspaper=[[Kleine Zeitung]]| date=7 November 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203212549/http://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/wolfsberg/3160366/doppelte-hilfe-fuer-flutopfer.story| archivedate=3 February 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder attempt==
In July 1999, Glock's tax advisor Charles Ewert hired a French mercenary to murder Glock with a hammer in a car park in an apparent attempt to cover up embezzlement of millions from the Glock company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/jim-armitage-dont-mess-with-gaston-hes-still-got-his-hand-on-the-glock-8706719.html|title=Jim Armitage: Don't mess with Gaston – he's still got his hand on|date=13 July 2013|publisher=''The Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Glock's injuries included seven head wounds and the loss of about a litre of blood, Glock was able to fend off the attack by striking the hitman twice. The hired killer, 67-year-old Jacques Pêcheur, was sentenced to 17 years in prison for the attack. Charles Ewert was sentenced to 20 years as a result of Pêcheur's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Machan | first = Dyan | title = Top Gun | newspaper = [[Forbes]] | date = 31 March 2003 | url = https://www.forbes.com/global/2003/0331/020.html | accessdate = 19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversy over [[George W. Bush]]'s military service''' in the [[Air National Guard of the United States|Air National Guard]] was an issue that first gained widespread public attention during the [[2004 U.S. presidential campaign|2004 presidential campaign]]. The controversy centered on [[Texas Air National Guard]], why he lost his flight status, and whether he fulfilled the requirements of his military service contract.

==Timeline==
George W. Bush joined the [[147th Fighter Interceptor Group]] of the [[Texas Air National Guard]] on May 27, 1968, during the [[Vietnam War]]. He committed to serve until May 26, 1974, with two years on active duty while training to fly and four years on part-time duty.&lt;ref name="lardner19990728"&gt;Lardner, George Jr. and Lois Romano. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush072899.htm  At Height of Vietnam, Bush Picks Guard]" ''[[Washington Post]]'', July 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1968 Statement of Intent (undated), he wrote, "I have applied for pilot training with the goal of making flying a lifetime pursuit and I believe I can best accomplish this to my own satisfaction by serving as a member of the Air National Guard as long as possible."

Following his six weeks of basic training, Bush began 54 weeks of flight training at [[Moody Air Force Base]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200402180840.asp |title=Bush and the National Guard: Case Closed |author=Byron York |publisher=''[[National Review]]'' |date=February 18, 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1969, Bush began 21 weeks of fighter interceptor training on the [[F-102]] in Houston at the 147th's Combat Crew Training School, soloing in March 1970 and graduating in June 1970. When he graduated, he had fulfilled his two-year active-duty commitment.&lt;ref name="lardner19990728"/&gt;

In November 1970, [[Lieutenant colonel|Lt. Col.]] [[Jerry B. Killian]], commander of the [[111th Fighter Squadron]], recommended that Bush be promoted to [[First Lieutenant]], calling him "a dynamic outstanding young officer" who stood out as "a top notch fighter interceptor pilot." He said that "Lt. Bush's skills far exceed his contemporaries," and that "he is a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership. Lt. Bush is also a good follower with outstanding disciplinary traits and an impeccable military bearing." Bush was promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DB1F3AF937A25751C0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Files Offer Glimpse of Bush After College | first=Richard W. | last=Stevenson | date=February 14, 2004 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air National Guard]] members could volunteer for active duty service with the Air Force in a program called Palace Alert, which deployed F-102 pilots to Europe and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. According to three pilots from Bush's squadron, Bush inquired about this program but was advised by the base commander that he did not have the necessary flying experience (500 hours) at the time and that the F-102 would soon be retired.&lt;ref name="lardner19990728"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Isaac |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4271922/ |title=War Stories - Newsweek Campaign 2004 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216040554/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4271922/ |archivedate=December 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's four-year part-time obligation to serve required him to maintain his immediate readiness to be recalled to active duty in the event of a national emergency. Bush performed part-time Guard duty as an F-102 pilot through April 1972, logging a total of 336 flight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040907-113844-8255r.htm |title=Inside Politics |work=Washington Times |date=September 7, 2004 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to April 1972, Bush had fulfilled more than the required hours of service, but with more than two years remaining before his discharge.  He volunteered his services on several projects, including a political campaign. After April 1972, Bush may have failed to meet the attendance requirements established for members of the Air National Guard. In mid-1972, he failed to meet the Air Force requirement for an annual physical examination for pilots, and lost his authorization to be a pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factcheck.org/democratic_groups_ad_revives_awol_allegation_against.html |title=Democratic Group's Ad Revives "AWOL" Allegation Against Bush |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120133253/http://www.factcheck.org/democratic_groups_ad_revives_awol_allegation_against.html |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |publisher=FactCheck.org |accessdate=May 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bush's pay records, he did not attend any drills between mid-April and the end of October 1972. He drilled in Alabama in October and November 1972, and again in January 1973; what duties he performed are unknown. Bush returned to his home unit in Houston and was paid for his service in April 1973 through July 1973; again, what duties he performed are not documented in any way.

On October 1, 1973, Bush was [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve's inactive reserves in [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/bushdocs/2-Discharge.pdf |title=Latest World &amp; National News &amp; Headlines |website=Usatoday.Com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, ending his military service.

==Acceptance into the Air National Guard==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pres GW Bush mounting jet.jpg|thumb|Lt. Bush at a F-102 Delta Dagger jet]] --&gt;
During the 1968–1974 period, Presidents [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] decided against calling up National Guard units for service in Vietnam. However, military documents show during the Vietnam War, almost 23,000 Army and Air Guardsmen were called up for a year of active duty; some 8,700 were deployed to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ng.mil/About/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117043307/http://www.ng.mil/About/default.aspx |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Ben Barnes (politician)|Ben Barnes]], former Democratic Speaker of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]], gave testimony in a deposition for a lawsuit related to the Texas lottery; and following the deposition, his lawyer issued a statement to the press. According to the statement, Barnes had called the head of the Texas Air National Guard, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] James Rose, to recommend Bush for a pilot spot at the request of Bush family friend Sidney Adger.  The statement also said, "Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush family asked Barnes' help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes' recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Michael|title=Man Says He OK'd Bush for Guard | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19990927/aponline190140_000.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=September 27, 1999 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While working as an active fundraiser for [[John Kerry]], Bush's opponent during the 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Joel |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/18/politics/main624711.shtml |title=Kerry Keeping Eye On Big Donors |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2004-06-18 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes repeated that he used his political influence to preferentially refer people to the National Guard, including Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= New Questions On Bush Guard Duty | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/08/60II/main641984.shtml | accessdate=November 19, 2009 |date=September 8, 2004 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both George W. Bush and his father have stated that they did not ask Adger to intercede and were unaware of any action he may have taken. Walter Staudt, the [[colonel]] in command of Bush's squadron, has stated that he accepted Bush's application without receiving any outside pressure to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In applying for pilot training, Bush took a standardized test on which he had a low score, in the 25th percentile. In addition, Bush had two arrests for college pranks and four traffic offenses before applying for pilot training. In 2004, former and current military pilots said it was uncommon for an applicant to be accepted into pilot school with such a record, though there was no specific score that disqualified a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why Bush stopped flying remains a mystery|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-02-15-bush-record_x.htm|website = USATODAY.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22|date = February 15, 2004|last = Moniz|first = Dave|last2 = Drinkard|first2 = Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight performance and flight status in 1972 and 1973==

===Final flights===
Flight logs released in September 2004 in response to a lawsuit (see [[#Release of military records|below]]) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102A Delta Dagger]], a single-seater [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], for most of his career, flew nine times in [[Lockheed T-33|T-33]] [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]] in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months.&lt;ref name="AP-9-10-04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-9-11-2004"&gt;[http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2004/09/11/build/nation/60-bush-pilot.inc "Bush flew in training planes before losing pilot privileges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021131053/http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews%2F2004%2F09%2F11%2Fbuild%2Fnation%2F60-bush-pilot.inc |date=October 21, 2007 }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', September 11, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter.&lt;ref name="WJWB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eastman|first=Susan Cooper|title=Fear of Flying|url=http://wjwb.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WJWB/MGArticle/JWB_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1031778123118&amp;path=!frontpage|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=WJWB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825152157/http://wjwb.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WJWB%2FMGArticle%2FJWB_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1031778123118&amp;path=%21frontpage|archivedate=August 25, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said Bush could have just been practicing landing skills. "It doesn't mean anything to have multiple approaches," Weaver said.&lt;ref name="AP-9-10-04"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,131961,00.html |title=Experts Examine Bush Pilot Logs |publisher=Associated Press'' |date=September 10, 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final two entries of Bush's official flight logs show him being assigned to work as an instructional pilot in late May 1972 at a Texas Air National Guard base, although he had left for Alabama in mid-May (see [[#Equivalent duty in Alabama|below]]) and his pay records show he was not paid for any work on the two dates of the instructional pilot assignment.  Coding on the logs showed these assignments were subsequently deleted from the official record.&lt;ref name="AP-9-10-04"/&gt;

===Flight physical===
By regulation, all Air Force pilots were required to take and pass an annual physical in order to remain in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6). Bush did not take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/gwbush/gwb72-73milpay-p1.html |title=FindLaw - Military Records of President George W.

Air National Guard regulations require that "the local commander who has authority to convene a Flying Evaluation Board will direct an investigation as to why the individual failed to accomplish the medical examination." But there are no records of an investigation or of any requests to complete one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gaps Remain In Bush Guard Service|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/03/politics/main615317.shtml|website = |accessdate = 2015-10-17|date = May 3, 2004|last = Lester|first = Beth|publisher = CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the previous two physicals that Bush had taken were done by flight surgeons, Bush said in 2000 that he wanted to wait to take the physical until it could be done by his own private doctor. But regulations require that the physical be performed by an Air Force doctor.&lt;ref name="CBSGaps"/&gt; Air Force flight surgeons were assigned to [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], located across town from Maxwell AFB at the [[Montgomery Air National Guard Base|Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base]] at [[Montgomery Regional Airport|Dannelly Field]] airport, where Bush was paid for drilling in October and November 1972 and in January 1973, his only drilling dates between April 1972 and April 1973.

According to his released military records, after April 1972 Bush never flew again as an Air National Guard pilot.

==Drill attendance in 1972 and 1973==
During 2004, [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Terry McAuliffe]] and others accused Bush of being absent without leave ([[AWOL]]) from the Air National Guard in 1972–73.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/09/20/bush_guard_records/index.html "Bush in the National Guard: A Primer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830011231/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/09/20/bush_guard_records/index.html |date=August 30, 2008 }} Salon.com – September 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[White House]] communications director [[Dan Bartlett]] and others, who called the charge election-year propaganda, noted that Bush was honorably discharged&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt; and that no AWOL charge had ever been made against Bush by the National Guard.

Released military records show that Bush's documented service record through mid-April 1972 (Bush drilled on the 15th and 16th of that month) was without gaps; the period in question is from May 1972 forward.

===Transfer request===
On May 24, 1972, Bush submitted a form requesting a transfer to the [[9921st Air Reserve Squadron]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Reese R. Bricken. According to the request form, Bush was already in Alabama at work on the Senate campaign of [[Winton M. Blount]], who was a friend of his father. Jimmy Allison, a longtime family friend, helped Bush get the campaign work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elizabeth |first=Mary |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/09/02/allison/index.html |title=George W. Bush's missing year |publisher=Salon.com |date=September 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, Bricken approved Bush’s application for transfer. Bricken wrote: "You already understand that this is a Training Category G, Pay Group None, Reserve Section MM proposition." As an obligated Reservist, Bush was in Training Category "fA", which required a minimum of 48 periods of inactive duty training, and 15 days of active duty training, and was required to remain in that Training Category. Training Category "G" offered no training at all. According to Air Force regulations (AFM 35-3, paragraph 14-6), being in "Training Category A" meant that "If a member...will be unable to further train with his unit because of an impending change of residence,...he is required to sign a statement that he has been counseled." That counseling included notifying Bush of his obligation to find a new unit with which he could fulfill his training obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/lechliter.pdf |format=PDF |title=President George W. Bush’s Military Service: A Critical Analysis |author=Gerald A. Lechliter |date=2004 |website=Nytimes.com |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) rejected Bush's transfer request, saying that he could not be reassigned to an Air Reserve Squadron because of his obligated service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glcq.com/docs/transfer_rejection.jpg |title=Memo, Subject: Application for Reserve Assignment, Bush, George W., 1st Lt |publisher=Air Reserve Personnel Center |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bricken, asked about the matter in 2000, said that Bush made no effort to participate as a Guardsman with the 9921st.&lt;ref name="Globe gap"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Walter V. |title=1-year gap in Bush's Guard duty |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2000/05/23/1_year_gap_in_bushs_guard_duty?pg=full |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=May 23, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104012330/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2000/05/23/1_year_gap_in_bushs_guard_duty?pg=full |archivedate=November 4, 2005 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalent duty in Alabama ===
Bush remained obligated to train with his Texas unit, or to perform substitute training elsewhere each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/10/bush_credited_for_guard_drills/ |title=Bush credited for Guard drills|work=The Boston Globe |date= February 10, 2004| first=Walter V. | last=Robinson|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206113258/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/10/bush_credited_for_guard_drills/|archivedate=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 1972, he requested permission to "perform equivalent duty" at the [[187th Fighter Wing|187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group]] in Alabama "for the months of September, October, and November." He did not receive approval to do so, though his commanding officer recommended he be granted permission.  He would have reported to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] William Turnipseed, the base commander, for drills on October 7 and 8, and November 4 and 5 (the September drill dates of the unit had already passed). Bush's grandfather, former U.S. Senator [[Prescott Bush]], died of cancer on October 8, and Bush served as a pallbearer at the funeral in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. Turnipseed has said that he could not recall whether Bush reported on those occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7372-2004Feb2.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Bush's Guard Service In Question | first=Lois | last=Romano | date=February 3, 2004 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, John "Bill" Calhoun, a former [[Alabama Air National Guard]] officer who had served at the [[Montgomery Air National Guard Base|Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base]] in Montgomery, home of the 187th, said he had seen Bush report for duty "at least six times" in the spring and summer of 1972, a period he had not even applied for, and that Bush had in fact spent time in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-13-bush-military_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Former Guardsman: Bush served with me in Alabama | date=February 13, 2004 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the payment and retirement records the White House handed out three days prior to Calhoun's claims show that Bush received no pay or attendance credits during that May to October period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=1257 |title=W's AWOL Spin Update! |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama, on which Bush worked, ended on November 7, 1972, when Blount lost overwhelmingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m7JPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=clIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1372,2968177&amp;dq=winton+blount+1972+senate&amp;hl=en |title=Nixon Went It Alone for Sweeping Victory |work=The Bryan Times |date=November 9, 1972 |author=Mike Feinsilber |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released military records show that Bush was paid for service for the days of October 28–29 and November 11–14, 1973, and for January 4–6 and 8–10, 1973, and that he received a dental examination at Dannelly on January 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=[[The Nation]]| date=February 19, 2004| url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=1264| title= What Bush's Guard File Reveals| accessdate=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6257505/ |title=More Bush service documents found - Politics |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of those dates are outside of the period that was claimed for Bush's service in Alabama. 

A 2006 column in the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' (Alabama) reported about people who remembered Bush when he was in Alabama, working for the Blount campaign: "None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard. Some heard he was serving but never saw for themselves." Opinions of him during his time working on the campaign ranged from good (amiable, well liked, and fond of sports) to bad (bragging about drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living).&lt;ref name="Birmingham 2004"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackledge|first=Brett J.|title=Bush Remembered From Social Contacts|url=http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1077963426278660.xml|work=The Birmingham News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607150053/http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1077963426278660.xml|archivedate=June 7, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winton Blount's son Tom said "He was an attractive person, kind of a 'frat boy.' I didn't like him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Village Voice]]|date=February 11, 2004|url= http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0406,mondo1,50942,6.html |title= Dubya in 'Bama: 'God's Gift to Women' | accessdate=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 and 1973, Bush dated Mavanee Bear, another member of Blount's campaign staff. Bear said in 2009 that "I know [Bush] served" while in Alabama because he had to regularly reschedule meetings, but also said "I didn't see him in uniform." When later back in Texas, she said she frequently saw him in uniform, stating "I think he was mostly just flying in circles over Houston."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=Jane |url=http://newyorker.com/printable/?talk/040301ta_talk_mayer |title=Old Flames: The Guard Years |work=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728095327/http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?talk%2F040301ta_talk_mayer |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a document dated May 2, 1973, Bush's immediate superiors gave him his [[performance appraisal|annual performance review]] for the period from May 1, 1972, to April 30, 1973. The review stated that "Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of the report." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Beth Lester |title=Gaps Remain In Bush Guard Service |date=May 3, 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-22 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/03/politics/main615317.shtml |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Col. William D. Harris Jr. and Lt. Col. [[Jerry B. Killian]] also wrote, "A civilian occupation made it necessary for him to move to Montgomery, Ala. He cleared this base on May 15, 1972 and has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status with the 187 Tac Recon Gp. Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama."

=== Return to Houston ===
Back in Houston, in late 1972 or early 1973, Bush did unpaid volunteer work for a number of months with an inner-city poverty program, Project P.U.L.L. (Professional United Leadership League), the brainchild of John White, a former professional football player and civic leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 23, 2004 |publisher=Knight-Ridder |title=Former Workers Dispute Bush's Pull in Project P.U.L.L. |author=Meg Laughlin |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1023-03.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527011318/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1023-03.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was paid for drilling on April 7–8, 1973. That service presumably occurred at his home base, [[Ellington Air Force Base]], in Houston, in contradiction to the information in his performance review. For May 1973, Bush was paid for service on fifteen days: 1–3, 8–11, 19–20, 22–24, and 29-31. For June, he was paid for five days; for July (his last month of drilling) for 19 days. However there is nothing in the released military documents that shows that he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed.&lt;ref name="CBSGaps"/&gt; As of the end of July 1973, Bush had been in the Air National Guard for a little over five years.

==Six-year service obligation==
On May 27, 1968, Bush signed a six-year obligation. That required him to complete "48 scheduled inactive-duty training periods" each fiscal year (typically consisting of four four-hour periods during one weekend each month), plus a minimum of 15 days of Annual Active Duty Training. For Bush, as a pilot, this was typically split into periods of duty of a few days each during the year.

The ''Boston Globe'' reported in September 2004 that "Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligation", citing examples of Bush failing to meet Air National Guard commitments in 1972 and 1973.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobeShort"/&gt; Bush's military records show that he was credited for attending Air National Guard drills during 1972 and 1973, but the time frame of these drills (see above) still left questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Walter V. |title=Bush credited for Guard drills: But time frame leaves questions |url=http://liveweb.web.archive.org/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/10/bush_credited_for_guard_drills/?page=2 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414074902/http://liveweb.web.archive.org/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/10/bush_credited_for_guard_drills/?page=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 1973, his last day of paid service in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush signed a statement that "I have been counseled this date regarding my plans to leave my present Reserve of [sic] assignment due to moving from this area. I understand that: a. If I disassociate from my current Ready Reserve Assignment, it is my responsibility to locate and be assigned to another Reserve Forces unit or mobilization augmentation position. If I fail to do so, I am subject to involuntary order to active duty for up to 24 months under the provisions of AFM 35-3, chapter 14."&lt;ref name="BostonGlobeShort"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/08/bush_fell_short_on_duty_at_guard/ |title=Bush fell short on duty at Guard |work=Boston Globe  |date=September 8, 2004 |accessdate=2010-05-24 |author=Walter V. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 1973, Bush requested discharge from Texas Air National Guard service, to be effective on October 1. He wrote, "I am moving to Boston, Massachusetts to attend [[Harvard Business School]] as a full time student."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George W. Bush's letter of request for discharge for the Texas Air National Guard |date=September 5, 1973 |url=http://users.cis.net/coldfeet/doc27.gif |accessdate=June 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530012148/http://users.cis.net/coldfeet/doc27.gif |archivedate=May 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Killian recommended approval of the discharge the following day. Bush had completed five years, four months, and five days toward his six-year service obligation.

On October 1, 1973, Bush was [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve's inactive reserves in [[Denver]], Colorado. On November 21, 1974, he was discharged from the Air Force Reserve, ending his military service.

In September 2004, [[Lawrence Korb]], an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan, after reviewing the payroll records for Bush's last two years of service, concluded that they indicated that Bush did not fulfill his obligations and could have been ordered to active duty as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roane |first=Kit R. |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/roane040908.htm |title=Bush's military service in question – again (9/8/04) |publisher=USNews.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release of military records==
During the 2000 presidential campaign, various military records of Bush were made public by the Bush campaign.

On February 13, 2004, during Bush's re-election campaign, more than 700 additional pages of documents on Bush's service were released, including those from the [[National Personnel Records Center]], under the provisions of the [[United States FOIA|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bush's National Guard Pay Records Are Released|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/11/us/bush-s-national-guard-pay-records-are-released.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-02-11|access-date = 2015-10-17|issn = 0362-4331|first = Elisabeth|last = Bumiller}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release was claimed by some to contradict the statement that Bush made on February 8, 2004 to ''Meet the Press'' interviewer [[Tim Russert]], that "We did [authorize the release of everything] in 2000, by the way." In response, Bush contended that he was referring only to documents already in his possession, as opposed to the newly released documents from military sources.

On June 22, 2004, The [[Associated Press]] sued the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], seeking access to all of Bush's records during his military service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pentagon Says Bush Records of Service Were Destroyed|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/09/politics/campaign/09records.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-07-09|access-date = 2015-10-17|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ralph|last = Blumenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2004, [[the Pentagon]] reported that the [[microfilm]]ed payroll records of Bush and numerous other service members had been inadvertently ruined in 1996 and 1997 by the [[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]] during a project to salvage deteriorating microfilm. The records lost included those covering July through September 1972, when Bush's claims of service in Alabama were in question, and the Pentagon reported that no paper backups could be found.&lt;ref name="CBSGaps"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Joel |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/03/politics/main615317.shtml |title=Gaps Remain In Bush Guard Service |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2004-05-03 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On July 23, 2004, the Pentagon reported that the records it had previously reported destroyed had been found. A Pentagon official said the earlier statement that the records were destroyed was an "inadvertent oversight." The Pentagon released computerized payroll records covering Bush's 1972 service. Like the records released earlier by the White House, the newly released documents did not indicate that Bush performed any drills, in Alabama or elsewhere, during May through September 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bush Service Records From &amp;#39;72, Thought Lost, Are Discovered|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/24/politics/campaign/24records.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-07-24|access-date = 2015-10-17|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ralph|last = Blumenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 2004, the White House released the flight logs recording the flights done by Bush as a pilot. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the logs were found at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, which is the central repository for veterans' records. She said the logs were found among a batch of records sent to St. Louis from [[Norton Air Force Base]] in 1993, which were originally thought to contain records of active-duty officers rather than of National Guardsmen such as Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pentagon Releases Bush's Long-Sought Military Records|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/08/politics/campaign/pentagon-releases-bushs-longsought-military-records.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-09-08|access-date = 2015-10-17|issn = 0362-4331|first = Elisabeth|last = Bumiller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2004, under court order resulting from an earlier FOIA lawsuit filed by the Associated Press, the Pentagon released more documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Judge orders all Bush records released | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6022115|website=Msnbc.msn.com | accessdate=October 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2004, the White House released a November 1974 document, saying it had been in Bush's personnel file and that it had been found by the Pentagon.

On October 5, 2004, more than a week after a court-imposed deadline to turn over all records of Bush's military service, the Texas Air National Guard produced two previously unreleased documents (four pages of records) that included Bush's orders for his last day of active duty in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MILITARY RECORDS; Texas Unit Releases More on Bush|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-10-06|access-date = 2015-10-17|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2004, two weeks after Texas National Guard officials signed an oath swearing they had turned over all records, the Texas National Guard released 31 additional pages of documents found by two retired Army lawyers who went through Guard files under an agreement between the Texas National Guard and The Associated Press, which sued to gain access to the files. A Guard spokesman defended the continuing discoveries, saying Guard officials did not find all of Bush’s records because they were disorganized and in poor shape. "These boxes are full of dirt and rat [excrement] and dead bugs. They have never {{sic}} been sitting in an uncontrolled climate," said Lt. Col. John Stanford. "It’s a tough task to go through archives that were not set up in a way that you could easily go through them."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

==Memos allegedly from Jerry Killian==
{{Main|Killian documents}}
{{See also|Killian documents authenticity issues}}
The "Killian documents" were initially claimed by CBS to have come from the "personal files" of the late Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, Bush's squadron commander during Bush's Air National Guard service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= New Questions On Bush Guard Duty | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/08/60II/main641984.shtml | accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=September 8, 2004 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe preferential treatment during Bush's service, including pressure on Killian to "sugar coat" an annual officer rating report for the then 1st Lt. Bush. CBS aired the story on September 8, 2004, amid more releases of Bush's official records by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], including one just the day before as the result of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] lawsuit by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AP Sues for Bush Guard Records | website=Editorandpublisher.com | url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/departments/newsroom/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000543184 | accessdate=October 3, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210121925/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/departments/newsroom/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000543184 | archivedate=December 10, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Killian documents are widely considered to be fake. Starting with a [[Free Republic]] web posting by Harry MacDougald, a conservative Republican lawyer posting under the blogger name, "Buckhead."  MacDougald and multiple fellow bloggers claimed that the formatting shown in the documents used proportional fonts that did not come into common use until the mid-to-late 1990s and alleged that the documents were therefore likely forgeries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Buckhead," who said CBS memos were forged, is a GOP-linked attorney |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002039080_buckhead18.html |accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=March 18, 2002 |work=The Seattle Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809230831/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002039080_buckhead18.html |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= After Blogs Got Hits, CBS Got a Black Eye | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34153-2004Sep19.html | accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=September 19, 2004 | work=The Washington Post | first=Howard | last=Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the widely publicized rationale of "Buckhead" was technically inaccurate, both related and unrelated serious challenges to the authenticity of the documents nonetheless exist. For instance, it is unlikely that the typewriters available to Killian's secretary could have produced such a document, and the documents contained U.S. Army, rather than U.S. Air Force, jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Drum |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/04/bush-national-guard-story-lives |title=The Bush National Guard Story Lives! |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/bush.html |title=Are the Bush Documents Fakes? |website=Site.xavier.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-24/ex-60-minutes-producer-is-no-hollywood-hero |title=Ex-'60 Minutes' Producer Is No Hollywood Hero |publisher=Bloomberg View |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004692.php |title=Killian Finale? |publisher=[[Washington Monthly]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/truth-or-consequences/ |title=Truth or Consequences |website=Texasmonthly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forgery allegations subsequently came to the attention of the mainstream media, especially after experts also questioned the documents' authenticity and lack of a chain of custody.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/graphics/cbsdocs_091804.html The Paper Trail: A Comparison of Documents] [[Washington Post]], September 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapoexpert&gt;Kurtz, Howard [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21675-2004Sep14.html?nav=hcmodule Document Experts Say CBS Ignored Memo 'Red Flags'] ''[[Washington Post]]'', (September 14, 2004) Accessed April 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21939.html?cprose%3D5-39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230255/http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21939.html?cprose=5-39 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original documents have never been submitted for authentication. The man who delivered the copies, Lt. Col. [[Bill Burkett]], a former officer in the Texas Army National Guard and outspoken Bush critic, claimed that he burned the originals.  Burkett admitted lying to CBS and ''USA Today'' about where he had obtained the papers and eventually expressed doubts of his own about their authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moniz |first=Dave |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-cover-guard_x.htm |title=CBS backs off Guard story |website=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS and [[Dan Rather]] initially defended the documents and the report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= CBS Stands By Bush-Guard Memos | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/11/politics/main642787.shtml | accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=September 11, 2004 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on September 20, 2004 – less than two months before Election Day, CBS News stated that it had been "misled" and that it could not authenticate the documents and should not have used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= CBS: Bush Memo Story A 'Mistake' | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/21/politics/main644719.shtml | accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=September 21, 2004 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later ''60 Minutes'' broadcast an interview with Marian Carr Knox, secretary to Killian at the time, who stated that she "didn't type these memos", although she stated she had typed memos of similar content.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Leung, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-the-record-bush-documents-15-09-2004/ For the Record: Bush Documents], Sep 15 2004 (retrieved May 3, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; CBS then formed an independent panel headed by former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and retired [[Associated Press]] president Louis D. Boccardi to investigate the story and the handling of the Killian memos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= CBS Names Memo Probe Panel | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/06/politics/main641481.shtml | accessdate=October 3, 2007 |date=September 6, 2004 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report of the panel, while not addressing the authenticity of the documents, faulted many of the decisions made in developing the story, and producer [[Mary Mapes]] along with  three others were forced to resign from CBS News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= CBS Ousts 4 For Bush Guard Story | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/10/national/main665727.shtml | accessdate=October 4, 2007 |date=October 4, 2007 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the panel report being completed, Rather announced the date of his retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Dan Rather to Step Down at CBS | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7313-2004Nov23.html | accessdate=October 4, 2007 |date=November 23, 2004 | work=The Washington Post | first=Howard | last=Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; left ''60 Minutes Wednesday'', stepped down as anchor on March 9, 2006, and then left CBS altogether on June 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Dan Rather Signs Off | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/19/national/main1727285.shtml | accessdate=October 4, 2007 | date=June 19, 2006 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBS news show that had aired the memos, ''60 Minutes Wednesday'', was canceled on May 18, 2005, allegedly due to poor ratings and not because of the memos broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= '60 Minutes' Wednesday Canceled | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/18/60II/main696185.shtml | accessdate=October 4, 2007|date=May 18, 2005 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Rather sued CBS and its former parent company, Viacom, for US$70 million, claiming that he had been made a "[[scapegoat]]" over the memos story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Rather sues CBS for $70 million, saying he was made a scapegoat | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/09/20/rather_sues_cbs_for_70_million_saying_he_was_made_a_scapegoat/ | date=September 20, 2007|accessdate=October 4, 2007 | work=The Boston Globe | first1=Samuel | last1=Maull}}&lt;/ref&gt; His legal fight with CBS ended in January 2010 when the New York State Supreme Court declined to hear his motion to reinstate his lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dan Rather loses bid in CBS lawsuit |date=January 13, 2010|author= [[Matea Gold]] |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/13/entertainment/la-et-rather13-2010jan13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gil Juco Puyat Sr.''' (September 1, 1907 – March 22, 1981) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] statesman and businessman who served as a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] of the [[Philippines]] from 1951, and as [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from 1967 to 1972.

==Education==
Having been exposed to the world of business, Puyat was inevitably drawn to a course in commerce for his higher education. This he pursued at the [[University of the Philippines]] where he topped his class. Even as a student, he was already immersed in intricate operations of finance and expense, of capital and production, and of management labor handling. He became an active member of the business-oriented [http://iskwiki.upd.edu.ph/index.php/Pan_Xenia_Fraternity#.WCIBMfl95PY Pan Xenia Fraternity]. He was also later inducted into [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]] as an honorary member.

==Early career==
He became a member of the [[Rotary Club]] of Manila at about the same time that he was also a young professor of economics at the University of the Philippines. Puyat's skill in managing the family business caught the eye of the late President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. At the time, the country was predominantly agricultural in activity and the President was advocating industrialization. Quezon named the young Puyat as dean of the College of Business Administration at the [[University of the Philippines]] when he was 33, becoming the youngest dean the UP ever had. An active member of international trades bodies, he acquired international stature in business. The Business Writers’ Association of the Philippines voted him  "Business Leader of the Year" in 1948 and the Association of Red Feather Agencies voted him "Civic Leader of the Year" in 1949. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1953, he received a plaque from the Community Chest of Greater Manila for “ outstanding services as one of the founders, first president and first campaign fund chairman “ of the body. The Philippine Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO) awarded him a certificate of honor for demonstrating national leadership in business, economics, the civic and political fields and for his distinguished service to the youth.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Political career==
In the [[Philippine general election, 1951|Philippine midterm elections of 1951]], he was elected Senator and he served in the [[Philippine Senate]] until its closure by Martial Law in 1972. From 1967 he was the Senate President.

As a legislator, Puyat created a sensation unmarked in political history by his reforms and innovations involving the dispensation of the controversial public works funds.

==Business activities==
He is founder of Manila Banking Corporation (now Chinabank Savings Bank), Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corporation and the Loyola Group of Companies. The Loyola Group of Companies is composed of Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc., Group Developers Inc. and Loyola Memorial Chapels and Crematorium Inc.

He founded Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc. in 1968 and today it is the oldest Pre-need Company in continuous operation. Group Developers pioneered the concept of memorial parks in the Philippines with its two signature memorial parks in Marikina and Sucat. Loyola Memorial Chapels was the first to use modern cremation technology in the Philippines. Loyola Memorial Chapels has six branches: Commonwealth Avenue Quezon City, 20th Avenue Cubao Quezon City, Marikina, Guadalupe Makati City, Sucat Rd Paranaque City and Los Banos Laguna.

==Family background==
Puyat is the third child of Philippine Pioneer Industrialist Gonzalo Puyat and Nicasia Juco. He was trained early in life by his father, Don Gonzalo, in the trade of manufacturing billiard tables and bowling alleys. Eventually, he assisted in managing the family business of Gonzalo Puyat &amp; Sons, the brand holder of AMF-Puyat, Puyat Steel, and Puyat Vinyl.

Puyat was married to Eugenia Guidote, an accountant and pioneer member of the [[Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (PICPA), and a trained opera singer (soprano). They had seven children – Gil, Jr. (deceased), Vicente (deceased), Antonio, Victor, Jesusa, Alfonso and Eugenia

==Death==
In 1978, he was invested as a member of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]]. He died, 3 years later, on March 22, 1981 due to [[cardiac arrest]], one of the complications of an asthma attack. He was buried on March 28, 1981 at [[Loyola Memorial Park]] in [[Marikina]].&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

[[Gil Puyat Avenue|Buendia Avenue]], which was formerly named after the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Era]] senator and [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayano]] Nicolas Buendia, is now named after him, but most people tend to use the original name of the road.

'''Gilbert Anselme Girouard''' (October 26, 1846 &amp;ndash; January 13, 1885) was a general merchant and political figure in [[New Brunswick]], Canada. He represented [[Kent (New Brunswick electoral district)|Kent]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1878 to 1883 as a [[Liberal-Conservative]] member.

He was born in Ste-Marie de Buctouche, New Brunswick, and educated at [[University of St. Joseph's College|St. Joseph's College]] in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]]. He taught school briefly in Sainte-Marie-de-Kent before becoming a general merchant in [[Buctouche, New Brunswick|Buctouche]] in 1870. In 1872, he married Sophia Baker. Girouard resigned his seat in 1883 to accept the position of customs collector for [[Richibucto, New Brunswick|Richibucto]]. He died of [[tuberculosis]] in Buctouche at the age of 38.

'''Dorothy Jane Roberts''' (May 8, 1929 – September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed [[psychic]], and [[Mediumship|spirit medium]], who claimed to [[Channelling (mediumistic)|channel]] an energy personality who called himself "Seth."  Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the ''[[Seth Material]]'', established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref name=klimo&gt;{{cite book |title=Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources |first=Jon |last=Klimo |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=1998 |pages=22, 30 |isbn=1-55643-248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion |first=Catherine L. |last=Albanese |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |pages=501 |isbn=0-300-11089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yale University Library]] Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled ''Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090)'', which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name=yalelibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Jane Roberts Papers|work=Jane Roberts Papers, Manuscript Group 1090.

==Early life and career==
Roberts was born in a hospital in [[Albany, New York]] and grew up in nearby [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie Burdo, divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood in Saratoga Springs. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] by 1932, but worked as much as possible. Eventually Roberts' grandfather, Joseph Burdo, with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance. Roberts' grandmother was killed in an automobile accident in 1936.

The next year, her grandfather moved out of the house. By then Marie was partially incapacitated, and the Welfare Department began to furnish mother and daughter with occasional (and often unreliable) domestic help.&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 40. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Marie became a bedridden invalid, it was Jane’s responsibility to take care of her. This included cooking, cleaning, bringing her the bedpan, and getting up in the middle of the night to refuel the stove. Her embittered mother used to tell Jane that she was going to turn on the gas jets in the middle of the night and kill them both. "My mother was a real bitch," Jane said, "but she was an energetic bitch. When my mother attempted suicide for about the fifth time, she took a whole mess of sleeping pills and was in the hospital. I went to the welfare lady and said, 'I can’t take it anymore. I’ve just got to leave.'"&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realtalkworld.com/2010/12/01/memories-of-jane-roberts/|title=Memories of Jane Roberts|author=Kendall, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over and over Marie told Jane that she was no good, that the daughter's birth had caused the mother's illness, and that she was disowned and considered no longer her daughter.

The persistent psychological abuse and mistreatment by her mother resulted in the young girl's deep fear of abandonment.  Such situations increased Jane's sense of not being safe, yet also reinforced feelings of independence, for she did not have to feel as dependent upon Marie as she might otherwise. Well before she was 10 years old Jane had developed persistent symptoms of [[colitis]]. By her early teens she had an [[hyperthyroidism|overactive thyroid gland]]. Her vision was poor; she required very strong glasses (which she seldom wore). For most of 1940 and half of 1941 Jane was in a strictly-run Catholic orphanage in [[Troy, NY]] while her mother was hospitalized in another city for treatment of her arthritis. Priests came to the house regularly and support was offered to the fatherless family. Jane's initial bonding to the cultural beliefs of religion was very strong to make up for the lack of a loving, nurturing family.

The 'troublesome' material remained relatively inactive until her curiosity and ability led her to actively challenge those ideas, while she was also in a situation where the natural fear of abandonment might be suggested, thus clouding her perception of her own reality. This type of limiting psychological suggestion might have resulted from coercive and unintentionally abusive societal interaction perpetuated by the unenlightened and egotistical behavior of individuals around her, which she would later help to unveil, at great length, through the persona of "Seth".

For a time she was left between belief systems. In the summer of 1945, when she was 16 years old, Jane began working at a variety store. It was her first job. That fall she continued on the job after school hours and on an occasional Saturday. After attending public schools she went to [[Skidmore College]] from 1947 to 1950 on a poetry scholarship. Roberts' grandfather died when she was age 19. It was a time of severe shock for her. She began to substitute scientific world view for religious belief.&lt;ref name=yalelibrary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 30. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 75–77. {{ISBN|0-13-219452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 371, 421, 441, 442, 450, 452–53. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayhouse.com/authorbio.php?id=422|title=Jane Roberts Author Biography|publisher=Hay House|work=Hay House Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorothy Jane Roberts Butts"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/72983366 |title= Dorothy Jane Roberts Butts |publisher=Find a Grave |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time Jane was dating a man called Walt Zeh, a long-time Saratoga Springs friend. Together they went to the west coast by motorcycle to see Jane’s father who had also come from a broken home. Jane then married Walt and continued to write while taking a variety of other jobs, including society editor for the Saratoga newspaper, and as a supervisor in a radio factory. Walt and Jane lived together for three years. It was then in February 1954 while “cutting up, dancing, and raisin' hell at a party,” that Jane first met the former commercial artist Robert Fabian Butts, Jr. (June 20, 1919 - May 26, 2008). The bachelor had shown up at the shindig on a last-minute impulse. The fourth time they met at another party and, never having dated, Jane 'just looked at him and said, "Look, I’m leaving Walt, and I'm going to live by myself or I'm going to live with you, so just let me know."'"&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg.16. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the two left town together and Jane filed for divorce. Jane and Rob married on December 27, 1954 at the home of his parents in Sayre, PA.&lt;ref name="Dorothy Jane Roberts Butts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nPYfqEbfrsC&amp;pg=PA1049&amp;lpg=PA1049&amp;dq=Robert+F+Butts+1955&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZC62XtS5XL&amp;sig=4On-0BeVabd1Z2WfPbcA5GrUXkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QASwUJq0IcT_ygGz64A4&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20F%20Butts%201955&amp;f=false|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2|author=Reginald, Robert|publisher=Borgo Press |year= 2010|page= 1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 524. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/72983187  |title= Robert Fabian Butts, Jr |publisher=Find a Grave |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts wrote in a variety of genres: poetry, short stories, children’s literature, nonfiction, science fiction and fantasy, and novels. She was the only woman invited to the first science-fiction writer's conference in 1956 in Milford, PA. The couple moved to Elmira, NY, in 1960, to find steady part-time work – Rob in the local greeting card company, Jane in an art gallery. Their lives seemed set, their art defined. Now in her 30s, she and her husband began to record what she said were messages from a personality named "Seth," and she wrote several books about the experience.

==Seth Material==
{{main|Seth Material}}
On a September evening in 1963, their everyday worldview changed. Roberts sat down at her table to work on poetry; Butts was in his back-room studio, painting. "It was very domestic, very normal, very unpsychedelic," she would later remember. And then "Between one normal minute and the next, a fantastic avalanche of radical, new ideas burst into my head with tremendous force ... It was as if the physical world were really tissue-paper-thin, hiding infinite dimensions of reality, and I was flung through the tissue paper with a huge ripping sound." When she "came to," Roberts found herself scrawling the title of this odd batch of notes: ''The Physical Universe as Idea Construction.'' Before this, she had never had any interest in psychic phenomena, and though her fiction typically dealt with such themes as clairvoyance and reincarnation, intellectually neither she nor Butts believed in extrasensory abilities or that anyone survived death once, let alone many times. Yet soon after this episode, Roberts suddenly began recalling her dreams, including two that were inarguably precognitive, the first, as far as she knew, that she'd ever had. Their curiosity piqued, the couple decided to investigate further, and she managed to land a contract with a New York publisher for a do-it-yourself book on [[extra-sensory perception]].&lt;ref name="Dorothy Jane Roberts Butts"/&gt;

In late 1963, Roberts and Butts started experimenting with a [[Ouija]] board as part of Roberts' research for the book.&lt;ref&gt;''ESP Power'', by Jane Roberts (2000) (introductory essay by Lynda Dahl). {{ISBN|0-88391-016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth.  Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. The first seven sessions were entirely with the Ouija board. The three-hour session on the evening of  Jan. 2, 1964 was the first where she began to [[Dictation (exercise)|dictate]] the messages instead of using the Ouija board.  For a while she still opened her sessions with the board, but finally was able to abandon it after the 27th session on Feb. 19, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 68, 166. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts described the process of writing the ''Seth'' books as entering a trance state.  She said Seth would assume control of her body and speak through her, while her husband wrote down the words she spoke.  They referred to such episodes as "readings" or "sessions."&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations With Seth, Book 2: 25th Anniversary Edition'', by Susan M. Watkins (2006). {{ISBN|978-1-930491-09-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 26th session on Feb. 18, 1964 was the first held in the presence of another person—a friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 157. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Jan. 17, 1964, Roberts channeled an allegedly recently deceased woman who told Butts that his and his wife's work with Seth was a life-time project, that they would publish his manuscripts, and help spread his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 105-106. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 27th session Seth also told the couple how to rearrange the furniture in their apartment which would better suit their energies. Despite feelings of disbelief toward both messages, the couple somewhat reluctantly agreed.  Two days afterwards they heard from a [[psychologist]] interested in reincarnation to whom they had written three weeks earlier with some session copies enclosed.   The psychologist told them that the very fluency of the material suggested that it might come from Roberts' [[subconscious]], though it was impossible to tell.  He also cautioned that in some circumstances, amateur [[mediumship]] could lead to mental problems.

''The letter upset me considerably, yet it also objectified some of my own doubts.  They were out in the air where I could at least deal with them.  As far as we could tell, for all of my stewing and hemming and hawing, there were no alarming changes in my personality.  I was doing twice the creative work I had done earlier.  I was satisfied with the quality of the Seth Material; it was far superior to anything I could do on my own.  If nothing else, I thought the sessions presented a way of making deeply unconscious knowledge available on a consistent basis.''&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 170-171. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Because we were so innocent about psychic literature, we weren't hampered by superstitious fears about such [psychic] phenomena.  I didn't believe in gods or demons, so I didn't fear them.  I wanted to learn.  Rob and I had discovered a whole new world together, and we were going to explore it.

''There was a constant battle, though, as some of our results ran full tilt into my intellectual ideas.  In the beginning, I took it for granted that Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified, because I simply couldn't accept the possibility of ''spirits'' or, for that matter, life after death.  Then, after it became obvious that the Seth sessions were going to continue, we kept constant check on my personality characteristics and went to a psychologist – as any sane, red-blooded American would do under such circumstances in those days. Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying.  Besides, my personality showed no adverse signs of instability. If anything, I was more competent in handling physical affairs.  This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.''&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), p. 84. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts also purportedly channeled the world views of several other people,&lt;ref name=klimo/&gt; including the philosopher [[William James]],&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fisher and John Edminster, "William James.... Ghostwriter?", ''[[Fate (magazine)|FATE]]'' #350, pp. 61–66 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]], and the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Paul Cézanne]],&lt;ref name=klimo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spirit Summonings: Mysteries of the Unknown |last=Time-Life Books (editor)|publisher=Time-Life Books|year= 1989|page=137 |isbn=0-8094-6344-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; through a process she described as using a typewriter to write "[[Automatic writing|automatically]]."&lt;ref name=lewismelton&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives on the New Age|last=Lewis|first=James R.|author2=J.

For 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held more than 1500 regular or private "ESP class" trance sessions in which she spoke on behalf of Seth.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Woolger, ''Other Lives, Other Selves: A Jungian Psychotherapist Discovers Past Lives'', (1988). {{ISBN|978-0-553-34595-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986). {{ISBN|0-13-219452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Butts served as stenographer, taking the messages down in home-made [[shorthand]], and having others on occasion make [[sound recording|recording]] of some sessions.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 491. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The messages from Seth channeled through Roberts consisted mostly of monologues on a wide variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sethapplied.com/Index%20of%20ElevenBooks.pdf|title=Index of Eleven Seth Books|author=Williams, Sue R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were published by [[Prentice-Hall]] under the collective title ''Seth Material''.

Over the years, hundreds of people witnessed Seth speaking. Some went to the ESP classes Roberts held (Tuesday and some Thursday nights,  Sept. 1967 – Feb. 1975)&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 202. {{ISBN|0-13-219452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an evening, others attended for longer periods. (By this time Jane had given up her gallery work, and was teaching nursery school during part of this time.) Outside of the ESP class structure, Roberts gave many personal Seth sessions to various individuals who had written her, asking for help. She never charged for those sessions; however, at some point she did charge $2.50 to $3.50 per ESP class of 5 to 40 people. When the books began to sell in sufficient numbers, she dropped that fee.&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritual-endeavors.org/seth/howitall.htm |title=How it all began |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121005115/http://www.spiritual-endeavors.org/seth/howitall.htm |archivedate=2012-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 333. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Book sessions were almost always private, held on Monday and Wednesday evenings without witnesses from 1967 through 1982 (except for Tues and Thurs from Aug. to Nov. 1981).&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 7. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 453, 499. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material through 1969 was published in summary form in ''The Seth Material'', written by Roberts from the output of the channeling sessions. Beginning in January 1970, Roberts wrote books which she described as dictated by Seth.  Roberts claimed no authorship of these books beyond her role as medium. This series of "Seth books" totaled ten volumes.  The last two books appear to be incomplete due to Roberts' illness.  Butts contributed extensive [[footnotes]], appendices, and other comments to all the Seth books, and thus was a [[collaborative writing|co-author]] on all of them.  These additions describe what was going on in Roberts' and his life at the time of the various sessions, annotated some of Seth's comments in light of contemporary beliefs and materials that Roberts and Butts were reading, described excerpts from some fan mail and letters from professionals commenting on Seth's material about their fields, and, especially later, provided insight as to the [[galley proof|many steps of production]] of multiple books with the publisher. By February 1982 they were still receiving "from 30 to 50 letters and packages a week" from readers of their various books.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 536. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Roberts' earlier and later poetry was occasionally included to show how she had touched upon some of Seth's concepts.&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pp. 62, 91, 121–122, . {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 301–04, 312–13, 336, 381, 487–88, 506–07, 524–25. {{ISBN|0-13-219460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also wrote ''The Oversoul Seven'' trilogy to explore via fiction some of Seth's teachings on the concepts of reincarnation and oversouls.

According to Roberts, Seth described himself as an "energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter," and was independent of Roberts' [[subconscious]].  Roberts initially expressed skepticism as to Seth's origins, wondering if he was a part of her own personality.&lt;ref name=klimo/&gt; As Seth, Roberts at times appeared stern, jovial or professorial. "His" voice was deeper and more masculine sounding than Jane's and was possessed of a distinct, although not identifiable, accent.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul'', by Jane Roberts, notes by Robert F. Butts, p. 2 (1972, 1994). {{ISBN|978-1-930491-09-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the psychic [[Edgar Cayce]], whose [[syntax]] when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Paula|title=New Age Metaphysics: An Introduction for Young Adults|year=1987|publisher=Ozark Mountain Publishing|isbn=0-9617920-0-0|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later books continued to develop but did not contradict the material introduced in earlier works.  Some "Practice Elements" were even given so that the readers could see how a few of the concepts could be practically experienced.&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pp. 103, 179–82, 185–87, 198–99, 219–20. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 2'', by Jane Roberts (1979), pp. 324–25, 335–35, 419–22, 443–46, 460–63, 480–82. {{ISBN|0-13-938696-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few contemporary world events were commented upon by Seth, such as the [[Jonestown]] Guyana deaths&lt;ref&gt;''The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events'', by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 177–180. {{ISBN|0-13-457259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events'', by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 191–204. {{ISBN|0-13-457259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth also provided an alternative [[creation myth]] to that of either the [[Big Bang]] or [[Intelligent Design]].&lt;ref name="Helfrich, Paul M. Ph.D. 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newworldview.com/library/Helfrich_P_Seth_on_a_Conscious_Creation_Myth.html |title=Seth on ''The Origins of the Universe and of the Species'' ~ An Integral Conscious Creation Myth |author=Helfrich, Paul M.

Roberts' father died in November 1971 at the age of 68; her mother died six months later at the same age.&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 189. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the hospital for severely [[hypothyroidism|underactive thyroid gland]], protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight [[anemia]], budding [[pressure ulcer|bedsores]]—and a hospital-caused [[staph infection]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 18–19. {{ISBN|0-13-219452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She recovered to an extent, but died two and a half years later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis—like her mother—for the final year and a half of her life. Roberts had spent 504 consecutive days in a hospital in Elmira, N.Y. The immediate causes of her death were a combination of protein depletion, [[osteomyelitis]], and soft-tissue infections.  These conditions arose out of her long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 15. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts' case, at least, the young girl's psychological conditioning was far more important—far more damaging, in those terms—than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 76. {{ISBN|0-13-219452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Roberts was cremated the next day, in a process she and Butts had agreed upon several years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 16. {{ISBN|0-9652855-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Roberts’ death, lovingly recorded in ''The Way Toward Health'' (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including ''The Early Sessions,'' and making sure that all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes, and drawings related to the extraordinary encounters with Seth would be given to the [[Yale University Library|Yale Library]]. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel Lee Davies, supported his work during the more than twenty years that they were together. (Davies had moved to Elmira from California in 1985 at Butts' request to help answer mail and proofread manuscripts.  They did not actually marry until 1999.) Butts died of cancer on May 26, 2008. Jane Roberts Butts and Robert F. Butts Jr. are interred together in the Wayne County, NY, Furnaceville cemetery; however, there is another gravestone with their names on it in the Sunnyside cemetery in Tunkhannock, PA. The vitality of the teachings they helped to bring to the world continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://californiasethconference.com/about-seth.html|title=About Seth, Jane Roberts and Robert Butts|publisher=California Seth Conference|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828002805/http://www.californiasethconference.com/about-seth.html|archivedate=2012-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/TheSethMaterial-LosAngeles/messages/46600612/  |title= Estate sale of Jane Roberts, Robert and Laurel Butts happening online |publisher=The Los Angeles Seth Material Readers Group |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nirvikalpa.com/content.php?page=seth |publisher=Nirvikalpa|title=Seth/Jane Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized sections of his teachings,&lt;ref name="Helfrich, Paul M.

===Reception and influence===
Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The title jacket of "The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book," published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. [[Marianne Williamson]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Shakti Gawain]], [[Dan Millman]], [[Louise Hay]], [[Richard Bach]], and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} In words similar to Williamson's they state: "Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life." Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the [[University of Chicago]], stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material "launched an era of nationwide awareness" of the channeling trend.  She believes it contributed to the "self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion|first=Catherine L.|last=Albanese |publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|pages=501 |isbn=0-300-11089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: "you create your own reality." (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations.  Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of the Psyche', by Jane Roberts (1979), pg. 49. {{ISBN|0-13-610469-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the "Seth Material."&lt;ref name=newport&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue|first=John P. |last=Newport|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1998|pages=165|isbn=0-8028-4430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at [[Bradley University]], wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called "unchurched American spirituality," related to concepts of [[reincarnation]], ''[[karma]]'', [[free will]], ancient metaphysical wisdom, and "Christ consciousness."&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite book| title=Spiritual, But Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America |first=Robert C.|last=Fuller|pages=60|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001 |isbn=0-19-514680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers noted, "Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East… and we've done a little reading on [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Zen]], and [[Taoism]], for example, not to mention subjects like [[shamanism]], [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]]ism, and [[obeah]]."&lt;ref name="app"&gt;Kole, Andre; [[E. Calvin Beisner]], Robert M Bowman Jr, Terry Holley [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3bw0WdaLEpcC&amp; ''Astrology and Psychic Phenomena''] Zondervan Publishing House, 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-310-48921-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 12. {{ISBN|0-13-938704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late amateur [[physicist]] [[Michael Talbot (author)|Michael Talbot]] wrote, "To my great surprise—and slight annoyance—I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[quantum physics]]."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Beyond the Quantum'', Bantam Paperback, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Roberts and the ''Seth Material'' have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet [[Charles Upton (poet)|Charles Upton]], in his collection of essays titled ''The System of Antichrist'', posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death.  His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The System of Antichrist: Truth and Falsehood in Postmodernism and the New Age|first=Charles|last=Upton|publisher=Sophia Perennis|year=2005|pages=173|isbn=0-900588-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology [[James Alcock|James E. Alcock]] opined, "In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production—at any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency."&lt;ref name="app"/&gt;

Seth's teaching of a philosophy far more detailed than and not in keeping with traditional Church-authority, God-separate-from Creation, one-mortal-life, Jesus-centered messages has also received its share of criticism from some Christian believers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Various ministries have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letusreason.org/NAM13.htm |title=Channeling – a spirit speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Seth Material'' has been considered in certain circles to be "a book entirely written by a demon. A woman simply wrote it down as it was dictated to her by the demon; and, of course, it just destroys everything that is true in terms of God's revelation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/1218/demonand-magic|title=Demons and Magic |work=Grace to You}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as evidence for "Devil possession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.world-destiny.org/spirit/10possF.pdf |title=Spirit Entry into the Human Mind| author=Moyer, Ernest | chapter=10, Devil Possession: Jane Roberts and Seth| page=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Videos such as ''Jane Roberts' Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books – Allowed By The Media'' protested that Seth was "a demon from hell contacted through a ouija board."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQheZ5ARq44|title=Jane Roberts' Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books – Allowed By The Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Karen Stollznow]] has written that much of Roberts work was "criticized for being a rip-off of Christian and
Eastern philosophy. It comes as no surprise that Seth influenced such authors as [[Deepak Chopra]] and [[Louise Hay]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Stollznow|Stollznow, Karen]]. (2014). ''Language Myths, Mysteries and Magic''. Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 112-113. {{ISBN|978-1-137-40484-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Roberts' death, others have claimed to channel Seth.&lt;ref name="fuller" /&gt; In the introduction to Seth's first dictated book, ''Seth Speaks'', "he" says, "communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material." In ''The Seth Material'', Jane Roberts wrote: "Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts." At least one person has claimed more recently to channel Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Roberts' A View From The Other Side'', Mary Maracek (1997). {{ISBN|0-9663258-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Massis''' (4 June 1940 &amp;ndash; 12 July 1988) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and teeth-acrobat. His real name was '''Wilfried Morbée'''.

Massis specialized in bending iron with his teeth. He also performed stunts where he lifted cars, pulled trains and stopped motorbikes and even helicopters and hot air balloons with his teeth. This resulted in several entries in the [[Guinness World Records]] book. He even stopped 4 small sport planes of lifting off in 4 different directions.

In 1980 he started pirate radio "Radio Superstar" and also recorded the song ''John Massis de krachtpatser''. In 1987 he recorded ''Zet er je tanden in'', with [[Willy Sommers]].

In 1983 he also funded a political party called ''Positief Radicalen'' in Dutch or ''Positive Radicals''.

He had a few roles too in the Flemish films ''The Leeuw Van Vlaanderen'' (1984) and ''Merlina''

In 2004 [[Johan Heldenbergh]] performed a play based on Massis' life: ''Massis, the musical''.

In 2005 he became number 172 on the list of the most famous Belgian ever in history.

He was also a source of inspiration for the cartoonist Pirana in the 80's to draw "Het Land Zonder Tanden" (1986). They were also close personal friends.
He also made an appearance in the Kiekeboe-album ''De spray-historie'' (1988) with cartoon character  "John Massif".

In 1999  the band ''[[Noordkaap]]'' referred to John Massis by naming their album ''Massis''.

==Death==
Because of his unknown and therefore untreated  diabetes condition Massis was found by the local police in a delirium. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. With waning media interest and [[diabetes]] undermining his condition, he committed [[suicide]] at the age of 48 officially on the 12th of July 1988. To make a statement he actually committed suicide on 11 July  which is the day of the Flemish Community. He was found only the day after by his sisters Godelieve and Erna Morbée.

==Early life==
Knoxville was born Philip John Clapp in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="tcm"/&gt; His father, Philip, was a tire/[[car salesman]], and his mother, Lemoyne Clapp (née Houck), taught [[Sunday school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1115522.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000|work=The Times|location=London|title=Strictly+for+Jackasses|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Jackass the Sophisticated Dude; You Want Rowdy and Moronic?

Knoxville credits a copy of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'', given to him by his cousin, singer-songwriter [[Roger Alan Wade]], with giving him the acting bug.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-08-01-knoxville-gentleman_x.htm "Knoxville: A Southern mix of contradictions"], ''[[USAToday]]'', August 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=369041&amp;apid=0 |title=Overview for Johnny Knoxville|publisher=Tcm.com|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[South-Doyle High School|South Young High School]] in 1989 in Knoxville, he moved to [[California]] to become an actor. In the beginning, Knoxville appeared mostly in [[Television advertisement|commercials]] and made several minor appearances as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. 

When the "big break" he sought eluded him, he decided to create his own opportunities by writing and pitching article ideas to various magazines. An idea to test [[self-defense]] equipment on himself captured the interest of [[Jeff Tremaine]]'s skateboarding magazine ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'', and the stunts were filmed and included in ''Big Brother''{{'s}} "Number Two" video.

==Career==
{{Main|Jackass (TV series)}}
Knoxville is responsible for many of the ideas in ''Jackass'', and is often seen as the [[de facto]] leader of the crew. The show also stars [[Jeff Tremaine]], Sean Cliver, Spoezy, and [[Dave Carnie]] who produced a pilot that used footage from ''Big Brother'' and [[Bam Margera]]'s [[CKY (videos)|CKY videos]]. 

With help from Tremaine's friend, film director [[Spike Jonze]], they pitched a series to various networks. A deal was made with [[MTV]] and ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' was born.&lt;ref name="KnoxvilleAug2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/08/johnny_knoxville_jackass_star.html|title=Johnny Knoxville: 'Jackass' star Steve-O almost ready to dive back into his work|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=August 4, 2009|first=Mike|last=Scott|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knoxville also participated in the [[Gumball 3000]] for ''Jackass'' along with co-stars [[Steve-O]], [[Chris Pontius]], ''Jackass'' director [[Jeff Tremaine]], and producer [[Dimitry Elyashkevich]]. Prior to ''Jackass'' premiering on MTV, Knoxville and company turned down an offer to perform their stunts for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on a weekly basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/aug/1/20050801-095719-4468r/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016062119/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/aug/1/20050801-095719-4468r/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-16|title=The Washington Times - In a Southern state of mind|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Knoxville later hosted a 2005 episode of the show.

On February 4, 2009, Knoxville explained on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' how he tore his [[urethra]] during a stunt for ''[[Nitro Circus]]'' explaining how he had to flush it twice daily.

'''Julia''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1689), was the [[lady's maid]] of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] at her court in [[Rome]]. She was regarded as a [[clairvoyant]] and known for her predictions, and Christina referred to her as her [[Sibyl]].

The most famous prediction of Julia was that of the death of Queen Christina. Shortly before her death, Christina appeared before Julia in a new dress, and asked her: "What am I thinking of?" Julia replied, "The Queen wishes to be buried in this beautiful dress", upon which Christina replied that this was indeed her wish, but that death was in the hands of fate.&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0240.html&lt;/ref&gt; Julia responded by saying that Christina would be buried in that dress, and that Cardinal [[Decio Azzolino]] and Pope [[Innocent XI]] would follow shortly afterward in death.&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0240.html&lt;/ref&gt; All this also happened as described.

'''Kamal Abbas''' ({{lang-arz|'''كمال عباس'''}}) is General Coordinator of the [[Center for Trade Unions and Workers Services]] (CTUWS), an activist group for independent unions in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dine |first=Philip |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/8/dine-egyptian-workers-key-element-in-uprising/ |title=DINE: Egyptian workers key element in uprising |work = [[The Washington Times]] |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Involved in activism for over 20 years,&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/labor/2439-roots-of-egypts-revolution-labor-unions-and-the-uprising-in-tahrir-square |title=Roots of Egypt’s Revolution: Labor Unions and the Uprising in Tahrir Square |publisher=Towardfreedom.com |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011216141815340645.html |title=Egyptians defy call to end strikes - Middle East |work = [[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system.

He began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in [[Helwan]], Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.  Abbas' relationship with [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak's regime]] was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Abbas "a major annoyance" to President Hosni Mubarak's regime, and "passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance."&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/14/world/fg-activist14 |title=Problems In Egypt - Unions tap into public ire in Egypt |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Abbas was charged with [[defamation]] and sentenced to one year of prison.  There was international condemnation of the ruling, with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas.  In February 2012 he was once again sentenced to a prison term, this time six months for "insulting" a public official.

Abbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime.

==1989-1990: Early work and founding of CTUWS==
Abbas began working in a steel mill in 1975 at the age of 20.&lt;ref name="wac-maanil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aflcio1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aflcio.org/2007/06/26/labor-support-organization-banned-after-strike-actions/ |title=Egyptian Labor-Support Organization Banned After Strike Actions |publisher=Blog.aflcio.org |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While under the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak regime]], Abbas began organizing workers, despite unions being dominated by the state-approved [[Egyptian Trade Union Federation]] (ETUF).  In 1989 he participated in a strike at the Iron and Steel Company plant in [[Helwan]] where 19,000 workers sought wage increases and a meal during work.  They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers;&lt;ref name="aflcio1"/&gt; ultimately the strike was broken up when security forces stormed the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests.&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aflcio1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/statement-kamal-abbas |title='We Stand With You as You Stood With Us': Statement to Workers of Wisconsin by Kamal Abbas of Egypt's Centre for Trade Unions and Workers Services |publisher=MichaelMoore.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas was arrested four times in the subsequent months,&lt;ref name="aflcio1"/&gt; including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;  Following, he was terminated for participating in an “illegal” strike not sanctioned by the official trade union.&lt;ref name="merip1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero050907 |title=Strikes in Egypt Spread from Center of Gravity | publisher = [[Middle East Research and Information Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later in 1990, Abbas co-founded CTUWS in Helwan to support workers and address the lack of independent unions in the private sector.&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aflcio1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnivX-lt1o4C&amp;dq=%22Kamal+Abbas%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Social Social Movements, Mobilization, and Contestation in the Middle East and North Africa | author=Joel Beinin, Frederic Vairel |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|what pages?|date=July 2011}}  He was guided by the advice of [[Yusuf Darwish]], a long-time communist and labor lawyer, with whom Abbas had previously led the People’s Socialist Party.  Abbas had studied world labor movements, looking up to the power of unions in Europe and the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;  Abbas changed his ideological focus from his early ties to Marxist politics, instead focusing CTUWS on practical reform.&lt;ref name="merip1"/&gt;

==1990-2007: Work with CTUWS==
Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"/&gt;

In 1998 Abbas commented on the July strikes at the Egypt-Helwan Textiles Factory and the Nasr Pharmaceutical plant.  Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation.  He said, "People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farag |first=Fatemah |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/390/eg2.htm |work = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]]  | title = Privatisation faces a hot summer |date=1998-08-19 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers.  He said, "In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/427/eg6.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = May Day dilemmas |date=1999-05-05 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. According to Abbas, he received it, "Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council."&lt;ref name="almasryalyoum2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/72833 |title=Labor representation in parliament: Between need and myth | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area.  Abbas argued, "After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/507/eg21.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Tribal labour |date=1995-11-15 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Abbas commented on the increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, "Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong to and vote for 'professional committees.'" Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee, as are the construction workers in Shubra. "These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class." He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions:  "And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fatemah Farag |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/552/eg2.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = What lies beneath |date=2001-09-26 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and "pure" agricultural work when done by women and minors.&lt;ref name="ahram2002"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/ec4.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Dirge for a dog? |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002, which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  "The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen—things could get even worse tomorrow."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Margins of Repression'' by Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words "worker" and "trade union" from the organization name or scope.  "They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11. 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers' rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, "Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles—such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties—are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates."  He told the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram]]'', "Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/740/eg10.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = May Day and the absent actor |date=2005-05-04 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the Esco workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform "essential duties", was broad enough to permit random firings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/eg42.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = A partial victory  |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, "Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straitjacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/eg9.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title =Nobody's listening |date=2005-03-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, "The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/749/eg9.htm |work= [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Political spin-off effects |date=2005-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime.  He was badly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zunes |first=Stephen |url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/bombings_and_repression_in_egypt_underscore_failures_in_us_anti-terrorism_strategy |title=Bombings and Repression in Egypt Underscore Failures in U.S. Anti-Terrorism Strategy |publisher=FPIF |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Abbas also criticized the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. "Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Steele |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/29/comment.islam |title= Open debate can tackle the dangers of fundamentalism |work =[[The Guardian]] |date=  2005-07-29 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections, arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few.  He recommended switching focus to uninionized private sector workers:  "The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/818/eg4.htm |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Battling over a dead horse | date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kamal Abbas.jpg|thumb|Kamal Abbas during the 2010 National Minimum Wage protest]]

In November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kassem |first=Mahmoud |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ayJBbeRA0qLw&amp;refer=home |title=Egypt's Bow to Unions Stalls State Asset Sales, Investing Boom |publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he criticized the state of politics, calling the regime illegitimate, and saying that Egypt is "a suffering society with no way to express itself."&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;  He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;  Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader who could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement.  He said, "Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish.  The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things."&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

In April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused of working with "external forces" in order to disrupt the country's economy.  The government closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for "security reasons".&lt;ref name="ahram2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/866/eg4.htm |work = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Inconvenient truths | date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in ''Kalam Sanay'iya'', a magazine published by the CTUWS.  The lawsuit for alleged "slander and defamation of character" against Abbas—and his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmi—was filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors at the youth center.&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt; Ibrahim filed three petitions against Abbas and claimed that the magazine article "publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant". He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law,&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt; which penalizes false reporting (anyone who "publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order" may face a prison sentence).&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt;  Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15218389 |title=Striking Textile Workers in Egypt Get Concessions |publisher=NPR |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the incident, Abbas commented to [[National Public Radio]], "The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

"It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors," Abbas told Ahram Weekly. "The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties.  The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?" he said.&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt;

CTUWS criticized the conviction. "What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?"&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt;

International labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemned the court decision.&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegypt1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/international-labor-groups-condemn-conviction-of-labor-leader-kamal-abbas.html |title=International labor groups condemn conviction of labor leader Kamal Abbas |work =Thedailynewsegypt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC)]], accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media.  "We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS.  We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt," said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary.&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegypt1"/&gt; A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to "ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that "this particular case could be reviewed.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement "expressing its deep concern over the case.&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegypt1"/&gt;

Egyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, "The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents".&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt;  Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights.&lt;ref name="ahram2007"/&gt;

After Abbas' and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true.  Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded.&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegypt1"/&gt;

Abbas appealed his conviction at a Dec. 29 hearing.  He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal.&lt;ref name="thedailynewsegypt1"/&gt;

In 2009 [[Human Rights Watch]] noted a significant increase "in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport", which included the detainment of Abbas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/24/egypt-and-libya-year-serious-abuses |title=Egypt and Libya: A Year of Serious Abuses | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/2128 |title=No fly zone: The perils of Cairo Airport | work =  [[Almasry Alyoum]] | date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding [[minimum wage]], which Abbas criticized for not acting.  Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/689/eg2.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]| title = Labour backlog | date=2004-05-12 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify | how can the article be dated when it discusses 2010?|date=July 2011}}

In 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections.  Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as "a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way."&lt;ref name="almasryalyoum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/227915 |title=ETUF makes bid to rally workers behind president, regime | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote.&lt;ref name="almasryalyoum1"/&gt;

In May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months.  Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labour Organization about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/44045 |title=Streets cleaned and protesters cleared out for Kenyan PM's visit | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/74146 |title=Military court acquits 3 workers, suspends sentences of others | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] | date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer of being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected.  Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party (NDP)]], suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections.  Abbas argued, "The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form."&lt;ref name="almasryalyoum2"/&gt;

==2011-present: Egyptian revolution==
{{External media
| video1 = {{YouTube|dHqWMxxBdMY|The role of Independent Unions in Egypt's Revolution}}
| video2 = {{YouTube|5Y6uc8tV3G0|Egyptian Unions In Solidarity With Wisconsin Workers}}
}}
During the revolution, Abbas made an appeal for new trade unions at [[Tahrir Square]].  He said, “On January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation.  We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.”&lt;ref name="towardfreedom1"/&gt;

In February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupt with fraud.  He said, "There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir.”  Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying, "We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentPrint/3/0/6383/Business/0/Revolution-fuels-Egypt-labour-movement-.aspx |work = [[Al-Ahram]] | title = Revolution fuels Egypt labour movement |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by "how many billions the Mubarak family was worth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014178863_egypt10.html |title= Strikers in Egypt try to turn up heat on Mubarak | work = [[The Seattle Times]] |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/Strikes+sweep+Egyptian+workplaces/4257204/story.html |title=Strikes sweep Egyptian workplaces |work = [[National Post]] |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 Abbas celebrated [[International Workers' Day]] (also known as "May Day"), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform begun in the United States.  Abbas deemed that year's celebrations  “historic” for marking a break from the ETUF.  Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF).  May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/11128/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptians-celebrate-first-May-Day-since-popular-up.aspx |title=Egyptians celebrate first May Day since popular uprising | work = [[Al-Ahram]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF.  The suit called for "sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics" as well as "barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/468158 |title=Legal battle against Mubarak's trade union federation begins | work =[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas interrupted the ETUF's Ismail Fahmy during his speech at the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization (ILO)]] June 2011 conference.  Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, "Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2011/06/13/enough-you-killers-egypts-independent-unions-confront-state-labour-front |title="Enough you killers" - Egypt's independent unions confront state labour front  | publisher=[[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] |date= 2011-06-13 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from [[Tahrir Square]] telling American workers who were on [[2011 Wisconsin protests|strike]] in [[Wisconsin]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us.  I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights.  When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation.  No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region.  But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the people….We want you to know that we stand on your side.  Stand firm and don’t waiver.  Don’t give up on your rights.  Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights.  We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support.  As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed.  Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Levine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/02/201122518445333563.html |title=History's shifting sands |publisher= [[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Eating Egyptian pizza in Wisconsin |author= Kroll A |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MC04Ak01.html |work =[[Asia Times]] |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime.  At the end of the panel, Abbas declared, “the regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen!  What more do you want?  Go create your own unions!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/7652/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-Labor-minister-declares-the-end-of-governmen.aspx |title=Egypt Labor minister declares the end of government domination of trade unions | work = [[Al-Ahram]] |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2012, the [[CTUWS]] reported that Abbas had been sentenced ''in absentia'' to six months in prison for "insulting" a public official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctuws.com/view.aspx?id=1123&amp;item=1123 |title=A judgment in absentia has been issued on Kamal Abbas, CTUWS general coordinator, of six months imprisonment |publisher=[[CTUWS]] |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512011355/http://ctuws.com/view.aspx?id=1123&amp;item=1123 |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Kijimuna'''|キジムナー|Kijimunaa|lead=yes}}, or '''Bunagaya''', are creatures of the [[mythology]] native to the island of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. They are said to look around three or four years old and have red hair.&lt;ref&gt;Okinawan folktales- kijimuna. (2008, June 14). Retrieved from http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Japan/Okinawa/Camp-Kinser/blog-287249.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
The kijimuna are small wood spirits according to Okinawan mythology. The kijimuna are said to live in [[trees]], but the most common one is the [[banyan]] tree. They are often described as being child-sized, with red hair covering their bodies and large heads. They are also known to be excellent fisherman, able to catch many [[fish]], but then only eating one of the eyes of the fish before leaving the rest of it. The [[Kijimuna Festival|Kijimuna festival]]
in Okinawa is named after them. Another name for the kijumuna is "bungaya," which means roughly "Large-Headed."&lt;ref&gt;Okinawan folktales. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.chicagookinawakenjinkai.com/Folklore%20Pages/Kijimuna.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Kijimuna are known to be very mischievous, playing pranks and tricking humans. One of their most well known tricks is to lie upon a person's chest, making them unable to move or breathe. This is known as "kanashibari."&lt;ref&gt;BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION:  Morgan, T. (2007, January 16). Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.travisjmorgan.com/blog/2007/01/16/kijimuna-okinawa-fairy-inkblot/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829134800/http://www.travisjmorgan.com/blog/2007/01/16/kijimuna-okinawa-fairy-inkblot/ |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}     PARENTHETICAL CITATION:  (Morgan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Kijimuna are tricksters, they have been known to make friends with humans. However, these relationships often go sour. A kijimuna may offer to carry a human on its back as it leaps through the mountains and over the seas. The kijimuna dislike people passing gas on their backs, however, and will immediately throw the human off, no matter where they were at the moment. The kijimuna also hate octopuses.&lt;ref&gt;Okinawan folktales. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.chicagookinawakenjinkai.com/Folklore%20Pages/Kijimuna.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The kijimuna are a common subject in Okinawan folk tales. Many of their stories begin with the kijimuna becoming a human's friend and then ending with the relationship going bad. One story tells of a kijimuna's friend burning down his tree, so the kijimuna fled to the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Okinawan folktales- kijimuna. (2008, June 14).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14470">A Lithuanian personal name, like in mostly [[Europe]]an cultures, consists of two main elements: the [[given name]] (''vardas'') followed by [[family name]] (''pavardė''). The usage of [[personal name]]s in [[Lithuania]] is generally governed (in addition to personal taste or family custom) by three major factors: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[canon law]], and tradition. Lithuanian names always follow the rules of the [[Lithuanian language]]. Lithuanian male names, as well as the rest of words, have preserved the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] masculine endings (''-as''; ''-is''), although the rules are not as rigid as [[Latvian name]]s, which preserve masculine/feminine endings even for foreign names.

== ''Vardas'' (given name) ==
A child in Lithuania is usually given one or two given names. Nowadays the second given name is rarely used in everyday situations, the use of a [[middle name]] being considered pretentious. In addition to modern names, parents normally choose a name or names for their child from a long list of traditional names which may be:

* a [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] name of pre-Christian origin.

It is the most ancient layer of Lithuanian personal names; a majority of them are dual-[[word stem|stemmed]] personal names, of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin. These ancient Lithuanian names are constructed from two interconnected [[Word stem|stem]]s, the combination of which has been used to denote certain beneficial personal qualities, for example ''Jo-gaila'' mean "a strong rider". Although virtually extinct following the [[Christianization of Lithuania]], they continued to exist as [[surnames]], such as [[Goštautas]], [[Kęsgaila]], [[Radvila]] or in their Slavicised versions, as well as in [[toponym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Notably, [[Gelgaudiškis]] from ''Gedgaudas'', [[Radviliškis]] from ''Radvila'', [[Buivydiškės]] from ''Butvydas'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The existing surnames and written sources have allowed the reconstruction of names by linguists, such as [[Kazimieras Būga]]. During the [[Interbellum]] these names returned to popular use after a long period of neglect. Children are often named in honor of the most revered historical Lithuanian rulers, making their names one of the most popular. They include [[Vytautas]], [[Gediminas]], [[Algirdas]], [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis|Žygimantas]]. In line with the double-stemmed names, shorter variants containing only one stem were also used, such as [[Vytenis]] and [[Kęstutis]]. Since there are few pre-Christian female names attested in written sources, they are often reconstructed from male variants, in addition to the historical [[Birutė]], [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]], [[Rimgailė]] etc.

* a [[Christian name]], i.e., a [[List of Biblical names|Biblical name]] or a [[saint's name]].

The use of Christian names in the Lithuanian language long predates the adoption of Christianity by Lithuanians. The linguistic data attest that first Biblical names were started to be used in [[Aukštaitija]] as early as in the 11th century. The earliest strata of such names originates from [[Old Church Slavonic]]; they were borrowed by [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] in their [[Byzantine]] versions. The examples of such names are ''Antanas'' ([[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]]), ''Povilas'' or ''Paulius'' ([[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]]), ''Andrius'' ([[St. Andrew]]) and ''Jurgis'' ([[St. George]]). The later influx of Christian names came after the adoption of Christianity in 1387. They are mostly borrowed in their [[Polish language|Polish]] versions: ''Jonas'' ([[John the Apostle|St. John]]), ''Vladislovas''/''Vladas'' ([[St. Ladislaus]]), ''Kazimieras''/''Kazys'' ([[St. Casimir]]), etc.

* a [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] [[common noun]] or [[hydronym]] used as a name.

There are popular names constructed from the words for celestial bodies (''Saulė'' for the [[Sun]], ''Aušrinė'' for [[Venus]]), events of nature (''Audra'' for the storm, ''Aušra'' for the [[dawn]], ''Rasa'' for the [[dew]], ''Vėjas'' for the wind, ''Aidas'' for the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]), plants (''[[Linas]]''/''Lina'' for [[flax]], ''Eglė'' for [[spruce]]), river names (''Ūla'', ''Vilija'' for [[River Neris]]).

* an invented name from literature.

Some names were created by the authors of literal works and spread in public use through them. Such names were invented following the rules of the Lithuanian language; therefore it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the name is fictitious and had never existed before. Notably, ''Gražina'', ''Živilė'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]], ''Daiva'' by [[Vydūnas]], ''Šarūnas'' by [[Vincas Krėvė]] and others.

* names of Lithuanian pagan deities and mythological figures.

There are some popular names of gods and goddesses from [[Lithuanian mythology]] that are used as personal names, such as ''[[Laima]]'', goddess of luck, ''[[Žemyna]]'', goddess of earth, ''[[Gabija]]'', goddess of fire; ''Žilvinas'', a serpent prince from the fairy tale ''[[Eglė the Queen of Serpents]]'', ''Jūratė'', goddess of the sea, and ''Kastytis'', from the legend about ''[[Jūratė and Kastytis]]''.

A distinctive practice dominated in the [[Regions of Lithuania|ethnic region]] of  [[Lithuania Minor]], then being a part of [[East Prussia]], where Lithuanized [[German name|German personal names]] were common, such as ''Ansas'' ([[Hans (name)|Hans]]), ''Grėtė'' ([[Gretchen]]), ''Vilius'' ([[Wilhelm (name)|Wilhelm]]) among [[Prussian Lithuanians]]. Some of them are still in use among Lithuanians at present.

The choice of a given name is largely influenced by fashion. Many parents may name their child after a [[Folk hero|national hero]] or heroine, some otherwise famous person, or a character from a book, film, or [[TV show]]. In spite of this, a great number of names used in today's Lithuania have been in use since the ancient times.

===Sex differentiation===

Lithuanian male and female names are different grammatically. Almost all Lithuanian female names end in the vowels ''-a'' or ''-[[ė]]'', while male names almost always end in ''-s'', and rarely in a vowel ''-a''. When the male  name ending in ''-a'' has its female counterpart, it ends in ''-ė'', such as ''[[Jogaila]]'' and ''Jogailė''. Female double-stemmed Lithuanian names always end in ''-ė''.

===Diminutives===

[[Diminutive]]s are very popular in everyday usage, and are by no means reserved for children. The [[Lithuanian language]] allows for a great deal of creativity in this field. Most diminutives are formed by adding a [[suffix]]. For female names it may be ''-elė'', ''-utė'', ''-ytė'', ''-užė''; certain suffixes are more common to specific names over the rest.

Also, as in many other cultures, a person may informally use a [[nickname]] (''pravardė'') in addition to or instead of a given name.

== ''Pavardė'' (surname) ==
Lithuanian surnames, like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], i.e., passed from the father on to his children.

A married woman usually adopts her husband's name. However, other combinations are legally possible. The wife may keep her [[maiden name]] (''mergautinė pavardė'') or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a [[double-barrelled name]]. It is also possible, though rare, for the husband to adopt his wife's surname or to add his wife's surname to his family name.

=== History ===

Family names first appeared in Lithuania ca. end of 14th century beginning 15th century&lt;ref name='Schmalstieg'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lithuanian names|journal=[[Lituanus]]|year=1982|first=William R.|last=Schmalstieg|volume=28|issue=3|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1982_3/82_3_01.htm|accessdate=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were only reserved to the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. They usually derived from [[patronymic]]s.

The most striking peculiarity of the historical Lithuanian heraldic system, which is adopted from the Polish one in the [[Union of Horodlo]] in 1413, is that '''a coat of arms does not belong to a single family'''. A number of unrelated families (sometimes hundreds of them), usually with a number of different family names, may use a coat of arms, '''and each coat of arms has its own name'''.

The use of family names gradually spread to other social groups: the [[townsfolk]] by the end of the 17th century, then the [[peasantry]]. People from the villages did not have last names until the end of the 18th century. In  cases like this their village of origin was usually noted in documents. The process ended only in the mid-19th century, and due partial [[Polonization]] of society at the time many names were influenced by Polish form of the name.&lt;ref name='Schmalstieg'/&gt;

===Classification===

Based on origin, several groups of Lithuanian family names may be recognized.

==== Cognominal ====
A [[cognominal surname]] derives from a person's nickname, usually based a physical or character trait.

Examples: 
* Naujokas, Naujokaitis – from ''naujas'' ("new one")
* Kairys, Kairelis, – "[[leftie]]", from ''kairė'' ("left side")

====Occupational====
Examples of [[occupational surname]]s: 
* Kalvis, Kalvelis, Kalvaitis – from ''kalvis'' ("[[blacksmith]]")

==== Toponymic ====
A [[toponymic surname]]  usually derives from the name of a village or town,  or the name of a topographic feature.

Examples:
* Užugiris – from across the forest (''už girios'');
* Kalnietis – from the mountains (''kalnai'').

==== Patronymic ====
A [[patronymic surname]] derives from a given name of a person and usually ends in a suffix suggesting a family relation.

Examples:
* Jonaitis, Janavičius, Januitis – derived from ''Jonas'' ([[John (name)|John]]);  
* Adomaitis, Adamonis, Adamkus – derived from ''Adomas'' ([[Adam (name)|Adam]]);  
* Lukauskis, Lukša, Lukošius, Lukoševičius – derived from ''Lukas'' ([[Luke (name)|Luke]]).

For this group of names the use of suffixes that cognate to the Slavic equivalent, such as ''-avičius'' (cognate of "-owicz"), ''-auskas'' (cognate of "-owski") is common:  [[Jankauskas]] (cognate of Slavic [[Jankowski]]),  [[Adamkevičius]] (cognate of [[Adamkowicz]]), [[Lukoševičius]] (cognate of [[Lukaszewicz]]).

====Diminutives====
A number of surnames are [[diminutive]]s of popular first names.&lt;ref&gt;American surnames, by Elsdon Coles Smith, 1986, {{ISBN|0806311509}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OfHBWBK1wQQC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22lithuanian+surnames%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lithuanian%20surnames%22&amp;f=false p. 83]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Butkus]] from Butkintas
*[[Minkus]] from Minkantas
*[[Norkus]] from Norkantas
*[[Rimkus]] from Rimkantas

=== Feminine forms ===
Lithuanian surnames have specific [[Grammatical gender|masculine and feminine]] forms. While a masculine surname usually ends in ''-as'', ''-ys'' or ''-is'', its feminine equivalent ends in ''-ienė'' or rarely ''-uvienė'' for married women and ''-aitė'', ''-utė'', ''-iūtė'' or ''-ytė'' for unmarried ones.
Examples:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Father / husband
! Married woman or widow
! Unmarried woman
|-
| Paulauskas
| Paulauskienė
| Paulauskaitė
|-
| Bimbirys
| Bimbirienė
| Bimbirytė
|-
| Adamkus
| Adamkienė
| Adamkutė
|-
| Mielkus
| Mielkienė/Mielkuvienė
| Mielkutė
|-
| Kulėšius
| Kulėšienė
| Kulėšiūtė
|}

In 2003, Lithuanian laws allowed women to use a short form, without disclosing the marital status (ending in -ė instead of -ienė/-aitė/etc.: Adamkus –&gt; Adamkė)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.214783|title=N-2(87) Dėl moterų pavardžių darymo|website=e-seimas.lrs.lt|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These names are used, although traditional forms are still predominant.&lt;ref name="veidas"&gt;[http://www.veidas.lt/lt/leidinys.full/47c94b0032aff Naujoviškos pavardės tradicinių neišstūmė. Veidas magazine, 2008/9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305202828/http://www.veidas.lt/lt/leidinys.full/47c94b0032aff |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[Department of Statistics of Lithuania]], the most popular feminine family names are:&lt;ref name="veidas"/&gt;
# Kazlauskienė
# Jankauskienė
# Petrauskienė
# Stankevičienė
# Paulauskienė

== Formal and informal use ==
Lithuanians pay great attention to the correct way of referring to or addressing other people depending on the level of social distance, familiarity and politeness. The differences between formal and informal language include:
* using surnames vs. given names;
* using vs. not using honorific titles such as ''Ponas'' / ''Ponia'';
* using the third person singular forms vs. second person singular;
* using second-person singular personal pronoun vs. second-person plural personal pronoun to address a single person.

=== Formal language ===

==== Ponas/Ponia ====
''Ponas'' and ''Ponia'' ([[vocative case]] ''Pone'', ''Ponia'') are the basic honorific styles used in Lithuanian to refer to a man or woman, respectively. In the past, these styles were reserved to members of the ''[[szlachta]]'' and played more or less the same roles as "Lord" or "Sir" and "Lady" or "Madam" in English. Since the 19th century, they have come to be used in all strata of society and may be considered equivalent to the English "Mr." and "Ms." There is a separate style, ''Panelė'' ("Miss"), applied to an unmarried woman.

==== Given name/surname order ====
The given name(s) normally comes before the surname. However, in a list of people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. In many formal situations the given name is omitted altogether.

=== Informal language ===
Informal forms of address are normally used only by relatives, close friends and co-workers. In such situations diminutives are often preferred to the standard forms of given names.

'''Michael Hoenig''' (born 4 January 1952) is a [[Germans|German]] composer who has composed music for several films and games, in addition to two solo albums, including the highly acclaimed 1978 album ''[[Departure from the Northern Wasteland]]''. In 1997, he was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music]] for composing the theme to the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Dark Skies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/dark-skies |title=Dark Skies |publisher=[[Emmy Award|Emmys.com]] |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
As the editor of the underground magazine ''LOVE'' in the late sixties, Hoenig was part of the burgeoning progressive rock scene in Berlin, which fostered bands like [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Ash Ra Tempel]] and [[Agitation Free]]. His interest in [[avant-garde]] music, [[sound generator]]s and prepared tapes caught the eye of Michael Guenther, the bassist of [[Agitation Free]], and he joined the band in February 1971. In March 1975, Hoenig was hired to replace [[Peter Baumann]] in Tangerine Dream for an Australian tour and a London [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert, and subsequently left Agitation Free, which broke up shortly after. Baumann rejoined Tangerine Dream soon after, and Hoenig went on to collaborate with [[Klaus Schulze]] on the short-lived project, [[Timewind]]. In 1976 he had a brief collaboration with Manuel Göttsching of Ash Ra Tempel; a recording of one of the sessions was released in 1995 under the title "Early Water". In 1977, he released his first solo album, the highly acclaimed [[Berlin School of electronic music|Berlin School]] classic ''[[Departure from the Northern Wasteland]]'', and left for [[Los Angeles]] shortly after it was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/departure-from-the-northern-wasteland-mw0000194408 |title=Departure from the Northern Wasteland – Michael Hoenig |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Hoenig owns a recording studio in Los Angeles and through his company Metamusic Productions, he has composed the scores for several movies (see filmography below) and television shows. In addition to this, he has composed music for the extremely popular [[Baldur's Gate series|Baldur's Gate]] PC games by [[BioWare]]. In 1987, Hoenig released his second solo album, [[Xcept One]]. The track Bones on the Beach from the Xcept One album was installed in the roller coaster CHAOS at [[Opryland USA|Opryland]] in [[Nashville]], making the attraction the first roller coaster to be synced to music. Bones on the Beach has also been used at a similar roller coaster, [[Revolution (Bobbejaanland)|Revolution]], at [[Bobbejaanland]], a family park in [[Lichtaart]], [[Belgium]] from 2004-2008 and since 2011.

'''Mimi Coertse''' (born 12 June 1932) is a South African [[soprano]].

==Early life==
Coertse, born in [[Durban]], matriculated at the [[Helpmekaar Kollege|Helpmekaar Girls High School]] in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}} She began vocal studies in South Africa in 1949.&lt;ref name="rosenthalwarrack"&gt;H. Rosenthal and J. Warrack, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (OUP, London 1974 printing).&lt;/ref&gt; Her first vocal coach in Johannesburg was Aimee Parkerson.&lt;ref name="IOL01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/international/onse-mimi-coertse---a-formidable-woman-1317038|title=‘Onse’ Mimi Coertse - a formidable woman|work=IOL|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=6 August 2017|author=de Beer, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her debut performance in South Africa was singing Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' at the [[Johannesburg City Hall]] on 11 December 1951.&lt;ref name=IOL01/&gt; In July 1953 she married broadcaster and composer [[Dawid Engela]].&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}} She left South Africa in September 1953 for London, and then went via [[The Hague]] to [[Vienna]]. In January 1954 she started training with Maria Hittorff and [[Josef Witt]].&lt;ref name=IOL01/&gt;

==Opera career==
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2017}}
Coertse made her debut in January 1955 as the "first flower girl" in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' at the [[Teatro San Carlo]] in [[Naples]], [[Karl Böhm]] conducting. She also sang in [[Basle]] at the Teatro San Carlo. On 17 March 1956 she made her debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] as the Queen of the Night in ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and remained with the Vienna State Opera until 1978.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt; Her [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] debut was in 1956, in the same role.&lt;ref name="rosenthalwarrack"/&gt; 

Her roles were limited in the United Kingdom as the [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] boycott of South Africa due to [[Apartheid]], prevented its members from having anything to do with South Africa's  entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=IOL01/&gt;

[[File:Mimi Coertse - 1959 (1).jpg|thumb|Mimi Coertse in die rolprent Nooi van my hart.]]
Coertse sang the soprano part in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Matthäus-Passion]]'' at [[Fritz Wunderlich]]'s first appearance in Vienna in 1958, when he performed the tenor arias with [[Julius Patzak]] singing the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]]. In 1958, Coertse and Fritz Wunderlich again worked together at the [[Aix-en-Provence]] festival in ''Die Zauberflöte''.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 1965, she sang Konstanze in ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' at the Vienna State Opera which also featured Fritz Wunderlich as Belmonte. In 1966, Mimi was honoured by the President of Austria with the title ''Österreichischer Kammersänger'', for her ten years of work as a permanent member at the Vienna State Opera.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Later years==
{{moresources|section|date=March 2018}}
Since returning to South Africa in 1973 she has been a regular guest on South African stages and also a frequent broadcaster on radio and television. She remained contracted to the Vienna State Opera until 1978. 

In recent years she has devoted her time to exposing young South African singers to the neglected art of [[Lieder]] singing which can be artistically even more demanding than opera singing. Her support for her fellow South African musicians has been outstanding – as may be witnessed in her ''Debut with Mimi'' and through the ''Mimi Coertse Bursary''.

In 1996, Austria's Federal Ministry for Science and Art awarded her the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]] (Austrian Honour, first class) honour, the highest honour an artist can receive in that country.&lt;ref name=Parl01/&gt; 

In 1998, she received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Pretoria]] and another in 2013 from the [[University of South Africa|Unisa]].&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt; In 2002 she would receive the Golden Rathausmann from the mayor of Vienna.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;

In 1998, Coertse and Neels Hansen founded ''The Black Tie Ensemble'', a development project which enables young, classically trained singers to bridge the gap between training and professional performance.&lt;ref name="IOL02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/music/opera-in-limbo-facing-reality-of-funds-1748042|title=Opera in limbo, facing reality of funds|work=IOL|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=6 August 2017|author=de Beer, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This project has developed into the most exciting classical singing ensemble in South Africa, and is now on the brink of becoming a vibrant, new, young opera company. A project for future stars of Africa! The Ensemble, sponsored by [[Sappi]], performs operas at the [[State Theatre, South Africa|State Theatre]] ([[Pretoria]]), [[Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden]] (Johannesburg) and the [[Joburg Theatre|Civic Theatre]] (Johannesburg).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Marriage==
Mimi was married three times. Her first marriage was to South African composer Dawid Engela in 1953 but the marriage ended in divorce in 1957.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}} Her second marriage was to Italian business man Diego Brighi in 1965 and was again divorced in 1969.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}} Her last marriage was to a businessman, Werner Ackerman, in 1970 and lasted until 1994.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;{{rp|5}} After five miscarriages, she would adopt a son and daughter, Walter and Mia.&lt;ref name=Burg01/&gt;

==Honours and awards==
* 1961: Medal of Honour of the South African Academy for Science and Art (''Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns'') {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Separated from his father Jo Gray, Hilda took him to grow up with her father at Middle View near Dalgety on the Snowy River. His grandfather brought him up. George Hedger was son of a man that newspaper reports said was the original inspiration for the [[Banjo Paterson]] poem "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Monaro Mercury| date=3 August 1912| title=Death of George H. Hedger}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Noel and Hilda moved to Sydney and he attended a number of technical schools and at the Sydney Technical School passed the [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|Intermediate Certificate]] He then went to worked in the radio industry culminating in a position at Kriesler as a technician before the War.

Nucleus Holdings Pty Limited, a company incorporated in 1967, became a 50% shareholder of Telectronics in January 1968.

This led to the sale of Telectronics assets to, eventually, [[St. Jude Medical]] of Minneapolis and Pacific Dunlop restructuring itself into [[Ansell]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
An '''orator''', or '''oratist''', is a public speaker, especially one who is eloquent or skilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/orator|title=orator {{!}} Definition of orator in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Recorded in English c. 1374, with a meaning of "one who pleads or argues for a cause", from Anglo-French ''oratour'', Old French ''orateur'' (14th century), Latin ''orator'' ("speaker"), from ''orare'' ("speak before a court or assembly; plead"), derived from a Proto-Indo-European base *''or-'' ("to pronounce a ritual formula").

The modern meaning of the word, "public speaker", is attested from c. 1430.

==History==
In ancient [[Rome]], the art of speaking in public (''Ars Oratoria'') was a professional competence especially cultivated by [[politician]]s and [[lawyer]]s. As the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] were still seen as the masters in this field, as in philosophy and most sciences, the leading Roman families often either sent their sons to study these things under a famous master in Greece (as was the case with the young [[Julius Caesar]]), or engaged a Greek teacher (under pay or as a slave).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In the young revolutionary French republic, ''Orateur'' (French for "orator", but compare the Anglo-Saxon parliamentary [[speaker (politics)|speaker]]) was the formal title for the delegated members of the [[Tribunat]] to the [[Corps législatif]], to motivate their ruling on a presented bill.

In the 19th century, orators and [[lecture]]rs, such as [[Mark Twain]], [[Charles Dickens]], and Col. [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] were major providers of [[popular entertainment]].

A '''pulpit orator''' is a Christian author, often a clergyman, renowned for their ability to write or deliver (from the [[pulpit]] in church, hence the word) rhetorically skilled religious [[sermon]]s.

In some [[university|universities]], the title 'Orator' is given to the official whose task it is to give speeches on ceremonial occasions, such as the presentation of [[honorary degrees]].

== Orators ==
The following are, by necessity, '''those who have been noted as famous specifically for their oratory abilities''', or for a particularly famous speech or speeches. Most religious leaders and politicians (by nature of their office) may perform many speeches, as may those who support or oppose a particular issue. To include them all would be prohibitive.

'''Pellegrino Rossi''' (13 July 1787 – 15 November 1848) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] economist, politician and jurist. He was an important figure of the [[July Monarchy]] in France, and the Minister of Justice in the government of the [[Papal States]], under [[Pope Pius IX]].

==Biography==
Rossi was born in [[Carrara]], then under the [[Duchy of Massa and Carrara]]. Educated at the [[University of Pisa]] and the [[University of Bologna]], he became professor of law at the latter in 1812. In 1815 he gave his support to [[Joachim Murat]] and his [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] anti-[[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] expedition: after the latter's fall, he escaped to France, and then proceeded to [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], where he began teaching a course of [[jurisprudence]] applied to [[Roman law]], the success of which gained him the unusual honour of [[naturalization]] as a [[Swiss people|citizen of Geneva]]. In 1820 he was elected as a deputy to the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal council]], and was a member of the diet of 1832; Rossi was entrusted with the task of drawing up a revised constitution, which was known as the ''Pacte Rossi''. This was rejected by a majority of the diet, a result which deeply affected Rossi, and made him accept the invitation of [[François Guizot]] to settle in France.

Here he was appointed in 1833 to the chair of [[political economy]] in the [[Collège de France]], vacated by the death of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]. He was naturalized as a French citizen in 1834, and in the same year became professor of [[constitutional law]] in the faculty of law of the [[University of Paris|Paris University]]. In 1836 he was elected a member of the [[Academy of Political and Moral Sciences]], was raised to the [[Peerage of France|French peerage]] in 1839, and in 1843 became [[dean (education)|dean]] of the faculty of law.

In 1842 Rossi  and Count Ferdinand-Charles-Philippe d' Esterno (1805–83) organized the first meetings of what would become the [[Société d'économie politique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=670 |last=Garnier|first=Joseph|title=Dictionnaire de l'économie politique contenant l'exposition des principes de la science, l'opinion des écrivains qui ont le plus contribué a sa fondation et a ses progrés, la bibliographie générale de l'économie politique par noms d'auteurs et par ordre de matiéres, avec des notices biographiques et une appréciation raisonnée des principaux ouvrages: A-I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY7KFHk43q0C&amp;pg=PA670|accessdate=2017-08-18|year=1852|publisher=Meline, Cans|chapter=Économie Politique (Société d’)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, Guizot appointed Rossi ambassador of France to the Papal States, with a specific mission to discuss the question of the [[Jesuits]]. However, the [[French Revolution of 1848]] toppled Guizot's regime, and the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolution in Italy]] fully severed Rossi's connection with France. Rossi thus remained at Rome and became Minister of the Interior under Pius IX. Rossi's program of [[Liberalism|liberal reforms]], however, never took off, as his brand of [[conservative liberalism]], in which suffrage was to be limited to the well-off and the economic and social disruptions created by industrialization went unaddressed, had narrow appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last=Duncan|first=Mike|author-link = Mike Duncan (podcaster)|title=The Flight of the Pope|website=Revolutions|publisher=|date=18 February 2018|time= |url=http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2018/02/727-the-flight-of-the-pope.html|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His assassination took place on the stairs at the opening of the Parliament in the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]] on 15 November 1848 by a stab wound to the neck. This was one of the causes of the flight from Rome of Pope Pius IX and the beginning of the series of events that led to the proclamation of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]].

The murderer was said to be Luigi Brunetti, the elder son of Angelo Brunetti (or Ciceruacchio), who acted at the instigation of [[Pietro Sterbini]], and with the cooperation of some veterans or ''reduci'' of the conflict in Lombardy. After the murder, the senate adjourned without much sorrow, and little to no attention to the murder victim. That night crowds at the house of Rossi's widow chanted ''Blessed is the hand that stabbed the Rossi''. Sterbini went on to play a prominent role in the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] in 1849, but fled into exile after its fall, until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0UmLbpjJYYC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=who+murdered+Pellegrino+Rossi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJp2dp9t52&amp;sig=c8kpAii6gtgfBXqsFeyel0ZaN5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7r_fUJXWMYL8qAHS_4GwDg&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=who%20murdered%20Pellegrino%20Rossi&amp;f=false ''Garibaldi's Defence of the Roman Republic''], (1907) by [[George Macaulay Trevelyan]], 3rd edition, Longmans, Green, and Company, 39 Paternoster Row, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In a trial held in 1854, a man by the name of Gabriele Constantini was convicted and executed.

The city of Carrara erected a statue in honour of Pellegrino Rossi.

'''Robert Bigham Brode''' (June 12, 1900 – February 19, 1986) was an American physicist, who during [[World War II]] led the group at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos laboratory]] that developed the fuses used in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

A graduate of the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he earned his doctorate in 1924, Brode attended [[Oxford University]] on  a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and the [[University of Göttingen]] on a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowship. During [[World War II]], Brode worked at Applied Physics Laboratory at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he helped develop the [[proximity fuse]], and then as a group leader at the Los Alamos Laboratory. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the [[hydrogen bomb]].

After the war, Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley. Between 1930 and 1957 he supervised 37 graduate students. In addition to his research and teaching, he occupied a number of other positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, and sat on numerous advisory panels and boards.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Bigham Brode was born in [[Walla Walla, Washington]], on June 12, 1900, the son of Howard S. Brode, a professor of biology at [[Whitman College]], and his wife Martha Catherine née Bigham. He was the second of a set of quadruplets, being born between his brothers [[Wallace R. Brode|Wallace]] and Malcolm, the fourth child died within weeks of being born. They also had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwda.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv07580 |title=Guide to the Howard S. Brode Papers 1890–1958 |publisher=Northwestern Digital Archives |accessdate=February 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=27 }}

Brode graduated from Whitman College with his Bachelor of Science degree in 1921, and then entered the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in [[physics]] in 1924, the first year in which Caltech awarded this degree,&lt;ref name="acap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsnow.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?broder |title=Robert Brode |publisher=Array of Contemporary American Physicists |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221214854/http://physicsnow.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?broder |archivedate=February 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=27 }} for his thesis on "the absorption coefficient for slow electrons in gases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechETD:etd-04192004-160943 |publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] |title=The Absorption Coefficient for Slow Electrons in Gases  |accessdate=February 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external [[electron]]s have similar [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for collisions with slow electrons. These results could not be readily explained with [[classical physics]], and their importance would not be realised until 1966.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=28 }}

On graduation, Brode became an Associate Physicist at the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. He was awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to study at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], in England in 1924 and 1925, and then a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowship, which he used to study at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany in 1925 and 1926, and then at [[Princeton University]] from 1926 to 1927. On returning to the United States, he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16, 1926. They had two sons.&lt;ref name="acap" /&gt;{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=28 }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gc.gf.org/fellows/1793-robert-b-brode |title=Robert B. Brode |publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222232955/http://gc.gf.org/fellows/1793-robert-b-brode |archivedate=February 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brode became an assistant professor of physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which enabled him to return to England and study at [[Cambridge University]] and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with the British physicist [[P.M.S. Blackett]].&lt;ref name="acap" /&gt;{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=28 }} He was impressed by Blackett's [[cloud chamber]]s, and set his graduate students to work on projects using them, starting with [[Dale R. Corson]].{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=29 }}

== Manhattan Project ==
In 1941, after the start of [[World War II]], Brode went to work at Applied Physics Laboratory at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he helped develop the [[proximity fuse]]. In 1943, he moved with his family to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he was appointed the leader of the E-3 Fusing Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brode|first1=Bernice|editor1-last=Badash|editor1-first=Lawrence|editor2-last=Hirschfelder|editor2-first=Joseph O.|editor3-last=Broida|editor3-first=Herbert P.|title=Reminiscences of Los Alamos 1943-1945|date=1980|publisher=Reidel|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-90-277-1098-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Bernice was also hired to work at Los Alamos as a [[human computer]] in the T (Theoretical) Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howes|first1=Ruth H.|last2=Herzenberg|first2=Caroline L.|title=Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project|date=2003|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9781592131921|pages=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brode's group consisted of 14 civilians, 12 military officers and 37 enlisted men of the [[Special Engineer Detachment]]. Its task was to develop a fuse that would detonate an [[atomic bomb]] at a specified height above the ground.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|pp=30–31 }} {{sfn|Hawkins|1946|pp=132–135}}

Normally, bombs are cheap and fuses are relatively expensive, but an atomic bomb is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within {{convert|200|ft}} of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar [[proximity fuse]]s and [[barometric altimeter]] fuses. Testing was carried out at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]] in August 1943 and [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Army Air Field]] in March 1944 using dummy drops from [[barrage balloon]]s. In the end, a modified APS-13 [[Monica tail warning radar]] known as "Archie" was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|pp=30–31 }}{{sfn|Hawkins|1946|pp=132–135}}

== Later life ==
After the war, Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In 1951 he returned to England for another year, this time at [[Manchester University]] as a [[Fulbright Scholar]].{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|pp=32-33 }} Between 1930 and 1943, 15 graduate students conducted their research under his direction.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=29 }} He supervised another  22 between 1946 and 1957. The 37 students included Corson, who became president of [[Cornell University]], and [[William B. Fretter]], who was vice president of the University of California from 1978 to 1983.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|p=32 }}

In addition to his research and teaching, Brode occupied a number of other positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, [[Clark Kerr]] from 1960 to 1965, and [[Charles J. Hitch]] from 1972 to 1973, and to [[Angus E. Taylor]], the vice-president for academic affairs, from 1967 to 1972. He served on the selection panels for [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], [[Fulbright Scholarship|Fulbright]] and [[Kennedy Scholarship|Kennedy]] scholarships, and for awards from the [[State Department]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[Institute of International Education]]. He was chairman of the Advisory Board of the [[Naval Ordnance Test Station]] from 1948 to 1955, a member of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology]] (CODATA) from 1951 to 1957, and chairman of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] and the [[American Institute of Physics]]' Committee on Physics Faculties in Colleges from 1962 to 1965.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|pp=32-33 }}&lt;ref name="acap" /&gt;

At various times Brode was vice president of the International Union for Pure and Applied Physics and the [[American Association of University Professors]], a  member of the Council of the [[American Physical Society]], president of the Pacific Division of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], chairman of the Physics Division of the National Research Council, associate director for research of the [[National Science Foundation]], and the U.S. delegate to the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]]. He was acting director of the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory from 1964 to 1965 and director of its Education Abroad Program in the United Kingdom from 1965 to 1967.{{sfn|Fretter|Judd|1992|pp=32-33 }}&lt;ref name="acap" /&gt;

Brode became a [[professor emeritus]] at Berkeley in 1967.&lt;ref name="acap" /&gt; He died at his home in Berkeley on  February 19, 1986.

'''Robert James Lees''' (born 12 August 1849 in [[Hinckley]], Leicestershire – died 11 January 1931 in [[Leicester]]) was a British [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]], [[Mediumship|medium]], preacher, writer and healer of the late [[Victorian era]] and early twentieth century known today for claims that he knew the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]], responsible for the [[Whitechapel murders]] of 1888.&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"&gt;Harris, Melvin. (1986). ''Investigating the Unexplained''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 59-65. {{ISBN|0-87975-367-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The son of William Lingham Lees (1818–1880) and Elizabeth (née Patch) (1819–1883), Robert Lees was born in [[Hinckley]] and spent his early years in [[Birmingham]]. It is claimed that, following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1861 the 13-year-old Lees went into a trance and communicated messages from Albert to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It is further claimed that Lees lived for a period in [[Buckingham Palace]] so that Victoria could regularly talk to her beloved Albert through him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qPXsIbPR5goC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=robert+james+lees+queen+victoria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=06pfLnQWNf&amp;sig=50rbtUpdUraI8UgBiLt9KWB7UHs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YD3OSvTDFs7KjAe9irX4Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20james%20lees%20queen%20victoria&amp;f=false González-Wippler, Migene 'What Happens After Death: Scientific &amp; Personal Evidence for Survival' Published by Llewellyn Publications, U.S. pgs 100–101 (1997)] {{ISBN|1-56718-327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chron&gt;[http://www.leicesterchronicler.com/lees.htm Lees in the ''Leicester Chroicler'']&lt;/ref&gt; None of these claims have been substantiated. The only Royal connection that has been uncovered between Lees and the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] is a letter dated 23 January 1899 sent to Lees from the Privy Office thanking him for sending [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] a copy of his book ''Through The Mists''.&lt;ref name=WSoc&gt;[http://www.whitechapelsociety.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=31 'Robert James Lees and The Psychic Hunt For Jack The Ripper' ''The Whitechapel Society 1888 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1871 Lees married Sarah Ann Bishop (1850–1912), whom he had first met as a boy while attending a [[Sunday School]] class in the [[Aston]] district of [[Birmingham]]. They had sixteen children, ten of whom survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=rjl/&gt; In 1876 he moved to [[Manchester]] where he worked as a journalist for the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''. In 1878 Lees and his family moved to London, where he worked as a journalist in [[Fleet Street]] and where he befriended [[William Thomas Stead|W.T. Stead]]. He worked on several London-based publications including [[George Newnes]]' ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=rjl&gt;[http://www.rjlees.co.uk/ Biography on the R J Lees website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritualist==
Lees claimed to have had his first psychic experience aged three. He later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am personally aware that as a child I cried at being left in the darkness unless I saw a mysterious and to others invisible kilted Highlander who remained beside me talking or singing till I fell asleep. And even now, after a lapse of half a century the vivid memory of his strong but kindly face is as freshly recalled as if he had sat beside me whilst this New Year was born."&lt;ref name=rjl/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite having had little formal education, Lees wrote a series of [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] books which continued to sell many years after his death. He claimed that these books had been dictated to him by friends from the spirit realm, and referred to himself as ''the Recorder''. The best known is the three-volume series 'The Mists Trilogy' (''Through the Mists'', ''The Life Elysian'', ''The Gate of Heaven''), written between 1898 – 1931. ''The Heretic'' was written as his only autobiographical novel which was a record of his many years in London. ''An Astral Bridegroom'' was a study into [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-james-lees"Lees biography on Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=silence&gt;[http://www.revealingthesilence.com/rjl.html Lees on the ''Revealing the Silence'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics consider his psychic claims to be the result of self-[[delusion]].&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Gordon. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. [[Prometheus Books]]. p. 585. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack the Ripper==
At the time of the [[Jack the Ripper]] [[Whitechapel murders|murders]] in 1888, Lees was living in the London area.&lt;ref name=cjtr&gt;[http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/ripperoo-lees.html Robert James Lees &amp; Visions From Hell? by Jennifer D. Pegg on the Casebook:Jack the Ripper website]&lt;/ref&gt; His diary entries for 1888 reveal that on 2 October, during a month when no Ripper murders took place, Lees went to both the [[City of London Police]] and [[Scotland Yard]] offering his assistance in catching Jack the Ripper. However, he was turned away as a madman on both occasions, though Scotland Yard offered to write to him.&lt;ref&gt;Lees diary of 1888, in the Archive at Stansted Hall – The College For Psychic Science&lt;/ref&gt;

One story, frequently quoted in books and films on the subject, is that Lees, using his [[psychic]] power, led the Police to Jack the Ripper. This story first appeared in print on 28 April 1895, in ''[[Chicago Times|The Chicago Herald]]''. Another version of the same story was also published in ''[[The People]]'' on 19 May 1895.

The ''Chicago Herald'' article claimed that over a number of years Lees had been troubled by psychic visions of Jack the Ripper killing his victims. Each of these visions came true. Lees became disturbed by the visions and sought medical advice, going abroad as a result, where he no longer had the visions. Back in London, he and his wife Sarah were travelling on an [[Bus#History|omnibus]] when a man got on at [[Notting Hill]]. Lees turned and told his wife that the man was 'Jack the Ripper'. Even though his wife laughed at him, when the man got off the bus at [[Marble Arch]] Lees followed him. Finding a [[Police Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Police Constable]] on the way Lees told him of his suspicions, but the Constable also laughed at him. After more murders Lees was able to convince the Police of the truth of his visions and led them to a fashionable house in London which was home to a noted physician who had treated members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]&lt;ref name=rjl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Robin. (2006). ''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer and a Literary Phenomenon''. Kent State University Press. p. 159 {{ISBN|0-87338-861-5}}]&lt;/ref&gt; On being found in incriminating circumstances, the doctor was put in a [[Psychiatric hospital|lunatic asylum]] under the name of Thomas Mason 124, and a mock funeral held. According to the ''Chicago Herald'', the tale had been related by a Dr. Howard of London, who, when drunk, had told the story to a man who then told the newspaper.&lt;ref name=cjtr/&gt;

[[Ripperologist]]s disregard the story as a hoax. Obvious errors in the ''Chicago Herald'' story include the claim there had been 17 murders that took place over a number of years, while the actual number of Ripper victims was just five, with the actual murders occurring in just a few months in the Autumn of 1888.&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"/&gt; [[Melvin Harris]] in his book ''Jack the Ripper, The Bloody Truth'' provides convincing evidence that the story was a hoax. He believes that the hoaxers were the 'Whitechapel Club, Chicago', the offices of the Club at that time being behind those of the ''Chicago Herald''.&lt;ref name=cjtr/&gt; According to Harris the police had "denied that Lees was involved with the Ripper hunt. In Fact, Robert Lees's own diary entries contradict this part of the tale. They show that he didn't approach the police until October 2, 1888 three days after the murders on the twenty-ninth."&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"/&gt;

In 1976 the Lees/Ripper story came into prominence again with the publication of [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]'s book ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''. Ian Sharp had rediscovered the ''Chicago Herald'' article while researching [[Jack the Ripper]] for a [[BBC]] documentary which had been screened before the publication of Knight's book. The publication of ''The Final Solution'' saw the first time that the ''Chicago Herald'' article had officially been quoted in a major publication since ''[[The People]]'' had quoted it in 1895.&lt;ref name=cjtr/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1902 Lees moved to [[Ilfracombe]] in Devon with his family from [[Plymouth]] and remained there until about 1928, when he returned to [[Leicester]]. Lees died at his home, 'Hazelhurst', Fosse Road South, Leicester, in 1931 at the age of 81 years. His body was cremated at Gilroes Cemetery and his ashes were interred in the grave of his wife in Score Woods Cemetery at Ilfracombe.&lt;ref name=rjl/&gt;

A [[blue plaque]] to commemorate Lees was commissioned by the [[Hinckley]] Civic Society and was unveiled by a descendant of Lees on Saturday 2 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenbutt.co.uk/leesplaque.htm Plaque to Robert James Lees unveiled]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

Robert James Lees has been depicted in several works on fiction related to the Jack the Ripper case.

In the 1979 film ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' starring [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]], Lees was played by [[Donald Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079592/ ''Murder by Decree''] (1979) on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1988 [[ITV Network|ITV]] mini-series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' starring [[Michael Caine]], Lees was played by actor [[Ken Bones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095388/ ''Jack the Ripper''] (1988) on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a character in the comic book ''[[From Hell]]'', written by [[Alan Moore]], although he is omitted from its [[From Hell (film)|film adaptation]]. In the [[graphic novel]], Lees is portrayed as a charlatan, though he is ultimately – and unwittingly –  instrumental in helping [[Frederick Abberline|Chief inspector Abberline]] in identifying the Ripper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-fromhell.html From Hell : a discussion of the Moore/Campbell series]&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, though this version of Lees admits privately that his visions were false, he also says that they all turned out to be true.

'''Sanesan''' was the king of [[Maskut]] in the early 4th century. He converted to [[Christianity]], but then rejected it and slew [[Grigoris (catholicos)|Grigoris]], the bishop who had introduced him to the faith. According to [[Pavstos Buzand|Faustus Byuzand]], when Grigoris arrived in the Caucasian Albanian principality of Maskut (located along the northeastern [[Azerbaijan]]i and south [[Dagestan]]i shore of the [[Caspian Sea]]) to preach Christianity, its ruler Sanatruk (also known as Sanesan) of the local branch of [[Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania|Arsacides]] ordered him killed. Grigoris was trampled to death by mounted Maskut soldiers in the Vatnik Valley, near the present-day village of Nughdi 37 south of [[Derbent]].&lt;ref&gt;René Grousset, Histoire de l´Arménie, Payot, Paris, 1973 S. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the history of [[Pavstos Buzand|Faustus Byuzand]], Sanesan was a member of the Arsacid Dynasty and ruled lands bordering the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]]. During the reign of his kinsman [[Khosrov III the Small]], he invaded [[Armenia]] with an army of various peoples including [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] in 337. After occupying Armenia for most of a year, he was defeated and killed by the Armenian general Vatche [[Mamikonian]].

Prince '''Simone [[Mikeladze]]''' (Georgian: სიმონ მიქელაძე) was born into a Georgian noble family known from at least the 14th century, and claiming descent from the Bagratids of Taron.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Toumanoff, Cyril (1967). Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p.&amp;nbsp;270. Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The senior, and the princely, line of the Mikeladze flourished in Imereti (western Georgia).

==Biography==

===Early years in India===
[[File:Sri-Chinmoy-sprint.jpg|thumb|Chinmoy in his youth at the start of a sprint.]]
Chinmoy was the youngest of seven children, born in Shakpura, [[Boalkhali Upazila]], in the [[Chittagong District]] of [[East Bengal]], [[British India]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). He lost his father to illness in 1943, and his mother a few months later. Chinmoy began his serious practice of meditation at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flame-Waves|last=Chinmoy|first=Sri|publisher=Agni Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=New York|pages=part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the 12-year-old Chinmoy joined his brothers and sisters at the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in Pondicherry, where elder brothers Hriday and Chitta had already established a presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dua, Shyam (ed). ''The Luminous Life of Sri Chinmoy: An Authorised Biography''. Tiny Tot Publications, 2005. pp. 18, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''My Brother Chitta'' 1998, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Chitta that gave Chinmoy his name which means 'full of divine consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World-destruction: never, impossible!|last=Chinmoy|first=Sri|publisher=Agni Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ashram he spent the next 20 years in spiritual practice, including meditation, study in [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] and [[English literature]],&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''My Brother'' 1998, pp. 60, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; athletics,&lt;ref name="hinduaward" /&gt; and work in the ashram's [[cottage industries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''Sri Chinmoy Answers, Part 23''  2000, p. 28 and Chinmoy, ''How Nolini-da'' 2004, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinmoy claimed that for about eight years, he was the personal secretary to the General Secretary of the ashram, [[Nolini Kanta Gupta]]. Chinmoy translated his writings from Bengali into English.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''Sri Chinmoy Answers, Part 23'', Agni, New York, 2000, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to the United States===
According to Chinmoy, in 1964 he was prompted to move to the United States in response to a "message from within" to be of service to people in the West searching for spiritual fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''Sri Chinmoy Answers, Part 23'', Agni, New York, 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Sam Spanier and Eric Hughes, American sponsors connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, he emigrated to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''Sri Chinmoy Answers, Part 23'' 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He successfully applied for a job as junior clerk at the Indian [[consulate]], despite his lack of formal education. He received support and encouragement from his colleagues and bosses and was invited to give talks on [[Hinduism]]. He started to give talks at universities and later, at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, ''Sri Chinmoy Answers, Part 23'' 2000, pp. 40–50&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chinmoy continued giving lectures and talks at universities around the U.S. on spiritual topics.

==Teachings==
Chinmoy taught that rapid spiritual progress could be made by following a path of love, devotion, and surrender.&lt;ref name=nyt-1973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140313080427/http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/eternity-breath/devotion "Devotion"]. In: ''Eternity's Breath''.

In: ''Canada Aspires, Canada Receives, Canada Achieves Part 2''. Agni Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; He described divine love as self-offering and self-expansion.&lt;ref name=lovedevotion /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Vidagdha Meredith. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KHIPQVSGj7IC&amp;pg=PA96 ''Simplicity and Power: The Poetry of Sri Chinmoy, 1971-1981'']. Aum Publications, 1991. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of love and devotion to God is known as Bhakti Yoga.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His path was not one of earthly renunciation or asceticism, but a middle path where the seeker has the opportunity to renounce, or transform, the negative qualities which stand in the way of union with the Divine. Chinmoy taught that meditation on the heart brings the light of the soul forward to reach the highest reality as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDDwAAAACAAJ ''The Divine Hero: Winning in the Battlefield of Life'']. Watkins, 2002. pp. 6–7, 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chinmoy stated: "We are all seekers, and our goal is the same: to achieve inner peace, light and joy, to become inseparably one with our Source, and to lead lives full of true satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6dbdSOBXuR4C&amp;pg=PA13 ''The Wings of Joy: Finding Your Path to Inner Peace'']. Simon and Schuster, 1997. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
An integral element of Chinmoy's teachings is the understanding of ‘self-transcendence’. Self-transcendence is the practice of having a new goal and going beyond our previous capacities and limits which inevitably gives us joy. Self-transcendence is the goal of making progress in life by becoming a better human being rather than competing with the rest of the world. Chinmoy believes that we are all truly unlimited in spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sri Chinmoy|title=Sport and Meditation|date=2013|publisher=The Golden Shore|isbn=978-3-89532-213-6|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinmoy's philosophy he explains is the acceptance of life. By sharing goodwill and inspiration to others and serving mankind the world can be transformed and peace can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-812|title=Interviewer: So you feel that peace is going to come about by offering goodwill to each and every human being? {{!}} Sri Chinmoy Library|website=www.srichinmoylibrary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He asked his disciples to adopt a vegetarian diet, abstain from [[recreational drugs]] including [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;Kubacki, Maria. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301103721/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=0bbec2e4-ce74-4c86-9ffb-dc4a940af980&amp;k=83044 "An 868-kilometre ‘Spiritual Journey’"] ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''. 23 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and lead a pure and celibate lifestyle.&lt;ref name=hinduaward/&gt;&lt;ref name=institutehonors/&gt; Although influenced by [[Hinduism]], his path catered to an international community of seekers from diverse backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells, John R.

===Meditation===

Chinmoy taught a range of techniques for meditation, especially those for calming and bringing silence to the mind, purifying the thoughts of the mind and meditating on the spiritual heart. Chinmoy explains that by keeping your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new experience can begin to dawn within you and this practise of stilling the mind is the root of all spiritual progress.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sZ1EhmSSX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3 ''Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction''].  Aum Publications, 1978 (1989 reprint). pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinmoy recommended meditation during the quiet atmosphere of the early morning, before starting daily activities. As the traditional Hour of God, between three and four a.m., known as the ''[[Brahma Muhurta]]'', may not suit the western lifestyle of keeping late hours, Chinmoy recommended for those newer to meditation to ideally meditate before seven a.m. Chinmoy taught that both prayer and meditation are important, but there is a difference in the result. Prayer is a process of rising up to God and speaking to Him, and meditation is a practice of stilling the mind so that the God-presence can envelop us and commune with us.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6dbdSOBXuR4C&amp;pg=PA29 ''The Wings of Joy: Finding Your Path to Inner Peace'']. Simon and Schuster, 1997. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught that reading spiritual writings or singing soulful songs was useful to prepare for meditation or to remain in a meditative mood after practising meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sZ1EhmSSX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA140 ''Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction'']. Aum Publications, 1978 (1989 reprint). pp. 140, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinmoy believed that running and physical fitness were a help to the inner spiritual life as well as to the outer life of activity, and encouraged his followers to run daily.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri. [http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/orir ''The Outer Running and the Inner Running'']. Agni Press, 1974 (reprinted online). Retrieved 3 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinmoy regarded the benefits of running as keeping the body fit and clearing the mind; he felt it can also be a form of external meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/foot-soldiers-of-the-soul-636987.html|title=Foot soldiers of the soul|last=Welch|first=Julie|date=28 October 2000|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Nations====
In 1970, Chinmoy began giving twice-weekly non-denominational peace meditations at the [[United Nations]] for UN delegates, staff, and NGO representatives.&lt;ref name=consecrated&gt;Rebidoux, Michelle.

In: ''Understanding the Consecrated Life in Canada: Critical Essays on Contemporary Trends'', Jason Zuidema, editor. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 2015. GoogleBooks pt. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he stated, "The ideas of the United Nations are universal peace and universal brotherhood, and the ideals of the United Nations are a oneness-world-family and a oneness-heart."&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri.

After directing the peace meditations, which had been attended by many UN employees and diplomats, for 37 years, more than 700 UN officials, ambassadors, members of the U.S. Congress, and representatives of various religions, paid tributes to Chinmoy following his death during a posthumous celebration at the UN headquarters in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[Press Trust of India]].

===Interfaith===
[[File:Parliament of Religions 1993.jpg|thumb|Chinmoy giving opening meditation at the [[Parliament of World Religions]], Chicago, 1993]]
An integral part of Chinmoy's teaching is the respect for other paths and religions. Chinmoy wrote:

{{quote|True religion has a universal quality. It does not find fault with other religions. ... Forgiveness, compassion, tolerance, brotherhood and the feeling of oneness are the signs of a true religion.&lt;ref&gt;Chinmoy, Sri.

Chinmoy's efforts to promote inter-faith harmony resulted in him being invited to open the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago (1993)&lt;ref name="PoWR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/news/index.php/2013/04/interfaith-reborn-sri-chinmoys-opening-meditation-of-the-1993-parliament-video/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026123841/http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/news/index.php/2013/04/interfaith-reborn-sri-chinmoys-opening-meditation-of-the-1993-parliament-video/|title=Interfaith Reborn: Sri Chinmoy's Opening Meditation of the 1993 Parliament |website=[[Parliament of the World's Religions]] |date=10 April 2013|archivedate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barcelona (2004)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718142233/http://www.yogachicago.com/sep04/parliament.shtml "Sri Chinmoy Opens the Parliament of World's Religions"].

==The arts==

===Artwork===
[[File:Jharna Kala Painting by Sri Chinmoy.jpg|thumb|Jharna Kala painting by Chinmoy]]

Chinmoy began painting in 1974 during a visit to Ottawa, Canada. He called his artwork "Jharna Kala", which in Bengali means "fountain art". Chinmoy's artwork is inspired by the themes of universal oneness and universal peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/07/painting-exhibition-showcases-art-a-spiritual-luminary.html|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|title=Painting exhibition showcases the art of a spiritual luminary|last=Nurhayati|first=Desy|date=7 February 2011|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His abstract paintings are a mixture of acrylics and pen drawings. Chinmoy used a wide variety of sponges, brushes and colours to paint in a unique spontaneous mystical style with a lot of vigour, strong movement and rhythm. Chinmoy has said that when he paints he finds a spontaneous flow of creativity from the stillness of his meditation that allows him to follow an inner inspiration or ‘streak of light’ to follow.
In December 1991 Chinmoy started a new series of art-work entitled "Dream-Freedom-Peace-Birds" or ‘Soul Birds’. The bird drawings are often simple zen like sketches that have either one bird or in some paintings hundreds of birds in one large drawing. The soul bird drawings, Chinmoy stated, symbolize humanity's heart cry for freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Sri Chinmoy|url=http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/art/|website=SriChinmoyBio.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ART|url=http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/sri_chinmoy/sri_chinmoy_art|website=SriChinmoyCentre.org|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Chinmoy's Art|url=http://www.srichinmoy.tv/art/|website=SriChinmoy.tv|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinmoy began weightlifting in 1985, at the age of 54. His weightlifting included a creative array of objects and machinery designed to challenge his strength and ability.

Introducing one of Chinmoy's weightlifting exhibitions in 1999, Bill Pearl wrote: "Today you are going to see some amazing feats of strength that I myself – and I have been in the industry for fifty-five years – would not even attempt to perform."&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, Bill ''Beyond The Universe: The Bill Pearl Story'' 2003, p192&lt;/ref&gt; Chinmoy said his motivation for lifting was to inspire others, especially those of an older generation. In 2006 he stated, "If I can inspire anybody in this world, then I feel that my life is meaningful. With my weightlifting, I am offering my physical strength to inspire people."&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Fitness'', February/March 2006 issue (No.77)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a program created in 1998 known as 'Lifting up the world with a Oneness Heart', Chinmoy lifted people of inspiration while they stood on a platform overhead. Chinmoy described his motivation: 'I lift them up to show my appreciation for their achievements,'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srichinmoy.org/service/lifting_up_the_world/ Lifting up the World] at Sri Chinmoy.org&lt;/ref&gt; Among some of the 7000 people he lifted include: [[Nelson Mandela]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9H9ga3agTU |title=Video of Mandela and Chinmoy |publisher=Youtube.com |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Richard Gere]]&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; [[Helen Hunt]].&lt;ref name="TFE"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/who-needs-doctors-when-you-can-conceive-courtesy-indian-guru-helen-hunt-finds-out/1075823|title=Who needs doctors when you can conceive courtesy Indian guru, Helen Hunt finds out|last=|first=|date=18 February 2013|work=[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]] |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty Nobel leaureates and a team of sumo wrestlers were also lifted.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt;

In April 2011, a documentary film about Chinmoy's weightlifting titled ''[[Challenging Impossibility (film)|Challenging Impossibility]]'' was featured at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="NY_Times"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/a-monument-to-strength-as-a-path-to-enlightenment/|title=A Monument to Strength as a Path to Enlightenment|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|date=25 April 2011|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Todd]], a professor of [[kinesiology]] at the University of Texas, concluded that Chinmoy misrepresented the type of lift he claimed to have completed.&lt;ref name=powerhouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-20/features/9103110628_1_meditation-sri-chinmoy-ashram/2 |last=Galloway |first=Paul |title=Gonzo Guru |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date= 20 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Muslim 100: The Lives, Thoughts and Achievements of the Most Influential Muslims in History''''' is a 2008 book, written by [[Muhammad Mojlum Khan]] and published by Kube Publishing, listing the biographies of the 100 most influential Muslims in history.

==Overview==
The Muslim 100 is an attempt to explore Islamic history through the lives, thoughts and achievements of a selection of the most influential Muslims. The book is an anthology of biographies of 100 influential Muslim personalities whom the author has selected according to their influence on Muslims throughout 15 centuries of Islam.&lt;ref name="muslimnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elshayyal|first=M. F|url=http://www.archive.muslimnews.co.uk/paper/index.php?article=3714|title=Book Review - One hundred influential Muslim personalities|location=|work=|publisher=''[[The Muslim News]]''|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=1 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001012817/http://www.archive.muslimnews.co.uk/paper/index.php?article=3714|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence is based on their contributions and achievements, which was the main criterion for selection and inclusion in the book. Khan measured the influence of a person by examining their lives and thoughts, and then assessed the nature of their contribution by evaluating what they actually did and what was special or extraordinary about their deeds, actions and accomplishments. In so doing, he claims to be able to determine whether their contributions and achievements had made them national, regional or international figures, and that he could evaluate the intellectual, social, political, economic or cultural importance, value and impact of their contributions and achievements over time.&lt;ref name="bukisa"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=The Muslim 100, The Lives, Thoughts and Achievements of the Most Influential Muslims in History. By Muhammad Mojlum Khan|location= |work= |publisher=''Bukisa''|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By exploring the ideas, thoughts and achievements of the lives of 100 most influential Muslim rulers and conquerors, religious scholars and philosophers, writers and literary figures, scientists and explorers, military generals and freedom fighters, reformers and educationalists, this book goes through Islamic thought, history, culture and civilization.&lt;ref name="bukisa"/&gt;

==Content==
The author's selection is representative of all periods from the advent of Islam to modern times, those who belong to a vast area and whose contributions have covered all fields of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="muslimnews"/&gt;

The 100 most influential Muslims include 20 personalities from modern times. The 100 names include; [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], Sir [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Abul A'la Maududi]], and [[Malcolm X]]. Among the 100, the author listed only four females, [[Aisha|‘A’ishah bint Abu Bakr]], [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadīja bint Khuwaylid]], [[Fatimah]] and [[Rabia Basri|Rābiʻah al-ʻAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya]].&lt;ref name="muslimnews"/&gt;

The book ends with a chronological list of the main events in Islamic history, a select bibliography and two indices, one of names and places and the other of ideas and concepts. It is easy to read and the author avoided using technical language or unnecessary jargon words. The Muslim 100 is aimed primarily at students and lay readers.&lt;ref name="muslimnews"/&gt;

He eventually led the [[Conquest of Mecca|Muslims back to Mecca]] before his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] and [[The Farewell Sermon|death]].

He turned [[Medina]] into a civil society, united the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] and transformed the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian Peninsula]] into a centre of learning, culture, commerce and civilisation. He is arguably the most influential person in history, as 1,400 years after his death, his message and teaching continues to influence mankind. He is regarded by 1.62 billion [[Muslim]]s as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet of God]] and [[Seal of the prophets|the last messenger]].

| Hussein was Muḥammad's second grandson through [[Fatimah]]. He participated in many battles of Islam.

He disagreed with [[Yazid I|Yazid ibn Muawiyah]] as ruler of the Islamic state and refused to recognise Yazid as caliph. His refusal to pledge allegiance to Yazid led to the [[Battle of Karbala]], where Hussein and his followers were [[List of casualties in Hussain's army at the Battle of Karbala|attacked and martyred]]. His fight against injustice, brutality and oppression is commemorated by Muslims on the [[Day of Ashura]], which is a [[Mourning of Muharram|day of mourning]] for Shia Muslims.

==Critical reception==
"It is rare to see a publication which includes personalities from both [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] schools of thought and which is so much needed in today's turbulent world. This book, I believe will... enrich our understanding of not only the historical but the contemporary history of the Muslim." — Ahmed J.

'''Victor Hugo Blanc''' (August 31, 1897 – December 16, 1968) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawyer and politician from [[Philadelphia]].

Blanc was born in Philadelphia in 1897, the son of Samuel and Pauline Blanc. His parents were [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Odessa]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (modern-day [[Ukraine]]). Blanc graduated from [[West Philadelphia High School]] before attending the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] and a [[juris doctor|law degree]] in 1919 and 1923, respectively.{{sfn|Inquirer 1955}}  While still in college, he served in the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Inquirer 1968}}

Blanc had a private law practice before joining the [[Pennsylvania Attorney General|state Attorney General's]] office. He was active in Philadelphia civic organizations and served as president of the National League of [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Clubs in 1938. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Blanc rejoined the military, this time as an officer in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. After the war, he continued his law practice, moving to work as an assistant district attorney in the [[District Attorney of Philadelphia|Philadelphia District Attorney]]'s office in 1950. As an assistant district attorney, Blanc won headlines by investigating police [[Graft (politics)|graft]]. That same year, he was named chairman of the County Board of Public Assistance.{{sfn|Inquirer 1955}}

[[Philadelphia municipal election, 1951|In 1951]], Blanc ran for [[Philadelphia City Council]]. Under the city charter adopted earlier that year, Philadelphians elected a seventeen-member city council, with ten members representing districts of the city, and the remaining seven being elected at-large; Blanc ran for one of the at-large seats. He won, part of a Democratic wave that swept the city government out of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] control for the first time in 67 years.{{sfn|Inquirer 1951}} While on city council, Blanc led an investigation into corruption related to construction at [[Philadelphia International Airport]].{{sfn|Inquirer 1955}}

Blanc returned to prosecution [[Philadelphia municipal election, 1955|in 1955]] when he won election as District Attorney of Philadelphia, succeeding [[Richardson Dilworth]], who had resigned to run for mayor. Blanc, who won the Democratic primary unopposed, handily defeated Republican Wilhelm Knauer in the general election that November.{{sfn|Inquirer 1955}} Two years later, [[Philadelphia municipal election, 1957|in 1957]], he was elected to a four-year term, even though Mayor Dilworth, a fellow Democrat, declined to endorse him.{{sfn|Daily Times 1957}} Before that term ended, Governor [[David L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11179">[[File:Cho Hee-Seung.jpg|thumb|Cho Hee-Seung]]
The '''Victory Altar''' (Korean ''SeungNiJeDan'') is a [[new religious movement]] founded in [[South Korea]] in 1981. It teaches that [[Jesus Christ]] was a false messiah and that the real Christ is its founder, Cho Hee-Seung (1931–2004), “the Victor Christ.” The movement had some 400,000 members in the early 1990s, but declined after Cho was arrested in 1994 and died in 2004; in 2017, membership was evaluated at around 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Secret Chamber.jpg|thumb|The Secret Chamber of Victory Altar]]
Cho Hee-Seung was born on August 12, 1931, in [[Gimpo]], in the [[Gyeonggi]] province of [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; As a Christian, he was incarcerated by [[North Korea]] during the [[Korean War]]; after his liberation, he was active in [[Methodism]] and [[Presbyterianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Victory Altar (2008-2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Decisive for Cho’s subsequent religious activities was his encounter with Park Tae-Seon (1915–1990), the founder of the Olive Tree (Jundokwan), a Korean Christian new religion that gathered 1,5 million followers in the 1970s before declining in the subsequent decades, and generated through various schism several other Korean religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Holland (2014), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, Cho operated as a successful missionary for the Olive Tree and founded several churches in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980, Cho went through a long retreat near [[Bucheon]], South Korea, in one of the Faith Villages of the Olive Tree. Here, in a building known as the “Secret Chamber” (''MilSil''), he was initiated by Hong Eup-Bi, a woman member of the Olive Tree who was regarded as a “shaman.”&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Holland (2014), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Victory Altar claims that on October 15, 1980, Hong recognized in Cho “the Victor Christ” and “God incarnated,” which led him to leave the Olive Tree and establish his own new religious movement, the Victory Altar (SeungNiJeDan), in [[Bucheon]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement grew rapidly, and on August 12, 1991 the headquarters in Bucheon were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Holland (2014), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In few years, the Victory Altar gathered some 400,000 followers, mostly in South Korea, but with branches in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

Because of his criticism of Jesus Christ and his own messianic claims, Cho encountered the hostility of Korean Christian churches, which promoted media campaigns against the Victory Altar and accused its founder of various wrongdoings.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Cho was arrested and spent in jail seven of the last ten years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Holland (2014), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused both of fraud and of having instigated the murder of six ex-members turned militant opponents of the Victory Altar. Cho was convicted for fraud, found not guilty in a first case about the murders in 1996, then found guilty in a second trial in 2004, and sentenced to death, but again found not guilty on appeal. South Korea has three degrees of judgement: the prosecutor appealed the decision favorable to Cho before the Supreme Court, but Cho died just before the trial, on June 19, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution of Cho and above all his death, since many followers believed him to be physically immortal, were serious blows for the movement, which started a phase of decline, although by 2017 it still maintained 40 Victory Altars in Korea with some 100,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Beliefs==
According to the Victory Altar, all the great sacred scriptures of humanity, including the [[Bible]], the classics of [[Buddhism]], and the ancient prophetic books of Korea announce the “original promise” of God, i.e. that humans may achieve physical immortality. This is the only real immortality, and the notion that a soul separated from the body will live eternally in Heaven is a false interpretation of the holy scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Han (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also part of the message of Jesus Christ, thus evidencing that he was a false prophet, and in fact was “the only son of Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;Kwon (1992), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional evidence that Jesus Christ was not a divine incarnation comes, according to the Victory Altar, from the fact that he was the son of a Roman soldier named [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Pantera]], who might have raped his mother [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and that he married [[Mary Magdalene]], widely regarded as a fallen woman.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon (1992), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The sources for these accusations are the Roman anti-Christian philosopher [[Celsus]] and the book [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]], which also influenced the phenomenally successful 2003 novel [[The Da Vinci Code]] by [[Dan Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwon (1992), 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jesus Christ is not part of the succession of divine incarnations and prophets proposed by the Victory Altar. This starts with [[Adam and Eve]], who were divine and immortal and formed the original Trinity with God. Not being omnipotent, however, God could not prevent Satan from capturing Adam and Eve and depriving them of their immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2000), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; 6,000 years, and a succession of divine prophets, were needed before God could overcome Satan and offer again physical immortality to humans. A first set of prophets includes [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[Dan (son of Jacob)|Dan]].&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was the legitimate successor of Jacob (as proved, the Victory Altar maintains, by the Biblical [[Book of Genesis]], 49:16) and eventually his tribe, the Danites, migrated to Korea, whose mythical first king was called [[Dangun]], or King Dan.&lt;ref&gt; Han (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Korea hosted the second set of prophets, including the founder of the Olive Tree, Park Tae-Seon, the woman who initiated Cho, Hong Eup-Bi, and Cho himself, as well as the founders of two other Korean new religions, [[Choe Je-u]] of [[Donghak]] and [[Gang Il-Sun]] of [[Jeungsanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial role, in the sacred history of humanity as narrated by the Victory Altar, belongs to Cho himself, which through his initiation of 1980 overcame the “blood of Satan,” which is still present in all humans and is identified with the ego, and became “the Victor Christ," i.e. a divine incarnation through which God came to Earth, defeated Satan, and finally restored physical immortality for humans.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon (1992), 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, Cho was the first Human after Adam who became physically immortal. Although he had to depose (or, rather, transform) his body because of the malice of his opponents, the movement believes that he is still physically present and guides the religious services of the Victory Altar, where his image is projected through videos.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Services are held daily, and five yearly feasts are also celebrated: the Victory Day (October 15), Cho’s Birthday, which is called Christmas (August 12), Messiah Day (December 25),Holy Dew Spirit Day (January 1), and Parent Day (May 8).&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The “Holy Dew,” also called in the movement “Hidden Manna,” is a smoke, fog, or fire that, the movement claims. emanated from Cho’s body and portraits during his lifetime and continues to emanate from his photographs today. The Victory Altar insists that the Holy Dew is real and can be captured by cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2000), 89–97.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves both as evidence of Cho’s divinity and as spiritual nourishment for his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Victory Altar, Cho also proved his divine status by complying with the “five covenants” he had promised to his followers: the destruction of world [[Communism]]; the stopping of typhoons coming to South Korea; making harvests in Korea abundant; stopping the rainy seasons (June 15-July 15) there; preventing a new Korean war and unifying the two Koreas. The latter covenant, the movement believes, is in the process of being realized, and at any rate Cho has miraculously stopped both the return of Communism to Russia and [[North Korea]]'s aggression plans against South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Han (2016), 135–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main promise of Cho, however, is that at least some humans may recover physical immortality. To this aim, belief in Cho is not sufficient, and the Victory Altar teaches that pretending that mere belief can save is just another of the misconceptions propagated by Jesus Christ. Only those who fully practice the "Law of Liberty,” by overcoming their ego and identifying with fellow human beings as one, may one day cleanse their blood from Satan’s heritage and become physically immortal.&lt;ref&gt;See Kwon (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; As old members age and die, insisting on physical immortality becomes difficult, which has been suggested as another explanation of the movement’s decline.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Many, however, still maintain the hope and proclaim that at least some of them will never die.&lt;ref&gt;See Han (2016), Han (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wang Hsing-ching''' ({{zh|t=王杏慶|s=王杏庆|p=Wáng Xìngqìng}}; born 1946), who has a [[pseudonym]] of '''Nanfang Shuo''' (南方朔, Nánfāng Shuò), is a [[journalist]], [[political commentator]], and cultural [[critic]]. Today, he is the chief editor and writer of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050319061906/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/041010/12/15irn.html ''The Journalist'' magazine] (新新聞週刊), with commentaries on current issues in major newspapers. His writings, including Western ideas analysis, social phenomena criticism, and literature comments, are all regarded as very influential. Crediting his intellectual contribution to the society, he is known as "the most industrious private scholar in Taiwan".

== Background ==
Wang earned his undergraduate degree in the School for Forestry and Resource Conservation, from [[National Taiwan University]] and a doctorate degree in [[Chinese Culture University]]. The [[Senkaku Islands|Senkaku (Diaoyutai) Island]] incident made Wang reach an epiphany to become a journalist. During that period, Wang abandoned his overseas study plan and stayed in Taiwan, starting his career. In the 1970s, Wang was a reporter for the ''[[Taiwan Times]],'' and afterwards worked as a writer, vice general editor, and general editor in ''[[The China Times]]'' (中國時報). Although he never received technical university training in journalism, he has more than twenty years of experience in the mass media as a news commentator.

== Style and major themes of writing ==
Wang, as an author, began with topics mainly concerned about cultural changes, political changes, and the controversies in society. His early works are based on the themes of describing and criticizing cultures and politics, e.g. ''Diguo zhuyi yu Taiwan duli yundong'' (帝國主義與臺灣獨立運動). Later in his career, he started publishing critical book reviews. Recently, Wang has published a series of books about "Language". ''Magical Eyes,'' his latest book, (魔幻之眼) is his first published work in the book commentary collection. As a tutor through writing, his analysis focuses on culture, history, thoughts, politics, etc.

== Contributions to journalism ==
Wang has never been shy expressing his critical opinions on current affairs. In the summer of 2004, he attended a forum in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center concerning the political issues in Taiwan and the relation across the [[Taiwan Strait]] after the Presidential election. He suggested that the two shores of the Strait should make positive interactions in order to solve the rational problems.

As a journalist and the chief writer of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050319061906/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/041010/12/15irn.html ''The Journalist magazine''], he has his own independent analysis towards the political issues. Not long after President Chen Shuibien gave the speech of "One State on Each Side", he wrote critics on it, which was exactly to the point, "democracy in Taiwan is already moving towards a new and populist type of soft politics of terror".

== Views on journalism ==
In a public discussion titled "How to build a mass media culture with "taste"? Wang criticized the current mass media culture. He pointed out that if the speakers/interviewees could not state their stance clearly, they had to "pay the price" in the sense that reporters might make twist their words to make a story more dramatic. The unethical reporting of some journalists disappointed Wang, and he urged that journalists had to realize that it was shameful to have disregarded the obligation to report the truth.

At societal level, he emphasized that not only does the mass media deliver information to the public, but it also affects the social structure and the political environment. He noted that journalists should bear in mind that they have great responsibilities to the general public.

Particularly in Taiwan, he put the blame of the current situation on changes in political conditions. During this unstable period, different types of mass media emerged. As advertising plays a greater role in the mass media, it is inevitable that politicians would make use of the mass media for propaganda. However, he said that there are still journalists who stand by their principles, although it remains difficult for them to uphold the journalistic ethics.

== Seeing literature as journalism ==
In an RTHK TV program "Merry Book Worm" in October 2003, (愈讀愈快樂 (www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/bookworm/20031026.html inactive as of 2008-05-07), 5 Oct 04.) Wang shared his opinions on how to choose suitable books for ourselves. He raised questions on how topics of certain discourses are set, why the topics are written the way they are, and how the written formats differ from author to author, and suggested that these are the aspects we have to think about when we choose books to read. Also, Wang stressed that it is necessary for every author to get the basic and wide-ranging knowledge on different areas before having any discussion or analysis. With his literature commentaries in ''Magical Eyes'' (魔幻之眼), Nanfang Shuo attempts to give his readers a brief overview on his recommended books to help them choose readings.

Wang’s views on literature ties in well in the principles in journalism. While literature commenting allows his audience to have a knowledge of what is currently happening in the world, reporters are also doing the same thing: making readers be aware of current affairs. Speaking about journalism, he said that we, as readers, have to be careful about different reporters’ stances and their different perspectives based on various sources. On the other hand, reporters should always bear the obligation to the truth and be objective by relying on the more reliable sources.

In another interview from Central News Agency (news.pchome.com.tw/life/can/20030408/index-20030408165736010244.html inactive as of 2008-05-07) in Taiwan, Wang pointed out that readers are not encouraged to spend too much time on books which are too difficult to be digested or too easy to read. In the interview, Wang encouraged readers to find the books which would motivate them and those which can give them new perspectives.
Applying Wang's views on reading, journalism, and news reports, readers should focus their attention on news of particular interest to them, ones which they feel comfortable to read and criticize. Moreover, Wang believes that readers are responsible for the verification of reports.

==Views on reading==
As a commentator of literature, Wang welcomes all different genres of books. He firmly believes that all books can be beneficial and that the more one reads, the more one will gain in that field of expertise. He recalled that in his childhood, he was unable to do anything but read.

One belief of Wang is that wisdom in different aspects are all inter-related. For him, the concepts of literature, history, and social theory can be easily understood. He believes that literature, poetry, politics, and philosophy are mutually related. Having this understanding, Wang likes to use poems to interpret international politics and the economic phenomenon in recent years. This proves that as a commentator of current affairs and as chief writer of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050319061906/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/041010/12/15irn.html ''The Journalist''], he uses literary style to write journalistic articles.

A few years ago, Wang discovered an interest in linguistics. Some of the inspirations of Wang stems from the Chinese classic literature, novels, and prose, while some of them comes from news reports. Researching the origin and history of the common vocabularies, he also investigated the changing process of these vocabularies in society. To him, this changing process can be seen from the use of language in news reports, for the language the reporters used marks the changes in social value.
In fact, his motivation and his way to learn about the origins of vocabulary is very applicable to the elements of journalism: both fields require accurate information, and verification by different reliable sources. We can only tell the truth (of events or the origin of vocabularies) after verifications.

Wang is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], and he believes that it is important to be aware of the language ambiguity in understanding readings. As there are some writers who easily confuse readers, with or without intention, great language skills and a critical mind are essential to make yourself clear about what you are reading and what the writers are telling.

== Comments on literature ==
Wang was one of the committee members to adjudicate the "20th century 100 greatest Chinese novels". As the novels revealed to Wang a feeling of sorrow and a sense of pressure, he commented the 20th century Chinese novels as a reflection of Chinese history in the past 100 years which he saw a difficult and suffering period for the intellectuals.

'''Wilmot Redd''' (a.k.a. '''Wilmot Read''' and '''Wilmot Reed''') (early 17th century - September 22, 1692) was one of the victims of the [[Salem witch trials]] of 1692. She was born in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], and executed by [[hanging]] on September 22, 1692. Her husband was Samuel Redd, a fisherman. She was known for her irritability, but she was given little serious attention and, to her neighbors, was "probably more bitch than witch."&lt;ref name="GamageLord52"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gamage | first=Virginia Clegg |author2=Priscilla Sawyer Lord  | title=The Spirit of '76 Lives Here: Marblehead | year=1972 | publisher=Chilton Book Company | location=Radnor, Pennsylvania | isbn=978-0-8019-5596-9 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redd was apprehended on May 28, 1692, by local constable James Smith. The warrant was signed by Magistrates [[Jonathan Corwin]] and [[John Hathorne]]. The charge brought against her was one of having "committed sundry acts of [[witchcraft]] on bodys of [[Mary Walcott]] &amp; [[Mercy Lewis]] and others in Salem Village to their great hurt."&lt;ref name="GamageLord52"/&gt;

A preliminary examination took place on May 31, 1692, at Nathan Ingersoll's house in [[Salem Village]]. This was Redd's first meeting with the children she allegedly bewitched. They promptly fell into fits, and when asked what she thought ailed them, Redd said, "I cannot tell."&lt;ref name="GamageLord53"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gamage | first=Virginia Clegg |author2=Priscilla Sawyer Lord  | title=The Spirit of '76 Lives Here: Marblehead | year=1972 | publisher=Chilton Book Company | location=Radnor, Pennsylvania | isbn=978-0-8019-5596-9 | page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urged to give an opinion, she stated, "My opinion is they are in a sad condition."&lt;ref name="GamageLord53"/&gt;

Indicted as a witch, Redd was accused of "detestable arts called Witchcraft and Sorceries wickedly, mallitiously [sic] and felloniously used, practiced &amp; exercised at the Towne of Salem."&lt;ref name="GamageLord53"/&gt;

Redd's body was buried in a common grave whose location is now unknown.  Memorial markers for her exist at Old Burial Hill in Marblehead and the Salem Witch Trials Memorial in Salem.
