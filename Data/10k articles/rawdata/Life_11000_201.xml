      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21473">The '''Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, labor confrontation of 1899''' was the second of two major labor-management confrontations in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of northern Idaho in the 1890s. Like the first incident, the [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892]], the 1899 confrontation was an attempt by union miners, led by the [[Western Federation of Miners]] to unionize non-union mines, and have them pay the higher union wage scale. As with the 1892 strike, the 1899 incident culminated in a dynamite attack that destroyed a non-union mining facility, followed by military occupation of the district. 

The confrontation of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages, hired Pinkerton or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] operatives to infiltrate the union; and routinely fired any miner who held a union card.

==Background==
===Miners strike of 1892===
Angered by wage cuts, Coeur d'Alene area miners conducted a strike in 1892. The strike erupted in violence when union miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners. After several deaths, the U.S. army occupied the area and forced an end to the strike. The response to that violence, disastrous for the local miners' union, became the primary motivation for the formation of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) the following year.

===The second military occupation, 1894===
Pro-union sentiment remained strong in the area, and by 1894, most of the mines were unionized, represented by the [[Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor|Knights of Labor]].

Violence erupted in the Coeur d'Alene district during the national [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] railroad [[Pullman strike|strike]] of 1894. Union members attacked non-union mines and workers. Forty masked men shot to death John Kneebone, who had testified against union miners in 1892. Others kidnapped a mine superintendent, and tried to blow up the powder house at the Bunker Hill mine.

Urged by the mine owners, the Idaho governor requested federal troops, supposedly to prevent interruptions in railroad service along the [[Northern Pacific Railroad|Northern Pacific]] route through the Coeur d'Alene area. US President Cleveland sent about 700 troops in July 1894. Major General John Schofield, determined to avoid embroiling his troops in a local labor dispute as they were in 1892, directed that the Army confine its mission to keeping the railroads running, and not take orders from state or local officials. The Army patrolled the railroad lines, and reported no disturbances or local opposition. The union members, wanting to avoid another military occupation, stopped the attacks on non-union targets.

The Army repeatedly reported that there were no disturbances of rail transport, and requested permission to withdraw the troops. The mine owners pressured the Cleveland administration to keep the troops in place. The mine owners eventually realized that the Army would not expand its mission beyond protecting the railroad, and dropped their opposition to withdrawal of the troops. The Army units left the Coeur d'Alene in September 1894.&lt;ref name="Domestic Disorders"&gt;Clayton D. Laurie and Ronald H. Cole, ''The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders 1877-1945''(Washington: US Army Center of Military History, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.163-165&lt;/sup&gt;

In December 1894, the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mine shut down rather than agree to the union demand of a uniform wage of $3.50 per day. The mine reopened in June 1895, with nonunion labor paying $3.00 per day to miners and $2.50 to surface employees and unskilled underground labor. The company said that whenever the combined prices of lead and silver rose again to a certain point, they would restore the old wage rate. &lt;ref&gt;Frederick Leslie Ransome, and Frank Cathcart Calkins, 1908, The Geology and Ore Deposits of the Coeur D’Alene District, Idaho, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 62, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leading up to the 1899 clash===
The [[Bunker Hill Mining Company]] at [[Wardner, Idaho]], was profitable, having paid more than $600,000 in dividends.&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 111"&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Miners working in the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines were receiving fifty cents to a dollar less per day than other miners,&lt;ref&gt;Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; which at that time represented a significant percentage of the paycheck. The properties were the only mines in the district that were not unionized, and the Bunker Hill company had employed [[Labor spies|Pinkerton labor spies]] to identify union members.

In April 1899, as the union was launching an organizing drive of the few locations not yet unionized, superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather "shut down and remain closed twenty years" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers that he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 111"/&gt;

== Dynamite Express ==
The strike by the union local at Wardner was not succeeding, and the nearby WFM locals, at Gem, Burke, and Mullan, feared that the other mine owners would cut wages to match those paid at the Bunker Hill mine. The other WFM locals agreed to support the strike at Wardner. The officers of the WFM locals met and planned a massive show of force for April 29. 

On April 29, 250 union members seized a train in [[Burke, Idaho|Burke]]. The engineer, Levi "Al" Hutton, later claimed at gun point.&lt;ref&gt;schwantes, carlos (1996). ""The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive history"". University of Nebraska Press. p.320&lt;/ref&gt; At each stop through [[Burke-Canyon]], more miners climbed aboard. In Mace, a hundred men climbed aboard. At Frisco, the train stopped to load eighty wooden boxes, each containing fifty pounds of dynamite. At Gem, 150 to 200 more miners climbed onto three freight cars which had been added to the train. In Wallace, 200 miners were waiting, having walked seven miles from [[Mullan, Idaho|Mullan]]. About a thousand men&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; rode the train to [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]], the site of a $250,000 mill of the Bunker Hill mine. Witnesses later testified that the majority of those on the train knew nothing of any planned violence when they started out; they thought that it would be just a massive demonstration to intimidate the mine owners into recognizing the union. However, the union had distributed masks and firearms to between 100 and 200 of the men, who acted as if under military discipline.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, 1900, Report of the Industrial Commission on the Relations and Conditions of Labor and Capital employed in the Mining Industry, v.12 p.LXXXVIII-LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-union ''Idaho State Tribune'' in Wallace wrote: 
:"At no time did the demonstration assume the appearance of a disorganized mob. All the details were managed with the discipline and precision of a perfectly trained military organization."&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Major-General Commanding the Army, Part 1, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

County sheriff James D. Young, who had been elected with union support, had ridden to Wardner on the train with the union miners. At Wardner, Young climbed atop a rail car, and ordered the group to disperse. His order was ignored, and he later said that any further attempt to restrain the miners would have been suicidal. 

Word had reached Wardner by telephone that the union miners were on their way, and most of the mine and mill workers had fled. The crowd ordered the remaining workers out of the Bunker Hill mine and mill. Once out, they were ordered to run, and some shots fired at them as they ran. James Cheyne was shot in the hip, then union miners shot more bullets into him as he lay on the ground; he died shortly after. One union man, John Smith, also called Schmidt, was mistakenly shot to death by other union men.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, 1900, Report of the Industrial Commission on the Relations and Conditions of Labor and Capital employed in the Mining Industry, v.12 p.LXXXVIII-LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

After carrying three thousand pounds of dynamite into the mill. The blast completely destroyed the mill.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck&amp;mdash;The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd also burned down the company office, the boarding house, and the home of the mine manager. The miners re-boarded the "Dynamite Express" and returned the way they came.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Working men gathered along the track, and according to the pro-union ''Idaho State Tribune,'' "cheered the [union] men lustily as they passed."."&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 111"/&gt;

== Arrests ==
[[File:Bull Pen Wardner ID 1899.png|thumb|The temporary wooden prison built in Wardner, Idaho, popularly called "the bullpen."]]
[[File:Prisoners in Bullpen Wardner ID 1899.png|thumb|Prisoners drill with wooden rifles in the "bullpen," Wardner, Idaho, 1899.]]
At the Idaho governor's request, President [[William McKinley]] sent in the Army. The majority of army troops sent to the Coeur d'Alene were African American soldiers of the 24th Infantry Regiment, stationed in Spokane, Salt Lake City, and other western posts. The 24th had distinguished itself in combat during the Spanish–American War, and was seen as one of the most disciplined Army units not then serving overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; But the miners were indignant about having to take orders from soldiers, and particularly offended at being ordered around by African Americans. WFM Secretary-Treasurer Bill Haywood later played on the resentment when he wrote that while white miners were held in the bullpen: "the black soldiers were at home insulting, outraging, ravishing their wives, mothers, sisters and sweethearts"&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lucas, ''Big Trouble'', p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

State authorities used the troops to round up 1,000 men and put them into "the bullpen." The arrests were indiscriminate; Governor Steunenberg's representative, state auditor Bartlett Sinclair believed that all the people of [[Burke-Canyon|Canyon Creek]] had a "criminal history," and "the entire community, or the male portion of it, ought to be arrested." The soldiers searched every house, breaking down the door if no one answered.&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 141"&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, ''Big Trouble'', 1997, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass arrests began on May 4, 1899, when 128 were arrested. More than 200 were arrested the following day, and the arrests continued until about a thousand men had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Major-General Commanding the Army, Part 1, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.31&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As Sinclair had ordered, they arrested every male: miners, bartenders, a doctor, a preacher, even the postmaster and school superintendent. … Cooks and waiters [were] arrested in kitchens, diners at their supper tables. … For desperate criminals, the men of Burke went quietly, the only gunshot was aimed at a "vicious watch dog."&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 141" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What was called "the bullpen" was actually a number of structures. The first 150 prisoners were kept in an old barn, a two-story frame structure 120 feet long by 40 feet wide and filled with hay. It was "still very cold in those altitudes" and the men, having been arrested with no opportunity to bring along blankets, "suffered some from the weather." As the barn became overcrowded, new prisoners were put in railroad boxcars. When both these became overcrowded, the prisoners were then forced to build a pine board prison for themselves, and it was surrounded by a six-foot barbed wire fence patrolled by armed soldiers. Conditions remained primitive, and three prisoners died.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Domestic Disorders"&gt;Clayton D. Laurie and Ronald H. Cole, ''The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders 1877-1945''(Washington: US Army Center of Military History, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.171&lt;/sup&gt;

The U.S. Army followed escaping miners into [[Montana]] and arrested them, returning them to Idaho, and failed to comply with jurisdictional or extradition laws. One man arrested and transported was a Montana citizen who had no connection to the Wardner events.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, page 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the three county commissioners had been caught in the roundup, as had the local sheriff. These, too, were held prisoner. Later, a district court removed all of the county commissioners and the sheriff from office, charging that they'd neglected their official duties.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, pages 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of those arrested were freed within two weeks. By May 12, 450 prisoners remained; by May 30, the number was  194. Releases slowed, and 65 remained incarcerated on October 10, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. Anthony|last=Lukas|title=Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle for the Soul of America|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1997|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.148-149&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Major-General Commanding the Army, Part 1, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.37,40,73&lt;/sup&gt; The last prisoners in the bullpen were not released until early December 1899.&lt;ref&gt;"Dynamiters discharged and bullpen deserted," ''Idaho Statesman'', Dec. 3, 1899, p.1 c.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Arrangements with replacement officials installed by Sinclair demonstrated "a pattern."

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The new regime's principal [sic] patronage—the fat contract for supplying food and drink to the bullpen's prisoners—had gone to Tony Tubbs, the former manager of Bunker Hill's boardinghouse, destroyed on April 29. Likewise, most of the thirty men Sinclair hired as special "state deputies" were either employees and former employees of the Bunker Hill Company or contractors for it. Among the most prominent was a saloonkeeper named W.C. "Convict" Murphy, who'd served time for horse stealing and cattle rustling. When Convict Murphy broke down people's doors, he was sometimes asked for a search warrant or other authority, at which he would draw a pair of six-shooters and say, "These are my warrants."&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, page 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Emma F. Langdon]], a union sympathizer, charged in a 1908 book that Idaho Governor [[Frank Steunenberg]], who had been "considered a poor man," deposited $35,000 into his bank account within a week after troops arrived in the Coeur d'Alene district, implying that there may have been a bribe from the mine operators.&lt;ref&gt;''Labor's Greatest Conflicts'', Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research appears to have uncovered the apparent source of this assertion. J. Anthony Lukas recorded in his book ''Big Trouble'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1899, when the state needed money for the Coeur d'Alene prosecutions, the [[Mine Owners' Association]] had come up with $32,000—about a third of it from Bunker Hill and Sullivan—handing $25,000 over to Governor Steunenberg for use at his discretion in the prosecution. Some of this money went to pay [attorneys].&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, page 351.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his autobiography, WFM Secretary-Treasurer [[Bill Haywood]] described Idaho miners held for "months of imprisonment in the 'bull-pen'—a structure unfit to house cattle—enclosed in a high barbed-wire fence."&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood'', William D. Haywood, 1929, page 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood concluded that the companies and their supporters in government—intent upon forcing wage cuts and employers' freedom to fire union miners—were conducting class warfare against the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Carlson wrote in his book ''Roughneck'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Haywood traveled to the town of [[Mullan, Idaho|Mullan]], where he met a man who had escaped from the 'bullpen'. The makeshift prison was an old grain warehouse that reeked of excrement and crawled with vermin.&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thirty-four-year-old Paul Corcoran, the father of three and "a highly respected member of the Burke community," was financial secretary of the Burke Miners Union. The state decided to make an example of him. No one could say he'd even been in the vicinity of the crime, but some had seen him riding on the roof of a boxcar of the Dynamite Express. The prosecution, whose salaries were paid by a $32,000 grant from the mine owners, argued that Corcoran should take the blame for planning the attack on the Bunker Hill mill. Corcoran was sentenced to seventeen years at hard labor. Eight more miners accused of leading the attack were scheduled for trial on charges of murder and/or arson, but bribed an army sergeant to allow them to escape. Hundreds more remained in the makeshift prison without charges.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, pages 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Sinclair developed a permit system which would prevent mines from hiring any miner who belonged to a union. The plan was designed to destroy the unions in the Coeur d'Alene district. General [[Henry C. Merriam]] of the U.S. Army endorsed the permit system verbally and in writing, resulting in considerable consternation at the McKinley White House.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, pages 146–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of one local newspaper, Wilbur H. Stewart of the ''Mullan Mirror'', dared to criticize the bullpen and its keepers. Sinclair appeared at his door alongside a major and several soldiers with unsheathed bayonets. Sinclair declared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I find that you have been publishing a seditious newspaper, inciting riot and insurrection, and we have concluded that publication of your paper must cease.&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 147"&gt;Lukas, page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stewart was taken to the bullpen, where he was assigned to garbage and [[latrine]] duty. However, the paper did not stop publication; Stewart's young wife, Maggie, continued to publish the weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Compare to [[Emma F. Langdon]] in Cripple Creek.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair impounded her type, and she contracted with another sympathetic publisher to continue the news. Eventually Stewart was released under instructions to end the criticism. He sold the newspaper instead.&lt;ref name="J. Anthony Lukas 1997, page 147" /&gt;

Many populist elected officials in Shoshone County were rounded up for their support of the miners. The town sheriff of [[Mullan, Idaho]] was arrested and sent to the bullpen.&lt;ref&gt;History of Selected Mines in the Pine Creek Area, Shoshone County, Idaho by Victoria E Mitchell, Idaho Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

[[May Arkwright]] Hutton, whose husband was the engineer on the dynamite express, wrote a book, ''The coeur d' alenes: or, A Tale of the Modern Inquisition in Idaho'', about the treatment of the miners, and her husband, at the hands of the mine owners and the sheriff.

Both Huttons and [[Ed Boyce]], head of the [[Western Federation of Miners]], had invested in the [[Hercules silver mine]] before the 1899 war. After they had become wealthy mine owners, May Hutton sought to buy back all copies of her book. Ed Boyce quit the miners union to manage a hotel in Portland.&lt;ref&gt;schwantes, carlos (1996).

[[File:Yarkand-tumbas-reyes-d09.jpg|thumb|right| Royal cemetery ''Altyn'' with tombs of Moghul Khans of Yarkand Khanate (1465-1759), including Abdul Karim Khan, his father [[Abdurashid Khan]] and grandfather [[Sultan Said Khan]] in [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Xinjiang]]-Uyghur Autonomous Region of [[People's Republic of China]], 2005]]
'''Abdul Karim Khan''' was the ruler of [[Yarkand Khanate]] in what is now north-west China ([[Xinjiang]]) between 1560 and 1591. He was second son of [[Abdurashid Khan]]. During his reign, he lost control over a number of oases and merely acted as the titular figurehead ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|title=Situating the Uyghurs Between China and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA22|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Karim Khan was a descendant of the first Moghul Khan [[Tughlugh Timur]] (1347-1363). He came to power in 1560. He became the Khan as the eldest son in the family after the death of his father Abdurashid Khan. 

Abdul Karim Khan distributed between his brothers all the troops and gold that he inherited from his father and increased troop numbers following the failed attempt by the Barlas emirs to replace him with his brother Sufi Sultan, who ruled in [[Kashgar]]. He expelled the [[Hakim (title)|hakim]] of [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], Mahmud Barlas, and the emir of [[Khotan]], Ahmad Barlas, and dispersed their 3,000 troops. He sent his brother Abduraim Sultan to rule [[Karasahr|Chalish]] and [[Turpan]], where the position of "Little Khan"  (contrary to the "Great Khan" who ruled from Yarkand) was vacant after the death of Shah Khan, son of Mansur Khan, in 1570 in a battle with the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmaks]]. 

Abdul Karim Khan's reign was generally tranquil thanks to the absence of wars and famine. Contemporary [[Balkh]] historian Mahmud ibn Vali wrote in 1644 in his work " Bahr al-asrar " that:'' Peace and  tranquillity and public security of the people of Uyghurstan was so widespread during the rule of Abdul Karim Khan that it caused envy among neighbouring countries. '' 

During Abdul Karim Khan's reign, Khoja Ishak Wali, 4th son of [[Nakshbandi]] sheikh [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Mahdum-i- Azam]] and founder of Sufi Order,'' Ishakiyya'', disciples of which were later known as ''Karataghliks'' or ''Black Mountaineers'', came to Yarkand at the Khan's invitation. He was unable to attract Abdul Karim Khan to his sect, but was allowed to carry out his missionary work among the population of the Yarkand Khanate during which time 40,000 became his disciples with 164 becoming teachers of his sect. Khoja Ishak Wali managed to attract to his sect a younger brother of Abdul Karim Khan, [[Muhammad Sultan]], who became Khan in 1591.  Khoja Ishak Wali died in 1599. 

Abdul Karim Khan died in 1591 and was succeeded by his brother [[Muhammad Sultan]].

'''''Aftermath''''' is a four-part 2010 documentary television series created by [[History Television]] Canadian station, airing in the United States on the [[National Geographic Channel]], and produced by [[Cream Productions]].

''Aftermath'' consists of a series of "[[thought experiment|experiments]]" looking at what would happen if [[planetary condition]]s changed drastically, within our lifetime. The series is a follow-up to the TV special ''[[Aftermath: Population Zero]]''.

In 2010, the series was nominated for a [[2010 Gemini Awards|2010 Gemini award]] for best documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geminiawards.ca/gemini25/press/Gemini%2025%20-%20List%20of%20Nominations.pdf Gemini Awards – 2010 Nominations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The World After Humans===
'''Population Zero'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/3225/Overview National Geographic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205134121/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/3225/Overview |date=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=114079 History.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719201916/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=114079 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Aftermath: Population Zero}}

The special that started it all documents what happens if all humans suddenly disappeared from the planet. The History Television title for this show is "The World After Humans" and the National Geographic Channel title for it is "Population Zero".

===World Without Oil===

Our world is seriously dependent on oil, but humans are using it up so quickly to the point that it may eventually run out one day, and the Earth will not have enough time to replenish it. It will happen within a timescale between twenty years to a century, but what if all the oil ran out today?

In the first few minutes, approximately {{convert|100000|Goilbbl|litre}} of under-ground oil vanishes. Alarms in [[oil platform|oil rig]]s sound as pipe pressure plummets. One day after oil, [[asphalt]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], petrol, and [[tar]] supplies become limited. This causes $US2 trillion of stock to become worthless. Oil-workers are [[dismissal (employment)|sacked]].

Consumers rush to [[petrol station]]s to fill their cars up for the last time. [[Oil tanker]]s are called back to their countries of origin to save national reserves of oil. Every mode of international transport is now grounded. However, steel, food, [[medical supplies]], and trash are not being moved.

Power-stations start running out of diesel. [[Power cut]]s start spreading across the world. Five days after oil, [[martial law]] is declared to stop [[rioting]] and [[looting]]. Unemployment rises to 30%. [[Livestock|Farm animal]]s die due to lack of food. Coal power stations face shortages of coal. Thirty days after oil, [[passenger train]]s are running on oil rations and the roads are empty of cars. Governments decide to start a program of [[biofuel]] planting.

Five months after oil, [[Chrysler]], [[General Motors]], and [[Ford]] are taken over by the [[United States Government|American government]]. [[Famine]] and [[Drug resistance|drug-resistant]] infections threatens death and [[human migration|migration]] as food shipments come every second day. [[Emergency vehicle]]s are still getting oil rations. This inspires [[citizenship|citizen]]s to work with chemicals to get [[biofuel]]. Governments start to wonder if they should plant crops for food or fuel. They later abandon biofuel planting altogether.

One year after oil, emergency vehicles start to be run either by [[lithium battery]] or biofuel. The price of [[lithium]] then shoots up. Populations of [[wildlife|wild animal]]s bounce quickly back. People resort to growing their own food, keeping livestock and hunting.

Ten years after oil, artificial [[satellite]]s burn up in the atmosphere as parts are not being replaced. [[Electronics|Electronic equipment]] is scavenged for [[precious metal]]s as people start [[recycling]] on a huge scale. [[Algae]] is used as a bio-fuel. Trucks deliver supplies to hospitals.

Forty years after oil, skies are much clearer and cleaner as pollutants are washed out. [[Aeroplane]]s, trains, and ships now run on biofuel. Lithium battery cars are expensive. People only grow and farm what they need. New towns grow along railway points. A world trade based on biofuel and lithium is now growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234860 History.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719202008/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234860 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4462/Overview National Geographic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414041229/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4462/Overview |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population Overload===

{{cquote|There are currently 7 billion people living on Earth, and this number is rapidly increasing. As the world population grows, the planet is literally pushed to its limits as more and more people reap the Earth of its resources, placing it under pressure. What if the global population doubled again instantly?}}

Overnight, the population of the earth doubles, from about 7 billion to nearly 14 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234861 History.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424003856/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234861 |date=April 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4463/Overview National Geographic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916191310/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4463/Overview |date=September 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of the world attempt to cope at first by ordering the construction of gigantic highrise apartment complexes. However, the often outdated public works systems cannot handle this vastly increased load, and bridges break and sewers fail, leading to contamination of the water supply. Much of the remaining woodlands of the earth are cleared to form new farms and housing. In the meantime, [[Rationing#Emergency rationing|emergency rationing]] becomes commonplace. Rationing of water and food becomes common, and countries who formerly exported grain stop the exports, leading to a drastic shortage. Even in wealthy countries, food and water resources are becoming strained as countries struggle to support the doubled population. Electrical power grids have difficulty keeping up with the increased demand. New coal plants are built to relieve the pressure, but they result in worldwide air pollution.

Water shortage becomes the primary problem, with not enough water available for drinking or farming. Looting becomes a problem, and martial law is declared in many places. Desalination plants are built to deal with the water shortage. People in countries that lack water and food begin leaving the country in search of resources, prompting an unprecedented human migration. Many people head to the [[Great Lakes]], forming massive [[Tent city|tent cities]].

Years later, a population crash occurs before the population stabilizes at 4 billion.

===When the Earth Stops Spinning===

This scenario is unique because it doesn't happen overnight, but rather over a given period of time: The Earth revolves at 1,000 miles an hour, but is gradually slowing down, yet this slowing is too slow to be noticed on human timescales. But what if it significantly slowed and eventually stopped? (The reason for this is because if the Earth stopped spinning instantly, everything on its surface, including buildings and trees, would blown away eastward across the planet by winds over thousands of miles per hour, which would essentially kill every living thing on the surface in the process)

The [[Earth's rotation|spin of the Earth]] starts slowing down dramatically. It is estimated Earth would stop spinning in as little as 5 years. The first effect is the isolation between the [[Global Positioning System]] [[satellite]]s and ground-based [[atomic clock]]s. Then [[stock market crash|stock markets crash]] because of uncertainty about humanity's future. As times goes on the oceanic bulge of water at the [[equator]] moves northward and southward. The water floods [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Northern Europe]]. The [[atmosphere]], once shaking [[Solar energy|solar heat]] out over the world and shifting air, stops and whirls to the [[Geographical pole|poles]]. The air starts to thin at the equator and people have to migrate to more northerly and southerly cities in order to keep up with denser air. There is a higher risk of [[solar radiation]] as the [[magnetosphere]] weakens because of the slowing [[inner core]]. As the Earth slows, the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the molten [[planetary core|core]] slows down at a different speeds, causing massive friction. This creates tremendous earthquakes where there have never been earthquakes before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234859 History.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331190029/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234859 |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4464/Overview National Geographic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414051924/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4464/Overview |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans and other animals start suffering from sleep [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] as their bodies cannot properly work in a day longer than 60 hours.

The new oceans at the poles starts inundating the [[Contiguous United States]] and [[Mediterranean Europe]] around this time. As the oceans have moved to the poles, the sea-bed dries out, revealing new land. Canada, Russia, Antarctica and most of [[Europe]] are underwater.

Eventually, the Earth stops spinning altogether. The scorching light of day lasts for six months, while the remaining six months of the year are ice-bound darkness of night. The planetary landscape now consists of one ocean approximately 10 miles deep in the north, one in the south and a girdle of land around the equator. Most of the new continent is uninhabitable due to thin air, but the former ocean floor has a sufficient air pressure for human life.

Survivors living in places such as [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Oklahoma]] are safe from flooding and have sufficient air pressure to sustain human habitability, but in the new stable climate of the still Earth it will either receive very little or will never rain in these places again— even worse, because the electricity supply is destroyed due to the flooding, the survivors are unable to desalinate the oceans for water for several years. Survivors living in [[Hawaii]], now part of the new equatorial megacontinent are better off than survivors living in Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma because the colony is about 1000 miles north from the edge of the Sun's path— survivors living there are able to get sufficient amounts of water from rain to last the year, and would be able to fish without having to break through the ice and put their lives at risk.

===[[Red Giant]]===
'''Swallowed by the Sun'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234858 History.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719202035/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=234858 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4465/Overview National Geographic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611004819/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath/4465/Overview |date=June 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life on Earth is dependent on the Sun's light and heat in order to survive, but our Sun won't live forever and eventually it will die one day. However, the Sun's death will not happen for billions of years. What if the Sun started aging rapidly at an accelerated rate?

The sun expands to its [[Red giant#The Sun as a red giant|red giant phase]]. If the sun aged billions of years overnight, the average global temperature would go up by 36&amp;nbsp;°F (20&amp;nbsp;°C). In [[Greenland]] and Antarctica, snow and ice would begin to melt. Sea levels around the world would rise by more than {{convert|200|ft|m}}, submerging coastal cities.  Regular temperatures this hot, around {{convert|130|°F}}, are hard for us to handle. If our body temperature increases by 6&amp;nbsp;°F to 7&amp;nbsp;°F (3-4&amp;nbsp;°C) for an extended period of time, we can suffer permanent injury or death.

At {{convert|212|°F}}, we can't survive. The heat, hot enough to boil water, would blind and [[suffocation|suffocate]] us. The [[magnetosphere]], an invisible field circling our planet that protects us from blasts of solar radiation, would begin to weaken. The only place humans could survive is underground, and to explore the Earth's surface, humans have to wear [[spacesuit]]s.

At {{convert|300|°F}}, water would begin to [[evaporation|evaporate]] much faster than it does today. The sun would literally boil water off our Earth. Animals that breathe, including hardy creatures like [[cockroach]]es, (which lack [[lung]]s), couldn't survive. The [[oxygen]] levels are so low that fires don't start and the clouds don't rain.

At {{convert|700|°F}}, all human life on Earth would be finished. We couldn't even survive underground or in spacesuits. Every last drop of water evaporates, turning the oceans into [[deserts]]. The air pressure resulting from the vaporized oceans would increase to 4000 psi, destroying any pressurized containers. Anything made of plastic or other synthetic material melts away. Concrete deteriorates as the water inside it evaporates explosively, resulting in collapsing buildings.

At {{convert|2,400|°F}}, what is left burns, because oxygen levels shoot back up. Stone structures such as [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Egyptian Pyramids]] melt down, erasing the last of what humans have made. The planet would start turning red as the iron in Earth's crust begins to [[rust]].

As the sun expands on its way to becoming a Red Giant, its massive outer edges would begin to slow the Earth's [[orbit]]. Our planet, now a fireball, burning up like a [[meteorite]], would be swallowed by the sun.

History Television title for this show is "Red Giant", the National Geographic Channel title for it is "Swallowed by the Sun".

[[File:Ahijahs and Jeroboam.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Gerard Hoet]], ''Ahijah's prophecy to [[Jeroboam]]'', 1728.]]

'''Ahijah the Shilonite''' ({{Hebrew Name 1|אחיה השילוני|Aḥiya &lt;ref&gt;According to [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/980-ahijah-the-prophet "Ahijah", ''Jewish Encyclopedia''], the name also appears in the expanded form אחיהו, Aḥiyahu.&lt;/ref&gt; ('brother of [[Jah|Yah]]'&lt;ref&gt;See Gesenius, who interprets the name as "friend of Jehovah," taking the literal expression 'brother' as metaphorical for friendship. [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H281&amp;t=KJV]&lt;/ref&gt;) Hashiloni)}},  was a [[Levite]] [[prophet]] of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] in the days of [[Solomon]], as mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[1 Kings]]. Ahijah foretold to [[Jeroboam]] that he would become king ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:29|HE}}).&lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/980-ahijah-the-prophet "Ahijah", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] records two of his prophecies. In {{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31-39|HE}}, he announced the separation of the Northern ten tribes from Solomon's [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united kingdom]], forming the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom]]. In {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:6-16|HE}}, Ahijah's prophecy, delivered to [[Jeroboam's wife]], foretold the death of the king's son, the destruction of Jeroboam's dynasty, and the fall and [[Babylonian captivity|captivity]] of Israel "beyond the River", a stock expression for the land east of the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/dictionaries/hbd/b/beyond-the-river.html ''Holman Bible Dictionary,'' "Beyond the River"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[2 Chronicles]], Ahijah also authored a book, described as the ''Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite'', which contained information about Solomon's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|9:29|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text, however, has not survived and is one of the [[Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible|lost texts]] mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In {{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:41|NKJV}} it is referred to as the "[[Acts of Solomon|Book of the Acts of Solomon]]".

[[Rabbinic]] [[tradition]] credits Ahijah with having lived a very long life, linking his life-span with that of [[antediluvian]] [[patriarch]]s such as [[Methuselah]] and [[Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, [[Baba Batra]] 121b&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1749">'''Ajiboyede''' was a successful but autocratic [[king]] of [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]]. He succeeded [[Orompoto]].

==Ajanlapa and peaceful reign==
According to Oyo tales, the empire was attacked by King of [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]], Lajomo during Ajiboyede's time in office. Originally, the battle was going in favor of the invaders until a bit of trickery and [[hero]]ism by Ajanlapa, the Osi-wefa changed the course and gave favor to the Oyos. To commemorate Ajanlapa's valor in war, the King created a special honor in the [[palace]] for Ajanlapa's son. The son was given a full-time and rare permission to be a guest in the palace of the Alaafin and to take the stead in place of the king at some occasions. Unfortunately, this honor required that he had to become a eunuch, as this was the tradition for high court offices. Ajiboyede thought it would be ungrateful to have Ajanlapa's son castrated, but his advisers strongly recommended having him gelded. The King agreed and the boy was castrated. 

A [[festival]] known as Bebe was started to celebrate peace on the victory of Oyo over the Nupes. During the peaceful period, [[commerce]] and agriculture thrived, and the new capital of Igboho began to grow as a result of a favorable geographical location and population concentration. In the process, two major markets were established during his reign, and the city became a major trade route for acquiring horses from [[Hausaland]].

'''Alan, Abbot of Tewkesbury''' (date of birth unknown) is said by [[Gervase of Canterbury]] (contemporary chronicler) to be of English (i.e. non-[[Normans|Norman]]) descent. He probably spent some time at [[Benevento]] (Italy). Became a monk at [[Canterbury]], rising to [[prior]] in 1179. In the struggle between [[Thomas of Canterbury]] and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], he was a strong supporter of Thomas. As a result, he went to [[Tewkesbury Abbey|Tewkesbury]] as abbot where he was out of Henry's way.

His works are written about in ''Life of St. Thomas'' printed (as ''Life of Becket'') in the second volume of ''Materials for the History of Thomas Becket'', edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] ([[Rolls Series]], London,; 1875–85; Part I, CXC, 1475–88). 

He also collected and arranged a number of Thomas' epistles.

'''Artaxerxes III Ochus of Persia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|t|ə|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|s|iː|z}}; {{lang-peo|𐎠𐎼𐎫𐎧𐏁𐏂}} ''Artaxšaçā'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghias Abadi|first=R. M.|title=Achaemenid Inscriptions (کتیبه‌های هخامنشی)&amp;lrm;|edition=2nd|publisher=Shiraz Navid Publications|year=2004|location=Tehran|isbn=964-358-015-6|pages=144|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{nowrap|c. 425 BC –}} 338 BC) was the [[List of monarchs of Persia|eleventh emperor]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as well as the first [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt|31st dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. He was the son and successor of [[Artaxerxes II]] and was succeeded by his son, [[Arses of Persia]] (also known as Artaxerxes IV). His reign coincided with the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] and [[Nectanebo II]] in Egypt.

In his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] identified Artaxerxes III as [[Ahasuerus]] in the [[book of Esther]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ester+1%3A1&amp;version=KJV| Esther 1:1]/[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ester+10%3A1&amp;version=KJV| 10:1]).&lt;ref&gt;https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ascending the throne Artaxerxes was a [[satrap]] and commander of his father's army. Artaxerxes came to power after one of his brothers was executed, another committed suicide, the last murdered and his father, [[Artaxerxes II]] died. Soon after becoming king, Artaxerxes murdered all of the royal family to secure his place as king. He started two major campaigns against Egypt. The first campaign failed, and was followed up by rebellions throughout the western part of his empire. In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes defeated [[Nectanebo II]], the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt, driving him from [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]], stopping a revolt in Phoenicia on the way.

In Artaxerxes' later years, [[Philip II of Macedon]]'s power was increasing in Greece, where he tried to convince the Greeks to revolt against the Achaemenid Empire. His activities were opposed by Artaxerxes, and with his support, the city of [[Perinthus]] resisted a Macedonian siege.

There is evidence for a renewed building policy at [[Persepolis]] in his later life, where Artaxerxes erected a new palace and built his own tomb, and began long-term projects such as the Unfinished Gate.

==Name==
Artaxerxes III ({{lang-peo|𐎠𐎼𐎫𐎧𐏁𐏂}}, ''Artaxšaçrā'', "he whose empire is well-fitted" or "perfected", or Arta:"honoured" + Xerxes: "a king" ("the honoured king"), according to [[Herodotus]] "the great warrior"&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;{{cite web |url=

He is generally referred to as Ochus, but in modern [[Iran]] he is known as Ardeshir III ({{lang-fa|اردشیر سوم}}). In [[Babylon]]ian inscriptions he is called "Umasu, who is called Artakshatsu". The same form of the name (probably pronounced Uvasu) occurs in the Syrian version of the [[Canon of Kings]] by Elias of [[Nusaybin]].&lt;ref name="Name"/&gt;

==Early life and accession==

In 355 BC, Artaxerxes forced [[Athens]] to conclude a peace which required the city's forces to leave [[Anatolia]] and to acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm |title=Artaxerxes 3 |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |last=Kjeilen |first=Tore| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225213722/http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm| archivedate= February 25, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes started a campaign against the rebellious [[Cadusii]], but he managed to appease both of the Cadusian kings. One individual who successfully emerged from this campaign was Darius Codomannus, who later occupied the Persian throne as [[Darius III]].

Artaxerxes then ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of Asia Minor, as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt.&lt;ref name="PersianArmy"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Persian Army 560–330 BC: 560–330 BC |last=Sekunda |first=Nick |author2=Nicholas V. Sekunda|author3=Simon Chew|year=1992 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=1-85532-250-1 |pages=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was however ignored by Artabazus of [[Lydia]], who asked for the help of Athens in a rebellion against the king. Athens sent assistance to [[Sardis]]. [[Orontid Dynasty#Orontids Kings and satraps of Armenia|Orontes of Mysia]] also supported Artabazus and the combined forces managed to defeat the forces sent by Artaxerxes in 354&amp;nbsp;BC. However, in 353&amp;nbsp;BC, they were defeated by Artaxerxes’ army and were disbanded. Orontes was pardoned by the king, while Artabazus fled to the safety of the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]].

==First Egyptian Campaign==
In around 351 BC, Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt, which had revolted under his father, Artaxerxes II. At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor, which, being supported by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], threatened to become serious.&lt;ref name="Ochus2"&gt;[http://persianempire.info/ArtaxerxesIII.htm Artaxerxes III PersianEmpire.info History of the Persian Empire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Levying a vast army, Artaxerxes marched into Egypt, and engaged [[Nectanebo II]]. After a year of fighting the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Ancient Israel and Judah |last=Miller |first=James M. |others=John Haralson Hayes (photographer) |year=1986 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=0-664-21262-X |pages=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt.

==Rebellion of Cyprus and Sidon==
[[File:Artaxerxes III Soldiers of the Empire.jpg|thumb|350px|Soldiers of various ethnicities of the Achaemenid Empire, tomb of Atarxerxes III.]]
Soon after this defeat, Phoenicia, Anatolia and [[Cyprus]] declared their independence from Persian rule. In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the Cyprian rebels to [[Idrieus]], prince of [[Caria]], who employed 8000 Greek mercenaries and forty [[trireme]]s, commanded by [[Phocion]] the Athenian, and Evagoras, son of the elder [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]], the Cypriot monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus &amp; Branchidæ |last=Newton |first=Sir Charles Thomas |author2=R.P.

Artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive against [[Sidon]] by commanding the satrap of Syria and Mezseus, and the [[Cilicia (satrapy)|satrap of Cilicia]] to invade the city and to keep the [[Phoenicia]]ns in check. Both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of Tennes, the Sidonese king, who was aided by 40,000 Greek mercenaries sent to him by [[Nectanebo II]] and commanded by [[Mentor of Rhodes]]. As a result, the Persian forces were driven out of [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt;

After this, Artaxerxes personally led an army of 330,000 men against [[Sidon]]. Artaxerxes' army comprised 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 [[cavalry]], 300 triremes, and 500 transports or provision ships. After gathering this army, he sought assistance from the Greeks. Though refused aid by [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]], he succeeded in obtaining a thousand Theban heavy-armed hoplites under Lacrates, three thousand Argives under Nicostratus, and six thousand Æolians, [[Ionians]], and Dorians from the Greek cities of Anatolia. This Greek support was numerically small, amounting to no more than 10,000 men, but it formed, together with the Greek mercenaries from Egypt who went over to him afterwards, the force on which he placed his chief reliance, and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due.

The approach of Artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of Tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king, and then admitting Artaxerxes within the defences of the town. Artaxerxes had the 100 citizens transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy, Artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate. Sidon was then burnt to the ground, either by Artaxerxes or by the Sidonian citizens. Forty thousand people died in the conflagration.&lt;ref name=Persianempire/&gt; Artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomrawlinson.com/Personal/Links/RawlinsonGeorge.htm |title=Phœnicia under the Persians |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |last=Rawlinson |first=George |authorlink=George Rawlinson |year=1889 |work=History of Phoenicia |publisher=Longmans, Green |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720031359/http://www.tomrawlinson.com/Personal/Links/RawlinsonGeorge.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennes was later put to death by Artaxerxes.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Artaxerxes |volume=2 |pages=661–663 |first=Eduard |last=Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes later sent Jews who supported the revolt to [[Hyrcania]], on the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm |title=The Legend Of Gog And Magog |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315084037/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm |archivedate=March 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary |last=Bruce |first=Frederick Fyvie |year=1990 |publisher=Wm.

==Second Egyptian Campaign==
{{see also|Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt}}
[[File:NectaneboII-StatueHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|Head of [[Nectanebo II]]]]

The reduction of Sidon was followed closely by the invasion of Egypt. In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes, in addition to his 330,000 Persians, had now a force of 14,000 Greeks furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor: 4,000 under [[Mentor of Rhodes|Mentor]], consisting of the troops which he had brought to the aid of Tennes from Egypt; 3,000 sent by Argos; and 1000 from Thebes. He divided these troops into three bodies, and placed at the head of each a Persian and a Greek. The Greek commanders were Lacrates of Thebes, [[Mentor of Rhodes]] and Nicostratus of Argos while the Persians were led by Rhossaces, Aristazanes, and [[Bagoas]], the chief of the eunuchs. [[Nectanebo II]] resisted with an army of 100,000 of whom 20,000 were Greek mercenaries. Nectanebo II occupied the [[Nile]] and its various branches with his large navy. The character of the country, intersected by numerous canals, and full of strongly fortified towns, was in his favour and Nectanebo II might have been expected to offer a prolonged, if not even a successful, resistance.  But he lacked good generals, and over-confident in his own powers of command, he was able to be out-manoeuvred by the Greek mercenary generals and his forces eventually defeated by the combined Persian armies.&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt;

After his defeat, Nectanebo hastily fled to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons. These garrisons consisted of partly [[Greeks|Greek]] and partly Egyptian troops; between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders. As a result, the Persians were able to rapidly reduce numerous towns across Lower Egypt and were advancing upon Memphis when Nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt; The Persian army completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile. Following Nectanebo fleeing to Ethiopia, all of Egypt submitted to Artaxerxes. The Jews in Egypt were sent either to [[Babylon]] or to the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]], the same location that the Jews of [[Phoenicia]] had earlier been sent.

After this victory over the Egyptians, Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. [[Persia]] gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] enough that it could never revolt against Persia. For the 10&amp;nbsp;years that Persia controlled Egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen.&lt;ref name="Egyptloot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |title=Persian Period II |accessdate=March 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217023749/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |archivedate=February 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he returned to Persia, he appointed Pherendares as [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|satrap of Egypt]]. With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt, Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries.  He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of Egypt.

==Later years==
After his success in Egypt, Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years after his conquest of Egypt, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] was firmly under his control. Egypt remained a part of the Persian Empire until [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt.

After the conquest of Egypt, there were no more revolts or rebellions against Artaxerxes. Mentor and [[Bagoas]], the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign, were advanced to posts of the highest importance. Mentor, who was governor of the entire Asiatic seaboard, was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against Persian rule. In the course of a few years Mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole Asian Mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence.

Bagoas went back to the Persian capital with Artaxerxes, where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the Empire and maintained tranquility throughout the rest of the Empire. During the last six years of the reign of Artaxerxes III, the Persian Empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government.&lt;ref name="Persianempire" /&gt;

The Persian forces in [[Ionia]] and [[Lycia]] regained control of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and took over much of [[Athens]]’ former island empire. In response, [[Isocrates]] of Athens started giving speeches calling for a ‘crusade against the barbarians’ but there was not enough strength left in any of the Greek city-states to answer his call.&lt;ref name="conspiracy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |title=Chapter V: Temporary Relief |accessdate=March 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619124220/http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |archivedate=June 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there weren't any rebellions in the Persian Empire itself, the growing power and territory of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in [[Macedon]] (against which [[Demosthenes]] was in vain warning the Athenians) attracted the attention of Artaxerxes. In response, he ordered that Persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the Macedonian kingdom. In 340&amp;nbsp;BC, a Persian force was dispatched to assist the [[Thrace|Thracian prince]], [[Cersobleptes]], to maintain his independence. Sufficient effective aid was given to the city of [[Perinthus]] that the numerous and well-appointed army with which Philip had commenced his siege of the city was compelled to give up the attempt.&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt; By the last year of Artaxerxes' rule, Philip II already had plans in place for an invasion of the Persian Empire, which would crown his career,  but the Greeks would not unite with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/PhilipofMacedon.html |title= Philip of Macedon Philip II of Macedon Biography |accessdate=March 7, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314165325/http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/PhilipofMacedon.html| archivedate= March 14, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, kings of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] were followers of [[Zoroaster]] or heavily influenced by Zoroastrian ideology. The reign of [[Artaxerxes II]] saw a revival of the cult of Anahita and Mithra, when in his building inscriptions he invoked [[Ahura Mazda]], Anahita and Mithra and even set up statues of his gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vohuman.org/Article/The%20Achaemenians,%20Zoroastrians%20in%20Transition.htm |title=The Achaemenians, Zoroastrians in Transition |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |author=J.

===In literature===
It is thought by some that the ''[[Book of Judith]]'' could have been originally based on Artaxerxes' campaign in [[Phoenicia]], as [[Holofernes]] was the name of the brother of the [[Cappadocia (satrapy)|Cappadocian satrap]] Ariarathes, the vassal of Artaxerxes.

===Construction===
[[File:Persepolis Taureaux.jpg|thumb|right|The Unfinished Gate at [[Persepolis]] gave archaeologists an insight into the construction of Persepolis.]]
{{see also|Persepolis}}

There is evidence for a renewed building policy at Persepolis, but some of the buildings were unfinished at the time of his death. Two of his buildings at Persepolis were the Hall of Thirty-Two Columns, the purpose of which is unknown, and the palace of Artaxerxes III. The unfinished Army Road and Unfinished Gate, which connected the Gate of All Nations and the One-hundred Column Hall, gave archaeologists an insight into the construction of Persepolis.&lt;ref name="Ochus2"/&gt; In 341&amp;nbsp;BC, after Artaxerxes returned to [[Babylon]] from Egypt, he apparently proceeded to build a great Apadana whose description is present in the works of [[Diodorus Siculus]].

The [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] palace in Babylon was expanded during the reign of Artaxerxes III.&lt;ref name=Babylonpalace&gt;{{cite book |title=The Illustrated Dictionary &amp; Concordance of the Bible |last=Wigoder |first=Geoffrey |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company |isbn=1-4027-2820-4 |pages=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artaxerxes' tomb was cut into the mountain behind the Persepolis platform, next to his [[Artaxerxes II|father's]] tomb.

==Family==
{{further|Achaemenid family tree}}
Artaxerxes III was the son of [[Artaxerxes II]] and Statira. Artaxerxes II had more than 115 sons by many wives, most of them however were illegitimate. Some of Ochus' more significant siblings were Rodogune, Apama, Sisygambis, Ocha, Darius and Ariaspes, most of whom were murdered soon after his ascension.&lt;ref name="conspiracy"/&gt; Artaxerxes married his niece and the daughter of Oxathres, brother of the future king [[Darius III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women in Ancient Persia, 559–331 BC |last=Brosius |first=Maria |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-815255-8 |pages=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His children were [[Arses of Persia|Arses]], the future king of Persia, Bisthanes and [[Parysatis II]], wife of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=Ochus2/&gt;

'''Barton Michael Biggs''' (November 26, 1932 – July 14, 2012) was a [[money manager]] whose attention to [[emerging markets]] marked him as one of the world's first and foremost global investment strategists, a position he held—after inventing it in 1985—at [[Morgan Stanley]], where he worked as a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] for over 30 years. Following his retirement in 2003, he founded Traxis Partners, a multibillion-dollar [[hedge fund]], based in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He is best known for accurately predicting the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanton|first=Elizabeth|title=Traxis Partners Founder Barton Biggs Dies At Age 79|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-16/traxis-partners-founder-barton-biggs-dies-at-age-79.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Biggs was born on November 26, 1932, in [[New York City]], named for his maternal grandmother, whose last name was Barton. He grew up on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]] and in [[Washington, D.C.]] His paternal grandfather, [[Hermann Biggs|Hermann M. Biggs]], was the top public-health official in New York and instituted measures that contributed to the eradication of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; Biggs' father was the chief investment officer of [[Bank of New York]], working at the company from 1931 until his death in 1974. He also renegotiated defense contracts for the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and was executive committee chairman of the [[Brookings Institution]]. He attended the [[Lawrenceville School]] in New Jersey and graduated in 1951.

Biggs enrolled at [[Yale University]], his father's [[alma mater]]. He studied under poet and novelist [[Robert Penn Warren]] as an English major&lt;ref name=money&gt;[http://www.smartmoney.com/print/index.cfm?printcontent=/barrons/index.cfm?story=20060601]"Hedge Funds," article by Lawrence C. Strauss, SmartMoney.com Web site, June 1, 2006, accessed August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Elihu (secret society)|Elihu]] secret society. After graduating in 1955, Biggs served in the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Marines]] for three years, taught English at the [[Landon School]], a prep school in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], played semiprofessional [[soccer]], and tried his hand at creative writing.

At age 18, Biggs was given a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of 15 [[stock]]s worth about $150,000, but he showed little interest in finance and [[investing]] in his youth. He ended up choosing that career path after feeling left out from conversations between his father and younger brother, Jeremy, who worked at a [[pension fund]]. He took his father's advice and read ''[[Security Analysis (book)|Security Analysis]]'' by [[Benjamin Graham]] and [[David Dodd]], first published in 1934. He graduated from [[New York University Stern School of Business|NYU Stern School of Business]] with distinction.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Career==
Biggs joined [[E.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Hutton]] upon graduation in 1961, with a starting salary of $7,200 a year.&lt;ref name=jeff&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=71000001&amp;refer=culture&amp;sid=a698AM5oWfVc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095155/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=71000001&amp;refer=culture&amp;sid=a698AM5oWfVc |archivedate=2009-03-31 |df= }} "Morgan Stanley's Biggs Shares Pain of Top Hedge-Fund Players," a review of Biggs' book ''Hedgehogging'' by Jeffrey Burke at Bloomberg News Web site, January 6, 2006, accessed August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Biggs co-founded one of the industry's first hedge funds, Fairfield Partners. During his eight-year tenure there, the fund returned 133 percent; whereas the [[S&amp;P&amp;nbsp;500]] returned a mere 19 percent.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48195611{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biggs joined [[Morgan Stanley]] as a managing director and general partner in May&amp;nbsp;1973. As the firm's first research director, he established Morgan Stanley Investment Management in 1975.&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt; Biggs served on the bank's board until 1996 and retired from the company in 2003 at age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=barton-biggs&amp;pid=158590325|title=Barton Biggs|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have left Morgan Stanley partly because his job had evolved into managing people rather than formulating strategy.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5221329]"Barton Biggs Shines a Light on Hedge Funds" by Jim Zarroli, National Public Radio ''Morning Edition'', February 20, 2006, accessed August 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Morgan Stanley in 2003, Biggs founded hedge fund Traxis Partners, where he remained until his death.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; According to Madhav Dhar, Biggs' partner, he enjoyed the intellectual challenge of running a fund.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

==Financial predictions==

===Dot-com bubble===
He "sealed his fame" as an investor when he correctly identified the [[dot-com bubble]] at a time the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] was posting annual gains that had averaged 25 percent from 1995 to 1999. In a July&amp;nbsp;1999 interview in [[Bloomberg Television]], Biggs called the U.S.&amp;nbsp;stock market "the biggest [[Stock market bubble|bubble]] in the history of the world", a view that was dismissed by the industry until March 2000, when the [[Nasdaq Composite]] Index dropped 78 percent.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===2007-2012 global financial crisis===
Barton Biggs was blindsided by the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Barton Biggs's Traxis Fund LP tumbled 10 percent in the first half of the year, hurt by bets that U.S. shares would appreciate. As recently as May, Biggs, 75, said the U.S. economy will grow in the second half of 2008, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index may climb to a record and commodity prices will retreat as much as 30 percent.&lt;ref name=burton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aimTNk3q6IzE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321165747/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102 |archivedate=2010-03-21 |df= }} "Soros Successors Thiel, Howard Prove Global Bears Rule Markets," by Katherine Burton at Bloomberg News Web site, J August 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he correctly called the bottom in U.S.&amp;nbsp;stocks in March&amp;nbsp;2009, and that year Traxis's flagship fund returned three times the industry average.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===Other predictions===
He had predicted the [[bull market]] in U.S.&amp;nbsp;stocks that began in 1982. He also predicted the bearish market in [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese stocks in 1989]], when the [[Nikkei&amp;nbsp;225]] stock index was approaching its peak, from which it tumbled more than 77&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; On the other hand, he was incorrectly bullish on [[Mexico]] shortly before the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|peso crashed in 1994]].&lt;ref name=smart/&gt; In March&amp;nbsp;2003, Biggs predicted that U.S.stocks would rise up to 50 percent, and more for emerging markets; the former climbed as much as 88 percent, while the [[MSCI]] Emerging Markets Index rose more than fourfold.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Awards and accolades==
His influence could be seen when, in 1996, some traders were surprised that India funds suddenly became popular. "Barton Biggs is there, having a look around", one trader said. "Do you need to know more?"&lt;ref name=smart&gt;[http://www.smartmoney.com/pundits/index.cfm?story=biggs] Web page titled "Pundit Watch: Barton Biggs" at the Web site of ''Smart Money'' magazine, no date, accessed August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Biggs was named by ''Institutional Investor'' magazine to its "All-America Research Team" ten times, and was voted the top global strategist and first in global asset allocation from 1996 to 2000 by the magazine's "Investor Global Research Team" poll.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganstanley.com/cgi-bin/morganstanley.com/pressroom.cgi?action%3Dload%26uid%3D149 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509223439/http://www.morganstanley.com/cgi-bin/morganstanley.com/pressroom.cgi?action=load&amp;uid=149 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }} News release from Morgan Stanley, January 17, 2006, "Barton Biggs to Become a Consultant to Morgan Stanley after 30 Years with the Firm; Will Advise Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund as Founder of New Firm," accessed August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[SmartMoney]]'' magazine once called him "the ultimate big-picture man ... the premier prognosticator on the international scene and a mover of markets from Argentina to Hong Kong. It wouldn't be a stretch to say Biggs wrote the book on emerging-market investing".&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

Biggs has appeared numerous times on [[CNBC]] and was a member of the [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] Roundtable.

==Personal life==
Biggs and his wife, Judith Anne Lund had three children; the marriage ended in [[divorce]]. At the time of his death, Biggs lived in Connecticut. He died from complications arising from a [[bacterial infection]].&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Author==
Biggs was the author of ''Hedgehogging'',&lt;ref&gt;308 pages; Wiley; 2006; {{ISBN|0-471-77191-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came from a journal kept by the former creative writing major at Yale and chronicles some of the indignities of being in the hedge fund business as well as its "very brilliant and often eccentric and obsessive people".&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He wrote about quirks of hedge fund culture; he noted that [[golf]] was very popular, perhaps due to its "measurable" nature similar to investing. "Or", he wrote, "maybe it's because hedge-fund guys are so competitive and have such massive egos".&lt;ref name=money/&gt;

Biggs was also author of the 2008 book ''Wealth, War and Wisdom''.&lt;ref&gt;358 pages; Wiley; January 2008; {{ISBN|978-0-470-22307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a gloomy outlook for the economic future, and suggests that investors take [[survivalist]] measures, such as looking into "polar cities" as safe refuges for future survivors of [[global warming]]. Biggs recommended that his readers should "assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure". He went so far as to recommend planning adaptation strategies now and setting up [[Retreat (survivalism)|survival retreats]]: "Your safe haven must be self-sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food", Mr. Biggs wrote. "It should be well-stocked with seed, fertilizer, canned food, wine, medicine, clothes, etc. Think [[Swiss Family Robinson]]. Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/fashion/06survival.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alex | last=Williams | title=Duck and Cover: It's the New Survivalism | date=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Biggs published a [[novel]] about the stock market, ''A Hedge-Fund Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley (December 28, 2010), {{ISBN|978-0-470-60454-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a final book, "Diary of a Hedgehog" was published posthumously on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Diary-Hedgehog-Biggs-Final-Markets/dp/111829999X|title=Diary of a Hedgehog: Biggs' Final Words on the Markets: Barton Biggs: 9781118299999: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs''', often referred to as "'''the Brookings Report'''", was a 1960 report commissioned by [[NASA]] and created by the [[Brookings Institution]] in collaboration with NASA's Committee on Long-Range Studies.  It was submitted to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Committee on Science and Astronautics]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[87th United States Congress]] on April 18, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rr0.org/data/1/9/6/1/04/18/Brookings_ProposedStudiesOnTheImplicationsOfPeacefulSpaceActivitiesForHumanAffairs_NASA/index.html |title=Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs |publisher=RRO.org (Beau, Jérôme) |accessdate=2012-11-16}} See [[Rollover (web design)|rollover]] [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image scan on the RRO.org page.&lt;/ref&gt; It was entered into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' and can be found in any library possessing the ''Congressional Record'' for that year.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Significance==
The report has become noted for one short section entitled "The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life", which examines the potential implications of such a discovery on public attitudes and values.  The section briefly considers possible public reactions to some possible scenarios for the discovery of extraterrestrial life, stressing a need for further research in this area. It recommends continuing studies to determine the likely social impact of such a discovery and its effects on public attitudes, including study of the question of how leadership should handle information about such a discovery and under what circumstances leaders might or might not find it advisable to withhold such information from the public. The significance of this section of the report is a matter of controversy. Persons who believe that extraterrestrial life has already been confirmed and that this information is being withheld by government from the public sometimes turn to this section of the report as support for their view. Frequently cited passages from this section of the report are drawn both from its main body&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001595826 |title=Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |location=Washington, D.C. |display-authors=2 |author1=Michael, Donald N. |author2=Baranson, Jack |author3=Bauer, Raymond A. |author4=Meier, Richard L. |author5=Nadel, Aaron B. |author6=Shepard, Herbert A. |author7=Striner, Herbert E. |author8=Wright, Christopher |date=December 1960 |id=NASA Document ID: 19640053196; NASA Report/Patent Number: NASA-CR-55643 |accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from its footnotes.&lt;ref name="Footnotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19640053194 |title=Footnotes for Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs |publisher=Brookings Institution |location=Washington, D.C. |display-authors=2 |author1=Michael, Donald N. |author2=Baranson, Jack |author3=Bauer, Raymond A. |author4=Meier, Richard L. |author5=Nadel, Aaron B. |author6=Shepard, Herbert A. |author7=Striner, Herbert E. |author8=Wright, Christopher |date=December 1960 |id=NASA Document ID: 19640053194; NASA Report/Patent Number: NASA-CR-55640 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although the report discusses the need for research on many policy issues related to [[space exploration]], it is most often cited for passages from its brief section on the implications of a discovery of [[extraterrestrial life]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The report touches on the possibility of covering up extraterrestrial life, including the following passages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"While face-to-face meetings with it will not occur within the next twenty years (unless its technology is more advanced than ours, qualifying it to visit Earth), artifacts left at some point in time by these life forms might possibly be discovered through our space activities on the Moon, Mars, or Venus." – pages 182–183&lt;ref name="Brookings" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Anthropological files contain many examples of societies, sure of their place in the universe, which have disintegrated when they have had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies espousing different ideas and different life ways; others that survived such an experience usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes and behavior." – page 183&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since intelligent life might be discovered at any time via the radio telescope research presently under way, and since the consequences of such a discovery are presently unpredictable because of our limited knowledge of behavior under even an approximation of such dramatic circumstances, two research areas can be recommended:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Continuing studies to determine emotional and intellectual understanding and attitudes -- and successive alterations of them if any -- regarding the possibility and consequences of discovering intelligent extraterrestrial life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Historical and empirical studies of the behavior of peoples and their leaders when confronted with dramatic and unfamiliar events or social pressures. Such studies might help to provide programs for meeting and adjusting to the implications of such a discovery. Questions one might wish to answer by such studies would include:  How might such information, under what circumstances, be presented to or withheld from the public for what ends? What might be the role of the discovering scientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact of discovery?" – pages 183–184&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An individual's reactions to such a radio contact would in part depend on his cultural, religious, and social background, as well as on the actions of those he considered authorities and leaders, and their behavior, in turn, would in part depend on their cultural, social, and religious environment. The discovery would certainly be front-page news everywhere; the degree of political or social repercussion would probably depend on leadership's interpretation of (1) its own role, (2) threats to that role, and (3) national and personal opportunities to take advantage of the disruption or reinforcement of the attitudes and values of others. Since leadership itself might have great need to gauge the direction and intensity of public attitudes, to strengthen its own morale and for decision making purposes, it would be most advantageous to have more to go on than personal opinions about the opinions of the public and other leadership groups." – page 183&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The knowledge that life existed in other parts of the universe might lead to a greater unity of men on Earth, based on the 'oneness' of man or on the age-old assumption that any stranger is threatening. Much would depend on what, if anything, was communicated between man and the other beings . . ." – page 183&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The positions of the major American religious denominations, the Christian sects, and the Eastern religions on the matter of extraterrestrial life need elucidation. Consider the following:
 'The Fundamentalist (and anti-science) sects are growing apace around the world . . . For them, the discovery of other life -- rather than any other space product -- would be electrifying. . . . some scattered studies need to be made both in their home centers and churches and their missions, in relation to attitudes about space activities and extraterrestrial life.'" – page 102, n.34&lt;ref name="Footnotes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If plant life or some subhuman intelligence were found on Mars or Venus, for example, there is on the face of it no good reason to suppose these discoveries, after the original novelty had been exploited to the fullest and worn off, would result in substantial changes in perspectives or philosophy in large parts of the American public, at least any more than, let us say, did the discovery of the coelacanth or the panda." – page 103, n.34&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If super intelligence is discovered, the results become quite unpredictable. It is possible that if the intelligence of these creatures were sufficiently superior to ours, they would choose to have little if any contact with us. On the face of it, there is no reason to believe that we might learn a great deal from them, especially if their physiology and psychology were substantially different from ours."– page 103, n.34&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been speculated that, of all groups, scientists and engineers might be the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures, since these professions are most clearly associated with the mastery of nature, rather than with the understanding and expression of man. Advanced understanding of nature might vitiate all our theories at the very least, if not also require a culture and perhaps a brain inaccessible to Earth scientists." – page 103, n.34&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is perhaps interesting to note that when asked what the consequences of the discovery of superior life would be, an audience of ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' readership chose, for the most part, not to answer the question at all, in spite of their detailed answers to many other speculative questions." – page 103, n.34&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A possible but not completely satisfactory means for making the possibility 'real' for many people would be to confront them with present speculations about the I.Q. of the porpoise and to encourage them to expand on the implications of this situation." – page 105, n.36&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Such studies would include historical reactions to hoaxes, psychic manifestations, unidentified flying objects, etc. [[Hadley Cantril]]'s study, ''Invasion from Mars'' (Princeton University Press, 1940), would provide a useful if limited guide in this area. Fruitful understanding might be gained from a comparative study of factors affecting the responses of primitive societies to exposure to technologically advanced societies. Some thrived, some endured, and some died." – page 105, n.37&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conclusions==
While not specifically recommending a [[cover-up]] of evidence of extraterrestrial life, the report does suggest that contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life (or strong evidence of its reality) could have a disruptive effect on human societies. Moreover, it does mention the possibility that leadership might wish to withhold evidence of extraterrestrial life from the public under some conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/1997/nov/m30-005.shtml |title=Brookings Report Re-examined |author=Woodard, Keith |publisher=virtuallystrange.net |date=30 November 1997 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028174130/http://www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/1997/nov/m30-005.shtml |archivedate=2002-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[ufology|ufologists]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enterprisemission.com/brooking.html |title=The 'Brookings Report' |publisher=The Enterprise Mission |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this section of the report, by outlining plausible motives for government suppression of a discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, furnishes evidence of an ongoing cover-up of intelligent extraterrestrial life already discovered.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In an email published by The Virtually Strange Network, entitled "Brookings Report Re-examined", [[Keith Woodard]] writes that the Brookings Report: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...did raise the possibility of withholding information, but took no position on its advisability. 'Questions one might wish to answer by such studies,' intoned the report, 'would include: how might such information, under what circumstances, be presented to or withheld from the public for what ends?  What might be the role of the discovering scientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact of discovery?' Those two sentences comprise the report's entire commentary on the subject of covering up the truth."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Others{{who|date=November 2015}} argue that many passages from this section of the report (e.g., those passages that suggest close study of the historical record regarding the effects on traditional cultures of contact with previously unfamiliar or technologically more advanced societies) comment on the subject of cover-up indirectly by suggesting factors that leaders would want to consider if faced with a decision about whether to release such information to the public.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In certain countries illegal importing, exporting, sale, or possession of drugs constitute capital offences that may result in the death penalty. According to a 2011 article by the [[Lawyers Collective]], an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] in [[India]], "32 countries impose [[capital punishment]] for offences involving [[narcotic drug]]s and [[psychotropic]] substances."&lt;ref name=lawyerscollective/&gt; A 2012 report by [[Harm Reduction International]] "documents the 33 countries and territories that retain death penalty for drug offences, including 13 in which [[mandatory death sentence|the sentence is mandatory]]."&lt;ref name=HRI&gt;[http://www.ihra.net/contents/1290 Death Penalty for Drug Offences Global Overview 2012: Tipping the Scales for Abolition]. 27 November 2012.

"Tipping the Scales for Abolition documents the 33 countries and territories that retain death penalty for drug offences, including 13 in which the sentence is mandatory."&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], and the section on the Federal Death Penalty Act.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3591#b 18 USC § 3591 - Sentence of death | Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure | U.S. Code]. [[Title 18 of the United States Code]]. [[Legal Information Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Kennedy v. Louisiana]] struck down capital punishment for crimes that do not result in the death of a victim, but left open the possibility for "offenses against the State" – including crimes such as "drug kingpin activity" (and treason and espionage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-343.pdf Syllabus.

SCOTUS is [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usali-dp.org/chapters/drugs Chapter 4:  The Death Penalty for Non-Homicide Drug Trafficking?  Kennedy v. Louisiana and the Federal Death Penalty Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012000835/http://usali-dp.org/chapters/drugs |date=12 October 2013 }}. By Seth Gurgel. From the book ''The Contemporary American Struggle with Death Penalty Law: Selected Topics and Cases.'' U.S.-China Death Penalty Reform Project of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute of [[New York University School of Law|NYU School of Law]]. A paragraph from it that summarizes things ('''emphasis''' added): 
:{| class=wikitable
|Making this discussion somewhat easier is the fact that in a recent case totally unrelated to drug trafficking (the case itself addressed the constitutionality of imposing the death penalty for rape of a child where no death occurs), '''Kennedy v. Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court''' conducted a detailed analysis of the distinction between crimes that do and do not take a human life and the relationship of each type of crime to the death penalty. Within this analysis, in a non-binding portion of the Court’s opinion (dictum), the Court drew an analytical line separating “offenses against the individual” from “offenses against the State.” In its holding, the Kennedy Court stated that, at least within the category of “offenses against the individual,” the death penalty is unconstitutional for crimes that do not take a human life, because the punishment of death is “excessive” and “disproportionate” to the crime, pursuant to the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishment.” With respect to the other category, however – '''“offenses against the State” – including crimes such as drug trafficking (and treason and espionage), even when they do not result in a death, the Court left open the possibility that the death penalty might not be unconstitutionally “excessive” punishment.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14515">'''Critical incident stress management''' ('''CISM''') is an adaptive, short-term psychological helping-process that focuses solely on an immediate and identifiable problem.  It can include pre-incident preparedness to acute [[crisis management]] to post-crisis follow-up. Its purpose is to enable people to return to their daily routine more quickly and with less likelihood of experiencing [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbgov.com/file_source/dept/ems/Document/103.01.01.Critical_Incident_Stress_Mgt_Policy.pdf|title=Critical Incident Stress Management: Purpose|format=PDF|publisher=Virginia Beach Department of Emergency Medical Services|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence-based reviews, however, have concluded that CISM is ineffective for primary trauma victims, and should only be used for secondary victims, such as responding emergency services personnel.  CISM was never intended to treat primary victims of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icisf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Crisis-Intervention-and-CISM-A-Research-Summary.pdf|title=CRISIS INTERVENTION &amp; CISM: A Research Summary|first=Jeffrey T|last=Mitchell|publisher=International Critical Incident Stress Foundation|date=February 10, 2003|accessdate=January 29, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crit1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crit7"/&gt;

==Purpose==
CISM is designed to help people deal with their trauma one incident at a time, by allowing them to talk about the incident when it happens without judgment or criticism. The program is ''peer-driven'' and the people conducting the interventions may come from all walks of life, but most are [[first responder]]s (Police, Fire, emergency medical services) or work in the [[mental health]] field. All interventions are strictly confidential, the only caveat to this is if the person doing the intervention determines that the person being helped is a danger to themself or to others. The emphasis is always on keeping people safe and returning them quickly to more ''normal'' levels of functioning.

''Normal'' is different for everyone, and it is not easy to quantify. Critical incidents raise stress levels dramatically in a short period of time and after treatment a new ''normal'' is established, however, it is always higher than the old level. The purpose of the intervention process is to establish or set the new ''normal'' stress levels as low as possible.

==Recipients==
Critical incidents are traumatic events that cause powerful emotional reactions in people who are exposed to those events.  The most stressful of these are line of duty deaths, co-worker [[suicide]], multiple event incidents, delayed intervention and multi-casualty incidents.&lt;ref name="eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic826.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811232118/http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic826.htm|archivedate=August 11, 2006|title=Critical Incident Stress Management|publisher=[[eMedicine]]|first=Stephen A|last=Pulley|date=March 21, 2005|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every profession can list their own worst-case scenarios that can be categorized as critical incidents. Emergency services organizations, for example, usually list the ''Terrible Ten''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgsp.edu.pl/sos/mitchel/wyklady/stress.pdf|title=Stress Management|first=Jeffrey T|last=Mitchell|format=PDF|publisher=Szkoła Główna Służby Pożarniczej|accessdate=July 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625160837/http://www.sgsp.edu.pl/sos/mitchel/wyklady/stress.pdf|archivedate=June 25, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
# Line of duty deaths
# Suicide of a colleague
# Serious work related injury
# Multi-casualty / disaster / terrorism incidents
# Events with a high degree of threat to the personnel
# Significant events involving children
# Events in which the victim is known to the personnel
# Events with excessive media interest
# Events that are prolonged and end with a negative outcome
# Any significantly powerful, overwhelming distressing event

While any person may experience a critical incident, conventional wisdom says that members of law enforcement, fire fighting units, and emergency medical services are at great risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, less than 5% of emergency services personnel will develop long-term PTSD symptomatology.&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Mitchell, J.T., &amp; Bray, G.P. (1990). ''Emergency service stress: Guidelines for preserving the health and careers of emergency services personnel.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; That percentage increases when responders endure the death of a co-worker in the line of duty.  This rate is only slightly higher than the general population average of 3–4%,&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, S.E. &amp; Silke, A.P. (2007). "Near- and long-term psychological effects of exposure to terrorist attacks".  In Bongar, B., Brown, L.M., Beutler, L.E., Breckenridge, J.N., &amp; Zimbardo, P.G. (Eds.). ''Psychology of terrorism.'' (pp. 175-193). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates that despite the remarkably high levels of exposure to trauma, emergency workers are resilient, and people who join the field may self-select for emotional resilience.  Emergency responders tend to portray themselves as "tough”, professional, and unemotional about their work. They often find comfort with other responders, and believe that their families and friends in other professions are unable to completely understand their experiences.&lt;ref name=MB /&gt; Humor is used as a defense mechanism. Alcohol or possibly other drugs/medications may be used to self-medicate in "worst case" situations.

==Types of intervention==
The type of intervention used depends on the situation, the number of people involved, and their proximity to the event. One form of intervention is a three-step approach, whereas different approaches include as many as five stages. The exact number of steps is not what is important for the intervention's success, however. The goal of the intervention is to address the trauma along the general progression: defusing, debriefing, and followup.&lt;ref name="intervention"&gt;Mitchell, J. T., &amp; Everly, G. S., Jr. (2000). "Critical incident stress management and critical incident stress debriefings: Evolutions, effects and outcomes". ''Psychological debriefing: Theory, practice and evidence''. (pp. 7190) Cambridge University Press, New York, NY. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511570148.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defusing===
A defusing is done the day of the incident before the person(s) has a chance to sleep. The defusing is designed to assure the person or people involved that their feelings are normal, to tell them what symptoms to watch for over the short term, and to offer them a lifeline in the form of a telephone number where they can reach someone whom they can talk to. Defusings are limited only to individuals directly involved in the incident and are often done informally, sometimes at the scene. They are designed to assist individuals in coping in the short term and address immediate needs.

===Debriefing===
Debriefings are usually the second level of intervention for those directly affected by the incident and often the first for those not directly involved.

A debriefing is normally done within 72 hours of the incident and gives the individual or group the opportunity to talk about their experience, how it has affected them, [[Brainstorming|brainstorm]] coping mechanisms, identify individuals at risk, and inform the individual or group about services available to them in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/plcy/cdshtm/253-2-gl-eng.shtml|title=Critical Incident Stress Management|publisher=Corrective Service of Canada|accessdate=July 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927081324/http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/plcy/cdshtm/253-2-gl-eng.shtml|archivedate=September 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final step is to follow up with them the day after the debriefing to ensure that they are safe and coping well or to refer the individual for professional [[psychotherapy|counselling]].

Although many have co-opted the debriefing process for use with other groups, the primary focus in the field of CISM is to support staff members of organizations or members of communities which have experienced a traumatic event. The debriefing process (defined by the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation [ICISF]) has seven steps: introduction of intervenor and establishment of guidelines and invites participants to introduce themselves (while attendance at a debriefing may be mandatory, participation is not); details of the event given from individual perspectives; emotional responses given subjectively; personal reaction and actions; followed again by a discussion of symptoms exhibited since the event; instruction phase where the team discusses the symptoms and assures participants that any symptoms (if they have any at all) are a normal reaction to an abnormal event and "generally" these symptoms will diminish with time and self-care; following a brief period of shared informal discussion (generally over a beverage and treat) resumption of duty where individuals are returned to their normal tasks. The intervenor is always watching for individuals who are not coping well and additional assistance is offered at the conclusion of the process.&lt;ref name="eMedicine"/&gt;

===Follow-up===
The important final step is follow-up. This is generally done within the week following the debriefing by team members as a check-in.

==Criticism==

A number of studies have shown that CISM has little effect, or that it actually worsens the trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kagee A |title=Concerns about the effectiveness of critical incident stress debriefing in ameliorating stress reactions |journal=Critical Care |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=88 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11940272 |pmc=137400|doi=10.1186/cc1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several meta-analyses in the medical literature either find no preventative benefit of CISM,&lt;ref name="crit1"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|accessdate=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppe Simone Assemani''' ({{lang-ar|يوسف بن سمعان السمعاني}} '''''Yusuf ibn Siman as-Simani''''', {{lang-en|'''Joseph Simon Assemani'''}}, {{lang-la|'''Ioseph Simonius Assemanus'''}}), was born on July 27, 1687 in [[Hasroun]], [[Lebanon]] and died on January 13, 1768 in [[Rome]]. Assemani was a [[librarian]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and [[Maronite]] eparch. For his efforts, and his encyclopedic knowledge, he earned the nickname "The Great Assemani".

==Life==
Giuseppe Simone Assemani was born on 27 July 1687 in [[Hasroun]], [[Mount Lebanon]] into the Assemani family.&lt;ref name="Graf3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graf |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Graf | title = Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur, Volume 3 | publisher=Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana |year=1960 |chapter=104 |pages=444–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; His surname is related to several distinguished Orientalists and clergy. "[[Assemani]]" is an Arabic [[patronymic]] which means son of Simeon, but this did not prevent him from being called Simon.&lt;ref&gt;[Simon is the name he was called in Italian, even though the name in Arabic is actually Shim'ūn.]&lt;/ref&gt; When very young, in 1703, he was sent to the [[Maronite College]] in [[Rome]], and was transferred thence to the [[Vatican library]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Assemani graduated in 1709. A talented graduate (at that time he had written three essays on the Syrian grammar and theology), he was spotted by [[Pope Clement XI]], who kept him in Rome and ordered him to catalogue early Christian manuscripts that were brought in 1707 from Egypt by his brother Elias. In 1710, Giuseppe worked as scribe of Oriental manuscripts (scriptor Orientalis), translator from Arabic and Syriac languages, and advisor to the Congregation for the review and reform of the liturgical books of the Eastern rites. He was ordained [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] on 21 September 1710.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bassemjs|Archbishop Josephus Simon Assemani|23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1711 Assemani received papal authorization to pass from the Maronite rite to the Latin rite. From 1715 to 1717 he was sent to [[Wadi El Natrun]], [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]] and [[Lebanon]] to search for valuable manuscripts, and returned with about 150 very choice ones,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} which formed a collection in the Vatican Library. In 1735 [[Pope Clement XII]] sent him again to the East where he presided the 1736 Maronite Synod of Mount-Lebanon, which laid the foundations for the modern [[Maronite Church]]. He returned with a still more valuable collection, because he found the opportunity to collect even more ancient works. This time he brought about 2,000 works, and the most important of them was the [[Codex Assemanius]], an [[evangeliary]] which he had brought from Jerusalem in 1736. He later played a significant role in mediating several crises in the Maronite Church hierarchy, by virtue of his influence in Rome and his knowledge of the Maronite Church.

Back in 1738 Assemani was in Lebanon, and on his return was made, in 1739, First Librarian of the [[Vatican library]]. He was also appointed by [[Charles III of Spain|Carlo di Borbone]] official chronicler of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

In Rome he began immediately to elaborate plans to publish the most valuable of his collected works. His translation of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]'s writings, his bibliography of Syriac writers from the Clementino-Vaticana Library, and his classification of Byzantine writings, are also very important.

In recognition of his achievements, he was appointed bishop on December 1, 1766 and consecrated [[titular archbishop]] of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] on December 7, 1766&lt;ref name="Graf3"/&gt; by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Henry Benedict Stuart]] Duke of York and [[Titular bishop]] of Frascati; his co-consecrators were his nephew [[Stefano Evodio Assemani]], Titular bishop of Apamea in Bithynia, and [[Nicholas-Xavier Santamarie]], Titular bishop of Cyrene. He died in Rome on 13 January 1768.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-simonio-assemani_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ treccani.it]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his work was lost in his apartment during a fire on August 30, 1768.&lt;ref&gt;[Luzzatto, David Samuel. Samuel David Luzzatto, History of the Hebrew Language. [sl]: Gorgias Press LLC, 2005 S. 181 (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Giuseppe Luigi Assemani|brother]] and [[Stefano Evodio Assemani|nephew]] were also noted orientalists.

==Works==
When appointed librarian of the Vatican library he instantly began to carry into execution most extensive plans for editing and publishing the most valuable manuscript treasures of the Vatican.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His main work is:
*http://digitale-sammlungen.ulb.uni-bonn.de/ulbbn/content/titleinfo/121369, ''Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana in qua manuscriptos codices Syriacos, Arabicos, Persicos, Turcicos, Hebraicos, Samaritanos, Armenicos, Aethiopicos, Graecos, Aegyptiacos, Ibericos, et Malabaricos, jussu et munificentia Clementis XI Pontificis Maximi ex Oriente conquisitos, comparatos, et Bibliotecae Vaticanae addictos Recensuit, digessit, et genuina scripta a spuriis secrevit, addita singulorum auctorum vita, Joseph Simonius Assemanus, Syrus Maronita'' (Rome, 1719–1728), 9 vols folio

Of the ''Bibliotheca'' the first three vols only were completed. The work was to have been in four parts:
#Syrian and allied manuscripts, orthodox, [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]
#Arabian manuscripts, [[Christian]] and [[Islam]]
#[[Coptic language|Coptic]], Aethiopic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts
#Syrian and Arabian manuscripts not distinctively theological{{sfn|Oussani|1913}}
Only the first part was completed, but extensive preparations were made for the others. There is a German abridgment by August Friedrich Pfeiffer (Erlangen 1770-77)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Giuseppe+Simone+Assemani&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPP5,M1|title= Joseph Simonius Assemanns orientalische Bibliothek oder Nachrichten von| year=1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Reprint (Hildesheim, New York: Olms o.J. ca. 1990).

[[Image:Vasnetsov Grave digger.JPG|right|thumb|200px|''Grave-digger'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], 1871.]]

A '''gravedigger''' is a [[cemetery]] worker who is responsible for digging a [[Grave (burial)|grave]] prior to a [[funeral service]].

==Description==
If the grave is in a cemetery on the property of a church or other religious organization (part of, or called, a [[churchyard]]), gravediggers may be members of the [[decedent]]'s family or volunteer parishioners. Digging graves has also been one of the traditional duties of a church's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In municipal and privately owned cemeteries, gravediggers may be low-paid, unskilled, and temporary laborers, or they may be well-paid, trained, and professional careerists, as their duties may include [[landscaping]] tasks and courteous interactions with mourners and other visitors. In some countries, gravedigging may be done by landscaping workers for the local council or [[local authority]].

A gravedigger implements a variety of tools to accomplish his primary task. A template, in the form of a wooden frame built to prescribed specifications, is often placed on the ground over the intended grave. The gravedigger may use a sod-cutter or [[spade]] to cut the outline of the grave and remove the top layer of [[sod]]. Digging the grave by hand usually requires [[shovel]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]], [[mattock]]s, and/or other tools. Cemeteries in industrialized countries may keep a [[backhoe loader]] and other heavy equipment, which greatly increases the efficiency of gravedigging.

Typically, gravediggers - at least in most Western countries - will use a wooden box to put the soil in. This box consists of several large pieces of wood that fit together, and the box is assembled next to the grave. Once the grave has been dug and the soil from the grave has been placed in the box, the box will usually be covered with a piece of [[tarpaulin]] or similar material. The soil will then remain in the box until the day of the back-fill, when the funeral takes place and the soil is emptied back into the grave after the coffin has been lowered, after which the box is disassembled. Due to the close proximity of graves in cemeteries (4 feet between the centre of each headstone is common in modern UK cemeteries), invariably the wooden box is often placed in front of one or more other graves, and is seen as a nuisance to those wishing to visit graves adjacent to a grave that is due to be filled.

Although the expression "six feet under" refers to the depth at which people were traditionally buried, at least in the UK the minimum legal depth for a new grave is seven feet. This allows a maximum of three coffins to be buried in the same grave, typically family members of the deceased who are buried at a later date when they die - which is known as a re-open. Gravediggers must take care to get the proportions of a grave right as the hole needs to be big enough for the coffin to be lowered in. Additionally, [[shoring]] is often used to stop a grave from collapsing. Gravediggers must make sure that the coffin can fit through the shoring. Additionally, on the day of the back-fill and for the funeral service, typically [[artificial turf]] will be placed around the grave whilst the coffin is being lowered. This is primarily for [[aesthetic]] reasons and serves no other real purpose.

In many cultures throughout history, gravediggers have been highly marginalized by their societies. In the traditional caste system of [[India]], cemetery work has been the responsibility of the lowest castes, considered "unclean" or "untouchable" for their association with death.

==Fossors==

'''Fossor''' (Latin '''Fossarius''', from the verb ''fodere'' 'to dig') is a term described in Chambers' dictionary as archaic, but can conveniently be revived to describe grave diggers in the Roman [[catacombs]] in the first three centuries of the [[Christian]] Era. The duties of the Christian fossor corresponded in a general way with those of the pagan ''vespillones'', but whereas the latter were held in anything but esteem in pagan society (many religions consider corpses, and sometimes anyone who touches them, 'unclean' also in a religious sense), the fossors from an early date were ranked among the inferior [[clergy]] of the Church (Wieland, Ordines Minores, 1897).

In the ''Gesta apud Zenophilum'' by [[St. Optatus of Mileve]], a reference is made to the character of the fossors as an order of inferior clergy. Speaking of the "house in which Christians assembled" at [[Cirta]] in the year 303, during the [[persecution of Diocletian]], this writer enumerates first the higher orders of the clergy present, from the [[bishop]] to the [[subdeacon]]s, and then mentions by name the fossors Januarius, Heraclius, Fructuosus, ''et ceteris fossoribus''.&lt;ref&gt;"Opp. S. Optati", ed. C. Ziwsa, in "Corpus Script. Eccl. Lat.", Vienna, 1893, XXVI, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Jerome]]&lt;ref&gt;Also (Ep. xlix)&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to fossors as ''clerici'', and a sixth-century chronicle edited by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Mai&lt;ref&gt;(Spicil. Rom., IX, 133)&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the (minor) orders of the clergy as ''[[ostiarius]]'', ''[[fossorius]]'', ''[[lector]]'', etc. At first the fossors seem to have received no regular salary, but were paid by individuals for the work accomplished; with the organization of the Church, however, they appear to have been paid from the common treasury. In the fourth century the corporation of fossors was empowered to sell burial spaces. For example, in the cemetery of [[St. Cyriacus]], two women bought from the fossor Quintus a ''bisomus'', or double grave, ''retro sanctos'' (behind and near a martyr's tomb), and there are several other references to this practice.

The corporation of fossors probably did not consist merely of the labourers who excavated the galleries of the [[catacomb]]s; it also included the artists who decorated the tombs, as appears from another allusion in the ''Gesta apud Zenophilum'' already cited. According to this authority two fossors were brought before the judge;&lt;ref&gt;(''inductis et adplicitis Victore Samsurici et Saturnino fossoribus'')&lt;/ref&gt; when interrogated as to their calling, one replied that he was a fossor, the other that he was an ''artifex'', meaning a painter or sculptor.

Among the representations of fossors in the catacombs the one best known, through Wiseman's "Fabiola", is that of the fossor Diogenes, discovered by Boldetti. The picture, which was seriously damaged in an attempt to remove it from the wall, represents Diogenes with his pick over his right shoulder and a sack, probably containing his midday meal, on his left shoulder, while in his left hand he carries a staff with a light attached. The inscription reads: ''DIOGENES FOSSOR, IN PACE DEPOSITVS, OCTABV KALENDAS OCTOBRIS'' ("the fossor Diogenes, interred in peace, the eighth day before the calends of October"). The oldest [[fresco]] of a fossor, or rather of two fossors, dates from the late second century, is in one of the [[Sacrament]] Chapels in the catacomb of [[St. Callistus]]. The figures are represented pointing toward three [[Eucharist]]ic scenes, a reference to another of their duties, which was to exclude unauthorized persons from taking part in the liturgical celebrations held occasionally in the cemeteries in commemoration of [[martyr]]s. Representations of fossors are usually near the entrance of the subterranean cemeteries.

==Gravediggers in literature==
One of [[Barbara Paul]]'s novels was titled ''First Gravedigger'' as an allusion to this scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarapaul.com/ |title=Barbara Paul's website |publisher=Barbarapaul.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravedigging has also been used as a theme in detective and crime fiction. [[Gravedigger Jones]] is one of two black detectives featured in the "Harlem cycle" of novels by [[Chester Himes]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chester Bomar Himes." Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Vol. 22. Gale Group, 2002. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His partner in the novels is Coffin Ed Johnson and the pair are often involved in violent confrontations. The timbre of these novels is frequently mordant, and a funeral director is a recurring character.

===Hamlet===
[[File:Pascal Adolphe Jean Dagnan-Bouveret - Hamlet and the Gravediggers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hamlet and the Gravediggers, by [[Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret]].]]
{{Main|The Gravediggers}}
Because of their association with the subject of [[death]], gravediggers have made notable appearances in literature. Perhaps the most famous of these occurs during Act 5, Scene 1 of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', where Hamlet and [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]] engage in dialogue with one of the grave-makers (called "First Clown") as he is digging [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]'s grave. The Gravediggers (or Clowns) make their one and only appearance at the beginning of Act v, Scene I. They enter and begin digging a grave for the newly deceased Ophelia, discussing whether or not she deserves a Christian burial after having killed herself.
When together, the Gravediggers speak mainly in riddles and witty banter regarding death, with the first asking the questions and the second answering.

{{quote|'''GRAVEDIGGER''': What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

'''OTHER''': The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.|V.i., 38-41}}

''and later in the scene:''

{{quote|'''GRAVEDIGGER''': And when you are asked this question next, say “A grave-maker.” The houses that he makes last till doomsday.|V.i., 53-55}}

Soon, Hamlet enters and engages in a quick dialog with the first Gravedigger. The scene ends with Hamlet's soliloquies regarding the circle of life prompted by his discovery of the skull of his beloved jester, Yorick. The First Clown unearths [[Yorick]]'s skull, prompting Hamlet to deliver the memorable lines: "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/hamlet/60.html Cliffs Notes summary of Act 5, Scene 1 in ''Hamlet''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211005553/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/hamlet/60.html |date=11 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxism==

In the terminology of [[Marxism]], a rising revolutionary class which is destined to overthrow and supplant an earlier ruling class is often referred to as that earlier class' "gravedigger". Thus, the [[bourgeoisie]]'s historical role was to act as "the gravedigger of [[feudalism]]", but by creating a vast exploited [[working class]] which is bound to organise and stage a revolution, the bourgeoisie has inevitably created its own "gravedigger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.net/resources/communistmanifesto.html |title=Resources &amp;#124; Ideas &amp;#124; The significance of the Communist Manifesto |publisher=A World to Win |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This metaphorical use of "gravedigger" is already attested in [[Karl Marx]]'s own writings, and was continued in the same sense by [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]] and many other Marxist theoreticians and leaders.

==Low social status==
In several societies worldwide, gravediggers are often drawn from the lowest [[social class]] or [[caste]], and regarded as [[wikt:Special:Search/unclean|unclean]]. In India, gravediggers and related professions have traditionally been drawn from among the [[Dalit|Untouchables]]. In feudal [[Japan]], gravedigging was one of the "unclean" professions historically allotted to the [[Burakumin]] class. Other examples can be found in [[Ancient Egypt]] and elsewhere.

'''Harry Acres''' was a British [[composer]] of [[film scores]]. He was [[musical director]] for a number of years during the 1930s at [[British International Pictures]]'s [[Elstree Studios]]. Acres tended to be involved with the studio's light comedies and musicals, rather than more serious and expensive historical films.

Acres also worked as musical director for several [[Ivor Novello]] stage musicals including ''[[The Dancing Years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''houris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʊər|i|z}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/houris "houri"].

== Descriptions ==
The houris are mentioned in several passages of the Quran, always in plural form. No specifics are ever given, though, as to the number of houris that should be available to each believer. As for the gender of the houris, the Quran does not indicate that only men would be granted the company of houris&amp;mdash;in fact, it can be inferred from the context that both men and women believers will have a plural number of houris for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/635343/are-all-houris-female|title=Are all ‘houris’ female?|first=From the|last=Newspaper|date=9 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn leads to the assumptions that houris can be both male or female.

On the other hand, feminine adjectives or participles are always used when it is possible to make a distinction,&lt;ref&gt;Such as قَاصِرَاتُ الطَّرْفِ in [http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=37&amp;verse=48 37:48].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Qur'an says that one of the favors granted to those in Paradise is houris "untouched before them by man or [[Jinni]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(55:74:1)|title=55:74|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that they are (female) virgins.&lt;ref name=Warraq/&gt; They are described as virgins in 56:36 (although the word in another context can mean "first-born").

Details of the houris that have been pointed out by Sunni scholars include that the houris would not [[urinate]], [[defecate]] or [[menstruate]].&lt;ref name="Religious_Sciences"&gt;[[Al Ghazzali]], [http://www.nderf.org/islamic_views_death.htm Ihya Uloom Ed-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) Vol. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224520/http://www.nderf.org/islamic_views_death.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been said that all houris are "transparent to the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their bones",&lt;ref name=Sunan_al-Tirmidhi_v2&gt;Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bukhari_476"&gt;{{hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|476}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eternally young",&lt;ref name=Sunan_al-Tirmidhi_5638&gt;Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, hadith: 5638&lt;/ref&gt; "hairless except the eyebrows and the head",&lt;ref name=Sunan_al-Tirmidhi_5638/&gt; "pure"&lt;ref name="Bukhari_476"/&gt; and "beautiful".&lt;ref name="Bukhari_476"/&gt; Islamic scholars such as [[Ibn Majah]] and [[Al-Suyuti]] have also described them as having libidinous vaginas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Sunan Ibn Majah | volume=5 |chapter=Zuhd (Book of Abstinence), Hadith 4337 |location= |publisher= |page= |quote=Abu Umama narrated: "The Messenger of God said, 'Everyone that God admits into paradise will be married to 72 wives; two of them are houris and seventy of his inheritance of the [female] dwellers of hell.

Each chosen one will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetizing vaginas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hadiths ====
A number of Sunni ''[[ahadith]]'' (collections of the reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, accepted as canonic by most, but not all, Muslims) also mention the houris:
* [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810–870):
{{Quote|"...everyone will have two wives{{ref|F|F}} from the houris, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari'', Book 54 "The Beginning of Creation", hadith 476)&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|476}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|[People who enter Paradise] will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their censers. Their wives will be houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father [[Adam]] (in stature), sixty cubits tall.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari'', Book 55 "Prophets", hadith 544&lt;ref name="Bukhari_544"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/60|title=Sahih al-Bukhari, book 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathir"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ismail ibn Kathir |author-link=Ibn Kathir |title=[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] |year=2000 |at= |chapter=The Reward of Those on the Right After}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Sixty cubits is approximately {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Al-Bukhari notes elsewhere that "people have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri]] (821–875):
{{Quote|Muhammad reported that some (persons) stated with a sense of pride and some discussed whether there would be more men in Paradise or more women. It was upon this that [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] reported that Abu'l Qasim (the Holy Prophet) said: The (members) of the first group to get into Paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night, and the next to this group would have their faces as bright as the shining stars in the sky, and every person would have two wives{{ref|G|G}} and the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath the flesh and there would be none without a wife in Paradise.|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri|''Sahih Muslim'', Book 40 "Pertaining to Paradise", hadith 6793&lt;ref name="Muslim 40 6793"/&gt;}}
{{Quote|[[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir b. 'Abdullah]] reported: I was shown Paradise and I saw the wife of Abu Talha (i. e. [[Rumaysa bint Milhan|Umm Sulaim]]) and I heard the noise of steps before me and, lo, it was that of [[Hasan of Basra|Bilal]].|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri|''Sahih Muslim'', Book 31 "Pertaining to the Merits of the Companions", hadith 6012&lt;ref name="Muslim 31 6012"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|31|6012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]] (At-Tirmidhi) (824–892):
{{Quote|[[Al-Hasan al-Basri|Al-Hasan Al-Basri]] says that an old woman came to the messenger of Allah and made a request, O’ Messenger of Allah make [[Dua]] that Allah grants me entrance into Jannah. The messenger of Allah replied, O’ Mother, an old woman cannot enter Jannah. That woman started crying and began to leave. The messenger of Allah said, Say to the woman that one will not enter in a state of old age, but Allah will make all the women of Jannah young virgins. Allah Ta’aala says, Lo! We have created them a (new) creation and made them virgins, lovers, equal in age.|Al-Tirmidhi|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]'' (Surah Waaqi’ah, 35–37).&lt;ref&gt;Shamaa-il Tirmidhi, Chapter 035, Hadith Number 006 (230)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|A houri is a most beautiful young woman with a transparent body. The marrow of her bones is visible like the interior lines of pearls and rubies. She looks like red wine in a white glass. She is of white color, and free from the routine physical disabilities of an ordinary woman such as menstruation, menopause, urinal and offal discharge, child bearing and the related pollution. A houri is a girl of tender age, having large breasts which are round (pointed), and not inclined to dangle. Houris dwell in palaces of splendid surroundings.|Al-Tirmidhi|''Jami` at-Tirmidhi''&lt;ref&gt;Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, ''Jami al-Tirmidhi''. Vol. II pp.35-40. (Karachi:Muhammad Ali) and ''Mishka Sharif'' (Lahore: Farid) Vol. 3 pp 83-97. Translated by Anwar Shaikh ''Islam: Sex and Violence'', Cardiff: Principality Publishers (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Ibn Majah]] (824–887):
{{Quote|Houris do not want wives to annoy their husbands, since the houris will also be the wives of the husbands in the afterlife. "[[Muadh ibn Jabal]] (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, 'A woman does not annoy her husband but his spouse from amongst the maidens with wide eyes intensely white and deeply black will say: Do not annoy him, may Allah ruin you." He is with you as a passing guest.

* Like Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri (see above), Abu Hurairah mentions houris as the solution to previous mundane worries as to whether there would be more women or more men who would go to paradise&lt;ref name="Muslim 40 6793"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|40|6793}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and whether, therefore, there would be a shortage of each gender for couple-making in the afterlife). [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] (Abu Ubayda) said that the recreated women of this life referring to {{Quote|We have created (their Companions) of special creation.&lt;br&gt;And made them virgin—pure (and undefiled)|Quran, sura 56 (Al-Waqia), ayat 35-36&lt;ref name="quran 5635"&gt;{{Cite quran|56|35|e=36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} were mentioned in the previous verse as houri in verse 22. [[Hasan of Basra|Al-Hasan al-Basri]] stated that the word "houri" implied the righteous women among mankind who are rewarded with paradise as related in the [[Tafsir al-Tabari|Tafsir of Tabari]] quoted by [[Muhammad Asad]] in his tafsir "Message of Quran"&lt;ref name="waqiah"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Message of The Qur'an]] |last=Asad, M. |author-link=Muhammad Asad |year=2003 |at= |chapter=(Surah) 56 Al-Waqiah, ayat 35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the following ayah:
{{Quote|We have created (their Companions) of special creation.&lt;br&gt;And made them virgin—pure (and undefiled)|Quran, sura 56 (Al-Waqia), ayat 35-36&lt;ref name="quran 5635"/&gt;}}

==== Quranic commentators ====
* Artat bin Al-Mundhir said regarding houri mentioned in sura Rahman (55), ayah (verse) 56:
{{Quote|Damrah bin Habib was asked if the Jinns will enter Paradise and he said, 'Yes, and they will get married. The Jinns will have Jinn women and the humans will have female humans.'|Ibn Kathir|''Tafsir ibn Kathir''}}
* [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] mentions that all righteous women, however old and decayed they may have been on earth, will be resurrected as virginal maidens and will, like their male counterparts, remain eternally young in paradise.&lt;ref name="waqiah"/&gt;
* [[Ibn Kathir]] says that the houris "are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands."&lt;ref name=TaqwaParadise&gt;[http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=55&amp;tid=51713 The Delight of Those Who have Taqwa in Paradise] - Tafsir.com for Quran 55:56&lt;/ref&gt; by commenting, "in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful."&lt;ref name="Right After"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ismail ibn Kathir |authorlink=Ibn Kathir |title=[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] |year=2000 |at=The Reward of Those on the Right After |chapter=(Surah) 56 Al-Waqiah ayat 35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Kathir also stated that Muhammad confirmed that there would be sexual intercourse in Paradise.&lt;ref name="Kathir"/&gt;
* [[Al-Qurtubi]] reconciled between a previous hadith that stated that the majority of the inhabitants of [[Hell]] ([[Jahannam]]) would be women by suggesting that many of the women that will form the majority in Hell will be among the sinners that would stay there merely temporarily and would then be brought out of Hell, into Paradise. Thereafter the majority of the people of Paradise will be women.&lt;ref name="Qurtubi"&gt;at-Tadhkirah, al-Qurtubî, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] comments that amongst the houris mentioned in the Quran would also be "[even] those toothless old women of yours whom God will resurrect as new beings"&lt;ref name="Razi"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Message of The Qur'an]] |author=Asad, M. |author-link=Muhammad Asad |year=2003 |at=Al-Hasan, quoted by Razi in his comments on 44: 54 |chapter=(Surah) 56 Al-Waqiah, ayah 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

=== Classical Arabic usage ===
The word 'ḥūr' ({{lang-ar|حُور}}) is the plural of both ''ʾaḥwar'' ({{lang-ar|أحْوَر}}) (masculine) and ''ḥawrāʾ'' ({{lang-ar|حَوْراء}}) (feminine) &lt;ref&gt;see [http://ejtaal.net/aa/#HW4=261,HW3=230,LL=2_302,LS=2,HA=160,SG=322,BR=267,PR=47,AAN=152,VI=125,MGF=240,UQW=390,UMR=292,UMS=236,UMJ=189 Lane's Lexicon, p. 302] and [http://ejtaal.net/aa/#HW4=260,HW3=230,LL=2_302,LS=2,HA=160,SG=322,BR=267,PR=47,AAN=152,VI=125,MGF=240,UQW=390,UMR=292,UMS=236,UMJ=189,LL_HIDE,LS_HIDE Hans Wehr, p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be translates as "gazelle-eyed" (or "having eyes with an intense contrast of white and black",&lt;ref&gt;Wehr's Arabic-English Dictionary, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;) or as "distinguished by ḥawar ({{lang|ar|حَوَر}})", which itself means "intense whiteness of the eyeballs and lustrous black of the pupils". Some also propose that the most literal translation of the noun into English would be "pure companions, most beautiful of the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/right_hands.html|title=ZAWAJ.COM: Articles and Essays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corresponding Hebrew root ===
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] the corresponding adjective {{Hebrew|חיוור}} ''hiwer'' has the same root h-w-r, meaning "pale, whitish". The corresponding word for eye is {{Hebrew|עין}} ''Ayin''.

=== European usage ===
The word "houri" has entered several European languages (French – 1654, English – 1737) with the meaning of a "elegant, beautiful, charming woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=houri|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bartelby.com/61/59/H0295900.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Houri" versus "whore" ====
The English word "[[whore]]" ([[German language|German]] ''Hure'', [[Danish language|Danish]] ''hore'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''hora'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hoer'', [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*hōrōn'', masculine form [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''hors'', Proto-Germanic ''*hōraz'') is thought to stem from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|verb root]] ''*keh₂-'' "to love" and is not [[Etymology|etymologically]] related to the Arabic ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and thus non-Indo-European) word ''houri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2007/05/april_gleanings/|title=Monthly Gleanings: April 2007 - OUPblog|date=2 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
Several translators—like [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali|Hilali]]-[[Muhammad Muhsin Khan|Khan]], [[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]], [[Edward Henry Palmer|Palmer]], [[John Medows Rodwell|Rodwell]] and [[George Sale|Sale]]—have translated the adjective ''ka'ib'' in Book 78, verse 33 of the Quran to refer to "wide shoulders and chest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|78|33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Kathir, in his [[tafsir]], writes that the adjective contained in said verse "means 'fit pectorals or breasts'." He goes on as to state that it is "meant by this that the chest and pectorals or breasts of these girls will be fully fit and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age. And the houris can be male and female both. It means the 'fit pectorals or breasts' can be male or female."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=78&amp;tid=56825 |author=Ibn Kathir |title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Abridged, Volume 10 Surat At-Tagabun to the end of the Qur'an |pages=333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], on the other hand, translates said adjective into English simply as "charming, elegant and holy"&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali: ''The Meanings of the Illustrious Qur'an'', Alminar Books, Houston, TX, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;—which refers to sensual (or physical) attributes, though not necessarily chest, pectorals or breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voluptuous|title=Definition of VOLUPTUOUS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative interpretation, Muhammad Asad has said the following regarding such verse:
{{Quote|As regards my rendering of kawa’ib as "splendid companions", it is to be remembered that the term ''ka'b''—from which the participle ka’ib is derived—has many meanings, and that one of these meanings is "prominence", "eminence" or "glory" (Lisan al-Arab); thus, the verb ''ka'ba'', when applied to a person, signifies "he made [another person] prominent", "glorious" or "splendid" (ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb ka'ba and the noun ka'b, the participle ka'ib has often been used, in popular parlance, to denote "a girl whose shoulder and chest are becoming prominent" or "are budding" hence, many commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of youthful "female companions' who would entertain the (presumably male) occupants of paradise ... This interpretation of kawa’ib overlooks the purely derivative origin of the above popular usage—which is based on the tropical connotation of "prominence" inherent in the noun ''ka'b''—and substitutes for this obvious tropism the literal meaning of something that is physically prominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly unjustified. If we bear in mind that the Qur'anic descriptions of the blessings of paradise are always allegorical, we realize that in the above context the term kawa’ib can have no other meaning than "glorious [or "splendid"] beings".|Muhammad Asad|''The Message of The Qur'an''&lt;ref name="atrab"/&gt;}}

The authoritative [[Arabic-English Lexicon]] of [[Edward William Lane]] defines the singular of the word kawa`ib as "A girl whose chest is beginning to swell, or become prominent, or protuberant",&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.quranic-research.net/data/22_k/112_kEb.html كعب] in Lane's lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt; related to words meaning knob, chest, bosom, virginity, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Wehr's Arabic-English Dictionary, 1960, under the root [[wikt:كعب]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual intercourse in Paradise ==
[[Ibn Kathir]] mentions Muhammed saying that man in heaven would have sex with one hundred virgins in one day.&lt;ref name=IbnKathir_surah55&gt;[http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=56&amp;tid=51961 The Reward of Those on the Right After] - Ibn Kathir's commentary on Quranic surah 55, Al-Waqia&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of the hadith, [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said: ''"In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women." [[Anas ibn Malik|Anas]] said, "I asked, 'O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that?' He said, "He will be given the strength of a hundred (men)".''&lt;ref name=IbnKathir_surah55/&gt; Some companions of [[Muhammad]] are reported to have said that man in heaven will be "busy in deflowering virgins"&lt;ref name=islamqa10053&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamqa.com/index.php?ref=10053&amp;ln=eng|title=موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب - عربي - islamqa.info|website=www.islamqa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Kathir]] says that the houri "are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands."&lt;ref name=TaqwaParadise/&gt; by commenting,''"in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful."'' &lt;ref name="Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Reward of Those on the Right After"&gt; Ibn Kathir,''Tafsir ibn Kathir (Qur'anic Commentary)'',"The Reward of Those on the Right After", [Chapter (Surah) Al-Waqiah (That Which Must Come To Pass)(56):35-36], Dar-us-Salam Publications,2000, {{ISBN|1591440203}}, {{ISBN|978-1591440208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suyuti|Imam Suyuti]] is reported to have said, "[E]ach time we sleep with a houri we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [ie Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetising vaginas."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ibn|last=Warraq|title=Virgins? What virgins?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2002-01-12|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,,631332,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another place, Ibn Kathir emphasizes the literal nature of sexual intercourse in Paradise by another Hadith:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Prophet was asked : 'Do we have sex in Paradise?' He answered: 'Yes, by him who holds my soul in his hand, and it will be done dahman, dahman (that is intercourse done with such shove and disturbance&lt;ref&gt;Ibn-Kathir, vol. 8, page 11, commentary on Q. 56:35-37, published by Dar Ash-sha'b, editorial footnote by the publisher explaining the meaning of 'dahman'&lt;/ref&gt;). And when it is finished she will return pure and virgin again.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ibn-Kathir, vol. 8, page 11, commenting on Q. 56:35-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Alternative Interpretations ===
Ibn Kathir relates concerning the following verses:
"Verily, the dwellers of the Paradise, that Day, will be busy with joyful things. They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones. They will have therein fruits and all that they ask for." [Chapter (Surah) Ya Seen (O Thou Human Being)(36):55-57]&lt;ref name="Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Life of the People of Paradise"&gt; Ibn Kathir,''Tafsir ibn Kathir (Qur'anic Commentary)'',"The Life of the People of Paradise", [Chapter (Surah) Ya Seen (O Thou Human Being)(36):55-57], Dar-us-Salam Publications,2000, {{ISBN|1591440203}}, {{ISBN|978-1591440208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ibn Kathir relates the opinion of some companions of [[Muhammad]] being reported to have said concerning "will be busy with joyful things" that means in heaven people will be ''"busy in deflowering virgins"'', he continues to relate other alternate meanings. Another companion, Ibn Abass has said that it refers ''"listening to stringed instruments"''.&lt;ref name=islamqa10053/&gt; Others such as Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Isma`il bin Abi Khalid have said, ''"they will be too busy to think about the torment which the people of Hell are suffering."'' Qatadah implied ''"with the delights which they are enjoying."'' Ibn Abas said, ''"this means that they will be rejoicing."''. While Mujahid said, ''"Their spouses,(will be in pleasant shade) means, in the shade of trees."''Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Khusayf said, ''"beds beneath canopies."''&lt;ref name="Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Life of the People of Paradise"/&gt;

== {{anchor|72 virgins}}Reference to "72 virgins" ==
The idea of 72 virgins in Islam refers to an aspect of paradise. In a Sunni collection by Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi in his ''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Volume IV, chapters on ''The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of Allah'', chapter 21: ''About the Smallest Reward for the People of Heaven'', hadith 2687&lt;/ref&gt; and also quoted by [[Ibn Kathir]] in his ''Tafsir ibn Kathir'' of sura 55&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|55|72|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is stated:

{{Quote|It was mentioned by Daraj Ibn Abi Hatim, that Abu al-Haytham 'Adullah Ibn Wahb narrated from Abu Sa'id al-Khudhri, who heard Muhammad saying, 'The smallest reward for the people of Heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand servants and seventy-two houri, over which stands a dome decorated with [[pearl]]s, [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]], and [[ruby]], as wide as the distance from [[Damascus|al-Jabiyyah]] to [[Sana'a|San'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/sp2-gfh_e.html#9|title=Various Questions Answered by Shaykh Gibril Haddad|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, regarding the above statement Hafiz Salahuddin Yusuf has said: "The narration, which claims that everyone would have seventy-two wives has a weak chain of narrators."&lt;ref name="Salahuddin Yusuf"&gt;Salahuddin Yusuf, ''Riyadhus Salihin'', commentary on Nawawi, Chapter 372, Dar-us-Salam Publications (1999), {{ISBN|1-59144-053-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59144-053-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same collection of Sunni hadiths, however, the following is judged strong (''[[Hadith terminology|hasan sahih]]''):
{{Quote|That the Messenger of Allah said: "There are six things with Allah for the [[Shahid|martyr]]. He is forgiven with the first flow of blood (he suffers), he is shown his place in Paradise, he is protected from punishment in the grave, secured from the greatest terror, the crown of dignity is placed upon his head—and its gems are better than the world and what is in it—he is married to seventy two wives among the Hur the `Iyn ["wide-eyed ones", اثْنَتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ زَوْجَةً مِنَ الْحُورِ الْعِينِ] of Paradise, and he may intercede for seventy of his close relatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/22/46|title=Hadith - The Book on Virtues of Jihad - Jami`at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran]]'' by the pseudonymous "[[Christoph Luxenberg]]" claims that the word is actually just the Syriac word for "white" and refers to white raisins.&lt;ref name=Warraq&gt;[[Ibn Warraq]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/12/books.guardianreview5 "Virgins?

'''Irene Angelina''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Εἰρήνη Ἀγγελίνα}}}}; c. 1181 – 27 August 1208), was a Byzantine princess member of the [[Angelos|Angelos dynasty]] and by her two marriages [[List of Sicilian consorts|Queen of Sicily]] in 1193 and [[List of German queens|Queen of Germany]] from 1198 to 1208.

She was the second daughter of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] and his first wife, an unknown Palaiologina? who became nun with the name Irene.

== Life ==
Irene was born in [[Constantinople]]. Her father Isaac II inaugurated his reign with a decisive victory over the [[Normans|Norman]] invaders on the [[Balkans]] in the 1185 [[Battle of Demetritzes]]. In 1193 he and [[Tancred, King of Sicily|King Tancred of Sicily]] arranged Irene's marriage with Tancred's eldest son, [[Roger III of Sicily|Roger]].{{sfn|Ciggaar|1996|p=240}} Roger was declared co-king, but died on 24 December 1193, shortly before his father's death on 20 February 1194. Sicily was claimed by Tancred's aunt [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance]] and her husband, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry VI]]. After he had conquered the Sicilian kingdom, Irene was captured on 29 December 1194 and was married on 25 May 1197 to Henry's younger brother, Duke [[Philip of Swabia]].{{sfn|Ciggaar|1996|p=240}} In Germany, she was renamed Maria.

After the Emperor had died on September 28, Philip was elected [[King of the Romans]] in [[Mulhouse|Mühlhausen]] on 8 March 1198. Queen Irene's father, who had been deposed in 1195, urged her to get Philip's support for his reinstatement; her brother, [[Alexius IV Angelus|Alexius]], subsequently spent some time at Philip's court during the preparations for the [[Fourth Crusade]]. She thus had an early influence on the eventual diversion of the Crusade to [[Constantinople]] in 1204. Rivalled by the [[House of Welf|Welf]] scion [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], Philip was able to consolidate his rule over the German kingdom. On 21 June 1208, he was killed by the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] Count Palatine Otto VIII of [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]], leaving Irene widowed a second time.

After the murder of her husband, Irene - who was pregnant at the time - retired to [[Hohenstaufen Castle]]. There, two months later on 27 August 1208, she gave birth to another daughter (called Beatrix Posthuma). Both mother and child died shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Ciggaar|1996|p=240}} She was buried in the family mausoleum in the Staufen proprietary monastery of [[Lorch (Württemberg)|Lorch]] Abbey, along with her daughter and sons. Her grave was destroyed and cannot be reconstructed.

==Issue==
Philip and Irene had six children, two sons (Reinald and Frederick) who died in infancy and four daughters:
* [[Beatrice of Swabia|Beatrix]] (April/June 1198 – 11 August 1212), married her father's rival Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] in 1212 and died three weeks later without issue.
* [[Maria of Swabia|Maria]] (3 April 1201 – 29 March 1235), married Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Brabant|Henry, Hereditary Prince of Brabant]] (later Duke Henry II), by whom she had issue.
* [[Kunigunde of Hohenstaufen|Kunigunde]] (February/March 1202 – 13 September 1248), married King [[Wenceslaus I, King of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]], by whom she had issue.
* [[Elisabeth of Swabia|Elisabeth]] (March/May 1205 – 5 November 1235), married King [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], by whom she had issue.

==Legacy==
In his poem on King Philip's [[Magdeburg]] Christmas celebrations, the minnesinger [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] described Irene as ''rose ane dorn, ein tube sunder gallen'' ([[Middle High German]] for "rose without a thorn, a dove without gall").

'''The Jagiełło Oak''' is the most noted of the [[Białowieża Forest]] oaks. The tree was blown down in November 2, 1974, at which time it had a circumference of {{convert|550|cm|in|abbr=on}} at [[Diameter at breast height|breast height]] and a height of {{convert|39|m|ft|abbr=on}}; it had large branches and a well-developed crown.  The fallen trunk can still be seen in the Białowieża [[List of national parks of Poland|National Park]].

King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] is said to have rested beneath the tree before the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410 &amp;ndash; however at its death the tree is thought to have been no more than 450 years old, which would mean it did not begin growing until around 1524.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">'''John Joseph Daverio''' (October 19, 1954 &amp;ndash; March 16, 2003) was a violinist, scholar, teacher and author, best known for his writings on the music of [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms]].

Daverio was born in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]], the only son of Italian-American parents.  He was a professor of music at [[Boston University]]; Daverio received the University's Metcalf Award for Excellence in Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metcalf Awards for Excellence in Teaching: Past Awardees »  Office of the Provost &amp;#124; Boston University|url=http://www.bu.edu/provost/awards-publications/award-opportunities/metcalf/awards-for-excellence-in-teaching/|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daverio died under mysterious circumstances, drowning in the [[Charles River]] at the age of 48. It remains unclear whether his death was accident or suicide, though foul play has been ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing BU Professor Found Dead in Charles River|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V123/N20/20budeath.20n.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have noted an unfortunate irony in the manner of Daverio's death, as Robert Schumann attempted suicide in 1854 by throwing himself into the Rhine river, and Daverio was among the world's leading Schumann scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Beam|first=Alex|title=This theory has a truly tragic overtone|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=April 17, 2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His major works include ''Nineteenth-Century Music and the German Romantic Ideology'' (1993), ''Robert Schumann: Herald of a New Poetic Age'' (1997), and ''Crossing Paths: Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms'' (2002).

He represented Charlottetown in the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]] from 1873 to 1876 and [[Queen's County (electoral district)|Queen's County]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1882 to 1883 and from 1884 to 1887 as a [[Liberal-Conservative]] member.

He was educated at the Central Academy in Charlottetown and at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London, England]].&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt; Jenkins served as a surgeon in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Army during the [[Crimean War]]. He was [[coroner]] and health officer for Charlottetown and married Jessie Esther, the daughter of [[Stephen Rice (politician)|Stephen Rice]] in 1856. His election to the House of Commons in 1882 was declared invalid after an appeal; Jenkins was elected to the same seat in an 1884 by-election after [[Frederick de St Croix Brecken]] resigned his seat to accept an appointment as postmaster for Charlottetown. He was elected to the provincial assembly in [[5th Queens]] in an 1891 by-election held after [[Patrick Blake (Canadian politician)|Patrick Blake]] ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Commons and served until 1893.

Jenkins also raised horses and owned a ranch in Western Canada. He died in Charlottetown at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{cite book|title=Minding the House: A Biographical Guide to Prince Edward Island MLAs|last=Weeks|first=Blair|isbn=1-894838-01-7|year=2002|publisher=Acorn Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khachatur Abovian''' (or '''Abovyan''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the foundation of Khachatur Abovyan's house-museum |url=http://www.abovyanmuseum.am/en/home-museum.html |website=Khachatur Abovyan's house-museum |accessdate=25 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002171233/http://www.abovyanmuseum.am/en/home-museum.html |archivedate= 2 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-hy|Խաչատուր Աբովյան}}; October 15, 1809 is an [[Armenians|Armenian]] writer and national public figure of the early 19th century who mysteriously vanished in 1848 and was eventually presumed dead. He is an educator, poet and an advocate of modernization.&lt;ref name="Pan 143"&gt;Panossian, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Reputed as the father of [[Armenian literature|modern Armenian literature]], he is best remembered for his novel ''[[Wounds of Armenia]]''.&lt;ref name="Ruth"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bedevian|first=Ruth|title=Writer and Patriot: Khachatur Abovyan (sic)|date=December 8, 2004|url=http://www.groong.org/orig/rb-20041208.html|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1841 and published posthumously in 1858, it was the first novel published in the modern [[Armenian language]] using [[Eastern Armenian]] based on the [[Yerevan dialect]] instead of [[Classical Armenian]].&lt;ref name="Pan 143"/&gt;

Abovian was far ahead of his time and virtually none of his works was published during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the [[Armenian SSR]] was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited.&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan et al., p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian is regarded as one of the foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but [[History of Armenia|Armenian history]] at large.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"&gt;[[Robert H. Hewsen|Hewsen, Robert H.]] "The Meliks of Eastern Armenia: IV: The Siwnid Origins of Xac'atur Abovean." ''[[Revue des études Arméniennes]]''. NS: '''XIV''', 1980, pp. 459–468.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian's influence on [[Western Armenian]] literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.&lt;ref&gt;Bardakjian, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Bashinjagyan5.jpg|thumb|left|Painting in 1884 by [[Gevorg Bashinjaghian]] of the house where Abovian was born ]]
Abovian was born in 1809 in the village of [[Qanaqer-Zeytun|Kanaker]], then part of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Nalbandian, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and now a district of [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="Hac 211"&gt;Hacikyan et al., p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian's family were descendants of the Beglaryan ''[[melik]]'' family in [[Gülüstan, Goranboy|Gulistan]], one of five Armenian families who ruled around the current day region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The Abovian family held the position of ''[[tanuter]]'' (a hereditary lordship) in Kanaker; Abovian's uncle was the last ''tanuter'' of Kanaker. His aunt was the wife of Sahak Aghamalian, the last melik of Yerevan at the time of the Russian annexation in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, pp. 153-155.&lt;/ref&gt;  His social origins and descent imbued him at an early age with a sense of responsibility to his people.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; He was born six years after his parents, Avetik and Takuhi, married. He had a brother, Garabed, who died at the age of three.&lt;ref name="Ruth"/&gt;

At age 10, Abovian was taken by his father to [[Echmiadzin]] to study for the priesthood. He dropped out after five years and moved to [[Tiflis]] in 1822 to study [[Armenian studies]] and languages at the [[Nersisyan School]] under the guidance of Harutiun Alamdarian. Abovian graduated in 1826 and began preparing to move to [[Venice]] to further his education. However, the outbreak of the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Russo-Persian War]] (1826–28) curtailed his plans. For the following three years he taught briefly at [[Sanahin]] and then worked for [[Catholicos of Armenia|Catholicos]] [[Yeprem of Armenia]] as his clerk and translator.&lt;ref name="Hac 211"/&gt; While working for the Catholicos, the twenty-year-old Abovian met many notable foreigners, including the diplomat and playwright [[Alexandr Griboyedov]], who was stuck in [[Echmiadzin]] en route to [[Tabriz]] in September 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Abov, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Griboyedov's weekly ''Tifliskiye Vedemosti'' became the first paper to publish an article on Abovian.&lt;ref name="Khach 29"&gt;Khachaturian, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquest of Ararat==
The turning point in Abovian's life was the arrival of [[Friedrich Parrot]] in Armenia in September 1829, a professor of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural philosophy]] from the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] in [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] (in present-day [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]). Parrot traveled to Armenia to climb [[Mount Ararat]] to conduct [[geology|geological studies]] and required a local guide and a translator for the expedition. The Catholicos assigned Abovian to these tasks.&lt;ref name="Hac 211"/&gt; With Abovian's assistance, Parrot became the first explorer in modern times to reach the summit of Mount Ararat. The project received full approval from the emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], who provided the expedition with a military escort.&lt;ref&gt;Parrot, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Parrot.jpg|thumb|Abovian's mentor Friedrich Parrot]]
Abovian and Parrot crossed the [[Arax River]] into the district of [[Surmalinsky Uyezd|Surmali]] and headed to the Armenian village of [[Yenidoğan, Aralık|Akhuri]] situated on the northern slope of Ararat {{convert|4000|ft|m}} above sea level. Following the advice of Harutiun Alamdarian of Tiflis, they set up base camp at the [[Saint Hakob of Akori monastery|Monastery of St. Hakob]] some {{convert|2400|ft|m}} higher, at an elevation of {{convert|6375|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Parrot, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian was one of the last travelers to visit Akhuri and the monastery before a disastrous earthquake completely buried both in May 1840.&lt;ref name="Ketchian"/&gt; Their first attempt to climb the mountain, using the northeast slope, failed as a result of lack of warm clothing.

Six days later, on the advice of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was attempted from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of {{convert|16028|ft|m}}, they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 9, 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Parrot, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north.&lt;ref&gt;Parrot, pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist [[Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich]] climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.&lt;ref name="Ketchian"/&gt;

==The Dorpat years==
[[File:Album von Dorpat, TKM 0031H 05, crop.jpg|thumb|[[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] in the mid-19th century]]
Impressed with Abovian's thirst for knowledge, Parrot arranged for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Bardakjian, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied in the Philosophy faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Khachaturian, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The years in Dorpat were very fruitful for Abovian who studied social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="Hac 211"/&gt; At this time Abovian fell under the influence of [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Panossian, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] who studied with him.&lt;ref&gt;Abov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in [[St. Petersburg]], then married to the Georgian [[Alexander, son of Erekle II of Georgia|Prince Alexander]]. Prior to graduation, Abovian learned his mother Takuhi had died.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt;

==Return to Armenia==
In 1836 he returned home anxious to embark on a mission of enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Hac 212"&gt;Hacikyan et al., p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Abovian's efforts were thwarted as he faced a growing and hostile reaction from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian clergy]] as well as [[Tsarist]] officials, largely stemming from his opposition to [[dogmatism]] and formalism in the school system. Abovian was appointed as the supervisor of the [[Tiflis]] [[uyezd]] school and married a German woman named Emilia Looze (d. 1870) in 1839.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hac 212"/&gt; In 1840 he was approached by English traveler [[Anne Lister]], who was visiting Tiflis. She hoped that Abovian would guide her on another expedition to Mount Ararat which ultimately did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=David|title=Notes and Communications|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=53|issue=1|page=117|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00021303|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=University of London|year=1990|jstor=618973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dismissed from the school in 1843 and was transferred to the uyezd {{Clarify|date=September 2013}} school in Yerevan where he encountered apathy and antagonism from his colleagues and the clergy.&lt;ref name="Hac 212"/&gt;

In the summer of the same year, Abovian was visited by two German travellers. A [[Bavaria]]n professor, [[Moritz Wagner]], from the [[University of Munich]], arrived in May and toured the [[Lake Sevan]] region with Abovian and thereafter corresponded with him on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Guest"&gt;Guest, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In July Abovian also accompanied Wagner on the first recorded ascent of [[Mount Aragats]] in Armenia.&lt;ref name="Ketchian"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ketchian |first=Philip K. |title=Climbing Ararat: Then and Now |journal=[[The Armenian Weekly]] |volume=71 |issue=52 |date=December 24, 2005 |url=http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/fea12240501.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908015245/http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/fea12240501.htm |archivedate=September 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, Abovian escorted the German Baron [[August von Haxthausen]] around the province.&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, pp. xvii-xx.&lt;/ref&gt; They visited the Abovian family home in Kanaker and attended a service at the [[Blue Mosque, Yerevan|Blue Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;Haxthausen, pp. 147-172 and pp. 187-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also visited a [[Yazidi]] encampment where they met the chief Timur Aga and exchanged pleasantries with a rider from [[Ivan Paskevich|Count Paskevich]]'s guard. He became a trusted friend of the Yazidi community in Armenia, and when the chief returned with lavish gifts from a banquet in Tiflis organized by the viceroy of the Caucasus [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov]] in 1844, he organized a tribal feast and Abovian was invited to attend.&lt;ref name="Guest"/&gt; In 1845 he applied for a position at the Catholicate of [[Echmiadzin]] but was not accepted. The following year, he became a contributor to Vorontsov's weekly newspaper, ''Kavkaz'', for which Abovian wrote three articles.&lt;ref name="Khach 29"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
On April 14, 1848, Abovian left his home for an early morning walk, and was never seen again; his disappearance remains unresolved.&lt;ref name="Hac 212"/&gt; His wife Emilia did not report him missing for a month.&lt;ref name="Ruth"/&gt; Their children, Vartan (1840–1896) and Zarmandukht (later known as Adelaide; 1843–1909), were ages eight and five, respectively, at the time of the disappearance.&lt;ref name="Ruth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt;

Numerous theories have been proposed attempting to explain his disappearance: that he committed suicide, was murdered by his Persian or Turkish enemies, or arrested and exiled to [[Siberia]] by the [[Special Corps of Gendarmes]], among others.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; Given his love for his children and their young age, it is generally disregarded that Abovian committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; Writer [[Axel Bakunts]] put forward the theory that Abovian was in Western Europe engulfed in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} O. Melkonyan, ''«Ուշագրավ վկայություն Խաչատուր Աբովյանի առեղծվածային անհայտացման մասին»'' (Remarkable testimony regarding the mysterious disappearance of Khachatur Abovyan), ''«Կրթություն»'' (Education), '''7''' (116), 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Abovian wrote novels, stories, descriptions, plays, scientific and artistic compositions, verses and fables. He was the first Armenian writer to compose literature for children.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Абовян Хачатур (Abovian Khachatur)|encyclopedia="Большая Советская Энциклопедия" ([[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]), 3rd edition|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/60887/%D0%90%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8F%D0%BD|accessdate=2008-07-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wounds of Armenia''===
The historical novel ''[[Wounds of Armenia]]'' (written in 1841, first published in 1858) was the first Armenian secular novel dedicated to the fate of the Armenian people and its struggle for liberation in the period of [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian war of 1826–1828]]. The novel dealt with the suffering of Armenians under Persian occupation.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; The basic concept of the novel was the assertion of feelings of national merit, patriotism and hatred of oppressors. These themes had a profound influence over wide layers of Armenian society. The hero, Agassi, personifies the freedom-loving national spirit and its will to fight against the foreign conquerors. "Give away your life, but never give away your native lands", is his motto.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; The story begins with an abduction of an Armenian girl by a band of thugs sent by the Persian [[sardar]] that triggers an uprising led by Agassi.&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan et al., p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abovian saw in strengthening of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands.&lt;ref name="B137"&gt;Bardakjian, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly with the implementation of ''Polozhenie'' (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the [[Armenian Oblast]] in 1840.&lt;ref name="B137"/&gt; In the novel, elements of [[romanticism]] and [[Literary realism|realism]] are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] retreats.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

===Other works===
Abovian's poetry was filled with satire best expressed in ''The wine jug'', in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. ''Leisure entertainment'' was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work is a collection of fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Bardakjian, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the ''Discovery of America'' and ''Book of Stories''.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of [[Homer]], [[Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], Nikolay Karamzin, [[Ivan Krylov|I. A. Krylov]] and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading ''Introduction to education'' (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel ''History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children'' (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and [[Kurd]]ish folklore.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

Abovian's life is well remembered in Armenia. During the years in which Armenia was under Soviet rule, his pro-Russia stance was emphasized.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Hakobyan, P. ''«Աբովյան»'' (Abovyan). [[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]. vol. i. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1974, pp. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools, streets, boulevards and parks were named after him.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; The village of Elar, located {{convert|10|km|mi}} northeast of Yerevan, was named after him in 1961. Two years later, as the village's population grew larger, [[Abovyan]] was accorded with city status. His home in Kanaker was turned into a house-museum in 1939, and many of his original writings are preserved there.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Anon. ''«Աբովյանի Տուն-թանգարան»'' (Abovyan's House-Museum). ''Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia''. vol. i. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1974, p. 38.&lt;!-- any ISBN number? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The work Abovian accomplished in the field of education was remembered. Yerevan's State [[Pedagogic]] Institute was named after him. On February 28, 1964, a medal was named in his honour (Աբովյանի Անվան Մեդալ) and which was awarded to school teachers who showed exceptional abilities in teaching and education. Between 1948–84, five documentary films were produced in the Armenian SSR about the life and work of Abovian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentaries |publisher=Armenian Association of Film-Critics and Cinema- Journalists |url=http://www.arm-cinema.am/en/documentaries |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505015923/http://www.arm-cinema.am/en/documentaries/ |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 documentary film ''[[Journey to Ararat]]'' on Parrot and Abovian's expedition to Mount Ararat was produced in Estonia by filmmaker [[Riho Västrik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.looduskalender.ee/en/node/11879|title=Nights are long and dark|work=Looduskalender.ee|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ter-Sahakian|first=Karine|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/details/177415/|title=Armenian community of Estonia: A look into the future|work=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was screened at the [[Yerevan International Film Festival|Golden Apricot International Film Festival]] in Yerevan in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Journey to Ararat' Documentary Film|url=http://www.gaiff.am/en/1372752465|work=[[Yerevan International Film Festival|Golden Apricot International Film Festival]]|date=July 2013|access-date=2017-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804012409/http://www.gaiff.am/en/1372752465|archive-date=2017-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statues===
Two prominent statues of Abovian stand in Yerevan. The concept of the first statue dates back to 1908 when a number of Armenian intellectuals in [[Russian Armenia]] decided to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Abovian's disappearance and raise funds for a statue. These included [[Alexander Shirvanzade]],
[[Hovhannes Tumanyan]] and [[Gevorg Bashinjagyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Khanjyan, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910 they had collected enough funds to order the statue. It was designed by M. Grigoryan and sculpted by Andreas Ter-Manukyan in Paris between 1910–13. The statue is {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} high and made of bronze on a granite pedestal. As a result of a misunderstanding the statue was only delivered to Yerevan in 1925 and first erected on Abovian street by the cinema ''Moscow'' in 1933 and then moved to the children's park on the banks of the [[Hrazdan river]]. In 1964, it found its permanent home by the Abovian house-museum in Kanaker.&lt;ref&gt;Khanjyan, pp 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The second statue of Abovian in Yerevan was erected in Abovian square in 1950. The {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} high bronze statue was designed by Gevork Tamanian (son of [[Alexander Tamanian]]) and sculpted by Suren Stepanyan.&lt;ref&gt;Khanjyan, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrait===
Abovian's portrait is one of the most exceptional exhibits of the [[Charents Museum of Literature and Arts|Museum of Literature and Arts after Charents]]. It is an oil painting with a size of {{convert|20.5|cm|in}} by {{convert|27.5|cm|in}}. In 1938 Abovian's grandsons brought it to the museum. When Abovian's son Vardan returned to the Caucasus, he found the painting in a badly deteriorated condition. But by Vardan's request Armenian painter [[Gevorg Bashinjagyan]] restored the portrait. He cut worn-out edges, glued it to a hard paper and then filled the cracks with corresponding colors. The painter of the portrait was Ludwig von Maydell, from Dorpat University. He painted it in the fall of 1830, when Abovian was only 20 or 21 years old. This portrait is the only painting of Abovian made during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatmuseum.am/literature.html Charents Museum of Literature and Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110706072616/http://gatmuseum.am/literature.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111009145059/http://gatmuseum.am/images/abovyan.jpg Original portrait of Abovian]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Levan Abashidze''' ({{lang-ka|ლევან აბაშიძე}}; died December 14, 1757) was a member of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] princely family (''[[tavadi]]'') of [[Abashidze]], prominent in the politics of the [[kingdom of Imereti]] in the 18th century. He was the maternal grandfather of King [[Solomon I of Imereti]], whom he fought and eventually met his death in the battle with Solomon's army at [[Battle of Khresili|Khresili]].

==Rise to power and involvement in civil wars==
Levan Abashidze was a son of [[George VI of Imereti|Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze]], who seized the crown of Imereti in 1702 and was deposed in 1707. Prince Levan rose in prominence early in the reign of the young king [[Alexander V of Imereti]] in the 1720s, when he vied for influence with [[Bezhan Dadiani]], [[Principality of Mingrelia|Prince of Mingrelia]] and the father-in-law of Alexander. During a series of political intrigues and clan feuds plaguing Imereti, in 1726, Levan was dispossessed by Alexander of the fortress of [[Shorapani]], which was then granted to Levan's relative and adversary Zurab Abashidze. After the death of Bezhan in 1728, Levan Abashidze's influence grew and he married off his daughter Tamar to Alexander V as the king's second wife in 1732. Prince Levan fought on the side of Alexander against the powerful party of nobles led by Bezhan's son [[Otia Dadiani]] in a debilitating civil war, but he later fell afoul of his royal son-in-law and the two clashed with their forces in 1745.{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|p=235}}

==Downfall==
After Alexander V's death in 1751, Levan Abashidze opposed the accession of the royal heir, his own grandson [[Solomon I of Imereti|Solomon I]], who was briefly deposed in a coup which was supported even by the king's mother in 1752.{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|p=239}} Once Solomon regained the throne, he forced his mother and grandfather into exile and confiscated the Abashidze estates. In 1757, Levan, together with the influential Georgian grandee [[Rostom, Duke of Racha]], joined an Ottoman army sent against Solomon. The royal army defeated the allies at [[Battle of Khresili|Khresili]], killing Levan Abashidze in battle.{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|p=240}}{{sfn|Lang|1957|p=156}}

The '''Life Events and Difficulties Schedule''' is a psychological measurement of the [[Stress (biology)|stressfulness]] of life events. It was created by [[psychologist]]s George Brown and Tirril Harris in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1978 |title=Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women |location=London |publisher=Tavistock |isbn=0-422-76310-1 |first1=George William |last1=Brown |first2=Tirril |last2=Harris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmAhsL44_60C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of accumulating the stressfulness of different events, as was done in the [[SRRS|Social Readjustment Rating Scale]] by Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe, they looked at individual events in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4 |last1=Holmes |first1=Thomas |last2=Rahe |first2=Richard |year=1967 |title=The Social Readjustment Rating Scale |journal=[[Journal of Psychosomatic Research]] | volume=11 |issue=2 | pages=213–218 |pmid=6059863}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule is made up of an interview by which as much contextual information around the event as possible is collected. The event is then rated by "[[Blind experiment|blind]]" raters using this contextual information.

Critics of this method note the fact that the impact of the independent variable, the event itself, is measured by evaluating it using [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating]] and [[Moderation (statistics)|moderating]] variables.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule proved a powerful instrument to predict changes in neuroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.|author2= Riese, H.|author3= Sanderman, R.|author4= Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009 | doi = 10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 1944, the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] launched a [[Operation Bagration|massive attack against the German forces]] based in [[Belorussia]], which were made up of two strategic [[army group]]s known as [[Army Group Centre]].{{sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=7}} By mid July, Army Group Centre had lost no fewer than 250,000 men in less than a month of fighting, making the German position close to hopeless.{{sfn|Zaloga|1996|pp=6–9}}{{sfn|Housden|2013|p=513}}

In deciding what to do, a series of military conferences were scheduled at the [[Wolf's Lair]] headquarters in [[East Prussia]].{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} On 20 July, [[Adolf Hitler]] and his top military commanders entered the briefing hut of the headquarters, as the usual bombproof room, with no windows and thick walls of solid concrete, was considered "unbearably hot".{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} In attendance was Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], who had lost an eye, his right hand and half his left in action during the [[North Africa]]n theatre.{{sfn|Housden|2013|pp=113}} Undetected by [[Adolf Hitler's bodyguard|Hitler's ring of bodyguards]], Stauffenberg carried a British-made bomb in his briefcase.{{sfn|Housden|2013|pp=115–117}} His plan was to get as close as possible to Hitler, leave the briefcase nearby, and then make an excuse to quickly leave the conference by car with his [[adjutant]] and fellow conspirator [[Werner von Haeften]].{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} This was part of a larger planned [[coup d'état]] led by a group of army officers who were appalled by the way Hitler was leading [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].{{sfn|Moorhouse|2010|p=281}} Everything proceeded according to plan until the bomb exploded, as Stauffenberg walked towards his car, earlier than anticipated.{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} When the explosion tore through the hut, Stauffenberg was thoroughly convinced that no one in the room could possibly have survived.{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} Unbeknownst to Stauffenberg, Colonel [[Heinz Brandt]] had moved the bomb-containing briefcase further away from Hitler, placing it behind a solid wooden table leg, as it was in his way. Hitler survived with only minor injuries,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=29}} as did most of the others present, although three officers, including Brandt, and a stenographer were killed.{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}}

Although strictly against security doctrines imposed at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg and Haeften were allowed to pass through all three checkpoints and proceed to the airport, succeeding in getting away before clarity could be established back at the now completely demolished briefing hut.{{sfn|Martin|Newark|2009}} In the last hours of 20 July, Stauffenberg, Haeften, and several other plotters, were arrested and summarily condemned to death.{{sfn|Isbouts|Schwartz|2008}} The executions were carried out by soldiers under Major [[Otto Remer]] early on the morning of 21 July.{{sfn|Isbouts|Schwartz|2008}}

Following the assassination attempt Hitler came to believe that the [[Wehrmacht]] leadership could not be trusted; he launched a purge of the officer corps and also used the shock of the attack to round up all the surviving members of the old opposition in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Isbouts|Schwartz|2008}} At the same time, those officers who had been injured or killed by the bomb were awarded the [[Wound Badge#Wound Badge of 20 July 1944|20 July Wound Badge]] and hailed as heroes.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=40}} General [[Günther Korten]], General [[Rudolf Schmundt]], Colonel Heinz Brandt and stenographer Heinz Berger were given a state funeral with a [[eulogy]] delivered by Vice-Chancellor [[Hermann Göring]].{{sfn|Isbouts|Schwartz|2008}}

'''''Empire Albany''''' was a 306-ton [[Coastal trading vessel|Coaster]] which was built in 1944. She was renamed ''Albany'' in 1946 and disappeared on a voyage between [[Port Talbot]] and [[Rosslare Harbour|Rosslare]] in 1946.

==History==
''Empire Albany'' was built by Richards Ironworks Ltd, [[Lowestoft]] as yard number 337. She was launched on 3 October 1944 and completed in December 1944. ''Empire Airman'' was owned by the [[Ministry of War Transport]]&lt;ref name=Miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=1166695|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated under the management of the J Fisher &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;ref name=Albany&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=45a0325.pdf |title=NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, ''Empire Albany'' was sold to Mrs P Dowds, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and renamed ''Albany''. On 20 November 1946, ''Albany'' departed Port Talbot bound for Rosslare, but did not arrive.&lt;ref name=Mariner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireA.html |title=Empire-A |publisher=Mariners-L |accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Albany'' was carrying a cargo of coal. Two ship's boats and the name board from ''Albany'' were washed up near [[St David's Head]] on 22 November.&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Mitchell |first1= W H |last2= Sawyer |first2= L A | year = 1995| month = | title = The Empire Ships| pages = 234| publisher = Lloyd's of London Press Ltd| location = London, New York, Hamburg, Hong Kong|isbn=1-85044-275-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official number and code letters==

'''Michael Norgrove''' (9 January 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=531172&amp;cat=boxer|title=Michael Norgrove|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 6 April 2013) was a British professional [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[Woodford Green]], London. Nicknamed the "Zambezi Hitman", at the time of his death Norgrove had an unbeaten professional record. His death occurred several days after he was taken ill during a boxing match in London, and marked the United Kingdom's first post-match boxing fatality of the 21st century. Norgrove's death reopened the debate as to the safety of boxing as a sport.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kabwe]], Norgrove was the son of a British expatriate who worked for [[Zambian Railways]]. The family left Zambia at the end of his father's contract when Norgrove was seven, and moved first to Australia, then later to [[Manchester]] in England.&lt;ref name=Observer-2013-04-06/&gt;

In boxing Norgrove competed at [[light-middleweight]] level, and entered the sport at a relatively late age.&lt;ref name=Observer-2013-04-06/&gt; He was known as the "Zambesi Hitman".&lt;ref name=WorldBoxing-2013-04-06&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/news/2013/04/06/boxer-michael-norgrove-passes-away.html |title=Boxer Michael Norgrove passes away |publisher=World Boxing News |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an amateur he participated in [[white-collar boxing|white-collar fights]] before boxing at London's Repton Club in the East End. There he took part in the [[Amateur Boxing Association of England|Amateur Boxing Association]]'s Novice Championship, winning the London title, and competing nationally in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Len|last= Whaley|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/sport/boxing/former_repton_boxer_michael_norgrove_loses_fight_for_life_1_2013244 |title=Former Repton boxer Michael Norgrove loses fight for life |publisher=Archant|newspaper= Docklands and East London Advertiser |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned professional in 2010.&lt;ref name=Times-2013-04-06&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/boxing/article3733008.ece|title= Boxer Michael Norgrove dies after bout|first= Ron|last= Lewis|newspaper= The Times|publisher= News International|date= 6 April 2013|accessdate= 6 April 2013|format= subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN-2013-04-06&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/sport/story/201137.html# |title=Michael Norgrove passes away |publisher=ESPN UK |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a contemporary and former sparring partner of the one time European [[super-middleweight]] champion [[James DeGale]].&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-04-06&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin |last=Domin |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-2305057/Michael-Norgrove-boxer-dies.html |title=Michael Norgrove boxer dies |newspaper=Daily Mail |publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having successfully fought five bouts, he was taking part in his sixth fight (against Tom Bowen) when he was taken ill. It was his first professional fight following a two-year break.&lt;ref name=WorldBoxing-2013-04-06/&gt; On 28 March 2013 he was competing at the historic Ring venue in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], which was hosting its first professional boxing event for 73 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.boxrec.com/news/2013/michael-norgrove-rushed-hospital |title=Michael Norgrove rushed to hospital |work=BoxRecNews |publisher= |date=28 March 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alistair |last=Kleebauer |url=http://www.london24.com/news/woodford_green_pro_boxer_michael_norgrove_undergoing_treatment_after_being_taken_to_hospital_1_1998864 |title=Woodford Green pro boxer Michael Norgrove undergoing treatment after being taken to hospital |publisher=London24 |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fifth round of a six-round fight, referee Jeff Hinds noticed Norgrove acting strangely and stopped the bout. Norgrove subsequently collapsed, and was treated at the scene before being taken to the [[Royal London Hospital]], where he underwent emergency [[brain surgery]] for a [[cerebral haemorrhage]]. He died nine days later on 6 April following complications.&lt;ref name=Observer-2013-04-06&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin |last=Mitchell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/06/boxer-michael-norgrove-dies |title=Boxer Michael Norgrove dies nine days after collapsing in ring |newspaper=The Observer |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldBoxing-2013-04-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daily-Mail-2013-04-06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22051529 |work=BBC News |title=Boxer Michael Norgrove dies days after ring collapse |publisher=BBC |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.eurosport.com/boxing/michael-norgrove-dies-aged-31_sto3699289/story.shtml |title=Michael Norgrove dies, aged 31 |work=Eurosport Australia |publisher=Au.eurosport |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first post-match death in British boxing to occur in the 21st Century,&lt;ref name=Times-2013-04-06/&gt; the last being Scottish [[bantamweight]] [[James Murray (boxer)|James Murray]] who died in 1995 from head injuries sustained during a fight in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/22057033 |work=BBC Sport |title=Michael Norgrove death: British Boxing Board defends tests |publisher=BBC |date=7 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of Norgrove's final fight was recorded as "no contest", meaning he had an unbeaten record at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Independent02013-04-08&gt;{{cite news|last=Bunce |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/steve-bunce-michael-norgroves-death-is-not-on-boxings-conscience-8563579.html |title=Steve Bunce: Michael Norgrove's death is not on boxing's conscience  |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to death==

Public interest in boxing had experienced an upsurge since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] when Britain won five medals in the sport, and the UK Government's funding body, [[UK Sport]] had increased the amount of finance allocated to it, but Norgrove's death reopened the debate over its safety. Peter McCabe, chief executive of [[Headway Devon|Headway]], a charity that supports people with brain injuries, called for it to be banned. "Every time a boxer gets into the ring, there is a significant risk that they may lose their life or sustain a devastating, life-changing brain injury [...] Until this sport is banned, more young lives will be tragically lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/michael-norgrove-another-death-from-boxing-puts-the-sport-back-in-the-dock-8563578.html |title=Michael Norgrove: Another death from boxing puts the sport back in the dock |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Robert Smith, general secretary of the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] defended the sport's safety procedures. "We are one of the strictest authorities in the world. This is an acute injury, this can happen any time. He had his medicals done, he had his brain scans done. There was nothing there of any concern whatsoever, else he wouldn't have been in the ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/22057033 |work=BBC Spor |title=Michael Norgrove death: British Boxing Board defends tests |publisher=BBC |date=7 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monica Harris, herself a boxer, and a close friend of Norgrove's announced her intention to quit the sport amid concerns for her own safety. "I just don't feel it's right to carry on after this. It [safety] wasn't something I really worried about before. It wasn't an issue. This has just made it real, what we do when we get in the ring. I have a fight on Friday [12 April] which I've been training for since the beginning of the year, and I'm going to make this my last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22059556 |work=BBC News |title=Boxer Michael Norgrove death: Monica Harris to quit ring |publisher=BBC |date=7 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errol Johnson, who trained Tom Bowen, Norgrove's opponent in his final fights, said the boxer had been left devastated by the incident and was considering whether to continue in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/04/08/sedgley-boxers-horror-after-fight-ends-in-tragedy/ |title=Michael Norgrove dies in hospital after bout with Sedgley boxer Tom Bowen |newspaper=Express &amp; Star |publisher=Midland News Association |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', the sports journalist [[Steve Bunce]] expressed incomprehension at the death, but felt it was a tragic accident. "In nearly 30 years I have never been as confused by a boxer's death or injury as I am by Norgrove's [...] Norgrove did nothing wrong, the sport did nothing wrong and there is nothing that could have been done to prevent this death. There is no hidden story attached to this tragedy."&lt;ref name=Independent02013-04-08/&gt;

'''Mos Teutonicus''' (Latin: ''the Germanic custom'') was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.

== Background ==

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.&lt;ref name= Keen&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0300033605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate.

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scäfer |first1=Von Dietrich |last2= |first2= |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |issue=|pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''mos Teutonicus'', meaning ‘the Germanic custom.’{{#tag:ref|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; |group=note}}

English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of ''mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |issue=|pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;  Embalming and ''mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to [[France]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

== Process ==

The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water or wine&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; for several hours.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with [[salt]] in the same manner as animal meat.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

== Prohibition of the practice ==

Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. This probably hindered the research of some anatomists as they feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies but ''[[De Sepulturis]]'' only prohibited the act of ''mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general.

In June 1976, '''Dora Bloch''' ({{Lang-he|דורה בלוך}}), a dual Israeli-British citizen, was a hostage on Air France Flight 139 from [[Tel Aviv]] to Paris, which was hijacked after a stopover in [[Athens]] and rerouted to [[Entebbe]], Uganda. Bloch was taken ill on the plane and was taken to a hospital in [[Kampala]]; she was not rescued with the other hostages during [[Operation Entebbe]], but went missing from the hospital. Her disappearance led to Britain cutting diplomatic ties with Uganda. Her body was discovered in 1979 in a sugar plantation near the capital. In February 2007, declassified British documents confirmed that she was killed on the order of [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-the-fate-of-idi-amins-hijack-victim-436181.html| title= Revealed: the fate of Idi Amin's hijack victim| last=Verkaik| first=Robert| work=[[The Independent]]| year=2007| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/543/265.html|title=כך הורה אידי אמין לרצוח את דורה בלוך|language=Hebrew|trans-title=So Idi Amin Ordered the Murder of Dora Bloch|first=Yael|last=Arava|date=13 February 2007|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dora Feinberg was born in [[Jaffa]], then a part of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and now a part of Israel.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Her father, Joseph Feinberg, was among the founders of the Jewish agricultural settlement of [[Rishon LeZion]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rishonlezion.muni.il/eng/Pages/HistoryofRishonLeZion.aspx|title=History of Rishon LeZion|publisher=[[Rishon LeZion]] Municipality|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father's death, she was raised by an uncle in Egypt. She moved to Jerusalem as an adult. In 1925 she married Aharon Bloch, a naturalised citizen of the United Kingdom, which gave her British citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgbABQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105|title=Operation Thunderbolt: Flight 139 and the Raid on Entebbe Airport, the Most Audacious Hostage Rescue Mission in History|first=Saul|last=David|publisher=Hachette|year=2015|isbn=1444762524|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three sons.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; She spoke Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, German, Italian, and English.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1976/07/15/page/2/article/hostage-auntie-bloch-loved-kids|title=Hostage 'Auntie' Bloch Loved Kids|author=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=15 July 1976|accessdate=5 March 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 she was a grandmother and a widow living in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/7/newsid_2496000/2496095.stm| title= 1976: British grandmother missing in Uganda| work=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On 27 June 1976, Bloch, aged 74,&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; was on Air France Flight 139, an [[Airbus A300]] plane. She was travelling to [[New York City]] for her youngest son Daniel's wedding.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/06/archives/leaders-of-israel-attend-funeral-of-dora-bloch-victim-of-idi-amin.html?_r=0| title= Leaders of Israel Attend Funeral Of Dora Bloch, Victim of Idi Amin| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=6 June 1979| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was hijacked by terrorists after a stopover in Athens and was redirected to [[Entebbe]], Uganda.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; With her fluency in languages, Bloch served as an interpreter between the hostages and hijackers.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Bloch's son, Ilan Hartuv, with whom she had been travelling, was released during the subsequent [[Operation Entebbe]] [[counter-terrorist]] hostage-rescue mission.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Bloch was taken ill on the plane and was transferred to a hospital in Kampala.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; She is believed to have choked on food, and [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] papers say that she was also being treated for [[Venous ulcer|leg ulcers]] while at the hospital.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=SAHO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/cruel-murder-dora-bloch| title= Cruel murder of Dora Bloch| publisher=South African History Online| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her hospital stay, she was visited by [[James Hennessy]], the then-[[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Uganda|High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Uganda]].&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

[[Henry Kyemba]], then Uganda's Minister of Health, said that he had allowed Bloch to stay in hospital for an extra night before being returned to the other hostages.&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/06/19/page/43/article/the-killing-of-dora-bloch| title=The Killing of Dora Bloch| work=Chicago Tribune| date=19 June 1977| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she disappeared from her hospital bed, and on 13 July, [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Ted Rowlands, Baron Rowlands|Ted Rowlands]] said that she was presumed dead.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Kyemba later said that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and murdered by members of the Ugandan Army loyal to [[Idi Amin]]. The policeman guarding Bloch was also killed.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=SAHO/&gt; A suggested motive for her killing was retaliation for the deaths of 50 Ugandan soldiers during Operation Entebbe.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

On 28 July 1976, Britain cut all diplomatic ties with Uganda as a result of Bloch's disappearance. It was the first time in 30 years that Britain had severed ties with a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guuQAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=uk+cuts+diplomatic+ties+with+uganda+1976&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| title= British Foreign Secretaries Since 1974| last=Theakston| first=Kevin| publisher=[[Routledge]]| page=75| date=August 2004| access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery of body==
Bloch's body was discovered in 1979 in a [[sugar plantation]] around {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Kampala]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Visual identification was precluded because her face was badly burned, but the corpse showed signs of a leg ulcer.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Bloch was given an Israeli [[state funeral]]&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://archive.jta.org/1979/06/05/archive/dora-blochs-remains-to-be-buried| title= Dora Bloch's Remains to Be Buried| work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]| date=5 June 1979| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at [[Har HaMenuchot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/30572709/dora-bloch | website=Find a Grave | title=Dora Feinberg Bloch | accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declassified British documents released in February 2007 confirmed that Bloch had been killed on Idi Amin's orders. According to the documents, a Ugandan citizen told the British High Commissioner in Kampala that Bloch had been shot and her body deposited into the trunk of a car with Ugandan intelligence services number plates. The documents also showed that Britain continued to press Amin for information on Bloch's whereabouts, and that Amin continually denied knowledge of her fate.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

'''''Nikolai Dante''''' was a comic book series published in the weekly British [[science fiction]] anthology ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' from March 1997 through July 2012.

==History==

''Nikolai Dante'' was created by writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]].  The lead character, Dante, first appeared in 1997 in Prog 1035, and he made his final appearance in 2012 in Prog 1791.  Fraser was the primary artist for the first three years of the series, with support from artists including [[Charlie Adlard]], [[Henry Flint]], [[Chris Weston]] and [[Andy Clarke (comics)|Andy Clarke]].  From 2000, the majority of the stories were painted by [[John Burns (comics)|John Burns]], until Fraser returned to the character in October 2006, when the two artists began to alternate on different stories. Morrison is now working on a spin off series set in the same universe.&lt;ref&gt;prog 2024 Input section, letter of the week&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the 27th century after a resurgent Imperial Russia has seized control of Earth and an interstellar domain, Dante, a swashbuckling young thief and ladies' man, discovers he is an illegitimate scion of the Romanov Dynasty, aristocratic rivals to the Tsar. Dante's Romanov genes bond him with a sentient "Weapons Crest," a biological weapon which gives superhuman abilities—in Dante's case, the ability to extend bio-blades from his hands and hack into computer systems. He outrages aristocratic society and enjoys a turbulent relationship with Tsarina Jena. Dmitri, the Romanov patriarch and bitter enemy of the Tsar, tries to mold Dante into an aristocrat and killer worthy of the Romanov name.

Dmitri's underhanded political maneuvering prompts his war between the Makarov and Romanov dynasties, despite Jena's and Dante's attempts to prevent it, and the lovers break off their burgeoning romance. The civil war rips the empire apart, and Dante is forced to commit many atrocities. Vladimir triumphs, Dmitri dies by his own hand, and the power of the Romanovs is broken. Dante, now the most wanted man in the empire, returns to thieving, joining his mother, Katarina Dante, and her pirate crew. After spending time in the Pacific, he is forcibly recruited into the Imperial Service.

In his new role as Sword of the Tsar, Dante works against everything he once held dear, though he secretly abuses his position in order to plot against his employer as he begins to build a secret army. A massacre in the oppressed state of Amerika prompts Dante to try to kill the tsar. Imprisoned and tortured, Dante escapes from jail with the help of Jena, and the two renew their relationship and raise an army of thieves and whores to win a revolutionary war against the tsar. Tsar Vladimir is put on trial for his crimes and Dante proposes to Jena. Their happiness is cut short by the return of Dmitri Romanov.

Dmitri embarks on a rampage, murdering several of Dante's close allies, capturing Jena and destroying Dante's weapons crest. He tightens his grip on the empire, planning to marry Jena and execute Vladimir on their wedding day, Dante fights the same war against a different enemy. On the day of Jena's forced wedding to Dmitri, Dante leads his army to a second, final triumph that leaves Dmitri dead and a new era of peace and prosperity set to begin.

==Characters==
* '''Nikolai Dante''' – thief, ladies' man and illegitimate son of Dmitri Romanov.  Dante's mother is Katarina Dante, a feared pirate.  Abandoned at a young age, Dante was forced to survive by turning to crime.  He inadvertently becomes bonded with the weapons crest, intended for Arkady Romanov, which allows Dante to generate bio-blades and provides him with limited regenerative abilities.  The crest is also programmed to educate Dante on the correct manners of a nobleman.

===The Romanovs===

The Romanovs are one of the most powerful dynasties in Russia, descended directly from [[Peter the Great]], and rivalling the Makarovs in influence and military power.  The main sources of the family's power are its "Weapons Crests," [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[Symbiosis|symbiots]] from another dimension, which provide their bearers with incredible powers.  The crests were designed to only bond with the DNA of the Romanov family.

* '''Dmitri Romanov''' – Patriarch of the Romanov dynasty, bitter rival of the tsar, and Dante's father.  He is fanatically devoted to seeing his family regain their rightful place as the masters of the empire.  Possessing a crest that could override the abilities of all others, he apparently commits suicide at the end of the war.  However, he downloads his consciousness into his youngest child, Arkady Romanov, allowing for his dramatic return six years later. He is killed in the final battle when Katrina Dante shoots him twice with the Huntsmans Rifle.
* '''Jocasta Romanov''' – Dmitri's sister and, via [[genetic engineering]], the mother of his legitimate children. These are:
** '''Valentine''' – the "blunt instrument" of the Romanov Dynasty, scarred physically and mentally by his prototype crest.
** '''Konstantin''' – a born leader, his crest generates [[nuclear fusion]] energy.  Although he is believed to have been killed (by Dante) during the Battle of New Moscow, he survives and becomes the [[Lord Protector]]. He is the final Romanov that Dante kills, in a one-on-one fight to the death.
** '''Andreas''' – a womaniser and hellraiser, his crest gives him throwable bio-blades.  Similar in many ways to Dante, he is the closest to a friend Dante has in the Romanov dynasty.
** '''Lulu''' – a seductive vamp and a [[high priest]]ess of the Cadre Infernale.  Her crest creates swarms of vicious demons.  At the end of the civil war, Lulu surrenders to the Imperial forces, but escapes shortly after and begins waging a terrorist campaign against the empire.  She is believed to have been killed by Dante after the war on the orders of Vladimir,&lt;ref&gt;2000AD Prog 1531 – 4 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but later resurfaces as part of Dante's revolutionary army.  After the fall of Vladimir and Dimitri's return, she appears to accept her father's offer of rejoining him&lt;ref&gt;2000AD Prog 1736 – 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by capturing Dante, which is later revealed to be a ruse to get Dante to the heart of the Imperial Palace. She is one of the few Romanovs to survive the saga.
** '''Nastasia''' – a narcissistic sexual predator.  Her crest allows her to spit deadly venom and acids.
** '''Alexandr''' and '''Alexandra''' – twins whose crests allow them to combine into one super-being, as well as produce explosive nano-mines.  They are the first of the Romanovs in the saga to be killed by Dante after they attempt to take his and Jena's lives.
** '''Arkady''' – youngest of Dmitri's sons.  The crest intended for him bonded with Dante instead.  Always the closest to Dmitri, Arkady survives the war and is made a ward of the Imperial Court.  He is later promoted to commander of the Scarlet Wraiths, part of the empire's intelligence agency. It is revealed that before he killed himself Dmitri secretly downloaded his consciousness into Arkady, so he could return six years later. This seems to have transferred Dmitri's Crest and its abilities to him as well.
** '''Viktor''' – a mute, enigmatic loner whose crest transforms him into a Romanov eagle.  Viktor forms a close bond with Dante early on. After Dmitri (as Arkady) murders his wife Galya, he renounces his birthright as a Romanov and, taking the name of Viktor ''Dante'', joins Nikolai on a mission to bring about his father’s downfall. His final act is to abandon his humanity and take eagle form permanently. He only says two words in the whole 15-year series: “Goodbye, Nikolai.” This shows he was mute by choice.

===The Makarovs and their allies===
* '''Tsar Vladimir the Conqueror''' – ruthless ruler of the Russian empire.  Though he hates the Romanovs, he has feelings for Jocasta, and he retains these feelings through their families wars.  When they were younger, Vladimir, Jocasta and Dmitri liberated Russia from Tsar Ivan The Oppressor, who Vladimir strangled to death with his bare hands.  When Vladimir proposes to Jocasta and declares himself the new tsar, Dmitri is angered because he believes only Romanovs have the right to be tsars. Vladimir and Dimitri duel, and Vladimir wins.  Jocasta rejects his proposal, recognising Vladimir's cruelty whilst he humiliated her brother, and says they can never be together.  Vladimir is proud of his daughters, but acts with cruelty towards them when they are young to show them what they must do when they are rulers.
* '''Tsarina Eugenia (Jena) Vladimirovna Makarova'''&lt;ref&gt;2000AD Prog 1537 – 16 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; – the tsar's eldest daughter and Dante's on again-off again love interest.  She has a love-hate relationship with Dante, kissing him then hating him for cheating on her.
* '''Lady Juliana Makarov''' – the tsar's younger daughter.  When she is killed by Konstantin Romanov, her death starts the civil war.
* '''Count Pyre''' – shape-changing alien, Lord Protector of the tsar and commander of the Scarlet Wraiths. Killed by Dante and replaced by Arkady and Konstantin Romanov.
* '''The Lord Protector''' – a mysterious armoured warrior who serves the tsar, he kills several members of the Romanovs.  The Lord Protector reveals himself to be Konstantin Romanov, joining Tsar Vladimir The Conqueror to get his revenge when Dante tries to kill him.
* '''Mikhal Deriabin''' – head of the House of Bolshoi.  He intended to marry Jena in a marriage arranged by her father, Tsar Vladimir the Conqueror.  He secretly conspired with Sir Richard Hawksmoor (former tsarist warrior) to kidnap Princess Jena and start a civil war between Tsar Vladimir the Conqueror and the Romanovs so they could take power when the war was over. Unfortunately for both of them, Princess Jena's bodyguard was Nikolai Dante.
* '''The Arbatov family''' – male members of the family always seem to be on the wrong end of Dante's escapades.

===The Rudinshtein Irregulars===

During the war, Dante is given command of a regiment raised in his own [[fief]]dom, Rudinshtein.  Initially made up of regular soldiers, the regiment is eventually supplemented by troops drawn from [[penal military unit]]s.
* '''Sergeant Elena Kurakin''' – half Russian, half Mongolian swordswoman, she was imprisoned for killing her superior officer for cowardice.  Following the war, she is captured by the tsar and sent to a [[gulag]], where she is later freed by Dante, who makes her his bodyguard.
* '''Lord Peter Flintlock''' – a former British officer and a somewhat foppish coward.  He survives the war and later (along with Spatchcock) joins Dante's pirate crew. Killed in the final battle.
* '''Private Yuri Spatchcock''' – described as the filthiest man in the empire due to his complete lack of personal hygiene and lack of trustworthiness. Survives the final battle and lands somewhat on his feet, embarking on a whirlwind romance with Lady Felicity Flintlock, wild child of London Town and sister of his late friend Lord Peter, and making off with a sizeable proportion of the Flintlock family valuables.
* '''The Grozny Gang''' – a family of violent criminals who are drafted into the Irregulars.
** '''Boris Grozny''' – eldest member and leader of the gang. 
** '''Foma "the Coma" Grozny''' – a fragment of metal in his brain makes him impervious to pain.
** '''Ursa Grozny''' – the only female in the gang.

===Other recurring characters===
* '''Katarina Dante''' – pirate queen and Dante's mother.
* '''The Countessa de Wynter''' – a beautiful and manipulative con-artist.  She first meets Dante when he is trying to rob the Hotel Yalta and she manages to steal the jewels from him, after which they pull a heist on the Church of the [[Skoptsy]].  She cheats him out of the jewels from "the Romanov Job" then, years later, she hires the Solnkin Assassin Society to start a war between Tsar Vladimir the Conqueror and Papa Yeltsin so she can take over Yeltsin's criminal empire and New Moscow.
* '''Eloise de Janissaire''' – the leader of the mercenary Warlords and Dante's wife.
* '''Akita Sagawa''' – a [[Yakuza|Japanese Yakuza]] leader. Killed by The Kraken.
* '''The Kraken''' – the leader of the Pacific Rievers, killed by the Lord Protector.
* '''Alexander "Papa" Yeltsin''' – the leader of the criminal elements in New Moscow.
* '''Lauren Stone''' – Dante's childhood sweetheart (though Dante describes her as "more like the girl next ship").
* '''Henry Winsdor Mckray''' – The legendary "Mad King" of [[Britannia]] and close friend of Nikolai Dante.  He believes Nikolai is an attractive woman.
* '''Major Liberty''' – the leader of the Amerikan rebels in Imperial-occupied Russia.

===Other characters and imperial factions===
* '''The White Army''' and '''the Red Guard''' – warring factions from a parallel dimension, the White Army created the Weapons Crest technology, while the Red Guard fight to preserve their humanity.  In ''Sword of the Tsar'', the White Army has begun inserting themselves into Dante's dimension.  Their agents claim to have defeated the Red Guard.
* '''Sir Richard Hawksmoore''' – former Tsarist warrior turned mercenary, obsessed with Jena Makarov.  He secretly conspires with Mikhail Deriabin to kidnap Jena and start a civil war between Tsar Vladimir the Conqueror and the Romanovs so they can take power when the war is over.  Unfortunately for both of them, Dante goes as Jena's personal bodyguard.
* '''Major Elizabeth Hawksmoore'''- daughter of Sir Richard Hawksmoore.  She is arrested after she kills a member of the Arbatov family, but Arkady Romanov makes her head of the Order of the Dragon, the greatest strike force in the empire.
* '''Captain Luther Emmanuel''' – former agent of Britannia Intelligence and member of the Cadre Infernale.  A powerful [[psionics|psionic]], he uses his abilities both to interrogate prisoners and swindle casinos.  After the war, he supports Lulu Romanov's terror campaign before being captured and killed by the Lord Protector.&lt;ref&gt;2000AD Prog 1528 – 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jim Di Grisov''' – Legendary con artist, thief and tutor of Nikolai Dante in the thieves' world.  His name is an homage to [[The Stainless Steel Rat]], Slippery Jim DiGriz.

In February 2017 a one off new story was published (set during the series early years) in the comic's 40th anniversary special issue:
* "Devil May Care" (with Simon Fraser)

==Cultural references==
* In ''The Great Game'' we are introduced to Agent Kaine, a parody of [[Harry Palmer]] as played by [[Michael Caine]].  This is not the first time 2000ad has parodied Michael Caine; in [[Bix Barton]] the eponymous hero had a sentient walking stick as a companion called Michael Cane.
* In ''The Hunting Party'', [[Sinister Dexter]] and [[Sláine (comics)|Slaine]] appear as thinly disguised parodies.
* In ''The Romanov Job'', there are cameo appearances by thinly disguised characters from other comics including:
** [[The Spider (comic)|The Spider]] – "Abel Ganz, The Tarantula, Anarchist, Assassin and all-round master criminal"
** [[Janus Stark]] – "Janos Starak, escapologist extraordinaire"
** [[Catwoman]] – "Selina Solaris, The Panther"
** [[Absorbing Man|Crusher Creel]] – "Grushko Kreel"
** [[The Adventures of Luther Arkwright|Luther Arkwright]] – Captain Luther Emmanuel
* [[Captain America]] is lampshaded in the story ''Amerika'', projectile shield and all, by the character Major Liberty. This instalment of the Dante saga also references NBA team the [[New Jersey Nets]] before their move to Brooklyn. The pre-Brooklyn logo is featured on the front of the President Shawn C Carter Memorial Stadium - itself a reference to the rapper [[Jay-Z]], who owned a stake in both the team and its arena at the time; both have since been sold on to other parties.

==Other media==

===Novels===
A number of Nikolai Dante novels have been written by [[David Bishop]] and published by [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]].  Each is a new Dante story, set in between events depicted by the comic serials.  The first novel, "The Strangelove Gambit," details Dante's misadventures as a tutor in a boarding school for young ladies that hides a deadly secret.  In the second, "Imperial Black," Dante is forced to seek out an ancient [[citadel]] on the roof of the world.  The final Dante novel to date, "Honour Be Damned," is a romp set in future Britain that spoofs "The 39 Steps".  All of the novels are currently out of print, but [[E-book]] editions are available.

So far they include:

* ''From Russia with Lust: The Nikolai Dante Omnibus'' (672 pages, March 2007, {{ISBN|1-84416-454-3}}):
** ''The Strangelove Gambit'' (January 2005, {{ISBN|1-84416-139-0}})
** ''Imperial Black'' (August 2005, {{ISBN|1-84416-180-3}})

The comma is omitted on the authority of section 14(3)(a) of the [[Interpretation Act 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; is an Act of the [[Oireachtas]] which virtually codified the criminal law on [[offences against the person]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The Act replaced the greater part of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], scrapping such concepts as [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]], and recognised the use of modern technology as a weapon:

:'''"force" includes...application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy''' -Section 2.2(a)

The Act also made it an offence to use a syringe as a weapon, particularly where it is used to make the victim "...believe that he or she may become infected with disease".

'''''Paleoworld''''' is an American [[documentary television series]] that aired on [[The Learning Channel]] from 1994 to 1997. The series focuses on [[paleontology]] and comprised 50 half-hour episodes. It was the first  television series dedicated to paleontology that spanned multiple seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentaries on Prehistoric Life|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls059575825/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is now owned by the [[Discovery Channel]], along with other documentaries such as ''[[Beyond T. rex]]'' (1997), ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'' (2001), ''[[Valley of the T. rex]]'' (2001), and ''[[Dinosaur Planet (TV series)|Dinosaur Planet]]'' (2003).

==Spin-off==

''Paleoworld'' never returned for a fifth season. However, TLC released a new series about dinosaurs the following year (1998) as a spin-off to the series, ''When Dinosaurs Ruled'' (called ''Jurassica'' in some countries).

==Reception==

Season 1 (1994) featured a smooth style and was narrated by [[Ben Gazzara]]. This series had lots of musical scenes, and some consider it to be an extremely calm and relaxing show. It also uses much more Paleoart than later series. Season 2 (1995) and Season 3 (1996) lost the musical element (as well as changing narrators), which resulted in a more conventional-style nature documentary. Even so, Seasons 2 and 3 were still perceived as maintaining the quality standard. For Season 4 (1997), the series changed narrators again, and viewers felt the show suffered a drop in quality, shifting from being musical and calm, to full-on and repetitive. Consequently, Season 4 was cancelled mid-season. The show never returned for a fifth season.

==Release==

Many [[DVD]]s and [[VHS]] tapes have been made with episodes from the series; however, most have been discontinued and are no longer available to purchase. Three DVDs of ''Paleoworld'' with five episodes on each were released in [[Australia]] in 2002, and 
a five-disc set with 15 episodes from the series was released in the US and Canada. The three-disc set was also re-released in 2010.

'''Passive-aggressive behavior''' is characterized by indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Passive–aggressive|title=Passive–aggressive {{!}} Definition of Passive–aggressive|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality disorder==
{{main|Passive-aggressive personality disorder}}
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] [[DSM-IV|revision IV (DSM-IV)]] describes [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] as a "pervasive pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for adequate performance in social and occupational situations."

Passive-aggressiveness may not be necessarily a [[personality disorder]]. Personality disorder includes deviation in affectivity, cognition, control over impulses and need for gratification, ways of perceiving and thinking, and inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional behaviour. There must be [[personal distress]] attributable to such behaviour. Deviation must be stable and of long duration.

==Concept in different areas==

===Psychology===
In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors as procrastination, [[forgetfulness]], and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by [[authority figure]]s, but it can also occur in [[interpersonal]] contexts.&lt;ref name=dsmiv734&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatic Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0890420629|pages=733–734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: "a personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. Behaviors: learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Passive–aggressive%20personality%20disorder-diagnostic%20criteria|title=Passive–aggressive personality disorder-diagnostic criteria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of passive-aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, "playing the victim", feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellor-articles/what-is-Passive–aggressive-behaviour|title=What is Passive Aggressive Behaviour?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/Passive–aggressive-diaries/201011/10-things-Passive–aggressive-people-say|title=10 Things Passive–aggressive People Say|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
In [[conflict theory]], passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as [[wiktionary:catty|catty]], as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Simon|first=George|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People|year=2010|publisher=Parkhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. In the ad for Warner's online ebook, it says: "The worst case of passive-aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency." {{fact|date=February 2018}} If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harms | first = Kimberly A. | title = Passive Aggressive Behaviour in the Dental Office | edition = 3 |date=May–June 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says, "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Angelis | first = Paula | title = Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive–aggressive Leadership in the Workplace | page = 3 | year = 2009 | isbn = 1442159200 |publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Passive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel [[William Menninger]] during [[World War II]] in the context of men's reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their aggressiveness "by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" due to what Menninger saw as an "immaturity" and a reaction to "routine military stress".&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Citation|last = Lane | first=C |title=The Surprising History of Passive–aggressive Personality Disorder|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi= 10.1177/0959354308101419| format = [[PDF]] | url = https://sites.northwestern.edu/christopher-lane/files/2016/08/lanedocpapd2009-24w8s9n.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

'''Peter Adolphus McIntyre''' (July 19, 1840 &amp;ndash; July 16, 1910) was a Canadian politician, public servant, physician and [[coroner]].&lt;ref name=LG&gt;[http://www.gov.pe.ca/olg/gallery/picture_setup.php?lg=20McIntyre Prince Edward Island:Lieutenant Governors Gallery:Peter Adolphus McIntyre], Government of Prince Edward Island, accessed December 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parl&gt;{{Canadian Parliament links|ID=9961|nolist=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at Peterville in [[Kings County, Prince Edward Island|Kings County]], [[Prince Edward Island]], McIntyre's paternal grandfather came to Canada from [[Scotland]] around 1785 and settled at [[Cable Head, Prince Edward Island|Cable Head]], PEI. McIntyre's great-grandfather on his mother's side fought under [[General Wolfe]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759.&lt;ref name=LG /&gt;

McIntyre was educated at the [[Quebec Seminary]], [[Laval University]] and [[McGill University]] where he earned his medical degree in 1867. He returned to Prince Edward Island to begin his practice. He served as Kings County coroner for several years.&lt;ref name=LG /&gt;

In 1872 he was appointed one of the commissioners overlooking the construction of the [[Prince Edward Island Railway]] and was railway commander.&lt;ref name=LG /&gt;

Following Prince Edward Island's entry into [[Canadian confederation]] which occurred, in part, as a result of the debt incurred by the colony for the railway's construction, McIntyre was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1874|1874 federal election]] to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for Kings County. He was defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 federal election]] but regained his seat in [[Canadian federal election, 1882|1882]] and was re-elected in [[Canadian federal election, 1887|1887]].&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; After being defeated in the next two elections,&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;  McIntyre was appointed the [[List of lieutenant governors of Prince Edward Island#Lieutenant Governors of Prince Edward Island, 1873-present|seventh]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island]] by the [[Wilfrid Laurier|Laurier]] government in 1899. He served in office until 1904 and died six years later in Souris, P.E.I.&lt;ref name=LG /&gt;

'''Plant reproduction''' is the production of new individuals or [[offspring]] in [[plant]]s, which can be accomplished by sexual or [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] reproduction. [[Sexual reproduction]] produces offspring by the fusion of [[gamete]]s, resulting in offspring genetically different from the parent or parents. Asexual reproduction produces new individuals without the fusion of gametes, genetically identical to the parent plants and each other, except when [[mutations]] occur. In [[seed plant]]s, the offspring can be packaged in a protective [[seed]], which is used as an agent of dispersal.

== Asexual reproduction ==
{{See also|Asexual reproduction}}
Reproduction in which male and female gametes do not fuse, as they do in sexual reproduction.
Asexual reproduction may occur through [[budding]], [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], [[fission (biology)|fission]], [[spore formation]] and [[vegetative propagation]]. Plants have two main types of asexual reproduction in which new plants are produced that are genetically identical [[cloning|clone]]s of the parent individual. '''Vegetative''' reproduction invoves 
a vegetative piece of the original plant (budding, [[Tiller (botany)|tillering]], etc.) and is distinguished from ''[[apomixis]]'', which is a replacement for sexual reproduction, and in some cases involves seeds. Apomixis occurs in many plant species and also in some non-plant organisms. For apomixis and similar processes in non-plant organisms, see [[parthenogenesis]].

Natural '''vegetative''' reproduction is mostly a [[Biological process|process]] found in [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and [[wood]]y [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the [[Plant stem|stem]] or [[root]]s and in a few species [[leaf|leaves]]. Most plant species that employ vegetative reproduction do so as a means to perennialize the plants, allowing them to survive from one season to the next and often facilitating their expansion in size. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals constitutes a [[clonal colony]];  a single [[ramet]], or apparent individual, of a clonal colony is genetically identical to all others in the same colony. The distance that a plant can move during vegetative reproduction is limited, though some plants can produce ramets from branching rhizomes or stolons that cover a wide area, often in only a few growing seasons. In a sense, this process is not one of '''reproduction''' but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual [[organism]] increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called '''vegetative growth'''. However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic.  A major disadvantage to vegetative reproduction, is the transmission of pathogens from parent to offspring; it is uncommon for pathogens to be transmitted from the plant to its seeds (in sexual reproduction or in apomixis), though there are occasions when it occurs.&lt;ref name="plant_resistance_to_herbivores_and_pathogens"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fritz | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Simms | first2 = Ellen Louise | title = Plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens: ecology, evolution, and genetics | year = 1992 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago  | isbn = 978-0-226-26554-4 | pages = 359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeds generated by '''apomixis''' are a means of asexual reproduction, involving the formation and dispersal of seeds that do not originate from the fertilization of the [[embryo#Embryos of plants and animals|embryos]]. [[Hawkweed]] (''Hieracium''), [[dandelion]] (''Taraxacum''), some [[Citrus]] (''Citrus'') and [[Kentucky blue grass]] (''Poa pratensis'') all use this form of asexual reproduction. [[Pseudogamy]] occurs in some plants that have apomictic seeds, where pollination is often needed to initiate embryo growth, though the pollen contributes no genetic material to the developing offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/29781/why_apomixis_genetic_gold |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026234030/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/29781/why_apomixis_genetic_gold |archivedate=2009-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of apomixis occur in plants also, including the generation of a [[plantlet]] in replacement of a seed or the generation of [[bulbil]]s instead of flowers, where new cloned individuals are produced. Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction where the offspring comes from one parent only, thus, inheriting the characteristics of the parent.

=== Structures ===

A '''[[rhizome]]''' is a modified underground stem serving as an organ of vegetative reproduction; the growing tips of the rhizome can separate as new plants, e.g., [[polypody]], [[Iris (plant)|iris]], [[couch grass]] and [[Urtica|nettles]].

Prostrate aerial stems, called '''runners''' or '''[[stolon]]s''', are important vegetative reproduction organs in some species, such as the [[strawberry]], numerous [[Poaceae|grasses]], and some [[fern]]s.

'''[[Adventitious]]''' buds form on roots near the ground surface, on damaged stems (as on the stumps of cut trees), or on old roots. These develop into above-ground stems and leaves. A form of budding called '''[[Basal shoot|suckering]]''' is the reproduction or [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of a plant by shoots that arise from an existing [[root system]]. Species that characteristically produce suckers include [[Elm]] (''Ulmus''), [[Dandelion]] (''Taraxacum''), and many members of the [[Rose]] family such as ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' and ''[[Rubus]]''.

Plants like [[onion]] (''Allium cepa''), [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]] (''Hyacinth''), [[Narcissus (genus)|narcissus]] (''Narcissus'') and [[tulip]]s (''Tulipa'') reproduce by dividing their underground [[bulb]]s into more bulbs. Other plants like [[potato]]es (''Solanum tuberosum'') and [[dahlia]] (''Dahlia'') reproduce by a similar method involving underground [[tuber]]s. [[Gladiolus|Gladioli]] and [[crocus]]es (''Crocus'') reproduce in a similar way with [[corm]]s.

=== Usage ===

The most common form of plant reproduction utilized by people is seeds, but a number of asexual methods are utilized which are usually enhancements of natural processes, including: cutting, grafting, budding, [[layering]], division, sectioning of rhizomes, roots, tubers, bulbs, stolons, tillers, etc., and artificial propagation by laboratory [[Plant tissue culture|tissue cloning]]. Asexual methods are most often used to propagate [[cultivar]]s with individual desirable characteristics that do not come true from seed.&lt;ref name="introduction_to_plant_science_a01"&gt;{{Cite book  | title = Introduction To Plant Science | date =  | publisher = Delmar Thomson Learning | location =  | isbn = 978-1-4018-4188-1 | pages = 296  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fruit tree propagation]] is frequently performed by budding or grafting desirable cultivars ([[cloning|clone]]s), onto [[rootstock]]s that are also clones, propagated by [[stool bed|stooling]].

In horticulture, a "cutting" is a branch that has been cut off from a mother [[plant]] below an [[internodes|internode]] and then rooted, often with the help of a [[rooting powder|rooting liquid or powder]] containing [[plant hormone|hormones]]. When a full root has formed and leaves begin to sprout anew, the clone is a self-sufficient plant,&lt;ref name="rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees"&gt;{{Cite book  | title = Rooting cuttings of tropical trees | year = 1993 | publisher = Commonwealth Science Council | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-85092-394-0 | pages = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; genetically identical to the mother plant.

Examples include cuttings from the stems of [[Blackberry|blackberries]] (''Rubus occidentalis''), [[African violet]]s (''Saintpaulia''), [[Vervain|verbena]]s (''Verbena'') to produce new plants. A related use of cuttings is [[grafting]], where a stem or bud is joined onto a different stem. [[Nursery (horticulture)|Nurseries]] offer for sale trees with grafted stems that can produce four or more varieties of related fruits, including [[apple]]s. The most common usage of grafting is the propagation of cultivars onto already rooted plants, sometimes the rootstock is used to dwarf the plants or protect them from root damaging [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref name="introductory_horticulture_a04"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Reiley | first1 = H. Edward | last2 = Shry | first2 = Carroll L. | title = Introductory horticulture | year = 2004 | publisher = Delmar/Thomson Learning | location = Albany, NY  | isbn = 978-0-7668-1567-4 | pages = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since vegetatively propagated plants are clones, they are important tools in plant research. When a clone is grown in various conditions, differences in growth can be ascribed to environmental effects instead of genetic differences.&lt;ref name="rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees"/&gt;

== Sexual reproduction ==
{{main|Sexual reproduction of plants}}
{{Sex (biology) sidebar}}
Sexual reproduction involves two fundamental processes: [[meiosis]], which rearranges the [[gene]]s and reduces the number of [[chromosome]]s, and [[fertilisation|fertilization]], which restores the chromosome to a complete [[diploid]] number. In between these two processes, different types of [[plant]]s and [[algae]] vary, but many of them, including all [[Embryophyte|land plants]], undergo [[alternation of generations]], with two different multicellular structures (phases), a gametophyte and a sporophyte. The evolutionary origin and adaptive significance of sexual reproduction are discussed in the pages “[[Evolution of sexual reproduction]]” and “[[Origin and function of meiosis]].”

The gametophyte is the multicellular structure (plant) that is [[haploid]], containing a single set of [[chromosome]]s in each cell. The gametophyte produces male or female [[gamete]]s (or both), by a process of cell division called [[meiosis]]. In vascular plants with separate gametophytes, female gametophytes are known as mega gametophytes (mega=large, they produce the large egg cells) and the male gametophytes are called micro gametophytes (micro=small, they produce the small sperm cells).

The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilization) produces a [[diploid]] [[zygote]], which develops by mitotic cell divisions into a multicellular [[sporophyte]].

The mature sporophyte produces [[spore]]s by [[meiosis]], sometimes referred to as "[[reduction division]]" because the chromosome pairs are separated once again to form single sets.

In mosses and liverworts the gametophyte is relatively large, and the sporophyte is a much smaller structure that is never separated from the gametophyte. In [[fern]]s, [[gymnosperm]]s, and [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms), the gametophytes are relatively small and the sporophyte is much larger. In gymnosperms and flowering plants the mega gametophyte is contained within the [[ovule]] (that may develop into a seed) and the micro gametophyte is contained within a [[pollen]] grain.

== History of sexual reproduction of plants ==
{{main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

Unlike animals, plants are immobile, and cannot seek out sexual partners for reproduction. In the evolution of early plants, abiotic means, including water and wind, transported [[sperm]] for reproduction. The first plants were [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], as described in the page "[[Evolutionary history of plants]]", and released sperm freely into the water to be carried with the currents. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. As taller and more complex plants evolved,  modifications in the [[alternation of generations]] evolved; in the [[Paleozoic]] era [[progymnosperm]]s reproduced by using spores dispersed on the wind. The seed plants including [[seed fern]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[cordaites]], which were all [[gymnosperm]]s, evolved 350 million years ago; they had pollen grains that contained the male [[gametes]] for protection of the sperm during the process of transfer from the male to female parts. It is believed that insects fed on the pollen, and plants thus evolved to use [[insect]]s to actively carry pollen from one plant to the next. Seed producing plants, which include the angiosperms and the gymnosperms, have heteromorphic alternation of generations with large sporophytes containing much reduced gametophytes.  Angiosperms have distinctive reproductive organs called flowers, with [[carpel]]s, and the female gametophyte is greatly reduced to a female embryo sac, with as few as eight cells. The male gametophyte consists of the pollen grains. The sperm of seed plants are non-motile, except for two older groups of plants, the [[Cycadophyta]] and the [[Ginkgophyta]], which have flagellated sperm.

=== Flowering plants ===

[[Flowering plant]]s are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce by sexual and asexual means. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers. Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the production of male and female [[gamete]]s, the transfer of the male gametes to the female ovules in a process called [[pollination]].  After pollination occurs, [[fertilization]] happens and the ovules grow into seeds within a [[fruit]].  After the seeds are ready for [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], the fruit ripens and by various means the seeds are freed from the fruit and after varying amounts of time and under specific conditions the seeds [[germinate]] and grow into the next generation.

The [[Stamen|anther]] produces male [[gametophyte]]s which are [[pollen|pollen grains]], which attach to the stigma on top of a [[carpel]], in which the female gametophytes (inside ovules) are located. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the sperm from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and central cell within the female gametophyte in a process termed [[double fertilization]]. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus a binucleate female cell) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a [[fruit]], which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]] or [[pollination|cross-pollinate]].

==== Pollination ====
[[File:Orchidflower3.jpg|right|thumb|An orchid flower]]

In plants that use insects or other animals to move pollen from one flower to the next, plants have developed greatly modified flower parts to attract pollinators and to facilitate the movement of pollen from one flower to the insect and from the insect back to the next flower. Flowers of wind pollinated plants tend to lack petals and or sepals; typically large amounts of pollen are produced and pollination often occurs early in the growing season before leaves can interfere with the dispersal of the pollen. Many trees and all grasses and sedges are wind pollinated, as such they have no need for large fancy flowers.

Plants have a number of different means to attract pollinators including colour, scent, heat, nectar glands, edible pollen and flower shape. Along with modifications involving the above structures two other conditions play a very important role in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants, the first is timing of flowering and the other is the size or number of flowers produced. Often plant species have a few large, very showy flowers while others produce many small flowers, often flowers are collected together into large inflorescences to maximize their visual effect, becoming more noticeable to passing pollinators. Flowers are attraction strategies and sexual expressions are functional strategies used to produce the next generation of plants, with pollinators and plants having co-evolved, often to some extraordinary degrees, very often rendering mutual benefit.
[[Image:Telekiaflowers.jpg|right|thumb| Flower heads showing disk and ray florets.]]
The largest family of flowering plants is the orchids ([[Orchidaceae]]), estimated by some specialists to include up to 35,000 species,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=10638 Orchidaceae in Flora of North America @ efloras.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which often have highly specialized flowers that attract particular insects for pollination. The stamens are modified to produce pollen in clusters called [[pollinium|pollinia]], which become attached to insects that crawl into the flower. The flower shapes may force insects to pass by the pollen, which is "glued" to the insect. Some orchids are even more highly specialized, with flower shapes that mimic the shape of insects to attract them to 'mate' with the flowers, a few even have scents that mimic insect [[pheromone]]s.

Another large group of flowering plants is the [[Asteraceae]] or sunflower family with close to 22,000 species,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=10074 Asteraceae in Flora of North America @ efloras.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which also have highly modified inflorescences that are flowers collected together in heads composed of a composite of individual flowers called florets.  Heads with florets of one sex, when the flowers are pistillate or functionally staminate, or made up of all bisexual florets, are called homogamous and can include discoid and liguliflorous type heads.  Some radiate heads may be homogamous too.  Plants with heads that have florets of two or more sexual forms are called heterogamous and include radiate and disciform head forms, though some radiate heads may be heterogamous too.

=== Ferns ===

Ferns typically produce large diploid [[sporophyte]]s with [[rhizome]]s, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called [[sporangium]], [[spore]]s are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or [[thallus]], produce both motile sperm in the [[antheridia]] and egg cells in separate [[archegonia]]. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the antheridia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A [[zygote]] is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporophyte and gametophyte plants is call [[alternation of generation]]s. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the  ''[[Psilotum]]'', ''[[Lycopodium]]'', ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Equisetum]]''.

=== Bryophytes ===
{{Main|Alternation of generations|Bryophyte life cycle|}}
The [[bryophyte]]s, which include [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es, reproduce both sexually and [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]]. The gametophyte is the most commonly known phase of the plant. All are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with [[flagella]] and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antheridia respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells, thus producing zygotes that are diploid. The zygote divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid. The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called [[Sporangium|spore capsules]]. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, and when ripe, the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. In some species each gametophyte is one sex while other species produce both antheridia and archegonia on the same gametophyte which is thus hermaphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;Lovett Doust, Jon, and Lesley Lovett Doust. 1988.

'''Reproductive value''' (not to be confused with [[breeding value]]) is a concept in [[demography]] and [[population genetics]] that represents the discounted number of future female children that will be born to a woman of a specific age. [[Ronald Fisher]] first defined reproductive value in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' where he proposed that future [[offspring]] be discounted at the rate of growth of the population; this implies that [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproductive]] value measures the contribution of an individual of a given age to the future growth of the [[population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=16791649 | doi=10.1007/s00285-006-0376-4 | volume=53 | title=A theory of Fisher's reproductive value | year=2006 | journal=J Math Biol | pages=15–60 | last1 = Grafen | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/188/4/953.full The Relation Between Reproductive Value and Genetic Contribution Published by the Genetics journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consider a [[species]] with a [[life table|life history table]] with survival and reproductive parameters given by &lt;math&gt;\ell_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_x&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;\ell_x&lt;/math&gt; = probability of surviving from age 0 to age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;m_x&lt;/math&gt; = average number of offspring produced by an individual of age &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

In a population with a discrete set of age classes, Fisher's reproductive value is calculated as
: &lt;math&gt; v_x = \sum_{y=x}^{\infty} \lambda^{-(y-x+1)} \frac{\ell_{y}}{\ell_{x}} m_{y}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the long-term population growth rate given by the dominant [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Leslie matrix]]. When age classes are continuous, 
: &lt;math&gt; v(x) = \int_{x}^{\infty} e^{-r(y-x)} \frac{\ell(y)}{\ell(x)} m(y) dy&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the ''intrinsic rate of increase'' or ''[[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] growth rate''.

The '''self-perceived quality-of-life scale'''&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2008, August). ''Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development''. Presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2009). ''What constitutes happiness? Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development''. Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM. https://www.amazon.com/constitutes-happiness-Self-perceived-quality-scale/dp/3639207165&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological assessment instrument which is based on a comprehensive theory of the self-perceived quality of life (SPQL)&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2007, August). Enhancing ''the quality rather than intensity of subjective well-being.'' Presentation at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt; and provides a multi-faceted measurement of health-related and non-health-related aspects of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenberg, E. C. (2008). Self-perceived quality of life scale: Theoretical framework and development ([[Thesis|Doctoral dissertation]], [[Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]], Palo Alto, CA). ''Dissertation Abstracts International, 69'' (3).&lt;/ref&gt; The scale has become an instrument of choice for monitoring quality of life in some clinical populations, for example, it was adopted by the Positively Sound network for women living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;http://positivelysound.org/aboutus.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement of [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] may have an effect on multiple domains of an individual's life which could be captured only through a comprehensive measurement. For example, the treatment of a phobia may reduce fear ([[mental health]] index), which could lead to the improvement of [[social relation]]s (social relations index) and, in turn, performance at work, resulting in an increase in salary (financial index). Hence, in order to detect all implications of a treatment (e.g., for a phobia), a comprehensive measurement across multiple domains of an individual's life is needed. The SPQL scale can provide such a comprehensive measurement.

The scale is designed in an electronic format. The software calculates scores automatically; this allows for advanced quantification methods. The automatic calculations and quantification methods allowed undertaking a comprehensive approach for assessing SPQL from multiple facets. A multi-facet approach, in turn, provided a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of mental health interventions (through pre- and post tests).

The scale emerged from synthesis of existing theories including: (a) subjective well-being, (b) developmental life-stages, (c) different categories of human needs, (d) quality of life, and (e) subjective evaluation processes. The scale consists of three axes: Subjective well-being, positive and [[Affect theory|negative affect]], and fulfillment of needs. See a model diagram below.

The scale can (a) identify possible [[side effect]]s of psychiatric or psychological interventions which could occur in multiple domains of an individual’s life, (b) detect the occurrence of relapses, (c) assist in evaluating the progress of recovery, (d) measure the effects of various non-normative positive and negative events (e.g., divorce, promotion at work, becoming a parent) on an individual’s life as a whole and trace the course of their development, (e) evaluate an individual’s SPQL throughout the lifespan, (f) predict depression, anxiety, and mood, and (g) assess the effectiveness of interventions intended to enhance well-being and improve quality of life on an individual level.

This scale could be used by individual [[mental health professional]]s to evaluate the progress of treatment. This is useful for clients as well because they themselves are able to compare their initial scores with scores after intervention. Because the scale is available online, clients are able to complete the questionnaire outside of the therapy sessions. The scale also could be used in medical settings to assess how medical treatment affects a patient’s life overall and in specific aspects over time, as well as allow detecting psychological side effects. The scale could be of use to insurers because it would help in evaluating the effectiveness of mental health interventions.

==Theory==
[[File:spql.jpg|thumb|right|SPQL model.]]
It is safe to postulate that all people want to have a good life. Although the meaning of “a good life” may vary from culture to culture and from individual to individual, this meaning revolves around the same aspects of life across cultures. What actually varies between cultures and individuals is the availability of certain aspects of a good life, the subjective significance people assign to these aspects, and the way people evaluate these aspects of a good life.

Everything we do or do not do, wish or do not wish, and have or do not have has an explicit or an implicit relevance to how good or not good we perceive our lives to be. Because the preference for a good life over a bad life underlies all facets of our lives, understanding what constitutes and influences a good life on an individual level has a significant value for all people.

During the past several decades researchers investigated the concept of “the good life” based on three theoretical approaches:

The comprehensive scale of the good life, the Self-Perceived Quality of Life (SPQL) scale, overcame the limitations of prior approaches by integrating measurements of SWB, QOL, and functionality on an individual level, and by utilizing innovative quantification methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hagerty |first1=M. |last2=Cummins |first2=R. |last3=Ferriss |first3=A. |last4=Land |first4=K. |last5=Michalos |first5=A. |last6=Peterson |first6=M. |author7=et al. |date=2001 |title=Quality of life indexes for national policy: Review and agenda for research |journal=Bulletin of Sociological Methodology |volume=71 |pages=58–78 | doi = 10.1177/075910630107100104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rapley |first=M. |date=2003 |title=Quality of life research: A critical introduction |location=London |publisher=Sage }}{{ISBN missing|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} The scale focused on how individuals evaluate their lives and compare these measurements with the average good life of others. The SPQL scale includes well-being, emotions, and physical and mental health indices. The SPQL scale has implications for evaluating the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions intended to improve mental health and well-being.

===Conceptual model===
The SPQL construct consists of three axes, each compounded from several variables:
; Subjective well-being (SWB)
: Baseline average of overall happiness/unhappiness and transient deviations, which are measures of frequency and intensity of nonnormative transient experiences of happiness/unhappiness.
; Subjective affective experiences (SAE)
: Average of overall positive and negative affect.
; Fulfillment of needs
: A product of strength and fulfillment of a wide range of needs and preferences.

Because fluctuations within SPQL are likely to occur over time, a single-occasion measurement will not provide a comprehensive assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Diener, 2000.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, &amp; Schkade, 2005.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to capture a more comprehensive picture of SPQL, the SWB variable (axis) was measured retrospectively throughout three major [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|life stages]] of adult human development: Early-adulthood, mid-adulthood, and late-adulthood (see SPQL model diagram).

==Transitions between life stages==
[[File:LifespanFig2.jpg|thumb|Example lifespan curve of a 69-year-old person.]]
As people approach a life stage in their development, they face developmental tasks that they need to master in order for the transition to the next life stage to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, 1968.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harter, 1998, 1999.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of transition from one life stage to another is marked by three phases:
# Mastering or failing a task;
# Consequential reevaluation of life circumstances, values, and [[self-concept]]; and
# Adjustment and adaptation to new values and circumstances.
To a lesser degree, cycles of transitions occur continually within major life stages on annual and even on daily bases.

A curve of SWB throughout the lifespan can reflect the experience of an individual's good life. Ideally, all three SPQL axes should be evaluated for each life stage. However, this would make a questionnaire too long. Although the SPQL scale measures only one SPQL axis (SWB) for each life stage, the developed theoretical framework discusses the evaluation of all three SPQL axes throughout the major life stages. Thus, the framework can support the development of a next version of the scale that would accomplish this goal. Future research could explore possibilities for reducing the number of the evaluated scale items and include questions that will evaluate all three SPQL axes throughout the major life stages.

==Axes==
Participants' responses on the inventories for each of the three SPQL axes (see Appendixes) provided the data for the psychometric validation of the scale and for the quantitative analyses that allowed measuring the good life. The theoretical framework for the first two axes was based on the existing theories of SWB, positive affect and negative affect, and mood.&lt;ref name=Diener_et_al-1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, 1998.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson_2000/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Watson &amp; Clark, 1994.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical framework for the third axis was based on theories that conceptually differentiate between different categories of needs.&lt;ref name=Maslow_1970&gt;Maslow, 1970.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, 2000.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different categories of needs, in turn, are sorted into four general categories of needs composing the third axis. The measurement of an individual’s level of functionality across social, psychological, and health factors was integrated in the third axis. This integration was accomplished through evaluating the strength and fulfillment of an individual’s needs for optimal functioning across these factors.

===Axis I: subjective well-being ===
The subjective well-being (SWB) baseline is maintained by psychological and biological homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman &amp; Campbell, 1971.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins &amp; Lau, 2004.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of overall happiness determined the SWB baseline. A higher SWB baseline indicates a higher SPQL. People who have experienced more positive and less negative intense experiences during their lives (i.e., transient deviations), have a higher SPQL. Intense experiences were assessed through measuring the frequency and intensity of nonnormative transient subjective experiences of happiness/unhappiness that deviate from the SWB baseline throughout time.

===Axis II: subjective affective experiences ===
People who have experienced more positive and less negative subjective affective experiences (SAE) during their lives (i.e., transient deviations), have a higher SPQL. The average of positive and negative SAE was used to measure overall SAE.

===Axis III: fulfillment of needs===
Individuals with the same score on SWB can differ in their evaluations of [[Standard of living|standards of living]] even if their objective life circumstances are alike. Accordingly, their self-perceived QOL may vary. Hence, in order to capture a more accurate measurement of SPQL, the strength and degree of fulfillment of a wide range of human needs and preferences for life circumstances was evaluated. However, felt needs are not the only kind of needs that a person may have.&lt;ref name=Maslow_1970/&gt; If a need is satisfied it may not be felt as intensely as an unsatisfied need of lesser importance in terms of overall happiness. Thus, the strength with which a need is felt at a certain point in time does not necessarily indicate that it makes a greater contribution to the overall SPQL than other needs, which are felt less intensely or unfelt at all at that point in time because they are satisfied. Hence, the strength of individual preferences and needs was evaluated not only through questions such as “how important is fulfillment of this need to your overall happiness?” but also with questions such as “if this need were unfulfilled, how would it affect your overall happiness?”

[[Model (abstract)|Conceptual model]] for axis III fulfillment of needs. In order to measure fulfillment of needs, a broad range of human needs was sorted into four conceptually distinct categories that are (a) contingent on corresponding stages of cognitive and [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|moral development]],&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Levine, &amp; Hewer, 1983.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, 1952.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (b) constitute major components of self-concept,&lt;ref&gt;Marcia, 1980.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (c) correspond to the neural activity in different clusters of anatomical brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, 2004.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 2000a.{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sometimes the same anatomical brain regions are involved in different ways in neural activity associated with the four categories of needs, implicated brain regions will be distinguished based on their dominance in related processes, and based on the chronological maturation of the dominant regions.

#Instinctual needs include (a) sensory stimulation needs that became linked with positive or negative affect without involvement of cognitive evaluations; (b) physiological needs such as hunger, thirst, and sex; and (c) other physiological needs, such as those related to digestion, [[fluid balance]], [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]], and [[blood pressure]], which could elicit positive or negative affect depending on whether the needs are met.
#Self-centered emotional needs include (a) needs for safety and security (e.g., financial stability, home), love and belonging (e.g., affectionate relationships, [[sense of community]]), esteem (e.g., recognition, confidence); (b) ego-centered self-conscious needs (underpinned by self-conscious emotions, that is, emotions which require self-conscious awareness and evaluations), such as pride and honor (e.g., from personal accomplishments vs. nurturing), and guilt and embarrassment (with a focus on how one’s status has been affected vs. focusing on how others have been affected); and (c) spiritual/religious needs motivated by ego inflation or belonging emotional needs.
#Humanistic and spiritual emotional needs include (a) a higher order of self-conscious altruistic needs that are not self-centered, such as pride and honor (e.g., from nurturing vs. from personal accomplishments), and guilt and embarrassment (with a focus on how others have been affected vs. focusing on how one’s status has been affected); (b) humanistic, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|self-actualization]] needs, characterized by a desire to fulfill one’s potential, which are not ego-centered (e.g., desiring truth over dishonesty); and (c) spiritual/religious needs which are not motivated by ego inflation or belonging emotional needs.
#Cognitive needs include needs for harmony, organization, and coherence in (a) aesthetics (e.g., art, architecture, poetry, and music) and (b) intellect (sciences, information, and skills).

====Measuring axis III fulfillment of needs====
[[File:fig2spql.jpg|right|thumb|Two dimensions of motivational units: strength and fulfillment.]]
Because according to the SPQL theory an individual's motivations ensue from the idiosyncratic cluster of the four categories of needs, these four categories are proposed to compound an individual’s motivational framework (MF). In the following discussion, disparate preferences and needs will be referred to as motivational units (MU). Motivational units have two dimensions, importance of MU to the SPQL (strength) and the degree of fulfillment. The strength of a motivational unit (MU) was determined by evaluating the capacity for the fulfillment or unfulfillment of the MU to skew the SWB baseline.

'''Shenzhou 7''' ({{zh|s=神舟七号|t=神舟七號|p=Shénzhōu Qī Hào}}) was the third [[human spaceflight]] mission of the [[Chinese space program]]. The mission, which included the first Chinese [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) carried out by crew members [[Zhai Zhigang]] and [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]], marked the commencement of the second phase of the Chinese government's [[Chinese space program#Manned spaceflight programs|Project 921]].

The [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] carrying the three crew members was launched 25 September 2008, by a [[Long March 2F]] (CZ-2F) rocket which lifted off from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] at 21:10 CST.&lt;ref name="JSR600" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071120/ap_on_sc/china_space;_ylt=AlY9TmqX4L5d8TLlL7v1tjkPLBIF|title=China manned mission to follow Olympics |date=20 November 2006|accessdate=20 November 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission lasted three days, after which the craft landed safely in [[Siziwang Banner]] in central [[Inner Mongolia]] on 28 September 2008, at 17:37 CST.&lt;ref name="landing_chinawindow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/28/content_10128407.htm | title=Chinese taikonauts return as heroes after landmark spacewalk | publisher=[http://www.chinaview.cn/index.htm China View] | work=[http://www.chinaview.cn/china/index.htm Window of China] | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 September 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001021826/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/28/content_10128407.htm | archivedate=1 October 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.longhoo.net/gb/longhoo/news/tech/userobject1ai796208.html|title="神七""神九"将太空对接 "神七"准备工作顺利 (Shenzhou 7 and Shenzhou 9 to perform space rendezvous; Shenzhou 7 preparations for work going smoothly)|publisher=Longhu News Center|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=1 May 2008|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213165352/http://news.longhoo.net/gb/longhoo/news/tech/userobject1ai796208.html|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shenzhou 7'' EVA made the Chinese space program the third to have conducted an EVA.

=== Solid lubricant experiment ===

Scientists conducted a solid lubricant exposure experiment during the mission. A piece of equipment the size of a book was installed on the outside wall of the orbital module, and was later retrieved during the space walk, after having been exposed in space for more than 40 hours. The experiment was aimed to study a lubricant which will be used for space-based moving components in future space facilities.&lt;ref name="Solid lubricant experiment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/26/content_10112553.htm|title=Chief designer says Shenzhou-7 has four tasks|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=28 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928044508/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/26/content_10112553.htm|archivedate=28 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release of miniaturized satellite ===
: {{Main|BanXing}}
A [[miniaturized satellite]] was released during the mission on 27 September at 19:24, after Zhai returned to the spacecraft. The satellite was a cube about {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a mass of {{convert|40|kg|lb}}; it carried boost devices and two 150-megapixel [[stereo cameras]].&lt;!--An English source would be preferable here--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-09/24/content_10104656.htm|title=伴飞小卫星将给神七"照相"(Banfei miniature satellite to "take pictures" of Shenzhou 7)|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=24 September 2008|language=Chinese|accessdate=28 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928104838/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-09/24/content_10104656.htm|archivedate=28 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite's tasks included testing the mini-satellite technology, observing and monitoring the spacecraft, and testing the tracking and approaching technology used for [[Space rendezvous|space rendezvous and docking]].&lt;ref name="miniaturized satellite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/27/content_10123015.htm|title=Shenzhou-7 launches small monitoring satellite|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=27 September 2008|accessdate=28 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928132231/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/27/content_10123015.htm|archivedate=28 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The miniaturized satellite took photos and videos near the spacecraft, then maneuvered to about {{convert|100|to|200|km|mi}} away from the spacecraft. After the return module separated from the spacecraft and re-entered the atmosphere, the satellite caught up to the orbiting spacecraft using a liquid ammonia engine, then continue to orbit around the spacecraft. The mini-satellite will work for about three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-09/24/content_10104787.htm|title=伴飞小卫星将"追赶"分离后的神七轨道舱 (Banfei miniature satellite to "chase" Shenzhou 7 orbital module after separation)|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=24 September 2008|accessdate=24 September 2008|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927221510/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-09/24/content_10104787.htm|archivedate=27 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=July 2012|reason=that was 2008, it's now 2012}}

=== Data relay satellite ===

China launched its first-ever [[communication satellite|data relay satellite]], called ''[[Tianlian I-01|Tianlian I]]'' (天链一号), from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] on a [[Long March 3C|Long March-3C]] carrier rocket on 25 April 2008.&lt;ref name="Tianlian I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/26/content_8052455.htm|title=China blasts off first data relay satellite|publisher= [[Xinhua]]|date=26 April 2008|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tianlian I satellite will be used to speed up communication between the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft and the ground stations, and to increase the amount of data that can be transferred to the ground. The Tianlian I satellite alone can cover 50 percent of the orbit of Shenzhou 7—whereas the [[Yuanwang]] space tracking ships, along with China's ten ground observation stations, have a coverage of only 12 percent—and thus will increase the total coverage to about 62 percent of the mission.&lt;ref name="Solid lubricant experiment" /&gt;

== Mission support and preparation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--many CN tags--&gt;
=== Subsystems ===
The Shenzhou 7 project consists of seven subsystems, with the Chinese military responsible for launching, recovering, crew, and tracking subsystems, [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] responsible for the carrier rocket and spacecraft itself, and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] responsible for the payloads on board the spacecraft (other than the crew).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

=== Water training pool ===
A columniform water training pool of {{convert|23|m|ft}} in diameter and {{convert|10|m|ft}} in depth, located in China Astronaut Training Center, simulates the weightlessness experienced in space. A model of the Shenzhou orbital module has been used in the pool to train the crew for the space walk.&lt;ref name="Water pool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20080925/n259736731.shtml|title=10米水下"太空漫步" (A "space stroll" under 10 meters of water)|publisher= [[Sohu.com]]|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=28 September 2008|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications to the CZ-2F carrier rocket ===

Special attention has been paid to solving vibration problems that were encountered 120 seconds into the [[Shenzhou 5]] mission. These vibrations were described by Shenzhou 5 astronaut [[Yang Liwei]] as hard to endure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Corrective measures were implemented for the [[Shenzhou 6]] mission,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} but since then more improvements have been added to the [[Long March 2F|carrier rocket]], to the pipes of the second stage, and to more than thirty other parts of the spacecraft..{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

=== Modifications to the spacecraft ===

The [[Orbital module]] has been modified and its solar panels removed in order to allow for the EVA experiment. For this same reason, in contrast to previous Shenzhou missions, it will not remain in space after its separation with the departing crew in the Return module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mil/2/200806/0626_340_617870_3.shtml|title=神八2010年首飞 运载火箭将有重大变化 (Delivery rockets for 2010 maiden flight of Shenzhou 8 to undergo major changes)| publisher= Phoenix TV |date=26 June 2008|accessdate=8 July 2008|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handrails have been added to the external wall of the Orbital module to allow the space walking astronaut to reach specific experiment areas.&lt;ref name="second_astronaut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/tech/2008-06/12/xin_0420605121410078265007.jpg|script-title=zh:神七准备中俄产两套航天服 出舱将穿国产服|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=23 July 2008|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001161804/http://news.xinhuanet.com/tech/2008-06/12/xin_0420605121410078265007.jpg|archivedate=1 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More cameras have been installed on this spacecraft than on the Shenzhou 6 vessel, in addition to those covering the Orbital module and the Return module.&lt;ref name="Xinhua_suits_price" /&gt;

=== New space tracking ships ===
Two new, recently commissioned [[Yuan Wang class tracking ship|Yuanwang-class tracking ships]], Yuanwang-5 and Yuanwang-6, played a key role in the Shenzhou VII mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitech.people.com.cn/GB/7170743.html|script-title=zh:我国新一代航天远洋测量船完成海上设备精度鉴定|publisher=China Government online|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=11 July 2008|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toilets ===

Custom-made, compact, foldable toilets allow the astronaut's collected urine to be scientifically inspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuaibao.net/html/2008-09/03/content_64419025.htm |title=神七厕所南京制造 (Nanjing manufactures Shenzhou 7 toilets) |publisher=[[Xinhua]] |date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2008 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214044740/http://www.kuaibao.net/html/2008-09/03/content_64419025.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project management ===
Most of the [[Shenzhou 6]] [[Shenzhou 6#Mission highlights|project management team]] has stayed for the Shenzhou 7 mission. Changes in personnel include:
* General Project Manager and Commander [[Chen Bingde]] has been replaced, after his promotion to the position of Chief of the General Staff, by the current Director-General of the [[General Armaments Department]], [[Chang Wanquan]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

* Vice General Project Manager and Commander [[Zhang Qingwei]] has been replaced after his promotion to head of the [[ACAC consortium]], by [[Ma Xingrui]], the head of [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]]
* Vice General Engineer of [[Shenzhou 6]], [[Zhou Jianping]] ({{lang|zh|周建平}}) was promoted to General Engineer of Shenzhou 7, succeeding [[Wang Yongzhi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* Director of the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]: [[Major General]] [[Zhang Yulin]] ({{lang|zh|张育林}}) has been replaced, after his promotion to Chancellor of the [[National University of Defense Technology]], by the Vice Director of [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] [[Major General]] [[Cui Jijun]] ({{lang|zh|崔吉俊}})

== Controversy ==

According to the [[United States Strategic Command]], at 15:07 Greenwich Mean Time on 27 September 2008, the Shenzhou 7 ship passed within 45 kilometers of the [[International Space Station]]. China did not respond to queries about why it allowed its ship to pass so close to the space station. Richard Fisher, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal noted that the Shenzhou 7 had launched its companion satellite [[BX-1]] four hours earlier. The IASC is a "think-tank" focused on medium and long-term security issues and their impact on the security of the United States and her key allies. He noted "China's track record of using all of its Shenzhou missions since 1999 for dual military-civil missions," and speculated that China may have used the opportunity to pass near the space station to test "co-orbital" antisatellite interception technology.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Richard D., Jr., "[http://s.wsj.net/article/SB122539460905385099.html China's Close Call]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', 31 October 2008, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sterile male plants''' are plants which are incapable of producing [[pollen]]. This is sometimes attributed to mutations in the [[mitochondrial DNA]] which affects the [[Tapetum (botany)|Tapetum]] cells in anthers which are responsible for nursing developing pollen. The mutations cause the breakdown of the [[mitochondria]] in these specific cells and result in cell death and so pollen production is interrupted. These observations have now led to transgenic sterile male plants to be made in order to create [[hybrid seed]]s, by inserting [[transgenes]] which are specifically poisonous to Tapetum cells.

In [[Romanian mythology]], '''strigoi''' ([[English language|English]]: ''striga'', ''[[poltergeist]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=strigoi DEX Online]&lt;/ref&gt; are the troubled spirits of the dead rising from the grave. Some strigoi can be living people with certain magical properties. Some of the properties of the strigoi include: the ability to [[shapeshift|transform into an animal]], [[invisibility]], and the propensity to drain the vitality of victims via blood loss. Strigoi are the myth behind the modern Bram Stoker vampire.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The word is generally thought to originate in the Ancient Greco-Roman concept of the [[Strix (mythology)|''strix'']] ([[Late Latin]] ''[[wikt:striga|striga]]'', Greek στρίγξ), which denoted either a [[Witchcraft|witch]] or a type of ill-omened nocturnal flying creature&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes identified with the [[screech owl]] though Oliphant argued that the original inspiration was a bat and that the later association with owls is based on a misreading of the ancient sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or a hybrid of the two that was said to crave human flesh and blood, particularly of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliphant |first= Samuel Grant|year=1913|title= The Story of the Strix: Ancient|journal= Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=44 |issue= |pages=133–49|doi= 10.2307/282549 |jstor=282549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Modern ===
The Croatian [[Jure Grando]], who died in 1656, is often considered the first alleged vampire whose existence is documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.hr/davors/simotamo_BorisPeric.htm Interview with Boris Peric]&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest published description of the Grando case (in German), from Valvasor's ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'' (1689), the local term was given as ''strigon''.

Dimitrie Cantemir mentions the ''striga'' as being a Moldavian and especially Transylvanian belief in his ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'' (1714–1716), though his version corresponds more closely to the classical notion of a witch or sorceress than a blood-drinking vampire and includes a very typical description of [[dunking]] as a test for witchcraft.

''Strigoiulu'' (the Strigoi) was the name of a Romanian-language satirical magazine published briefly in 1862 in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publicaţiile Periodice Româneşti - PPR Tom.

The modern form, ''strigoi'', is cited in an 1865 article on Transylvanian folklore by Wilhelm Schmidt, who describes them as plaguing infants. He reports a tradition in which, upon the birth of a child, one tosses a stone behind oneself and exclaims "this into the mouth of the ''strigoi''!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Wilhelm|title=Das Jahr und seine Tage in Meinung und Brauch der Rumänen Siebenbürgens|journal=Österreichische Revue|date=1865|volume=3|issue=1|pages=211–226|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MApEAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belle Époque ===
In 1909, [[Franz Hartmann]] mentions in his book ''An Authenticated Vampire Story'' that peasant children from a village in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] started to die mysteriously. The villagers began to suspect a recently deceased count was a vampire, dwelling in his old fortress. Frightened villagers burned the castle to stop the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/15488040/an-authenticated-vampire-story-by-franz-hartmann  ''An Authenticated Vampire Story'' by Franz Hartmann] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111093256/http://www.scribd.com/doc/15488040/an-authenticated-vampire-story-by-franz-hartmann |date=2014-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Search of Dracula, The History of Dracula and Vampires'', [[Radu Florescu]] mentions an event in 1969 in the city of [[Căpăţâneni]], where after the death of an old man, several family members began to die in suspicious circumstances. Unearthed, the corpse did not show signs of decomposition, his eyes were wide open, the face was red and twisted in the coffin. The corpse was burned to save his soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond T. McNally]] and [[Radu R. Florescu]] ''In Search of Dracula, The History of Dracula and Vampires (Completely Revised)''. Houghton Mifflin. 1994. {{ISBN|0-395-65783-0}}. pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, a series of hideous crimes shocked Bucharest. The attacks took place at midnight during rainstorms. The victims were usually waitresses returning home from work. In 1971, [[Ion Rîmaru]] was arrested and identified by teeth marks on the corpses. During the trial he was in a state of continual drowsiness. He was interrogated at night because he was not lucid at any other time. During daylight hours, Rîmaru was intractably lethargic. Sentenced to death, Rîmaru became violently agitated. Several policemen were needed to restrain him. After the execution, Rîmaru's father died in a suspicious accident. During the investigation of the accident, it was discovered that the father's fingerprints matched those of a serial killer active in 1944 whose crimes looked remarkably similar to those of Ion Rîmaru. The similarities included the weather conditions and similar or identical names of some of the victims. It was rumored that the accident was engineered by the [[Securitate]], who decided to eliminate the dangerous individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/ramaru-primul-criminal-in-serie-al-romaniei-moderne-970477.html Râmaru, primul criminal în serie al României moderne]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the corpse of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] did not receive a proper burial. This made the ghost of the former dictator a threat in the minds of superstitious Romanians. Noted revolutionary [[Gelu Voican]] carpeted the apartment of the [[Conducător]] with braids of garlic. This is a traditional remedy against the strigoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/slave_0080-2557_1995_num_67_1_6260_t1_0255_0000_2|title=le Feu vivant : la parenté et ses rituels dans les Carpates|website=[http://www.persee.fr Persee.fr]|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post communism===
Before Christmas 2003, in the village of Marotinu de Sus, a 76-year-old Romanian man named Petre Toma died. In February 2004, a niece of the deceased revealed that she had been visited by her late uncle. Gheorghe Marinescu, a brother-in-law, became the leader of a vampire hunting group made up of several family members. After drinking some alcohol, they dug up the coffin of Petre Toma, made an incision in his chest, and tore the heart out. After removal of the heart, the body was burned and the ashes mixed in water and drunk by the family, as is customary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, the Romanian government anxious to maintain a good image in preparation for the country's accession to the [[European Union]] had banned this practice, and six family members were arrested by the police of [[Craiova]] from [[Dolj County]] for "disturbing the peace of the dead",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiscret.ro/178/reportaj/6250/pusculita-cu-manjiti.html|title=Adevărul despre "Cazul strigoiului Petre Toma"|website=[http://www.indiscret.ro Indiscret.ro]|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were imprisoned and sentenced to pay damages to the family of the deceased. Since then, in the nearby village of Amărăştii de Sus, people drive a fire-hardened stake through the heart or belly of the dead as a "preventative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2011/09/13/pour-echapper-aux-vampires-rien-ne-vaut-les-vieilles-recettes|title=Pour échapper aux vampires, rien ne vaut les vieilles recettes|website=[http://www.courrierinternational.com courrierinternational.com]|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six who exhumed the body were charged and sentenced to six months [[time served]].&lt;ref&gt;Family interview on the Travel Channel, Expedition Unknown with Josh Gates, "Hunting Vampires"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''strigoi'' is related to the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] verb ''a striga'', which in Romanian means "to scream". Virtually all authorities derive it directly from the Latin terms ''strix'' and ''striga'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?p=1484|title=Dictionnaire Gaffiot|website=[http://www.lexilogos.com lexilogos.com]|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the root of which relates particularly to owls and commonly appears in related taxonomic terms for them as well as for blood parasites such as the ''[[Strigeidida]]''. Cognates are found throughout the [[Romance languages]], such as the Italian word ''[[Stregheria|strega]]'' or the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] word ''strìga'' which mean "witch". In French, ''stryge'' means a bird-woman who sucks the blood of children. Jules Verne used the term "stryges" in Chapter II of his novel ''[[The Castle of the Carpathians]]'', published in 1892. The Greek word ''[[Strix (mythology)|Strix]]'' and the Albanian word ''[[shtriga]]'' are also cognate.

== Different types of strigoi ==
[[Tudor Pamfile]] in his book ''Mitologie românească'' compiles all appellations of strigoi in Romania ''strâgoi'', ''Moroi''&lt;ref&gt;''Noul dicţionar explicativ al limbii Române'', Bucharest: Litera Internaţional, 2002. {{ISBN|973-8358-04-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=moroi&amp;source=1 moroi] in ''Dicţionarul explicativ al limbii Române'', Academia Românǎ, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in western [[Transylvania]], [[Wallachia]] and [[Oltenia]], ''vidmă''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/definitie/vidm%C4%83 Definition of Vídmă]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bucovina]], ''vârcolacul'', ''Cel-rau'', or vampire.

=== The strigoaică ===
A ''strigoaică'' (singular feminine form) is a [[witch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=strigoaica DEX Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The strigoi viu ===
The strigoi viu (living strigoi) is a kind of [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. According to Adrian Cremene, in his book ''Mythology of the vampire in Romania'', the living strigoi steals the wealth of farmers, that is to say, [[wheat]] and [[milk]]. But it can also stop the rain, drop [[hail]] and give death to men and cattle.

=== The strigoi mort ===
The strigoi mort (dead strigoi) is much more dangerous. Its nature is ambiguous, both human and demonic. He/she emerges from their grave, returns to their family and behaves as in their lifetime, while weakening their relatives until they die in their turn.

== Becoming a strigoi ==
The encyclopedist [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] and the folklorist [[Teodor Burada]] in his book ''Datinile Poporului român la înmormântări'' published in 1882 refer to cases of strigoism. The strigoi can be a living man, born under certain conditions:

* Be the seventh child of the same sex in a family;
* Lead a life of sin
* Die without being married…
** …by execution for perjury
** …by suicide
** …having been cursed by a witch.

According to [[Ionna Andreesco]], in his book ''Where are the vampires?'' published in 1997, children born with a [[caul]] atop their head will become strigoi to their death.

== Prevention ==
[[File:Simion Florea Marian - Inmormantarea la romani, 1892.png|thumb|''Inmormantarea la romani'' (Romanian burial) written by Simion Florea Marian]]
In 1887, French geographer [[Élisée Reclus]] details the burials in Romania: "if the deceased has red hair, he is very concerned that he was back in the form of dog, frog, flea or bedbug, and that it enters into houses at night to suck the blood of beautiful young girls. So it is prudent to nail the coffin heavily, or, better yet, a stake through the chest of the corpse. "&lt;ref&gt;Nouvelle Géographie universelle, tome I, Hachette, Paris, 19 volumes, 1876-1894&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simeon Florea Marian]] in ''Înmormântarea la români'' (1892) describes another preventive method, unearthing and beheading then re-interring the corpse and head face down.

''The Dracula Scrapbook'' by [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]], published by New English Library editions in 1976, reported that the meat of pig killed on the day of St. Ignatius is a good way to guard against vampire, according to Romanian legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morduedevampires.pagespro-orange.fr/Fiches/F0279.htm|title=The Dracula scrapbook
|website=[http://www.morduedevampires.pagespro-orange.fr Mordue de vampires]|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a known method used by gypsies to get rid of a strigoi as explained on the show [[Lost Tapes]]:
# Exhume  the strigoi.
# Remove its heart and cut it in two.
# drive a nail in its forehead.
# Place a clove of garlic under its tongue.
# Smear its body with fat of a pig killed on St. Ignatius' Day.
# Turn its body face down so that if the strigoi were ever to wake up it would be headed to the afterlife.

'''William Stuart Adamson''' (11 April 1958 –  16 December 2001) was a Scottish guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He was the co-founder, lead vocalist, and guitarist of rock group [[Big Country]], which rose to prominence in 1983.

Prior to that he founded Scottish [[art-punk]] band [[Skids (band)|Skids]]. In the 1990s he founded [[alternative country]] rock act [[The Raphaels]].  He was once described by DJ [[John Peel]] as "the new [[Jimi Hendrix]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glen|first=Allan|title=Stuart Adamson – In A Big Country|isbn=184697142X|url=http://www.bigcountryinfo.com/pages/albums/comp_notw.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Adamson was born in Manchester. Both his parents were Scottish, and when he was four, his family moved to Fife and settled in a small mining town, [[Crossgates, Fife|Crossgates]], about a mile to the east of [[Dunfermline]].

Adamson founded his first two bands in Dunfermline and they both started out playing Dunfermline and across the [[Firth of Forth]] in Edinburgh. He went to school with [[Ian Rankin]], who was two years younger and went on to become a fan of Skids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Reid |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/celebrity/rock-star-adamson-dies-in-hotel-1-936409 |title=Rock Star Adamson dies in hotel |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=17 December 2001 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson was a lifelong supporter of [[Dunfermline Athletic Football Club]].

Adamson's father was in the fishing industry and traveled the world. He encouraged Stuart to read literature, and both parents shared an interest in folk music. Adamson founded his first band, Tattoo, in 1976 after seeing [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] play in Edinburgh. Besides Adamson, Tattoo included his friend William Simpson, who would also play bass guitar for his next band, [[Skids (band)|Skids]].

==Skids==
Adamson founded [[Skids (band)|Skids]] in 1977 when he was 18.  Adamson and Simpson first recruited drummer Thomas Kellichan. They played as a trio around Dunfermline and Edinburgh until meeting 16-year-old [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,1242759,00.html Jobson's Choice], The Observer, Sunday 20 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobson was recruited as a frontman; Adamson and Jobson both wrote songs for the band.

Skids' biggest success was the single "[[Into the Valley]]" in 1979, which reached number 10 in the UK charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=8134 Chart Stats - Skids - Into the Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; The band had four chart singles in the UK that year. Adamson was involved with three of their four albums, leaving in 1980 before ''[[Joy (The Skids album)|Joy]]''. Jobson's influence had increased in the band, which led to the increasing disputes between the two musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Goddard, [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/critique.cfm?id=243052007 Once more into the valley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030054140/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/critique.cfm?id=243052007 |date=30 October 2007 }}, ''The Scotsman'', 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jobson later said "This was a guy who had a mortgage, a wife, and a family when we were all trying to live some mythic punk lifestyle. He seemed level-headed, grounded."&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,1242759,00.html Jobson's Choice], [[The Observer]], Sunday 20 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Big Country==
Adamson came to greater international prominence with [[Big Country]]. He constructed the band with friend and fellow guitarist [[Bruce Watson (guitarist)|Bruce Watson]], then employed as a cleaner on submarines at [[Rosyth naval base]], and a rhythm section of studio musicians [[Mark Brzezicki]] and [[Tony Butler (musician)|Tony Butler]], whom he found with the help of his record company.

Big Country's first hit, 1983's "Fields of Fire", reached the UK's Top 10, and was rapidly followed by the album ''[[The Crossing (Big Country album)|The Crossing]]''. The album was a big hit in the United States powered by the single "[[In a Big Country]]", which was performed on [[Saturday Night Live]] and the [[Grammy Awards]]. The video for "[[In a Big Country]]" received frequent airplay on [[MTV]] and featured the band riding [[all-terrain vehicle|all terrain vehicles]] in the countryside.

Their second album ''[[Steeltown]]'' appeared in 1984.  The band's third album was ''[[The Seer (Big Country album)|The Seer]]''. The first two albums were produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. The band continued to record studio albums and to tour until 1999. Adamson supplied much of the distinctive guitar work, as well as being the lead singer and main songwriter (both music and lyrics). The band's lineup rarely underwent changes, the exception being a brief departure of drummer [[Mark Brzezicki]] in the early 1990s and his temporary replacement by Pat Ahern.

Adamson was also a keen motorcyclist and regularly purchased new machines for riding around Fife. His interest extended to the race track where he sponsored British Championship rider Iain Duffus in the late 1980s.

==Personal life==
Adamson was married twice. He had two children with his first wife Sandra in 1982 and 1985. His son [[Callum Adamson]] is the guitarist of British band Ahab, and his daughter Kirsten has a solo musical career. In 1996, Adamson split with Sandra and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scotsman.com/news/celebrity/stardom-life-and-times-of-punk-hero-1-589819 STARDOM: LIFE AND TIMES OF PUNK HERO], ''The Scotsman'', 18 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daughter of Big Country legend Stuart Adamson is happy the world still loves his music as she prepares to release her debut album |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/daughter-big-country-legend-stuart-5166654 |publisher=Daily Record |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he married his second wife, Melanie Shelley a celebrity hairdresser in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-wives feud over fortune of Big Country suicide star |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/27/theobserver.uknews2 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=28 November 2018 |date=27 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded his final band, the alternative country band [[The Raphaels]], a duo of Adamson and Nashville songwriter [[Marcus Hummon]].

==Death==
On 26 November 2001 Adamson was reported missing by his wife Melanie. At the time the couple had been estranged for several weeks, and Melanie filed for divorce on the day he had disappeared. He had been due to face drunk-driving charges in March 2002, and had been ordered to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. Adamson had previously experienced problems related to [[alcoholism]], and had resumed consuming alcohol after having been sober for over a decade. On 16 December 2001 Adamson was found dead in a room that he had booked into in the [[Best Western]] Plaza Hotel in [[Honolulu]] in [[Hawaii]]. According to a local police report, he had committed suicide by hanging himself with an electrical cord from a pole in a wardrobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Dec/18/ln/ln05a.html |title=Death of rocker Adamson likely suicide, official says &amp;#124; The Honolulu Advertiser &amp;#124; Hawaii's Newspaper |publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=18 December 2001 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeevan Vasagar, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/18/jeevanvasagar Big Country's Stuart Adamson dead in hotel], ''The Guardian'', 17 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent Coroner's Office report found that he had a consumed a 'very strong' amount of alcohol around the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Wade, [http://news.scotsman.com/stuartadamson/Autopsy-shows-star-was-drunk.2297294.jp Autopsy shows star was drunk at time of suicide], ''The Scotsman'', 26 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamson's body was subsequently flown back to Scotland, where after a private funeral service at Dunfermline Crematorium in [[Fife]], it was cremated.&lt;ref&gt;'Singer Adamson's funeral held', BBC News, 30 December 2001. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1734441.stm&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 27 December 2001 a public memorial service was held to celebrate his life and career at Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline, led by [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]], attended by a crowd of several hundred mourners, including Adamson's family and friends, and former members of Big Country. Messages of condolence were publicly read out, including one from [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]], stating that Adamson with Big Country had written the songs that he wished U2 could write.&lt;ref&gt;'Adamson Remembered', 'New Musical Express', 28 January 2002. http://www.stuart-adamson.co.uk/adamson-remembered/01/2002/&lt;/ref&gt;
==Memorials==
In April 2009, a [[mural]] of Stuart Adamson was unveiled at [[East End Park]], the home of [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic Football Club]] of whom Adamson was a fan: the mural was painted by art students from the local [[Queen Anne High School, Dunfermline|Queen Anne High]] and [[Dunfermline High School]]s, and adorns the wall of the north stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stuart Adamson Mural, East End Park, Dunfermline |url=http://www.stuart-adamson.co.uk/information/stuart-adamson-mural/ |publisher=Stuart Adamson fans website |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2011 a commemorative bench to Stuart Adamson was unveiled at [[Pittencrieff Park]] in [[Dunfermline]]. It was paid for by fans and is inscribed with some of his lyrics chosen by fans in an online poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Spiritual home’ pays tribute to rock legend Stuart Adamson with a little help from Wigan |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/fife/91689/spiritual-home-pays-tribute-to-rock-legend-stuart-adamson-with-a-little-help-from-wigan/ |publisher=The Courier |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
According to Skids bassist Bill Simpson, Adamson's first real guitar was a Gibson Flying V. He is usually associated with the Yamaha SG2000 guitar, which he used extensively during the Skids years, as well as on the first two Big Country albums. He also used Fender Stratocasters in this period to achieve lighter tones. Around the time of The Seer, Adamson began to lay his SG2000s aside and experimented with other models. Among these were several Les Pauls, a Gretsch Duo-Jet, and an ESP Stratocaster with humbucking pickups. Adamson also had several guitars made for him by the Glasgow guitar maker Jimmy Moon. Among these were a Telecaster-style electric that Adamson used live on songs such as "The Teacher," "Steeltown," and "Just a Shadow."

Adamson's distinctive "Scottish" sound was created using an MXR pitch transposer, which pushed the guitar notes up an octave and created a shrill, bagpipe-esque whine. This can be heard in the lead guitar passages in the song "In a Big Country." Adamson was also noted for his use of the [[E-Bow]], a device that magnetically vibrates guitar strings and generates unique tones with infinite sustain. The e-bow is most prominent in the introductions to the songs "The Storm" and "Lost Patrol."

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}(Retrieved from [[ProQuest|ABI/Inform]] Document ID: 347271391)&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|first1=Nigel
|last2=Bankes

|issue=3
|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10758">'''''Summer Day's Dream''''' is a 1949 play by [[J. B. Priestley]].  It is set in 1975, and evokes a world where a [[nuclear war|nuclear]] [[Third World War]] has caused [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to revert to a pre-industrial, pre-capitalist state.  It takes its title from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which is being produced by two members of the English family the play is based around.

==Plot summary==
Eighty-year-old Stephen Dawlish lives with his daughter-in-law, grandson and granddaughter on the [[South Downs]] in [[Sussex]], in a former mansion which is now a farmhouse.  There is no political system, no cars or telephones, and goods are exchanged by a [[barter]] system.  Three characters from the surviving great powers of the world, the [[United States]] (Franklyn Heimer), the [[Soviet Union]] (Irina Shestova) and [[India]] (Dr Bahru), arrive in an attempt to develop a major industrial plant to create synthetic products out of the area's abundant produce of [[chalk]].  They initially dismiss the environment as, respectively, out of date, decadent and unenlightened.  After a while, they find themselves captivated by the atmosphere of this rural society, and find themselves unable to carry out their plans, and ultimately depart to leave England in its newfound state of peace.&lt;ref&gt;"St. Martin's Theatre: 'Summer Day's Dream' by J.B. Priestley", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The play was first performed in Priestley's native [[Bradford]] on 8 August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"J.B. Priestley's New Play is Easy to Watch", ''[[Yorkshire Post|Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer]]'', 9 August 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  This production, along with that in London the following month, featured [[Herbert Lomas (actor)|Herbert Lomas]] as Stephen Dawlish, and also featured [[Eileen Thorndike]] (sister of [[Sybil Thorndike|Dame Sybil]]) and a young [[Adrienne Corri]]; the same cast appeared in a [[BBC Television Service|BBC Television]] performance of the play broadcast on 30 October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fc39088aaed2442594ea280300420ecd BBC Genome website - Radio Times listings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before going to London, it also played in [[Brighton]], [[Bournemouth]] and [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;"J.B. Sees Without Being Seen", ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'', 13 August 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was well received by critics when it was initially performed; the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' suggested in its review of the Bradford premiere that it combined "fancy, humour and plain brusque conversational commonsense" and that Priestley had "something to say that he has never said quite so well".&lt;ref&gt;"Priestley premiere scores a success", ''Yorkshire Evening Post'', 9 August 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', while mentioning that Priestley had attended the premiere, reported that "many people in the audience thought that the play was one of the best he had ever written".&lt;ref&gt;"The England of 1975", ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', 9 August 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  Priestley described the play as "a comedy of ideas and atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;"Entertainment Next Week", ''West Sussex County Times'', 12 August 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  When it opened at [[St Martin's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]] there were "at least six curtain calls"; the reviewer of the ''[[Birmingham Gazette]]'' said that "any rapture was earned less by the merits of Mr Priestley's discussion play shot with poetry than by the escapist glimpse it offers of a Britain 25 years hence that need not worry about missions to Washington" but added with some sarcasm that "unfortunately we presumably have to have a third world war first and ship millions of people abroad - presumably the uncultured and difficult ones", concluding that the best actors acted "as if they were something more than mouthpieces for the author's thoughts on civilisation's dilemmas".&lt;ref&gt;"Priestley pleases", ''[[Birmingham Gazette]]'', 9 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  The play was presented by the London Mask Theatre in association with the recently-formed [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]].&lt;ref&gt;"London Theatres: St Martin's", ''[[The Stage]]'', 15 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' described it as "a fantasy, mellow and serene".&lt;ref&gt;"Our Critic's First-Night Journal", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 24 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  George W. Bishop in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was reasonably positive, suggesting that Priestley was "again more interested in ideas rather than people ... (it) is simple to the point of naivety".&lt;ref&gt;"England After Another War: Priestley's Vision of the Future", ''Daily Telegraph and Morning Post'', 9 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the play's run in London was short-lived; it closed on 15 October 1949 after only 43 performances, because takings had only just managed to climb into three figures a night and the average loss was around £500 each week.&lt;ref&gt;"'Dream' logic", ''Yorkshire Evening Post'', 5 October 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  The subsequent TV production received at least one negative review from the ''Essex Newsman'',&lt;ref&gt;"'Static' plays always fail on TV screen", ''Essex Newsman'', 8 November 1949&lt;/ref&gt; although Emery Pearce in the ''Daily Herald'' was much more positive, stating that "Priestley plus television is a new and powerful combination of promise".&lt;ref&gt;"Philosopher by firelight", ''Daily Herald'', 31 October 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent revivals==
Subsequently, the play has only rarely been revived.  In 1950, it was performed by the [[Birmingham]] Repertory Theatre&lt;ref&gt;"Repertory", ''The Stage'', 24 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt;; a largely critical review in the ''Birmingham Gazette'' dismissed Priestley's American, Russian and Indian characters as "mere puppets" and referred critically to Priestley's "cardboard characters" and "incurable romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;"A Priestley discussion on science and progress", ''Birmingham Gazette'', 30 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  This production then went to [[Sheffield]]&lt;ref&gt;"Future Problems Seen In Mr. Priestley's Crystal", ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]'', 26 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements", ''[[Western Daily Press]]'', 12 October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  The text was also published in an anthology, ''The Plays of J.B. Priestley''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1957 revival by the Caryl Jenner Mobile Theatre was performed at [[Southwold]] in the summer before touring the UK during the autumn&lt;ref&gt;"Mobile Theatre Tour", ''The Stage'', 13 June 1957&lt;/ref&gt;; among the places it visited were [[Grantham]]&lt;ref&gt;"Grantham Twice", ''[[Grantham#Grantham Journal|The Grantham Journal]]'', 26 April 1957&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Billingham]] on 4 December 1957&lt;ref&gt;"Gossip", ''[[Hartlepool Mail|Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail]]'', 12 November 1957&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]] and [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]&lt;ref&gt;"Round About", ''The Stage'', 15 November 1957&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] on 30 November 1957&lt;ref&gt;"Entertainments", ''The Berwick Advertiser'', 28 November 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfreton]] on 7 December 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''Ripley and Heanor News and Ilkeston Division Free Press'', 29 November 1957&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, it was revived again (with the setting moved forward to 1985) by the Castle Theatre, [[Farnham]]&lt;ref&gt;"Farnham nearly beats record", ''The Stage'', 13 March 1958&lt;/ref&gt;; this production then went to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], in a production described by the ''Reading Mercury'' as "a thought-provoking play, well performed by a competent cast and certainly deserving of better support than it obtained on opening night"&lt;ref&gt;"Everyman Theatre", ''Reading Mercury'', 19 April 1958&lt;/ref&gt; and finally to [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;"Anthony Richardson is new Marlowe director", ''The Stage'', 31 July 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on the play remained in near-total obscurity until it was revived by the [[BBC]] in a production in [[BBC Two|BBC2]]'s ''Performance'' series – the last major series of studio plays broadcast in the UK – on 26 November 1994, starring [[John Gielgud]] in his last television role as Stephen Dawlish (more than 60 years after he had played on stage and [[The Good Companions (1933 film)|screen]] as Inigo Jollifant in Priestley's ''[[The Good Companions]]'') and also featuring [[Rosemary Harris]], [[Paul Bhattacharjee]], [[Mike McShane]], [[Saskia Reeves]], [[Paul Rhys]], [[Terence Rigby]] and [[Emily Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/a391174fd59e4ce3a545b83588b804c8 BBC Genome website - Radio Times listings]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was well received by [[Lynne Truss]] in ''[[The Times]]'' who wrote, "preposterous is how it sounds, but amazingly Saturday's production by [[Christopher Morahan]] was magical enough to carry it off", also mentioning that in the play [[Shrewsbury]] has become the largest settlement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;"Fiddle practice makes perfect after the bomb", ''The Times'', 28 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Sean Day-Lewis, previewing the production in the previous weekend's ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'', suggested that it was "a work of false prophecy, muddled style and contradictory attitudes" and that its politics were "craven", but also said that it came across with "beguiling effect" and that Gielgud's performance was "among his best for television".&lt;ref&gt;"TV pick of the week", ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 20 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hugh Massingberd]], reviewing it in ''The Daily Telegraph'', suggested that "for all his professed socialism, Priestley seemed to be conjuring up an Edwardian's nostalgic vision of a country estate that chimes with the great [[James Lees-Milne]]'s admirable claim that 'squirearchy was probably the most successful form of local government that's ever been devised'".&lt;ref&gt;"Roughing it in paradise", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC production is now available on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_4Tir6SoRQ YouTube upload, July 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;  A further revival – this time on stage – was performed by the [[Finborough Theatre]] in 2013, the first London production in 64 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/productions/2013/summer-days-dream.php Summer Day's Dream - 2013 - Finborough Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a positive review from [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/10/summer-days-dream-review Summer Day's Dream - Review - Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

"'''The Ruum'''" is a 1953 short story with a pursuit theme by the American author [[Arthur Porges]] and is probably his best known work.

==Plot==
A shape-shifting, indestructible robot—a "Type H-9 Ruum"—is accidentally left behind on earth during the age of the dinosaurs by visiting aliens, and not recovered because their ship is destroyed in a battle. The Ruum's work is collecting different species of animals within a 30-mile radius, weighing 160 pounds (give or take 15 pounds) and preserving them in a state of suspended animation for later retrieval.

Many millions of years later Jim Irwin, a uranium prospector in the [[Canadian Rockies|Canadian Rocky Mountains]], encounters the Ruum's specimens, animals which include modern and prehistoric mammals and a small [[Stegosaurus]]. After he has noticed that the animals are all of a uniform size, and alive, the still-functioning Ruum appears. Shooting it with a rifle does not damage it, and when the approaching blob-shaped Ruum reveals gripping hooks and a probe dripping green liquid, Irwin runs as it pursues him at a steady five miles per hour. It is noted that Irwin weighs 149 pounds.

Fit and military-trained, Irwin attempts to evade and destroy the Ruum. First he hides above his trail and drops a boulder on it, but this also fails to damage it. Then he climbs a sheer cliff, but the Ruum extrudes a climbing claw to the ledge where he is hidden. He tries to dislodge it with a stick, and finds the Ruum can generate an electric shock. He shoots it and dislodges it, but the Ruum is unharmed by the fall and responds by growing multiple claws. Having not had any time for food or sleep, Irwin eventually circles back to his camp by a lake and sets a trap with dynamite. Taking advantage of the Ruum's distraction by a grizzly bear, which it kills, he detonates the dynamite using a pistol bullet.

Dazed by the explosion, he sees the Ruum still unharmed and still approaching. Exhausted and defenseless, he awaits it adding him to its collection. However, it lifts him up, then puts him back down and leaves. Soon afterward, his colleague Walt Leonard arrives by seaplane and rescues him. Safely in the plane, they make plans to bring a helicopter and collect some of the Ruum's specimens in its absence to sell to scientists. Leonard comments on Irwin's haggard appearance, guessing him to have lost 10 pounds during the chase: the reader understands that this caused his weight to become less than the Ruum's weight criterion.

==Sequel==
A sequel to "The Ruum", entitled "A Specimen for the Queen", appeared in the May 1960 edition of ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction''.

==Reprints==
"The Ruum" was selected by [[David Drake]] for his 1988 anthology, ''Things Hunting Men,'' where he commented that this was one of Porges seventy-some "meticulously crafted stories" where "sometimes the problem the protagonist faces really is insoluble." But, here, Jim Irwin never gives up.&lt;ref&gt;David Drake, editor, ''Things Hunting Men."" 1988, Baen Books, {{ISBN|0671654128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Loomis Newberry''' (September 18, 1804 – November 6, 1868) was the son of Amasa and Ruth (Warner) Newberry.&lt;ref&gt;Newberry Genealogy, The Ancestors and Descendants of Thomas Newberry, J. Gardner Bartlett, Published for Limited Circulation by the Author for John Strong Newberry, Boston, Mass. 1914, p. 80, Newberry Library collection, Genealogy Case E 7 .N423&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an American businessman and philanthropist, best known for his [[bequest]] that resulted in the creation of the [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago.
==Career==
Newberry received an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]], but had to decline for health reasons.  In 1822, Newberry and his brother Oliver went into the shipping business in [[Buffalo, New York]].  They moved to [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1826 and founded a successful [[dry goods]] company.  Newberry joined a syndicate that included [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.|William Astor]] and [[Lewis Cass]], investing in real estate in what would become Chicago, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], and [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]; he moved to Chicago in 1833 and continued to prosper in banking and real estate.  He became President of the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], the first railroad built from Chicago.
==Later life and death==
Newberry died in 1868 on the steamship ''Periere'' while en route to France. 

==Legacy==
His will provided for his wife and daughters during their lifetimes, and further provided that if his daughters Julia Rosa and Mary Louisa died without issue, half his remaining estate would go to found a public library in Chicago.  Mary Louisa died in 1874, and Julia Rosa in 1876, neither having married or had children.  By the time that Newberry's widow, Julia Butler Newberry, died in 1885, the [[Chicago Public Library]] was already well-established as a circulating library.  The trustees of Newberry's will therefore used the bequest to establish the Newberry Library as a non-circulating reference library. A [[Chicago Public Schools|Chicago public school]] in Chicago's [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood and Chicago's Newberry Avenue are named for him.

==Personal life==
Newberry was the uncle of U.S. Congressman [[John Stoughton Newberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Pete|title=American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age|date=2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dttCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Grant and Fiske, John|title=Appleton's Cyclopædia of American Biography: Lodge-Pickens|date=1888|publisher=D.

===Brother===
'''Oliver Newberry''' (17 November 1789 &amp;ndash; 30 July 1860), a brother of Walter Loomis Newberry, born in [[East Windsor, Connecticut]]. He served during the War of 1812, and also during the [[Black Hawk War]]. In 1816 he settled in [[Buffalo, New York]], but in 1820 he went to Detroit, where he established himself in business. Soon after his arrival in Detroit, he secured government contracts to furnish all supplies to the numerous forts and Indian trading-posts in the northwest. He was unable to obtain suitable transportation, and was compelled to build a vessel for his own use. Afterward, he constructed other vessels during successive years until he became one of the largest owners of shipping on the lakes.

In 1833, he built the “Michigan,” his first steamboat, which was the largest that until that time had been launched for the lake trade. Several warehouses were constructed by him along the river front in Detroit, where his various schooners, brigs, and steamboats were loaded. He was elected an alderman in Detroit in 1831, and he was associated in the early history of Michigan railroads. For many years, he carried all of his business papers in his hat, and was rarely seen uncovered. He was known as the “commodore” of the lakes, and was sometimes called “the steamboat king.” He died in Detroit.

'''''Zarlor Mercenary''''' is a [[vertically scrolling shooter]] for the [[Atari Lynx]] handheld console, developed by [[Epyx]] and published by [[Atari Corporation]].

==Gameplay==
''Zarlor Mercenary''  is a vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] in which the player controls a spacecraft destroying enemy spaceships and buildings in order to earn money which can be used to buy upgrades between levels. At the end of each level there is a boss ship that needs to be destroyed. Up to four players can play simultaneously using the Comlynx. Noted in the game manual you don't start with life but a fleet of ships. In single-player you start of with four ships, in two player mode you start off with three ships each. With three and four players you only start the game with two ships each.&lt;ref name=manual5&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zarlor Mercenary instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Atari|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven different pilot mercenaries to choose from, each having their own permanent unique weapon and skill.&lt;ref name=manual10&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zarlor Mercenary instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Atari|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Screenshot shop from Zarlor Mercenary.png|thumb|left|Merchant of Venus shop.]]
After each mission there is a shop run by the Merchant of Venus. Here you can purchase and sell extra items. These include extra ships, which is like buying extra lives. ''Speed Up, Wing Cannons, Super Shield (regenerating shielding), Power Shots, Laser, Auto Fire, Mega Bomb, Back Shooter and Side Shooter.'' There are also two items for use in multiplayer mode. ''Invisibility'' so you can hide from other players and ''Back stabber'' which will attack your allied friends and not the enemy as well as protecting your loot so you don't lose it in that life.&lt;ref name=manual12&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zarlor Mercenary instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Atari|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
The war had been going on for years between the Mendicant and the Zarlor races. It wasn't going anywhere so the Zarlors decided to hire outside help. There are six key installations on the Mendicant's home planet of Yorith, all to be cleared out for colonization by the Zarlors.&lt;ref name=manual1&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zarlor Mercenary instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Atari|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', Paul Glancey called ''Zarlor Mercenary'' "a decent-looking shoot 'em up, but quite difficult and not overly exciting to play." &lt;ref name=cvg/&gt; [[Clayton Walnum]] wrote in ''[[STart (magazine)|STart]]'', "As you struggle to destroy the attacking aliens and blast the ground targets, you'll begin to understand what people mean by the term 'control pad ache'. This blastathon will please all players with a thirst for destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Clayton|last=Walnum|authorlink=Clayton Walnum |title=The Lynx Collection|magazine=[[STart (magazine)|STart]]|issue=39 |publisher=Antic Publishing|date=December 1990|page=73 |url=https://archive.org/stream/STart-Magazine-Issue-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 retrospective review, Robert Jung of ''[[IGN]]'' stated "A great no-nonsense action game, perfect for people who love the 'shoot it if it exists' philosophy. The game itself is not easy, and the addition of four-player teamups and cash payments/transfers/power-ups ensure quite a bit of variety to the game. Though there are only six levels, they are quite varied, and should offer many challenging hours to the average player."&lt;ref name="IGN-review" /&gt; Kyle Knight of ''[[AllGame]]'' praised the graphics but stated that "''Zarlor Mercenary'' moves sluggishly".&lt;ref name=allgame/&gt; In July 2013 ''[[GamesRadar]]''{{'}}s Jeff Dunn wrote that ''Zarlor Mercenary'' along with ''[[Blue Lightning (1989 video game)|Blue Lightning]]'' were the "obscure but excellent games" for the Lynx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/chasing-phantoms-history-failed-consoles/2/ |title=Chasing Phantoms - The history of failed consoles |publisher=gamesradar |author=Jeff Dunn |date=July 15, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]], in his account of the battle, reveals a curious fact about Æthelwulf, master of the art of the [[ambush]]: he was a Mercian and not a West Saxon. Not only this, Æthelweard says:

"In fact, the body of the ''[[dux]]'' (leader) mentioned above was carried away secretly and taken into Mercia to the place called Northworthig, but [[Derby]] in the Danish tongue."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hill (2009). ''The Viking Wars of Alfred the Great'', p. 41. {{ISBN|978-1-59416-087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
