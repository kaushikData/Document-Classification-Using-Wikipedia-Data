The '''1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery''', sometimes called the '''Skylight Caper''',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=Catherine Schofield|title=The Skylight Caper: The Unsolved 1972 Theft of the Montreal Museum of  Fine Arts|journal=The Journal of Art Crime|date=Fall 2010|issue=4|pages=57–68|url=http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JAC-Fall-2010-eVersion-Final.pdf|accessdate=August 27, 2017|issn=1947-5934}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place very early in the morning of September 4 of that year. Three [[armed robbery|armed robbers]] used a [[skylight]] under repair to gain entry to [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]] from its roof, tied up the three guards on duty, and left on foot with 18 paintings, including a rare [[Rembrandt]] [[Landscape painting|landscape]] and works by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Thomas Gainsborough]], as well as some [[figurine]]s and jewellery. One of the Brueghels was returned by the thieves as an initiative to start [[ransom]] negotiations. None of the other paintings has ever been recovered and the robbers have never been arrested or even publicly identified, although there is at least one informal suspect.

Collectively, the missing paintings have been valued at $11.7 million in 2017 dollars; although their value may have diminished since the theft as scholars have called the attribution of some of the works into question. However, the Rembrandt alone has been valued at $1 million; in 2003 ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' estimated it to have appreciated in value to $20 million. The thieves appeared to know what works they were looking for; many of the works had been part of ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to many museums in the U.S. and Canada prior to [[Expo 67]], as well as some other special exhibits put on by the museum in the preceding years. It is not only the largest [[art theft]] in Canada but the largest theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="CBC digital archives story"&gt;{{cite news|title=1972: Art heist at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1972-art-heist-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=September 4, 1972|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|title=Today in Canadian Art History: The Largest Art Theft in Canadian History Occurred at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts / Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 31, 2017|publisher=Canada Arts Connect|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720185443/http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|archive-date=2017-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the crime proved difficult in the early going, since it occurred over the [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] holiday weekend, when many of the museum's officials including its director were vacationing far away from [[Montreal]]. It was further complicated by continuing news coverage of the [[Blue Bird Café fire]], Montreal's deadliest [[arson]], three days earlier, dominating the headlines; the next day the [[Munich massacre|killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Munich]] further diminished media coverage. A [[sting operation]] conceived after the thieves returned the Brueghel (later reattributed to his students) and mailed photos of the other works to the museum seeking a ransom payment went awry; a later attempt to negotiate their return cost the museum $10,000 with no results.

The thieves took advantage of weakened security, resulting from the renovations at the museum, which had left the skylight's alarm disabled. The renovations and the security flaws were themselves a consequence of the museum's tightening finances, which had worsened during the 1960s as many of the wealthy [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] community in Montreal that had supported the museum since its founding in 1860 began to leave for [[Toronto]] due to increasing concerns over [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]],&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Unsolved '72 Theft of Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after terrorist acts by the [[Front de libération du Québec]] had led to [[October Crisis|martial law in the Montreal area]] two years earlier. [[Sûreté du Québec]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and [[Interpol]] continue to investigate the crime. Theories as to who might be responsible have ranged from the [[Montreal Mafia]] to Quebec separatists.

==Background==
[[File:New Art Gallery Building, Montreal 06.jpg|thumb|right|The Hornstein Pavilion, the original museum building, in 2013|alt=A three-story light stone building with a flat green-trimmed roof from which the Canadian, Quebec and Montreal flags are flying from poles at the center, seen from a three-quarters angle about midway up its height from across an intersection. On its front face is a recessed entry area with four fluted columns topped by Corinthian capitals. Banners to either side have the word "Chihuly", and the entablature has "Montreal Museum of Fine Arts" and "Musée de Beaux Art du Montréal in capital metal letters]]
The [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] (MMFA) was established in 1860 as the Art Association of Montreal, to encourage art appreciation in the city. It did not start to exhibit works until the late 1870s and 1880s, when wealthy patrons who had prospered from Canada's [[industrialization]] began to donate both cash and works, and it was soon able to build Canada's first space explicitly intended for the exhibition of art. In 1913 it built what is currently its main building, now known as the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion, on Sherbrooke Street in the neighborhood known even today as the [[Golden Square Mile]], because it was home to many of the wealthiest and most successful families in Canada.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part II: 'The Skylight Caper' |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-ii-skylight-caper.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[patronage|patrons]] were predominantly of British descent, all members of Montreal's [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] elite. At the end of the 1950s, their political and economic domination of the city began to yield to its majority [[Québécois people|Francophone]] population, as [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]] began to gain political influence in the province as a whole. Fearing the consequences should the province succeed in seceding, and mindful of the terrorist attacks of the [[Front de libération du Québec]] which had led to [[October Crisis|martial law being declared in the city in 1970]],&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; the Anglophone elite began leaving the city over the course of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

This slowly deprived the museum of much of its traditional financial support. In 1957, Bill Bantey, a former journalist who was appointed the museum's head of [[public relations]], began reaching out for the first time in its history to Francophones, with some success. But the contributions from newer philanthropists in the city were not as much as their predecessors had been able to give, and public funds from the province only covered 40 percent of the museum's annual budget.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

As a result, the museum was having to cut back financially in the early 1970s, going from a strictly private institution to a semi-public [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name="Museum history page"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MMFA 1860–2016|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/about-the-museum/history-of-the-mmfa-1860-2016/|publisher=[[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]|date=2017|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum needed to expand, and it needed to renovate the 1913 [[William Sutherland Maxwell]] [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building on Sherbrooke Street. The latter was particularly unsuited to the demands of a late-20th century art museum, with many cramped rooms and corridors.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt; The museum planned to close it in 1973 for a three-year renovation project.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VI: Closing the museum and another ransom demand|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-vi-closing-museum-and-another.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous thefts and attempts===

On two prior occasions thieves took, or attempted to take, works from the museum.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

One night in 1933, a person who had hidden in the museum overnight passed 14 paintings, mostly by Canadian artists, to someone else through an open window in the women's lavatory. Later the museum received a ransom note asking $10,000 for the return of the paintings. Three months later, the English-language ''[[Montreal Star]]'' and the French ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' each received half of one of the paintings in the mail. A note along with them said if a ransom of 25 percent of the remaining paintings' total value was not paid, they too would be returned in pieces.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The paintings were recovered before that could occur when Paul Thouin, a petty criminal, was arrested after burglarizing a rail freight car. During interrogation, he confessed to stealing the paintings and led police to where he had buried them, wrapped in a [[tarpaulin]] with newspapers, in a one-metre-deep (3&amp;nbsp;ft) sandpit near the village of [[L'Épiphanie, Quebec (town)|L'Épiphanie]] a short distance northeast of Montreal. Thouin, who had shot and killed a police officer attempting to apprehend him in a railroad warehouse, was reportedly terrified at the prospect of being returned to prison for what would likely be a very long time. He committed suicide by [[Strychnine poisoning|poisoning himself with a concealed dose of strychnine]] in the police lockup that night, before he could stand trial.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A gang of armed robbers attempted to steal some [[van Gogh]] paintings during a special exhibition of the artist's work at the museum in 1960. They were foiled and escaped. They have never been identified.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Labour Day weekend 1972 in Montreal===

In Montreal, [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] weekend of 1972 began with two major news events, neither of them positive. On the night of Friday, September 1, four men who had been refused entry to a downtown country-and-western bar for being too intoxicated retaliated by [[arson|setting the club's steps afire]]; [[Blue Bird Café fire|the ensuing blaze]] killed 37, making it the deadliest fire in the city in 45 years.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; On the following evening, the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet national hockey team]] defeated [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|their Canadian counterparts]] 7–3 in the first game of the [[Summit Series]] at the  [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; Canadians, who had expected their team, composed of [[National Hockey League]] stars, to overwhelmingly defeat the Soviets, who had only begun competing in international ice hockey a quarter-century earlier, at what Canadians considered their national sport were stunned.&lt;ref name="Summit Series game 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Red|authorlink=Red Fisher (journalist)|title=Summit Series Game 1: Canada reels at shocking loss|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/summit+series+game+canada+reels+shocking+loss/7176790/story.html|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=September 3, 2012|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans in Montreal were eagerly looking ahead to the next game in the series, to be held Monday evening in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt;

At the museum, the board president, director, and director of security were all on vacation in either the [[United States]] or [[Mexico]] for the holiday weekend. Bantey, the public relations director, was the most senior official in charge.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Robbery==

Shortly after midnight on the morning of September 4, police believe, a group of three men gathered out in front of the museum on [[Sherbrooke Street]]. They went to the museum's west wall, between it and the [[Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul]]. One of the men, who had the same sort of pick-equipped boots used by utility-company workers to climb telephone poles, went up a tree next to the museum and got high enough in it to gain access to the roof. He was able to find a ladder, and lowered it to the other two, who climbed up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Once the group was on the roof, they went to a [[skylight]] that had been covered by a plastic sheet in the course of some ongoing work. They opened the skylight, without setting off any alarm as the plastic sheet had rendered it inoperative, and lowered a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} [[nylon]] rope to the museum's second floor. All three slid down.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It had taken them almost an hour and a half to gain entry to the museum. Shortly after they did, around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., one of the three guards on duty was walking to the kitchen to get some tea. He encountered the thieves, their faces covered by [[ski mask]]s, who fired both barrels of a [[pump action]] shotgun into the ceilings to get his attention and made him lie down on the floor. The noise brought the other two guards, who were unable to resist, and soon all three guards were taken to a lecture hall where they were bound and gagged.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

There, one of the robbers, who carried a .38-caliber [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] handgun,&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; stood guard while the other two removed paintings, jewellery and figurines from their displays and brought them to the museum's shipping department. The thieves originally seemed to have planned to leave via the same skylight they had come in through, but eventually they concluded it would take too much time to put together a system of [[pulley]]s to get themselves and the stolen artwork out. After finding that one of the guards had a set of keys to one of the museum's [[panel truck]]s, they decided instead to flee that way.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, this alternative also went awry. They chose to exit through one of the museum's side entrances, where an alarm went off as they did so. Leaving half their take behind, they fled on foot down Sherbrooke.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Back in the museum, one of the guards worked to free himself. An hour after the robbery ended, around 3 a.m., he succeeded and called Bill Bantey, who told him to call the police. He arrived shortly after the police, along with Ruth Jackson, the museum's curator of decorative arts. After surveying the broken frames, smashed display cases and general disorder the thieves had left, they found that 18 paintings and 38 other pieces had been taken. Collectively they estimated the value of the stolen work at $2 million.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Works stolen==
[[File:Rembrandt- landscape with cottages - stolen.jpg|right|thumb|Rembrandt's ''Landscape with Cottages'', the most valuable of the stolen works, seen here in a black-and-white image from the artist's 1968 [[catalogue raisonné]].|alt=A slightly sepia-toned image of a painting showing a cottage surrounded by dark trees under an overcast late-evening sky]]
All of the stolen paintings were by European artists from the 17th through 19th centuries:

*''Landscape with Vehicles and Cattle'', attributed at the time to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] but later reattributed to his students (subsequently recovered)
*''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon'', Jan Brueghel the Elder
*''La rêveuse á la fontaine'' (''The Dreaming Woman at the Fountain''), [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]
*''Jeune fille accoudée sur le bras gauche'' (''Young Girl Leaning on Her Left Arm''), Corot
*''Landscape with rocks and stream'', [[Gustave Courbet]]
*''Head'', [[Honoré Daumier]]
*''Lioness and Lion in a Cave'', [[Eugène Delacroix]]
*''The Sorceress'', [[Narcisse Virgilio Díaz]]
*''Portrait of Brigadier General Sir Thomas Fletcher'', [[Thomas Gainsborough]]
*''Still Life: Vanitas'', [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]
*''Still Life with a Fish'', de Heem
*''La barrateuse'' (''Young Woman Churning''), [[Jean-François Millet]]
*''Portrait of Madame Millet'', Millet
*''Portrait of a Man, Possibly a Self-portrait'', [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]]
*''Landscape with Cottages'', [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]
*''Head of a Young Man'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]]
*''Portrait of a Lady'', [[François-André Vincent]]
*''Portrait of a Man'', Vincent

Most of the paintings taken were small works around a foot (31&amp;nbsp;cm) along their longest dimension; the three smallest (the Brueghels and Millet's ''La barrateuse'') were less than {{convert|80|sqin}}, smaller than a standard [[Letter (paper size)|letter-size]] piece of paper. The largest was the Courbet, at 28{{frac|7|8}} by 36{{frac|1|8}} inches ({{convert|28.875|by|36.125|in|cm|disp=output only}}), with the Gainsborough and Corot's ''Dreamer'' close behind. It was possible that when the thieves ran away each of them held a batch of smaller paintings in one hand and a larger one in the other.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part V: Comparable Crimes and the 'Masterpieces from Montreal'|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-v-comparable-crimes-and.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thieves also took 38 pieces of jewellery and figurines. Among the former pieces were an 18th-century gold watch once owned by the wife of [[Jacques Viger (1787–1858)|Jacques Viger]], Montreal's first mayor; a 19th-century French blue enamel latch box set with diamonds and two 17th-century Spanish pendants.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Investigation==

Later that morning, Bantey, who had covered the crime beat in Montreal as a journalist prior to his tenure at the museum, held a [[news conference]] to discuss the theft. He identified all the stolen works and described how the robbers had entered the museum and taken them. "They did show quite discriminating taste," he told reporters, "though as far as the objects are concerned, they could do with more art and historical training." In their haste to leave, he noted, the thieves had left behind another Rembrandt as well as works by [[El Greco]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Tintoretto]] that they could as easily have taken.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The news conference was initially effective in publicizing the theft. It, as well as lists of the stolen paintings, were reported as front-page news in many major newspapers across the U.S. and Canada the next morning. As soon as they learned of the theft, Montreal police had also put out the alert to the crossings along the [[Canada–United States border|U.S. border]], about {{convert|60|km}} from Montreal, to look out for the thieves and/or the paintings should anyone attempt to take them to [[New York City]], {{convert|330|mi|km|disp=flip}} farther south.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, further publicity that might have drawn attention to the theft and perhaps helped solve it was stymied by news events of September 5. At that year's [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terrorists]] with [[Black September]] took 11 Israeli athletes hostage, eventually [[Munich massacre|killing them]] along with a German police officer, the following day. Those events were of particular interest in Montreal since the city was preparing to host [[1976 Summer Olympics|the next Olympics]], and as a result further news about the art theft got less priority in the media. The investigation would continue, however.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

From interviews with the three guards, police learned that there had been three thieves. The guards saw two of them, describing them as both about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} in height. One spoke French and the other English. The guards also reported that the two spoke with a third, also a Francophone, whom they never were able to see.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Investigators were immediately struck by the similarity to another recent art theft in the Montreal area. On August 30, another group of three thieves had broken into the summer home of Agnes Meldrum, wife of a Montreal moving-company owner, in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], roughly 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of the city. They had all climbed up a 200-metre (600-foot) cliff from a powerboat on [[Lake of Two Mountains]] to do so. Witnesses said that while they wore hoods to prevent identification, two spoke French and the other, English. Once inside the home they stole paintings worth $50,000 in total.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Inside-job theory===

The presence of two Francophones and one Anglophone, plus the climbing skills involved, led the chief investigator on the case to believe the thieves involved in both incidents had been local, and possibly the same. That, and their apparent knowledge of the skylight's non-functional alarm, had at first fostered a theory that someone on the inside at the museum had aided the thieves in some way. This is a common phenomenon when museums are robbed; two [[New York City Police Department|New York City detectives]] who specialized in [[art theft|art crime]] said as much when commenting about the Montreal case later in 1972.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, the Montreal police considered that speculation too broad to be helpful in focusing their investigation, and evidence did not bear it out. While it was possible that the thieves had indeed actively involved someone working on the skylight, it was as possible that they, or others involved with them, had learned of the security flaw through an overheard remark somewhere. An intense investigation of the workers involved with the skylight did not find any evidence they had passed information about it to anyone criminally inclined.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It was also seen as possible that the robbers had learned of the skylight flaw by simply [[Reconnaissance|reconnoitering]] their target. Roughly two weeks before the theft, someone reported encountering two men sitting on chairs on the roof, wearing sunglasses and smoking. When asked by the person who reported the incident, they claimed to be museum employees. But when investigators looked for the chairs on the roof after the theft, they could not be found. Likewise, no fingerprints or other evidence was left on either the ladder or nylon rope.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Theories of an inside job were also undermined by the thieves' poorly planned exit. After abandoning their improvised plan to leave by the same skylight when they realized it would take too long to set up a system of [[pulley]]s, they instead chose to try to flee in one of the museum's trucks. If they had based that alternative on inside information they had obtained, they would have known how to disable the alarm they set off on the side entrance before opening it. And even if they had not chosen to do so, they would have known it did not sound anywhere else besides the museum—and thus not have abandoned half of what they had stolen to escape on foot.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Selection of works===

While the jewellery and figurines seem to have been chosen only because they could be easily carried, the paintings stolen seem to have been a matter of choice. Their small size, in addition to making them easy to carry and conceal, would also facilitate quick sales. The robbers, and any dealer working with them, might, investigators have speculated, have been looking to sell to private collectors who display their paintings in their homes. Indeed, the pairs of small paintings with similar subject matter by the same artist—Brueghel, Corot, Millet and Vincent—would be excellent choices to decorate a room.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Interest in art in recent years had driven up prices, a phenomenon which had been widely reported in both French- and English-language media, and the thieves would have known even if they had no interest in art what collectors were willing to pay large sums for. Some [[art dealer]]s in the Montreal area refused to discuss their business with police absent a legal order such as a [[subpoena]] or [[warrant (law)|warrant]]. Around Christmas 1972, a ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist reported that, in fact, most of the paintings had been delivered to the homes of wealthy collectors in [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], with a small portion diverted to the U.S. This led police to interrogate two unnamed individuals, but no new leads developed as a result.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The robbers might not even have had to visit the museum to decide what works to take. Half of those they did keep when they ran away had been in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to several cities in the U.S. during the year before [[Expo 67]]. The Rembrandt had been included in a 1969 exhibit to commemorate the tricentennial of the artist's death, and the following year many of the French paintings had been in another exhibit that the press in that language gave great attention to.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

All those works in the special exhibitions would have been depicted in handbooks or catalogues produced in association with them. Only the Brueghels, the Rubens and the Vincent portraits had not been included in those exhibits nor mentioned in any publication save the museum's own catalogue.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Possible early suspects===

Early in their investigation, the police began looking into a group of students at the nearby [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal]]. Mostly French-speaking, they had often visited the museum but had frequently been asked to leave before its official closing time so that the mostly English-speaking staff could [[Tea (meal)|take their tea]]. This had engendered considerable resentment on the students' part.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Police kept five of these students under 24-hour [[surveillance]] for two weeks. Eventually they decided they could not find any evidence, and dropped that part of the investigation. Alain Lacoursière, an art-theft specialist with the Montreal police who investigated the [[cold case]] in later years,&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; by his own account taking it over just before the files were slated to be shredded in 1984,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt; believes the students were not involved. "This crime was organized with a guy in charge who was 35 to 40 years old," well past his student years, he said in 2010.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Ransom negotiations and recovery attempts==

In many art thefts the thieves seek ransom payments in return for the stolen works, and this happened twice in the MMFA thefts. Within a week of the robbery museum director David Giles Carter received a phone call from, he believed, one of the thieves. A man with a gravelly voice and an accent Carter described as "European" gave him directions to a phone booth near [[McGill University]], near which one of the stolen pendants was found.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Soon afterwards, a brown manila [[Port of Montreal]] envelope arrived at the museum with snapshots of the stolen paintings. Carter nicknamed the thief "Port of Montreal" as a result, and dialogue was opened up between the museum and the thieves to negotiate a ransom. At first the thieves demanded $500,000, about a quarter of the works' stated value; later they halved that.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;
[[File:Montreal Central Station.JPG|right|thumb|Montreal Central Station, where one of the stolen paintings was found, in 2008|alt=A dark modern brick building with lighter buildings rising to the top of the image behind it.

Carter demanded the thieves, or whoever it was negotiating on their behalf, give more proof they had the paintings than snapshots. In response, they told the museum's security director to go to a locker in [[Montreal Central Station]]. Inside, he found the Brueghel ''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon''. It is the only one of the stolen paintings that has so far been recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

As a result of these negotiations, approximately a month later the museum's insurance companies and the Montreal police set up a [[sting operation]]. An undercover detective posed as an [[Claims adjuster|insurance adjustor]] and agreed to meet the thieves or their representative in an empty field in one of the city's suburbs, where he hoped the thieves would believe he was ready to hand over $5,000 for another one of the paintings. However, when one of the local police cruisers passed by, completely unaware of the plans, the thieves apparently came to realize what was actually going on and never met the undercover officer. The next day they called Carter and complained that they had been set up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière believes that it was actually the museum and the police who were being set up. The field the robbers had chosen as the meeting site had few nearby houses at the time and could easily have been monitored from some distance away, allowing the robbers to detect even the more subtle police presence necessary to support a sting operation. "It was all a smokescreen", he says. Since the thieves never reopened negotiations afterwards, he believes they never had any intention of returning the paintings at the time and were using the purported ransom negotiations as a [[Feint|diversion]] while they bought themselves more time to sell or otherwise dispose of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The second attempt took place the following year. A few months after the museum closed for its three-year renovation project in May 1973, a caller to a member of the museum's board said he would share where the paintings were hidden for $10,000. André DeQuoy, one of the adjusters handling the case, was involved in the discussion and made it clear that while the insurance companies would pay for information leading to the discovery of the painting, they would not pay for the paintings themselves. After he agreed to deliver it personally to the source, the board made the money available.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The caller had instructed DeQuoy, who was being discreetly followed by police, to go to a certain phone booth in [[downtown Montreal]] one afternoon. From there the caller sent him to other phone booths elsewhere in the city, such as the [[Blue Bonnets (raceway)|Blue Bonnets]] race track, on [[Saint Laurent Boulevard|St. Laurent Boulevard]] and at the [[Henri-Bourassa station]] on the [[Montreal Metro]]. The caller then informed DeQuoy that he had picked up the police tail and DeQuoy was to return to his office and await further instructions while the caller had the unmarked car called off.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

DeQuoy did, and an hour later the caller said the police had been taken care of. Again he was sent out to phone booths, ultimately traveling back and forth across the [[island of Montreal]] to 11 of them, until at 4 a.m. the next morning he was told he could leave the envelope at the base of a sign in a vacant lot on St. Martin Boulevard, then return to the Henri-Bourassa phone booth where the caller would contact him again with the location of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While DeQuoy waited for the call, he let the police know where he had been all night. But the caller never called, so the adjustor returned to his office. At 8 a.m. the caller called him there and told him the paintings were in a motel in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], north of Montreal. An intensive search of the building, however, produced neither the paintings nor any sign they had ever been there. The $10,000 was not recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Later developments==

Due to the minimal news coverage, in January 1973 Bill Bantey put together a circular, ''Attention: Stolen'', depicting the stolen paintings and giving information such as their dimensions, in English and French. The idea was to distribute it widely throughout the international art community and familiarize possible buyers with the stolen works, a practice that was not common in art thefts at the time as most museums preferred to keep the news of their victimization to themselves. Major [[auction]] houses like [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]] would not routinely check for whether art offered for sale through them was on lists of stolen works until 1985. "[We hope that] the works become so catalogued and so well-known that it would be unlikely that any collector or museum buyer could innocently purchase them," Bantey told the ''[[Montreal Gazette|Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The museum and investigators did not make the ransom negotiations in the year after the thefts public knowledge until ten years later. "For years we thought our chances of recovery were better keeping everything quiet," said one police detective, explaining the decision. "But now our hopes are small. Maybe this will stimulate interest and produce something." But while it did allow police to confirm what they have only described as "certain facts", those have apparently not led to any progress in the case.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The recovered Brueghel was kept in storage at the museum by Ruth Jackson for ten years until a new frame could be purchased, after which it was returned to the place it had been exhibited prior to the theft. However, it was later determined that it was not by Brueghel but one of his students; Lacoursière believes the thieves may have chosen to return it due to doubts about its authenticity. It nevertheless remains on exhibit.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A similar fate befell the painting the museum bought with the money it received from its insurers. A group of 20 of them paid out nearly $2 million to settle the claim; they in turn posted a $50,000 reward for the return of the paintings, which under the terms of the insurance policies they legally owned as a result of paying the theft claim. The museum used the money to purchase a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], ''The Leopards'',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; which the museum promoted as the largest Rubens exhibited in Canada. But like the Brueghel, it was later reattributed to the painter's assistants, after a [[art conservation|conservationist]] determined that its red pigments were mixed four decades after Rubens' death,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Alain Lacoursière's biographer Sylvain Larocque Dedicates Sixth Chapter to The Theft of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.|url=http://thelacoursieresociety.com/retired-quebec-art-cop-alain-lacoursiere/|newspaper=The Lacours/Cière Society|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing its value and interest to museumgoers. On the 35th anniversary of the robbery, in 2007, the museum thus returned it to storage and has never put it on display again.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Even the attribution of some of the stolen work has been called into question. When the de Heems were being prepared for their inclusion in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a Parisian [[art history|art historian]] the museum contacted suggested that they were in fact the work of another [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch master]], [[Evert Collier]]. The Rembrandt landscape, while indeed signed and dated by the artist, is one that both he and his students frequently returned to as a subject, and some historians are not entirely confident the painting was his even with the signature. The Gainsborough portrait, too, may in fact be the work of [[Joshua Reynolds]], Gainsborough's rival, since its subject, Thomas Fletcher, is shown wearing a [[Madras]] regimental uniform, which he only started wearing in 1771, three years before his portrait was painted by Reynolds.&lt;ref name="Sezgin site page 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VIII: The theft today |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-viii-theft-today.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the theft, a [[Radio-Canada]] story reported that the insurance companies now considered the paintings' value to have appreciated to $20 million.&lt;ref name="Le crime parfait"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lester|first=Normand|title=Le crime parfait|url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sante/criminalite_justice/clips/5010/|newspaper=[[Radio-Canada]]|language=French|date=September 1, 1992|accessdate=August 29, 2017|quote=Vingt ans plus tard, le journaliste Normand Lester révèle les intentions des compagnies d'assurances de relancer l'enquête pour retrouver les toiles volées. Pour y arriver, elles promettent une récompense de 100 000 $ et plus ... Actuellement, les toiles sont évaluées à plus de 12 millions de dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had consequently increased the reward offer to $100,000. On behalf of the Montreal police, Lacoursière, who began investigating art crime in 1994, offered an additional million in 1999. No one has yet come forward to claim these rewards.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière has had some promising leads over the years that have yielded nothing. He has been told that the paintings, or some of them, are in Italy, and that two Montreal men in the French city of [[Nice]] were possible suspects. One heroin addict he interviewed in [[Vancouver]] seemed to have inside information about the robbery, but everything he knew had been previously reported in the media; when he was asked about two details that police have withheld since only the actual robbers would know them, he was unable to do so.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==="Smith"===

One lead, however, has not been so easy for Lacoursière to dismiss. In 1998, a dealer he had gotten to know introduced him to a man who has been identified publicly only by the [[pseudonym]] "Smith". Smith told the detective he, too, had been a student at the [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal|École des beaux-arts]] at the time of the theft, explaining to him the tension between the students and museum staff.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In the course of their initial conversation, Lacoursière quickly came to believe Smith knew a great deal about the robbery, perhaps more than the police did. Although Smith said he had not been one of the five students kept under surveillance afterward, he told the detective that the rope used by the thieves to enter from the skylight was not gray as had been reported at the time, but yellow like the ones used at the school building. However, upon reviewing the original file and talking with one of the original investigators, Lacoursière found that any information on the colour of the rope had been deliberately withheld by police in order to confirm any later confessions or statements by possible suspects. He considered Smith's statements "highly suspicious".&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière investigated Smith's background, and found that a year after finishing his five-year course at the school, Smith had spent a quarter of a million dollars to buy himself a house and a local [[woodworking]] company. Lacoursière could not determine how Smith might have acquired that amount of money at such a relatively young age. He implied in 2010 it might have been from selling the stolen work.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

According to Lacoursière, Smith even told him that he would at some point in the future tell him something about the robbery. In 2007, during the filming of "L'Colombe d'art" ("The Colombo of Art"), a Radio-Canada special on his career as an art-theft detective, Lacoursière visited Smith and offered him the million-dollar cheque on camera. Smith, however, simply laughed, and invited the camera crew into his house so they could see for themselves that he had none of the stolen paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In 2010, Quebec journalist Sylvain Larocque interviewed Smith by telephone. While he again denied any role in the theft himself, he claimed that professors and porters at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], which the École des beaux-arts had been merged into in 1969, were behind the robbery. They were possibly, he claimed, the same people behind a robbery at the university a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt;

The following year Lacoursière received a link to a video in email from Smith, possibly intended to tease the detective, who by then had retired.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Suspected art thief uses the Internet to tease retired art crime investigator Alain Lacoursière about the location of the paintings stolen from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1972|url=https://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/suspected-art-thief-uses-internet-to.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[Mercedes-Benz]] advertisement from [[Hong Kong]] in which [[bank robbery|bank robbers]] steal a briefcase from a bank vault, then escape in a Mercedes. They elude capture but leave the briefcase behind; inside is a long-lost stolen [[Da Vinci]] painting.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part Two: Alain Lacoursière, the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Video, and Madonna and the Yarnwinder|url=http://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/part-two-alain-lacoursiere-mercedes.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of the paintings' current whereabouts==

The robbery is now largely forgotten, except by the insurance companies and police, who continue to search. "Like a death in the family, you have to let it drop," Bantey says.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; However, in 2009, Paul Lavallée, the museum's director at the time, said it continues to affect the museum, since it might not be able to reclaim the works even if they were recovered. "[W]e would be strapped for funds," he said, even if the insurer offered them to the museum at a discount.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It is possible the paintings may have been destroyed to prevent them from being used as evidence against those in possession of them. But Lacoursière believes they were likely sold through smaller dealers who may not have known they were stolen, or cared if they did, to collectors who likewise keep them private, especially today, since they cannot sell them. He also notes that [[organized crime|criminal organizations]] have found stolen art useful in other ways. During the 1994–2002 [[Quebec Biker war]], he recalls, he learned that one member of the Montreal-area [[Hell's Angels]] served as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] for art thieves, selling stolen art to the [[Italian Mafia]] at 10 percent of its price, who in turn used the names of dead residents of the affluent suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] on faked [[provenance]] forms.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While it is not believed likely that the original robbers were affiliated with organized crime, the ransom attempts may point in that direction. The [[Port of Montreal]] envelope in which the snapshots of the stolen art was sent may suggest the involvement of the [[West End Gang]], an Irish-dominated group that is one of Canada's oldest and strongest criminal organizations, which has historically been based in the city's port. Bantey, however, doubts this based on his familiarity with the city's criminal element from his journalism days. "[They] were interested in prostitution and drugs" exclusively at the time, he says, and no one involved would have had the expertise required to pull off the robbery. Nor does he believe the thieves were motivated by separatism or any other political cause, just a desire to enrich themselves.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Despite some suggestions the paintings, assuming they still exist, are still in Montreal, or elsewhere in Canada or the U.S. or Europe, the investigators who will discuss this believe the art has been moved to [[Latin America]]. Lacoursière notes that many of the West End Gang often spend their winters in, and retire to, [[Costa Rica]]. [[Public Forces of Costa Rica|Police there]] have not responded to requests for assistance from their counterparts in Montreal. Bantey believes the paintings are in [[South America]] somewhere. "I've heard several people I respect say that."&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The police files on the robbery remain closed to public inspection as the case is still considered open.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
An '''accessory''' is a person who assists in the commission of a [[crime]], but who does not actually participate in the commission of the crime as a joint principal. The distinction between an accessory and a [[principal (criminal law)|principal]] is a question of fact and degree:
*The principal is the one whose acts or [[Omission (criminal law)|omissions]], accompanied by the relevant ''[[mens rea]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty mind"), are the most immediate cause of the ''[[actus reus]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty act").
*If two or more people are directly responsible for the ''actus reus'', they can be charged as joint principals (see [[common purpose]]). The test to distinguish a joint principal from an accessory is whether the defendant independently contributed to causing the ''actus reus'' rather than merely giving generalised and/or limited help and encouragement.

==Elements==
In some [[jurisdiction]]s, an accessory is distinguished from an [[accomplice]], who normally is present at the crime and participates in some way. An accessory must generally have knowledge that a crime is being committed, will be committed, or has been committed. A person with such knowledge may become an accessory by helping or encouraging the criminal in some way. The assistance to the criminal may be of any type, including emotional or financial assistance as well as physical assistance or concealment.

===Relative severity of penalties ===

The punishment tariff for accessories varies in different jurisdictions, and has varied at different periods of history. In some times and places accessories have been subject to lesser penalties than ''principals'' (the persons who actually commit the crime). In others accessories are considered the same as principals in theory, although in a particular case an accessory may be treated less severely than a principal. In some times and places accessories before the fact (i.e., with knowledge of the crime before it is committed) have been treated differently from accessories after the fact (e.g., those who aid a principal after a crime has been committed, but had no role in the crime itself). [[Common law]] traditionally considers an accessory just as guilty as the principal(s) in a crime, and subject to the same penalties. Separate and lesser punishments exist by statute in many jurisdictions.

===Conspiracy===

In some situations, a charge of conspiracy can be made even if the primary offense is never committed, so long as the plan has been made, and at least one ''overt act'' towards the crime has been committed by at least one of the conspirators. For example, if a group plans on forging bank checks, and forges the checks but ultimately does not attempt to cash the checks, the group might still be charged with conspiracy due to the overt act of forgery. Thus, an accessory before the fact will often, but not always, also be considered a conspirator. A conspirator must have been a party to the planning of the crime, rather than merely becoming aware of the plan to commit it and then helping in some way.

A person who incites another to a crime will become a part of a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] if agreement is reached, and may then be considered an accessory or a joint principal if the crime is eventually committed. 

In the [[United States]], a person who learns of the crime and gives some form of assistance before the crime is committed is known as an "accessory before the fact".  A person who learns of the crime after it is committed and helps the criminal to conceal it, or aids the criminal in escaping, or simply fails to report the crime, is known as an "accessory after the fact". A person who does both is sometimes referred to as an "accessory before and after the fact", but this usage is less common.

===Criminal facilitation ===

In some jurisdictions, criminal "facilitation" laws do not require that the primary crime be actually committed as a prerequisite for criminal liability. These include state statutes making it a crime to "provide" a person with "means or opportunity" to commit a crime, "believing it probable that he is rendering aid to a person who intends to commit a crime."&lt;ref&gt;(See e.g., N.Y. Penal Law § 115.05 (McKinney 1996); see also Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-1004 (1996); Ky. Rev.
Stat. Ann. § 506.080 (Baldwin 1996); N.D. Cent. Code § 12.1-06-02 (1995). Cited in the U.S. Dept. of Justice report: Report on the Availability of Bombmaking Information, April 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of the crime ===

To be convicted of an accessory charge, the accused must generally be proved to have had actual knowledge that a crime was going to be, or had been, committed. Furthermore, there must be proof that the accessory knew that his or her action, or inaction, was helping the criminals commit the crime, or evade detection, or escape. A person who unknowingly houses a person who has just committed a crime, for instance, may not be charged with an accessory offense because they did not have knowledge of the crime.

=== Exceptions ===

In many jurisdictions a person may not be charged as an accessory to a crime committed by his or her spouse. This is related to the traditional privilege not to testify against an accused spouse, and the older idea that a wife was [[Marital coercion|completely subject]] to the orders of a husband, whether lawful or illegal.

In most jurisdictions an accessory cannot be tried before the principal is convicted, unless the accessory and principal are tried together, or unless the accessory consents to being tried first.

==Usage==
The term "accessory" derives from the [[England|English]] [[common law]], and been inherited by those countries with a more or less Anglo-American legal system. The concept of complicity is, of course, common across different legal traditions. The specific terms ''accessory-before-the-fact'' and ''accessory-after-the-fact'' were used in England and the [[United States]] but are now more common in historical than in current usage.

The spelling '''accessary''' is occasionally used, but only in this legal sense.

==History==
The English legal authority [[William Blackstone]], in his [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|''Commentaries'']], defined an accessory as:
{{quote|II. AN accessory is he who is not the chief actor in the offense, nor present at its performance, but is someway concerned therein, either before or after the fact committed.|Book 4 chapter 3}}
He goes on to define an ''accessory-before-the-fact'' in these words:
{{quote|As to the second point, who may be an accessory before the fact; Sir Matthew Hale 12 defines him to be one, who being absent at the time of the crime committed, does yet procure, counsel, or command another to commit a crime. Herein absence is necessary to make him an accessory; for such procusence is necessary to make him an accessory; for if such procurer, or the like, be present, he is guilty of the crime as principal.}}
and an ''accessory-after-the-fact'' as follows:
{{quote|An accessory after the fact may be, where a person, knowing a felony to have been committed, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon. Therefore, to make an accessory ex post facto, it is in the first place requisite that he knows of the felony committed.18 In the next place, he must receive, relieve, comfort, or assist him. And, generally, any assistance whatever given to a felon, to hinder his being apprehended, tried, or suffering punishment, makes the assistor an accessory. As furnishing him with a horse to escape his pursuers, money or victuals to support him, a house or other shelter to conceal him, or open force and violence to rescue or protect him.}}

==Specific laws==
===Canada===
{{see also|Aiding and abetting}}

The ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' has several sections which deal with accessory to offences:

{{quote|21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who
{{block indent|(a) actually commits it;}}
{{block indent|(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or}}
{{block indent|(c) abets any person in committing it.}}

(2) Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence. 

23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence, receives, comforts or assists that person for the purpose of enabling that person to escape.}}

For these purposes, ''abetting'' means "to encourage or set on" and an ''abettor'' is "an instigator or setter on, one who promotes or procures a crime to be committed..."

Note that under s. 21(2), the words "ought to have known" indicating objective knowledge have been ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in cases where the principal offence requires subjective foresight of the consequences, such as murder (''R v Logan'', [1990] 2 SCR 731).

===France===
Article 121-6 states that "the accomplice to the offence, in the meaning of article 121-7, is punishable as a perpetrator". Article 121-7 distinguishes, in its two paragraphs, complicity by aiding or abetting and complicity by instigation. It thus states that:
{{quote|The accomplice to a felony or misdemeanor is the person who, by aiding or abetting, facilitates its preparation or commission. Any person who, by means of a gift, promise, threat, order or an abuse of authority or powers, provokes the commission of an offence or gives instructions to commit it, is also an accomplice. It follows from this article that in order to incur liability as an accomplice, that person must have participated in the unlawful act of the principal and must have intended the principal to succeed. The theory of ''assumed criminality'' requires that the participation of an accomplice must be linked to an offence actually committed by a principal.}}

===Norway===
Each penal provision in the Norwegian criminal code specifies if it is criminal to aid and abet. Further, when the [[attempt]] is criminal, participating in that attempt is criminal.

===England and Wales===
The law governing complicity in criminal offences originally arose from the common law, but was codified in section 8 of the [[Accessories and Abettors Act 1861]] (as amended by s.65(4) Criminal Law Act 1977), which states:
{{quote|Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of any indictable offence, whether the same be an offence at common law or by virtue of any Act passed or to be passed, shall be liable to be tried, indicted, and punished as a principal offender.}}

====The significance of presence====
Mere presence at the scene of a crime is not enough, even where the defendant remains at the scene to watch the crime being committed. In ''R v Coney'' (1882) 8 QBD 534, where a crowd watched an illegal prize fight, it was held that there must be active, not mere passive, encouragement. Hence, even though the fight would not have taken place without spectators prepared to bet on the outcome, the spectators were acquitted because their presence was accidental. It would have been different if they had attended at the scene of a crime by prior agreement because their mere presence would be an encouragement. Similarly, in ''R v J. F. Alford Transport Ltd'' (1997) 2 Cr. App. R. 326 it was held a reasonable inference that a company, knowing that its employees are acting illegally and deliberately doing nothing to prevent it from being repeated, actually intends to encourage the repetition. This will be a natural inference in any situation where the alleged accessory has the right to control what the principal is doing.

====''Mens rea''====
A ''mens rea'' is required even when it is not required for the principal offender (for example, when the principal commits a [[strict liability]] offence). The defendant must intend to do the acts which he knows will assist or encourage the principal to commit a crime of a certain type. In ''R v Bainbridge'' (1960) 1 QB 129 the defendant supplied cutting equipment not knowing exactly what crime was going to be committed, but was convicted because the equipment supplied was not used in the ordinary way, but for a criminal purpose instead. The accomplice must also know of all the essential matters that make the act a crime, but need not know that the act would amount to a crime because ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]''. In ''National Coal Board v Gamble'' (1959) 1 QB 11 the operator of a weighbridge was indifferent as to whether the principal committed the offence which is generally not a sufficient ''mens rea'', but the NCB was convicted because the act of the employee was an act of sale (see [[vicarious liability]]).

''Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority'' (1986) AC 112 is an example of a type of case where the uncertainties of the precise meaning of [[Intention in English law|intention]] effectively confer a sometimes welcome discretion on whether to impose responsibility. That case concerned the question of whether a doctor giving contraceptive advice or treatment to a girl under the age of 16 could be liable as an accessory to a subsequent offence of unlawful sexual intercourse committed by the girl's sexual partner. The  Lords held that generally this would not be the case (the action was a civil one for a declaration) since the doctor would lack the necessary intention (even though he realised that his actions would facilitate the intercourse). One rationale for the decision would be that a jury would not infer intention in such circumstances if they thought that the doctor was acting in what he considered to be the girl's best interests.

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]], under section 293 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]], a person may be convicted of, and punished for, a contravention of any enactment, notwithstanding that he was guilty of such contravention as [[art and part]] only.

===United States===
U.S. jurisdictions (that is, the federal government and the various state governments) have come to treat accessories before the fact differently from accessories after the fact. All U.S. jurisdictions have effectively eliminated the distinction between accessories before the fact and principals, either by doing away with the category of "accessory before the fact" entirely or by providing that accessories before the fact are guilty of the same offense as principals.  The Model Penal Code's definition of accomplice liability includes those who at common law were called accessories before the fact; under the Model Penal Code, accomplices face the same liability as principals.  It is now possible to be convicted as an accessory before the fact even though the principal has not been convicted or (in most jurisdictions) even if the principal was acquitted at an earlier trial.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne LaFave, ''Substantive Criminal Law'' § 13.1(e) (2d ed. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, modern U.S. jurisdictions punish accessories after the fact for a separate criminal offense distinct from the underlying crime and having a different (and less severe) punishment.  Some states still use the term "accessory after the fact"; others no longer use the term, but have comparable laws against hindering apprehension or prosecution, [[obstruction of justice]], [[tampering with evidence]], harboring a felon, or the like.  Such crimes usually require proving (1) an intent to hinder apprehension or prosecution and (2) actual aid in the form of either (a) harboring the criminal, (b) providing specified means (such as a disguise) to evade arrest, (c) tampering with evidence, (d) warning the criminal of impending arrest, or (e) using force or deception to prevent the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne LaFave, ''Substantive Criminal Law'' § 13.6(a) (2d ed. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law has followed both these trends.  The U.S. Code effectively treats as principals those who would traditionally have been considered accessories before the fact at common law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2|title=18 U.S. Code § 2 - Principals|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|(a) Whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures the commission of an offense, is punishable as a principal.

(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense, is punishable as a principal.}}

However, federal law treats accessories after the fact differently from principals. Accessories after the fact face a maximum of only half the fine and half the prison time that principals face. (If the principal faces the death penalty or life imprisonment, accessories after the fact face up to 15 years' imprisonment.) Federal law defines accessories after the fact as persons who provide criminals with certain aid in order to hinder a criminal's apprehension or prosecution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3|title=18 U.S. Code § 3 - Accessory after the fact|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10278">The [[Internet]] uses the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) to associate numeric computer [[IP address]]es with human readable names. The top level of the domain name hierarchy, the [[DNS root]], contains the [[top-level domain]]s that appear as the suffixes of all Internet [[domain name]]s. The most widely used (and first) DNS root is administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). In addition, several organizations operate '''alternative DNS roots''', often referred to as '''alt roots'''. These alternative domain name systems operate their own root [[nameserver]]s and commonly administer their own specific name spaces consisting of custom top-level domains.

The [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB) has spoken out strongly against alternate roots in {{IETF RFC|2826}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2826}} (informational), ''IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root'', Internet Architecture Board, The Internet Society (May 2000), Quote: "There is no getting away from the unique root of the public DNS." (page 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The DNS root zone consists of pointers to the authoritative domain name servers for all TLDs (top-level domains). The root zone is hosted on a collection of root servers operated by several organizations around the world that all use a specific, approved list of domains that is managed by ICANN. By contrast, alternative roots typically include pointers to all of the TLD servers for domains delegated by ICANN, as well as name servers for other, custom top-level domains that are not sanctioned by ICANN.  Some alternate roots are operated by the organizations that manage these alternative TLDs.

Zach Bastick proposes that alternative DNS roots have allowed for more democratic control of the Internet:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastick|first=Zach|title=Our Internet and Freedom of Speech ‘Hobbled by History’: Introducing Plural Control Structures Needed to Redress a Decade of Linear Policy|journal=European Commission: European Journal of ePractice|year=2012|series= Policy lessons from a decade of eGovernment, eHealth &amp; eInclusion|issue=15|pages=97–111|url=http://www.epractice.eu/files/Journal_Volume_15_PART8_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The implementation of alternative gTLDs predates any significant debate on name space extension by official actors, and this exemplifies how democratising the DNS alters the pace of developing Internet policy, the nature of decisions that justify that policy development, and political dynamics and user autonomy in the network infrastructure." (p.103)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unless one specifically changes their [[DNS resolver|DNS resolution]] settings, alternative DNS top level domains are generally unreachable, and very few [[Internet service provider]]s provide this configuration by default.

==Alternative DNS providers==
Some organizations provide alternate DNS root services, such as additional [[Top-level domain|Top Level Domains]].

''Namecoin'' supports the alternative top-level domain .bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bit.namecoin.org/|title=Dot-Bit: Secure Decentralized DNS|website=bit.namecoin.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative domain .bit is resolved by any computer running a namecoin full node and bridging software such as, nmcontrol, ncdns, and the freespeechme browser plugin. 
A centralized server which bridges DNS and Namecoin can also be used, meaning that users who use the centralized server do not benefit from Namecoin's decentralized and secure nature. Alternatively, its resolution is also provided by OpenNIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.opennicproject.org/dotBitTLD|title=.bit TLD:OpenNIC Wiki|website=wiki.opennicproject.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Nations===
''New Nations'' provides domains to nation-states or regional efforts that are not listed in the [[ISO 3166-1]] standard and therefore do not have a [[Country code top-level domain|ccTLD]] delegated to them. Examples are [[Kosovo|.ko]] (''Kosovo''), [[Kurdish people|.ku]] (''Kurdish people''), [[Tamil Eelam|.te]] (''Tamil Eelam''), [[Tibet|.ti]] (''Tibet''), and [[Uyghur people|.uu]] (''Uyghur people''). Domain name resolution is provided by a peering agreement with OpenNIC or New Nations' own DNS servers.

===Open Root Server Network (ORSN)===
{{further|ORSN}}
Open Root Server Network (ORSN) is a network of Domain Name System root nameservers for the Internet. ORSN root zone information is normally kept in synchronization with the "official" root nameservers coordinated by ICANN. ORSN Public DNS Servers are operated by the community of ORSN, providing Domain Name System access freely for everyone, without any limitation. ORSN public DNS servers respect privacy and do not log usage.  {{Cite web|url=http://www.orsn.org/en/faq/|title=Open Root Server Network - General Information about this Project|website=ORSN.org|access-date=2017-07-28}}

===OpenNIC===
{{further|OpenNIC}}
OpenNIC is a user owned and controlled alternative to [[InterNIC]] and ICANN providing a non-national democratic alternative to traditional domain registries. OpenNIC servers are able to resolve all ICANN top-level domains, some OpenNIC original top-level domains, and the resolution of other Alternate DNS Roots with which they have reached peering agreements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.opennicproject.org/FAQ|title=What is OpenNIC?:OpenNIC Wiki|website=wiki.opennicproject.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.opennicproject.org/PeerTLDs|title=OpenNIC Peers:OpenNIC Wiki|website=wiki.opennicproject.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defunct providers==

===eDNS===
eDNS (Enhanced Domain Name Service) was founded by a coalition of ISPs led by [[Karl Denninger]] of the Chicago-area MCSNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9707181217/schism-hits-domain-name-system|first=Will|last=Rodger|title=Schism hits Domain Name System|work=Inter@ctive Week|date=February 1997|volume=4|number=5|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Rogue-domains-revolt/2100-1023_3-275957.html|title=Rogue domains revolt|work=[[CNET]]|date=1997-03-04|accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased operation in 1998. It served the following domains:  biz (general business use), corp (corporations), fam (for and about family), k12 (for and about children), npo (non-profit organizations), per (personal domains), web (web-based sites, Web pages).

===Open RSC===
One of the notable challengers to ICANN's control of the DNS namespace was ''Open RSC'' (''Open Root Server Confederation''), a group that grew out of private discussions and developed into a public [[Listserv|mailing list]].  It grew large enough that the group decided to submit an application to the United States government to run the DNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/ORSC_PRO.htm |title=ORSC proposal of 8 October 1998 |publisher=Ntia.doc.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109182608/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/ORSC_PRO.htm| archivedate= 9 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization posted bylaws and articles of incorporation outlining ORSC's position following extensive public discussion regarding the manner in which the DNS was operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/bylaws.html |title=ORSC bylaws |publisher=Ntia.doc.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091021022746/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/bylaws.html| archivedate= 21 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/ORSC_PRO.htm |title=ORSC articles of incorporation |publisher=Ntia.doc.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109182608/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/orsc/ORSC_PRO.htm| archivedate= 9 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICANN chairwoman [[Esther Dyson]] acknowledged adopting features such as membership from ORSC in her response to the United States Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/press/icann111098.htm |title=NTIA Reviewing ICANN November 6 Submission |publisher=Ntia.doc.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091108032422/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/press/ICANN111098.htm| archivedate= 8 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ORSC publishes a root zone containing additional top level domains not found in the [[ICANN]] root zone.

===RealNames===
Microsoft offered the [[RealNames]] service on its Internet Explorer browser address bar. RealNames, to users of Internet Explorer, was in effect a [[domain registry]]. RealNames shut down operations in 2002 following a decision by Microsoft to redirect the 1 billion page views per calendar quarter that RealNames was resolving from the browser address bar into its [[MSN search engine]].{{Fact|date=March 2018}}

==Early life and education==
Bronstein's Ukrainian-Polish Jewish family had moved to the United States to seek refuge from the pogroms. He was born in Brooklyn to Louis and Lillian (née Spielman) Bronstein, who both worked in sales. Bronstein attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]], then the [[City College of New York]] before graduating from [[New York Law School]] with an LL.B.&lt;ref name=bronbyrobnytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=Alvin Bronstein, Lawyer Who Fought Prison Abuse, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/us/alvin-bronstein-lawyer-who-fought-prison-abuse-dies-at-87.html|accessdate=October 30, 2015|work=New York Times|date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alvin J.

==Career==
He began his career working in the American South during the Civil Rights Movement, becoming the Chief Staff Counsel of the Lawyers’ Constitutional Defense Committee from 1964 to 1968 in Jackson, Mississippi. He litigated civil rights cases during that time in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, and represented the major civil rights organizations in the South.&lt;ref name="acluga" /&gt; He was a Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government, [[Harvard University]], from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref name="prisoncommission" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iop.harvard.edu/Programs/Fellows-Study-Groups/Former-Fellows/Alvin-J._Bronstein |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703101208/http://www.iop.harvard.edu/Programs/Fellows-Study-Groups/Former-Fellows/Alvin-J._Bronstein |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Pace Law School]]’s Practitioner-in-Residence in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pace.edu/page.cfm?doc_id=31514&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He served as the director of the National Prison Project from 1972 until 1995. During this time, he argued three cases in the United States Supreme Court, [[Hudson v. McMillan]] (1992), Block v. Rutherford (1984) ([http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/468/576/]), and Montanye v. Haynes (1976) ([http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/236/]). After his departure from the National Prison Project, he has been a consultant for the ACLU. He also served as a board member of Penal Reform International (London) and a member of the Assembly of Delegates for the World Organization Against Torture (Geneva).&lt;ref name="acluga" /&gt; 

He had three children from his first marriage to Kate Ransohoff- Lisa Snitzer of Philadelphia, Susie Renner of Piedmont, Calif., and Laura Zatta of Lowell, Mass.; a daughter from his second marriage to Julie Bronstein- Sarah Bronstein of Berkeley, Calif. He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Jan Elvin. Their son, Benjamin Bronstein, lives in the District of Columbia. Bronstein also had seven grandchildren- Ian, Zoe, Sasha, Daniel, Ava, Corinna, and Sadie.

Bronstein died of Alzheimer's disease on October 24, 2015, in [[Centreville, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=bronbyrobnytobit/&gt;

'''''Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom''''' [2013] ECHR 362 is a [[UK human rights|UK]] and [[European Court of Human Rights|European]] and [[international human rights]] case on political spending at elections. It held that the United Kingdom's ban on spending money on political advertising, under the [[Communications Act 2003]] section 321(2), was fully compatible with freedom of expression under the [[ECHR article 10]].

While reflecting most of the election laws in the democratic world, the case stands in heavy contrast to ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'' and ''[[Citizens United v FEC]]'', as decided by majorities of the [[US Supreme Court]] as well as ''[[Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth]]'' as decided by the majority of the [[High Court of Australia]].

==Facts==
The UK's [[Communications Act 2003]] section 321(2) bans political and industrial dispute related adverts. Animal Defenders International had an advertisement, not offensive, which was themed 'My Mate's a Primate'. The Broadcasting Advertising Clearance Centre refused to let it show because it was deemed to fall within the prohibition on political advertising. They said this breached their [[ECHR article 10]] right to freedom of expression.

==Judgment==

===House of Lords===
The House of Lords held unanimously that there was no breach of ECHR article 10, because the Communications Act 2003 was designed to level the playing field of expression, and therefore empower everyone's freedom of expression to the utmost.&lt;ref&gt;[2008] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/15.html UKHL 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving the leading judgment, [[Lord Bingham]] said the only issue (not interference, not legitimate aim pursued) was whether the restriction was 'necessary in a democratic society'. If views are debated then truth prevails over time, and the law was to ensure equality of debate. If parties can buy coverage proportionate to their resources, this would distort. The case of ''[[VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v Switzerland]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2002) 34 EHRR 4&lt;/ref&gt; was considered, but found to be inapplicable to the British context, where the full strength of arguments against money in politics was considered.

{{Cquote|28. The fundamental rationale of the democratic process is that if competing views, opinions and policies are publicly debated and exposed to public scrutiny the good will over time drive out the bad and the true prevail over the false. It must be assumed that, given time, the public will make a sound choice when, in the course of the democratic process, it has the right to choose. But it is highly desirable that the [[playing field]] of debate should be so far as practicable [[level playing field|level]]. This is achieved where, in public discussion, differing views are expressed, contradicted, answered and debated. It is the duty of broadcasters to achieve this object in an impartial way by presenting balanced programmes in which all lawful views may be ventilated. It is not achieved if political parties can, in proportion to their resources, buy unlimited opportunities to advertise in the most effective media, so that elections become little more than an [[auction]]. Nor is it achieved if well-endowed interests which are not political parties are able to use the power of the purse to give enhanced prominence to views which may be true or false, attractive to progressive minds or unattractive, beneficial or injurious. The risk is that objects which are essentially political may come to be accepted by the public not because they are shown in public debate to be right but because, by dint of constant repetition, the public has been conditioned to accept them. The rights of others which a restriction on the exercise of the right to free expression may properly be designed to protect must, in my judgment, include a right to be protected against the potential mischief of partial political advertising.

29. I do not think the full strength of this argument was deployed in ''[[VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v Switzerland|VgT]]''. And in that case the applicant was seeking to respond, with a wholly inoffensive advertisement, to commercials broadcast by the meat industry... Hypothetical examples spring readily to mind: adverts by well-endowed multi-national companies seeking to thwart or delay action on climate change; adverts by wealthy groups seeking to ban abortion; or, if not among member states of the Council of Europe, adverts by so-called patriotic groups supporting the right of the citizen to bear arms. Parliament was entitled to regard the risk of such adverts as a real danger, none the less so because legislation has up to now prevented its occurrence.}}

Lord Scott, while concurring with the result, dissented on one point at paragraph 44, by suggesting that ECHR cases were not actually binding on the UK courts.

[[Baroness Hale]] gave a concurring judgment.

{{Cquote|47. There was an elephant in the committee room, always there but never mentioned, when we heard this case. It was the dominance of advertising, not only in elections but also in the formation of political opinion, in the United States of America. Enormous sums are spent, and [[Campaign finance in the United States|therefore have to be raised]], at election times: it is estimated that the disputed 2000 elections for President and Congress cost as much as US$3 billion. [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|Attempts to regulate campaign spending]] are struck down in the name of the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press": see particularly ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'', 424 US 1 (1976). ''[[A fortiori]]'' there is no limit to the amount that pressure groups can spend on getting their message across in the most powerful and pervasive media available.

48. In the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in Europe, we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest spenders. Our democracy is based upon more than one person one vote. It is based on the view that each person has equal value. "Within the sphere of democratic politics, we confront each other as moral equals" ([[Bruce Ackerman|Ackerman]] and Ayres, ''Voting with Dollars'', 2003, p 12). We want everyone to be able to make up their own minds on the important issues of the day. For this we need the free exchange of information and ideas. We have to accept that some people have greater resources than others with which to put their views across. But we want to avoid the grosser distortions which unrestricted access to the broadcast media will bring.

49. So this case is not just about permissible restrictions on [[freedom of expression]]. It is about striking the right balance between the two most important components of a democracy: freedom of expression and [[equality before the law|voter equality]]. There are aspects of the ban on broadcasting political advertisements which no-one disputes: in particular, advertising by candidates for election, or by political parties, whether or not at election times. But this case is about advertising by a particular interest group which campaigns for changes in the law.

50. The proposed advertisement shows an animal's cage, in which a chained girl gradually emerges from the shadows into view; the screen goes black and the following messages appear: "A chimp has the mental age of a 4 year old"; "Although we share 98% of our genetic makeup they are still caged and abused to entertain us"; "Please help us to stop their suffering by making a donation today"; the final shot is of a monkey in a cage in exactly the same position as the girl was in. It takes little imagination to understand how powerful this would be, much more powerful than a static image on a bill-board or printed page, and beamed into every households in the land where anyone was watching commercial television at the time. It is also clearly part of a campaign for change in the law, and thus prohibited by sections 319(2)(g), 321(2)(b), and 321(3)(b), as well as by sections 319(2)(g) and 321(2)(a), which prohibit any advertising by bodies whose objects are wholly or mainly of a political nature.

51. For all the reasons which my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, has so eloquently and comprehensively given, I agree that the ban as it operates in this case is not incompatible with the appellants' Convention rights. It is a balanced and proportionate response to the problem: they can seek to put their case across in any other way, but not the one which so greatly risks distorting the public debate in favour of the [[Wealth|rich]]. There has to be the same rule for the same kind of advertising, whatever the cause for which it campaigns and whatever the resources of the campaigners. We must not distinguish between causes of which we approve and causes of which we disapprove. Nor in practice can we distinguish between small organisations which have to fight for every penny and rich ones with access to massive sums. Capping or rationing will not work, for the reasons Lord Bingham gives.}}

Lord Carswell and [[Lord Neuberger]] concurred with Lord Bingham.

===European Court of Human Rights===
By a bare majority (9:8), the European Court of Human Rights held the ban on political advertising under the [[Communications Act 2003]] section 321(2) was fully compatible with [[ECHR article 10]]. The majority reasoned as follows.

{{Cquote|117. The Court, for its part, attaches considerable weight to these exacting and pertinent reviews, by both parliamentary and judicial bodies, of the complex regulatory regime governing political broadcasting in the United Kingdom and to their view that the general measure was necessary to prevent the distortion of crucial public interest debates and, thereby, the undermining of the democratic process.

118. In addition, the Court considers it important that the prohibition was specifically circumscribed to address the precise risk of distortion the State sought to avoid with the minimum impairment of the right of expression. It only applies therefore to advertising given its inherently partial nature (Murphy, at § 42), to paid advertising given the danger of unequal access based on wealth and to political advertising (as explained at paragraph 99 above) as it was considered to go to the heart of the democratic process. It is also confined to certain media (radio and television) since they are considered to be the most influential and expensive media and to constitute a cornerstone of the regulatory system at issue in the present case. The limits placed on a restriction are important factors in the assessment of its proportionality (Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], § 75, cited above). Consequently, a range of alternative media were available to the applicant and these are outlined at paragraph 124 below.}}

In various dissents, a minority of the court, while stressing that money should never buy elections, objected to a total ban on spending.

An '''articled clerk'''  is someone who is studying to either be an accountant or a lawyer. In doing so they are put under the supervision of someone already in the profession, usually for two years. This can be compared as being an intern for a company; the only difference is once the two years is over the trainee becomes the trainer.  Trainees are obligated to sign a contract agreeing to the terms of being an articled clerk. The articled clerk signs a contract, known as "articles of clerkship", committing to a fixed period of employment. ''Wharton's Law Lexicon'' defines an articled clerk as "a pupil of a solicitor, who undertakes, by articles of clerkship, continuing covenants, mutually binding, to instruct him in the principles and practice of the profession".{{sfn|Burrill|1859|p=134}} The contract is with a specific [[partnership|partner]] in the firm and not with the firm as a whole.

Apprentice [[architect]]s can also be articled. [[Henry Percy Adams (architect)|Henry Percy Adams]] articled to Britwen Binyon (1846&amp;ndash;1909), architect.&lt;ref name=adamspainter&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.suffolkartists.co.uk/index.cgi?choice=painter&amp;pid=15 |title=ADAMS, (Harry) Percy |publisher=www.suffolkartists.co.uk |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
In India, the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] undergo an articleship programme for a period of 3/3.5 years as the case may be, CA Students after clearing CA-IPCC/Intermediate/Inter Group 1 or Both Group are required to registered himself with a partner of a CA Firm duly registered with the Institute. Those Students during the period of articleship are also known as Articled Clerk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Sri Lanka ==
In Sri Lanka, student members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]] are required to serve as a clerk serving under articles with a member of the Institute in practice or with a member of the Institute who is a salaried employee in the service of a firm of accountants for a minimum three-year practical training period. They are known as Articled clerks during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/pdf/members/parliament_act.pdf Act of Incorporation And Regulations Of The Institute Of Chartered Accountants Of Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
The '''best evidence rule''' is a legal principle that holds an original copy of a document as superior evidence.  The rule specifies that secondary evidence, such as a copy or [[facsimile]], will be not admissible if an original document exists and can be obtained.&lt;ref name="Law Dict"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Legal Terms and Definitions|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=57|website=Law Dictionary|publisher=ALM Network of Legal Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule has its roots in 18th-century British law.&lt;ref name=ROTlaw&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|url=http://www.rotlaw.com/legal-library/what-is-the-best-evidence-rule/ |title=What is the best evidence rule? |website=Rottenstein Law Group LLC|publisher=Rottenstein Law Group|accessdate=Feb 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
The best evidence rule has its origins in the 18th century case ''Omychund v Barker'' (1745) 1 Atk, 21, 49; 26 ER 15, 33. Wherein Lord Harwicke stated that no evidence was admissible unless it was "the best that the nature of the case will allow".&lt;ref name=ROTlaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''The Law of Evidence'' Dublin 1754&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Blackstone's Criminal Practice]] the best evidence rule in England and Wales as used in earlier centuries "is now all but defunct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hooper |editor2=Ormerod |editor3=Murphy |title=Blackstone's Criminal Practice |edition=2008 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-922814-0 |page=2285|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]] MR says that "nowadays we do not confine ourselves to the best evidence. We admit all relevant evidence. The goodness or badness of it goes only to weight and not to admissibility."&lt;ref&gt;''Garton v. Hunter'' [1969] 1 All ER 451, [1969] 2 QB 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Federal courts the best evidence rule is part of Article X of the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rules 1001-1008).&lt;ref name=CALI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Colin|title=Evidence: Best Evidence Rule|url=http://www.cali.org/books/evidence-best-evidence-rule|website=Center for Computer Assisted Legal Instruction|publisher=CALI|accessdate=Feb 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule specifies the guidelines under which one of the parties of a court case may request that it be allowed to submit into evidence a copy of the contents of a document, recording or photograph at a trial when the "original document is not available."&lt;ref name=CALI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; If the party is able to provide an acceptable reason for the absence of the original then "secondary evidence" or copies of the content in the original document can be admitted as evidence.  The best evidence rule is only applied in situations in which a party attempts to substantiate a non-original document submitted as evidence during a trial.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unknown author|title=Best Evidence Rule|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/best_evidence_rul|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=Feb 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admissibility of documents before state court systems may vary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6478">The '''British Court for Japan''' (formally '''Her Britannic Majesty's Court for Japan''') was a [[court]] established in [[Yokohama]] in 1879 to try cases against [[British subjects]] in [[Japan]], under the principles of [[extraterritoriality]]. The court also heard appeals from British [[Consulates in extraterritorial jurisdictions|consular courts]] in Japan.{{sfn|Chang|1984}} Appeals from the British Court for Japan lay to the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] based in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]].

==Background==

Britain acquired [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]] in Japan under the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] of 1858.   [[British Japan Consular Service|British Consular officials]] sat as judges [[consular court]]s in all [[treaty ports]] in Japan.   Until 1865 appeals from decisions of consular officials were made to the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]].  From 1865 appeals from decisions could be made to the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]].  Judges of the Shanghai Supreme Court were also empowered to travel to Japan to try cases on circuit.

==Establishment of Court for Japan==

In 1871, an attempt was made to establish a branch of the Shanghai Supreme Court in Yokohama by having an acting assistant judge from Shanghai, [[Nicholas John Hannen]], based in Yokohama.  Hannen ruled this arrangement to be invalid in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''Findlay Richardson &amp; Co vs Pitman &amp; Co'', ''Japan Weekly Mail'', 20 July 1872, pp. 445-447&lt;/ref&gt;   Judges from Shanghai remained in Yokohama but sat as a judge of the Kanagawa Consular Court. In 1877 and 1878 the legality of these arrangements were challenged by the Japanese Government when the acting law secretary, [[Hiram Shaw Wilkinson]], ruled that the import of medicinal opium into Japan was legal.{{sfn|Chang|1984}}&lt;ref&gt;''Reg (on the prosecution of the Imperial Customs) vs John Hartley'', ''[[Japan Times]]'', 2 March 1878&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Government determined to establish a formal court in Japan.

On 1 January 1879 the British Court for Japan was created in Yokohama.   The court had had first instance jurisdiction in Kanagawa and appellate jurisdiction from other consular courts in Japan.  Appeals from the Court for Japan lay to Supreme Court in Shanghai.{{sfn|Chang|1984}}

==Court buildings==

In Yokohama, the Court for Japan sat in the British Consulate building in Yokohama.  The building was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].  In other cities, when the Judge of the court went on circuit to outlying cities he would generally sit in courts in British consulate buildings but on occasions where important cases of great public interest were being heard would use other premises.

==End of extraterritoriality==

Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation]] signed in 1894, Britain gave up extraterritorial rights in Japan with effect from July 1899. The Court for Japan officially heard its last case, which had been filed before the end of July 1899, in early 1900.&lt;ref&gt;''Kobe Weekly Chronicle'', 17 January 1900, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
The court tried cases of all descriptions, all the time applying the laws of England in Japan, including murder trials before juries, divorce cases, commercial disputes and cases of petty theft.

Famous cases were:

* The ''[[Normanton Incident|Normanton]]'' case where Captain Drake of the ''Normanton'' was prosecuted for the [[manslaughter]] of 30 Japanese passengers who died on the ''Normanton'' when it sunk.
* The ''[[Japanese cruiser Chishima|Chishima]]'' case where the Japanese government sued the British Government for the loss of a new navy ship, the ''Chishima.''
* The trial, in 1897, of Edith Carew for the [[arsenic poisoning]] of her husband in Yokohama.&lt;ref&gt;''North China Herald'', 12 February 1897, pp. 259-264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A book has also been written on this case.{{cite book |last= Whittington-Egan|first= Molly|date= |title= Murder on the Bluff: Carew Poisoning Case|url= |location= |publisher= Neil Wilson Publishing|page= |isbn= 1-89778452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judges==

Between 1879 and 1900 the court had 4 full-time judges.&lt;ref&gt;Sourced from Foreign Office List entries for each individual&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges were:

*[[Richard Rennie|Richard Temple Rennie]] (Judge, Court for Japan, 1879 to 1881)
*[[Nicholas John Hannen]] (Judge, Court for Japan 1881 to 1891)
*[[Robert Mowat|Robert Anderson Mowat]] (Judge, Court for Japan,1891 to 1897)
*[[Hiram Shaw Wilkinson]] (Judge, Court for Japan, 1897 to 1900) (also acting Judge 1894-1895)

From 1871 to 1877 two judges from Shanghai were based in [[Yokohama]].

*[[Nicholas John Hannen]] (acting assistant judge 1871-1874)
*[[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] (assistant judge 1874-1877)

Between 1865 and 1872, Sir [[Edmund Grimani Hornby]], the Chief Judge of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] also heard cases in Japan when traveling on circuit.

A number of consular officials also sat as acting Judge of the Court for Japan when the Judge was on leave or otherwise unavailable.  These included:

*[[Russell Brooke Robertson]] 1881-1883
*[[John Carey Hall]] 1888
*[[George Jamieson (diplomat)|George Jamieson]] 1888-1889 (from the China Consular Service)

The title '''canon ''Episcopi''''' (also ''capitulum Episcopi'') is conventionally given to a certain passage found in medieval [[canon law]]. 
The text possibly originates in an early 10th-century  [[penitential]], recorded by  [[Regino of Prüm]]; it was included in [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian's]] authoritative [[Corpus juris canonici]] of c. 1140  (''Decretum Gratiani'', causa 26, quaestio 5, canon 12) and as such became part of [[canon law]] during the High Middle Ages.

It is an important source on folk belief and surviving pagan customs in [[Middle Francia|Francia]] on the eve of the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 
The folk beliefs described in the text reflect the residue of pre-Christian beliefs at about one century after the [[Carolingian Empire]] had been [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Christianized]]. Its condemnation of the belief in [[witchcraft]] was an important argument used by the opponents of the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witch trials]] during the 16th century, such as [[Johann Weyer]].

The conventional title "canon ''Episcopi''" is based on the text's incipit,  and was current from at least the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Antonio Iofreu, ''[https://books.google.ch/books?id=hsbdQDFol9QC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22canon+episcopi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EFHwTpW9MbD54QS5x_myAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22canon%20episcopi%22&amp;f=false Defensa del Canon Episcopi]'', in Pedro Cirvelo (ed.), ''Tratado en el qual se repruevan todas las supersticiones y hechizerias '' printed by Sebastian de Cormellas (1628)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
It is perhaps first attested in the ''Libri de synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis'' composed by [[Regino of Prüm]] around 906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey Burton | last=Russell | authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell  | title=Witchcraft in the Middle Ages | publisher=Cornell University Press | year=1972 }} pp.&amp;nbsp;75–82.  {{cite web | title=Book 8, Chapter 9, A History of the Spanish Inquisition, vol. 4 | url=http://libro.uca.edu/lea4/8lea9.htm | accessdate=October 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was included in [[Burchard of Worms]]' ''Decretum'' (compiled between 1008 and 1012), an early attempt at collecting all of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]
&lt;!--note, this is incorrect. figure out what "Corrector Burchardi" really is. 
The text is included by Burchard as book 19 of his work as a sort of appendix. This version of the text is also known as the ''Corrector Burchardi''.--&gt;

The text was adopted in the ''Decretum'' of [[Ivo of Chartres]] and eventually in  [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian's]] authoritative ''[[Corpus juris canonici]]'' of c. 1140 (causa 26, quaestio 5, canon 12).  Because it was included in Gratian's compilation the text was treated as canon law for the remaining part of the [[High Middle Ages]], until [[Roman Catholic]] views on [[European witchcraft]] began to change dramatically in the [[late medieval]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Charles Kors, Edward Peters, ''Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: a documentary history'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972, pp. 28-31; 2nd revised ed.  2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1751-3}}, pp. 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text of Gratian is not the same as the one used by Burchard, and the distinctive features of the ''Corrector'' text were thus not transmitted to later times.

The text of Regino of Prüm  was edited in [[Patrologia Latina]], volume 132; the  ''Decretum''  of Burchard of Worms in volume 140.
The text of Burchard's ''Corrector'' has been separately edited by Wasserschleben (1851),&lt;ref&gt;Wasserschleben, ''Die Bussordnungen der abendländischen Kirche'', Halle, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;
and again by Schmitz (1898).&lt;ref&gt;
H. J. Schmitz, ''Die Bussbücher und das kanonische Bussverfahren'', vol. 2, Düsseldorf, 1898, pp. 381-467.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The incipit of Gratian's text, which gave rise to the title of "canon ''Episcopi''" reads:
:''Episcopi, eorumque ministri omnibus modis elaborare studeant, ut perniciosam et a diabolo inventam sortilegam et magicam artem ex parochiis suis penitus eradicent, et si aliquem virum aut mulierem hujuscemodi sceleris sectatorem invenerint, turpiter dehonestatum de parochiis suis ejiciant. ''
:"The bishops and their ministers should by all means make great effort so that they may thoroughly eradicate the  pernicious art of divination and magic, invented by the devil,   from their parishes, and if they   find any man or woman adhering to such a crime, they should eject them, turpidly dishonoured, from their parishes."

This condemnation the "pernicious art of divination and magic" (''magicam'' being changed by Gratian from  ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:maleficium|maleficam]]}}'')  is justified by a reference to [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:10-11 on [[heresy]].
Then follows a description of the errors of "certain wicked women" (''{{lang|la|quaedam [[:wikt:sceleratus|sceleratae]]  mulieres}}''), who deceived by [[Satan]] believe themselves to join the train of the pagan goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] (to which Burchardus added: ''{{lang|la|vel cum Herodiade}}'' "or with [[Herodias]]") during the hours of the night, and to cover great distances within a multitude of women riding on beasts, and during certain nights to be called to the service of their mistress. Those holding such beliefs are then condemned by the text in no uncertain terms ("that they would only perish in their perfidity without drawing others with them"), deploring the great number of people who "relapse into pagan error" by holding such beliefs. Because of this, the text instructs that all priests should teach at every possible instant that such beliefs are phantasms inspired by an evil spirit.

The following paragraph  presents an account of the means by which Satan takes possession of the minds of these women by appearing to them in numerous forms, and how once he holds captive their minds, deludes them by means of [[dreams]] (''{{lang|la| transformat se in diversarum personarum species atque similitudines, et mentem quam captivam tenet in somnis deludens, modo laeta, modo tristia, modo cognitas, modo incognitas personas, ostendens, per devia quaeque deducit}}'').
 
The text emphasizes that the heretic belief is to hold that these transformations occur in the body, while they are in reality dream visions inspired in the mind (''{{lang|la| Et cum solus spiritus hoc patitur, infidelis mens haec non in animo, sed in corpore evenire opinatur}}'').
The text proposes that it is perfectly normal to have nightly visions in which one sees things that are never seen while awake, but that it is a great stupidity to believe that the events experienced in the dream vision have taken place in the body.
Examples are adduced, of [[Ezechiel]] having his prophetic visions in spirit, not in body, of the [[Apocalypse of John]] which was seen in spirit, not in body, and of [[Paul of Tarsus]], who describes the events at Damascus as a vision, not as a bodily encounter.

The text concludes by repeating that it should be publicly preached that all those holding such beliefs have lost their faith, believing not in God but in the devil, and whosoever believes that it is possible to [[Shapeshifting|transform themselves]] into a different kind of creature, is far more wavering (in his faith) than an infidel (''{{lang|la|procul dubio infidelis}}''; to which Burchard added: "and worse than a pagan", ''{{lang|la|et  pagano deterior}}'').

==Reception==
{{further|Christianity and paganism|European witchcraft|Protests against witch trials (Early Modern period)}}
The Canon Episcopi has received a great deal of attention from historians of the [[Witch-hunt|witch craze]] period as early documentation of the [[Catholic church]]'s [[theology|theological]] position on the question of witchcraft.

The position taken by the author is that these "rides of Diana" did not actually exist, that they are deceptions, dreams or phantasms.
It is the belief in the reality of such deceptions which is considered a heresy worthy of excommunication. 
The position here is that the devil is real, creating delusions in the mind, but that the delusions do not have bodily reality.
This skeptical  treatment of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] sharply contrasts with the sanction of   [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witch trials]] by the church in later centuries, beginning with the bull  ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'' (1484).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey | last=Russell | authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell | title=Witchcraft in the Middle Ages | publisher =Cornell University Press | year=1984 | isbn=0-8014-9289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proponents of these trials from were aware of this problem, and the authors of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', a witch-hunter's manual from 1487 that played a key role in the witch craze, were forced to argue for a reinterpretation of the Canon Episcopi in order to reconcile their beliefs that witchcraft was both real and effective with those expressed in the Canon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', Part II: Chapters 2, 8 and 11.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Protests against witch trials (Early Modern period)|Their detractors]] in the 16th and 17th century also made reference to the canon, e.g. [[Johann Weyer]] in his ''[[De praestigiis daemonum]]'' (1563).{{page needed|date=December 2011}}

Burchard of Worms added the [[New Testament]] figure [[Herodias]] to his copy of the document in one passage, and the [[Continental Germanic mythology|Teutonic]] goddess [[Holda]] in another.{{dubious|date=December 2011}} 
In the 12th century, [[Hugues de Saint-Victor]] quoted the Canon Episcopi as reading "Diana [[Minerva]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
Later collections included the names "Benzozia" and "Bizazia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Excerpt from A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages | url=http://www.publishersrow.com/ebookshuk/cart/bookexcerpt.asp?ProdIndex=0&amp;bookid=106&amp;formatid=&amp;o=1121403600000 | accessdate=October 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In modern times, the text's description of  "[[witches sabbath]]s" dedicated to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] has given rise to a hypothesis concerning a supposed [[Witch-cult hypothesis|medieval witch religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton  | title=Triumph of the Moon | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-500-27242-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a theory mostly associated with [[Margaret Murray]], and later adopted by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Wicca|his followers]]. Burchard's mention of Herodias is relevant especially the theories of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] presented in ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' (1899), and taken up in the ''[[Stregheria]]'' of [[Raven Grimassi]].

'''Christian existentialism''' is a theo-philosophical movement which takes an [[existentialism|existentialist]] approach to Christian theology. The school of thought is often traced back to the work of the [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher and theologian [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855).  &lt;ref&gt;M.J. Eliade &amp; C.J. Adams (1987). ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' (v.5). Macmillan Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existential approach to Christian theology has a long and diverse history including Augustine, Aquinas, Pascal and Maritain.

==Kierkegaardian themes==
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Søren Kierkegaard]]
Christian existentialism relies on Kierkegaard's understanding of [[Christianity]].  Kierkegaard argued that the [[universe]] is fundamentally [[paradox]]ical, and that its greatest paradox is the transcendent union of God and humans in the person of [[Jesus Christ]]. He also posited having a personal relationship with God that supersedes all prescribed moralities, social structures and communal norms,&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1846). ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', authored pseudonymously as Johannes Climacus.&lt;/ref&gt; since he asserted that following social conventions is essentially a personal aesthetic choice made by individuals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Kierkegaard proposed that each person must make independent choices, which then constitute his existence. Each person suffers from the anguish of indecision (whether knowingly or unknowingly) until he commits to a particular choice about the way to live. Kierkegaard also proposed three rubrics with which to understand the conditions that issue from distinct life choices: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.

==Major premises==
One of the major premises of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism [[logical consequence|entails]] calling the masses back to a more genuine form of Christianity. This form is often identified with some notion of [[Early Christianity]], which mostly existed during the first three centuries after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Beginning with the [[Edict of Milan]], which was issued by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] in AD 313, Christianity enjoyed a level of popularity among [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and later among other [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. And yet Kierkegaard asserted that by the 19th century, the ultimate meaning of [[New Testament]] Christianity ([[Charity (virtue)|love]], cf. [[agape]], [[mercy]] and [[Chesed|loving-kindness]]) had become perverted, and Christianity had deviated considerably from its original threefold message of grace, humility, and love.

Another major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism involves Kierkegaard's conception of God and [[Love]]. For the most part, Kierkegaard equates God with Love.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1849). ''The Sickness Unto Death'' Trans. Alastair Hannay (New York: Penguin Books, 2004), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a person engages in the act of loving, he is in effect achieving an aspect of the [[divinity|divine]]. Kierkegaard also viewed the [[individual]] as a necessary synthesis of both [[Wikt:finite|finite]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] elements. Therefore, when an individual does not come to a full realization of his infinite side, he is said to be in [[wikt:despair|despair]]. For many contemporary Christian [[theologians]], the notion of despair can be viewed as [[sin]]. However, to Kierkegaard, a man sinned when he was exposed to this idea of despair and chose a path other than one in accordance with [[Providentialism|God's will]].

A final major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism entails the systematic undoing of [[evil]] acts. Kierkegaard asserted that once an action had been completed, it should be evaluated in the face of God, for holding oneself up to divine scrutiny was the only way to judge one's actions. Because actions constitute the manner in which something is deemed good or bad, one must be constantly conscious of the potential consequences of his actions. Kierkegaard believed that the choice for [[good and evil|goodness]] ultimately came down to each individual. Yet Kierkegaard also foresaw the potential limiting of choices for individuals who fell into [[The Sickness Unto Death|despair]].&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1849). ''The Sickness Unto Death'' Trans. Alastair Hannay (New York: Penguin Books, 2004), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bible==
Christian Existentialism often refers to what it calls the '''indirect style''' of Christ's teachings, which it considers to be a distinctive and important aspect of his ministry.  Christ's point, it says, is often left unsaid in any particular parable or saying, to permit each individual to confront the truth on his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald D. Palmer]] (1996). ''Kierkegaard For Beginners''. London, England: Writers And Readers Limited. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly evident in (but is certainly not limited to) his [[parable]]s; for example in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] ({{bibleverse|Matthew|18:21-35|NIV}}). 
A good example of '''indirect communication''' in the Old Testament is the story of [[David]] and [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:1-14}}.

An existential reading of the Bible demands that the reader recognize that he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], studying the words that God communicates to him personally. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" which are outside and unrelated to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Howard V. Hong (1983). "Historical Introduction" to ''Fear and Trembling''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing them upon him, but as though they are inside him and guiding him internally. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life, or the learner who should put it to use?"&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1847). ''Works of Love''. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Existentially speaking, the Bible doesn't become an authority in a person's life until he ''permits'' the Bible to be his personal authority.

==Notable Christian existentialists==
Christian existentialists include German Protestant theologians [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rudolph Bultmann]], American existential psychologist [[Rollo May]] (who introduced much of Tillich's thought to a general American readership), British Anglican theologian [[John Macquarrie]], American theologian Lincoln Swain,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Swain (2005). [http://www.somareview.com/contributors.cfm?authorID=75 Five Articles], ''Soma: A Review of Religion and Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Clifford Williams (academic)|Clifford Williams]], French Catholic philosophers [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Emmanuel Mounier]], and [[Pierre Boutang]], German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno]], and Russian philosophers [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] and [[Lev Shestov]]. [[Karl Barth]] added to Kierkegaard's ideas the notion that existential despair leads an individual to an awareness of God's infinite nature. Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] could be placed within the tradition of Christian existentialism.

The roots of existentialism have been traced back as far as St [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R. Lewis (Winter 1965). [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bets/vol08/8-1_lewis.pdf "Augustine and Existentialism"]. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 8,1, pp. 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michial Farmer (6 July 2010). [http://www.christianhumanist.org/chb/a-primer-on-religious-existentialism-pt-4-augustine/ "A Primer on Religious Existentialism, Pt. 4: Augustine"]. christianhumanist.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig J. N. de Paulo, ed. (2006). ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of An Augustinian Phenomenology''. Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most striking passages in [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s ''[[Pensées]]'', including the famous section on the [[Pascal's Wager|Wager]], deal with existentialist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Clarke (2011). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal/ "Blaise Pascal"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Williams (July 3, 2005). [http://www.cliffordwilliams.net/pascal "Pascal"]. cliffordwilliams.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michial Farmer (20 July 2010). [http://www.christianhumanist.org/chb/a-primer-on-religious-existentialism-pt-5-blaise-pascal/ "A Primer on Religious Existentialism, Pt. 5: Blaise Pascal"]. christianhumanist.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michial Farmer (27 July 2010). [http://www.christianhumanist.org/chb/a-primer-on-religious-existentialism-pt-6-apologetics/ "A Primer on Religious Existentialism, Pt. 6: Apologetics"]. christianhumanist.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Maritain]], in ''Existence and the Existent: An Essay on Christian Existentialism'',&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Maritain (1947). ''Existence and the Existent: An Essay on Christian Existentialism'' (''Court traité de l'existence et de l'existent''), translated by Lewis Galantiere and Gerald B. Phelan. New York: Pantheon Books, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; finds the core of true existentialism in the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

== Radical Existential Christianity ==

It has been claimed that Radical Existential Christians’ faith is based in their sensible and immediate and direct experience of God indwelling in human terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Existing Christ: an Existential Christology|last=Di Giovanni|first=Aldo|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2014|isbn=9781503134911|location=Charlston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that individuals do not make or create their Christian existence; it does not come as a result of a decision one personally makes. The radical Protestants of the 17th century, [[Inward light|for example Quakers]] may have been in some ways theo-philosophically aligned with radical existential Christianity.

A '''collective work''' in the [[Copyright law of the United States]] is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published into a collective whole. 
The owner of the work has the property rights in the [[collective work]], but the authors of the individual works may retain rights in their contributions.
Electronic reproduction of the whole work is allowed, but electronic reproduction of the individual works on their own, outside the context of the work as a whole, may constitute an infringement of copyright.

==Definition==

The [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The act makes a clear distinction between the collective work and the individual contributions, 
{{quote|Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}} }}
The [[United States Copyright Office]] says, 
{{quote|A compilation or a collective work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, provided that it constitutes copyrightable subject matter. As discussed in Section 307, compilations and collective works are a subset of the subject matter categories set forth in Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act, rather than separate and distinct categories of works. ... Thus, a compilation or a collective work must qualify as a literary work; a musical work; a dramatic work; a pantomime or choreographic work; a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work; a motion picture or audiovisual work; a sound recording; and/or an architectural work.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.1}} }}

Because a collective work is a form of compilation,  the U.S. Copyright Office will apply the criteria for compilations to determine whether the author’s selection, coordination, and/or arrangement satisfies the originality requirement.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.3}}
Thus a website will be protected only if the author used creativity or subjective judgement to select and arrange the material.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=23}}
Ordinarily, the Office will not examine the preexisting material that appears in a [[derivative work]], a compilation, or a collective work to determine whether that material is protected by copyright or whether it has been used in a lawful manner.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=313.6(B)}}

==History==

The first copyright law in the United States, the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], covered maps, charts or books. 
The printed work was protected for 14 years from registration of its title with the district court, and could be renewed for another 14 years by the author, if still alive.
It did not provide for the copyright to be vested initially in an individual or employee who ordered or commissioned a map, chart or book.
The work only covered American authors, allowing publishers to flood the market with cheap reprints of British books.{{sfn|Patry|1994}}
The first major revision was the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], which extended the initial term to 28 years with the option to renew for another 14 years, and granted widows and children of deceased authors the right of renewal.{{sfn|Bracha|2008}}

The [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which became {{USPL|60|349}} on March 4, 1909, covered books, including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations; periodicals, including newspapers; and other works such as lectures, sermons, musical compositions, works of art and maps.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 5}}
Copyright was secured by publication with a notice of copyright.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 9}}
The owner was also required to deposit copies of the work with the copyright office.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 12}}
Copyright protection was for 28 years from date of publication, with the option to renew for a further 28 years.
Copyright could be registered and renewed for a contribution to a periodical or to a cyclopaedic or other composite work.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 23}}
Section 6 of the Act specified:
{{quote|That compilations or abridgements, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of works in the public domain, or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works, or works republished with new matter, shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this Act; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 6}}}}

The 1909 Act was repealed and superseded by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], but remains effective for copyrighted works created before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect in 1978. 
The Copyright Act of 1976 created a static seventy-five-year term (dated from the date of publication) for anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire. 
The extension term for works copyrighted before 1978 that had not already entered the public domain was increased from twenty-eight years to forty-seven years, giving a total term of seventy-five years. 
The [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]] {{USStatute|102|307|106|264|1992|06|26}} amended the 1976 Copyright Act, and affected works copyrighted between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 1977. Renewal registration for these works was made optional, and a second term was automatically secured.
In 1998 the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] further extended copyright protection to the duration of the author's life plus seventy years for general copyrights and to ninety-five years from date of publication or 120 years from date of creation, whichever comes first, for works made for hire. 

==Divisibility of copyright==

The 1909 Copyright Act was confused in its discussion of the relationship between copyright in the collective work and that in the individual works.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}}
Under the 1909 Act a copyright could only be transferred to another owner in whole, and not in part.
Thus an author could not transfer the rights for their work to be published as part of a collective work without transferring all rights in their work.{{sfn|Fountain}}
''Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397 concerned the rights of the author of the novel ''[[Dark Passage]]'', first published as a serial in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held on 9 March 1970 that the doctrine of indivisibility could not wholly deprive an author of his copyright in a case like this.{{sfn|425 F. 2d 397 - Goodis v. United Artists Television}}

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the Copyright Act of 1976.
Section 106 of the Act lists the exclusive rights that the copyright owner has in a copyrighted work, which are the rights of reproduction; preparation of derivative works; distribution; public performance; public display; and digital performance in sound recordings.
Each of these exclusive rights may be divided to any number of recipients, and each may be limited to a specified time or place.{{sfn|Fountain}}

==Property rights==

The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by a [[copyright transfer agreement]].
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The Copyright Act of 1976 says a work is considered a "work made for hire" as either,

{{quote| (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a [[collective work]], as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. (17 U.S.C. § 101){{sfn|Works Made for Hire – US Copyright Office}} }}

It there is no contract transferring ownership and the contributions are not work for hire, the owner has the right to reproduce, distribute and revise the collective work, but does not have the rights to the individual contributions.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==Classroom use==

Multiple copies of works for classroom use may be made subject to conditions that include "not more than one short poem, article, story, essay, or two excerpts may be copied from the same author, not more than three from the same collective work or periodical volume during one class term.{{sfn|DeGeeter|2004|p=158}}

==Websites==

The websites of daily or weekly magazines or journal such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' are collective works and qualify for group registration with the Copyright Office.
Electronic journals that are published one article at a time are not collective works.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=40}}
To defeat the "innocent infringer" rule{{efn|See [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]}}, a collective work website must contain a copyright notice for the work as a whole. 
It does not need to have a copyright notice for the individual works.
Advertisements are not covered by this notice, and require a separate notice to be protected.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=83}}
If a website contains material from the United States government, which is in the public domain, the copyright notice should indicate to readers which parts of the content are public domain and which are not.
If the notice does not do so it will be found invalid, and the innocent infringer defense may be used.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=85}}

''[[Metropolitan Regional Information System, Inc. v. American Home Realty Network, Inc.]]'' [722 F.3d 591] was a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] case in which a court held that the copyright owner of a collective work such as an automated database was not required by a pre-suit [[copyright registration]] requirement to identify names of creators and titles of individual work. Also, clicking yes to the term of use and uploading a photograph, is sufficient to writing component in assignment of right under {{usc|17|204}}.{{sfn|Metro. Reg'l Info. Sys., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network}}

Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The court also discussed how the work was presented and visible to the user on the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] online periodical database. 
The databases "present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions ... without the graphics, formatting, or other articles with which the article was initially published.{{sfn|McJohn|2006|p=134}}{{efn|The New York Times argued without success that it had the right to reproduce issues in Braille, in microform or translated into a foreign language, even though these versions would have a very different look and feel, so should have the right to reproduce issues electronically. The court disagreed.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=145}}
Another point that may be made in favor of the judgement is that the newspaper's editorials and opinion section are not shown along with the individual article, and these are essential parts of the collective work and communicate a political perspective with which the authors are associated. The authors may be instead associated in the online work with unwelcome discussion threads that cause them to lose credibility.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=144–145}} }}

In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In the late 1990s [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] had begun publishing ''The Complete National Geographic'', a digital compilation of all the past issues of the magazine. 
It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in ''[[Greenberg v. National Geographic]]'' and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the availability of the compilation. 
On June 30, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit held that National Geographic had the right to publish faithful copies of its print magazine electronically.
The ruling noted, 
{{blockquote|In the light of the Supreme Court’s holding in ''Tasini'' that the bedrock of any § 201(c) analysis is contextual fidelity to the original print publication as presented to, and perceivable by, the users of the revised version of the original publication, we agree with the Second Circuit in ''Faulkner'' and find that National Geographic is privileged to reproduce and distribute the CNG under the “revision” prong of § 201(c)."{{sfn|Greenberg v. National Geographic Society}} }}

An online database that contains copyrightable works may be considered a collective work, where the owner of the database has a "thin" copyright over the selection and arrangement of the works in the database. The individual works may be covered by separate copyrights.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=270}}

{{Apartheid |events}}

The '''Coloured vote constitutional crisis''', also known as the '''Coloured vote case''', was a [[constitutional crisis]] that occurred in the [[Union of South Africa]] during the 1950s as the result of an attempt by the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government to remove [[Coloured]] voters in the Union's [[Cape Province]] from the common [[Electoral roll|voters' roll]]s. It developed into a dispute between [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and the executive, on the one hand, and the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] of the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]], on the other hand, over the power of Parliament to amend an [[entrenched clause]] in the [[South Africa Act]] (the [[constitution]]) and the power of the Appellate Division to overturn the amendment as unconstitutional. The crisis ended when the government enlarged the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]] and altered its method of election, allowing the amendment to be successfully enacted.{{sfn|Sachs|1973|pp=143–145}}

== Background ==

Before the [[National Convention (South Africa)|creation]] of the [[Union of South Africa]], elections in the [[Cape Colony]] were conducted on the basis of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise|qualified franchise]]. This meant that the right to vote was limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications, but not restricted on the basis of race. This differed from the other South African colonies: in [[Natal Colony|Natal]] the franchise was limited to white men in practise though not in law, while in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange River Colony]] the franchise was limited by law to white men. The [[South Africa Act]], which was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], unified these four colonies to form the Union but preserved their franchise arrangements unchanged. Section 35 of the South Africa Act provided that no law could disenfranchise voters in the [[Cape Province]] on the basis of race, unless that law was passed by an [[Absolute majority|absolute]] [[supermajority]] of two-thirds of the members of both Houses of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] sitting together in a [[joint session]]. Section 35 was [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]] by section 152, which provided that neither section 35 nor section 152 itself could be amended without a similar supermajority in joint session.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|pp=1362–1363}}

In 1931, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] ended the power of the British Parliament to legislate for [[dominion]]s such as South Africa and gave those dominions the power to repeal or amend British laws in force within their territories.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|p=1364}} In 1936, the South African Parliament enacted the [[Representation of Natives Act]], removing "native" ([[Black people#South Africa|black]]) voters from the common voters' rolls and allowing them to elect, separately, three members of the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]) instead.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|p=247}} Although this Act was passed by the required [[Joint session|joint-session]] supermajority, its validity was challenged by an affected voter in the case of ''Ndlwana v Hofmeyr''. The challenge was rejected for a number of reasons, of which the most significant was the Appellate Division's ruling that because Parliament was a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] legislative body, courts could not invalidate one of its Acts on the basis of the procedure used to pass it.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|pp=1370–1371}}{{sfn|Cowen|1953|pp=250–251}}

== Separate Representation of Voters Bill ==
[[File:DFMalanPortret.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{nowrap|[[Daniel François Malan|D. F. Malan]]}}, [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] from 1948 to 1954.]]

In 1948, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], campaigning on a platform of ''[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]'', won [[South African general election, 1948|that year's general election]]. The following year, [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] {{nowrap|[[Daniel François Malan|D. F. Malan]]}} addressed the question of [[Coloured]] voting rights in a speech to Parliament, claiming that Coloured voters were corrupt and immature and that they posed a threat to white control in South Africa.{{sfn|Loveland|1999|p=260}} The government then sought to echo the 1936 Representation of Natives Act by introducing, in 1951, the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act|Separate Representation of Voters Bill]], whereby Coloured voters would also lose the right to vote for ordinary constituency members of the House of Assembly and instead elect four members at separate elections.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|p=252}} Besides the Nationalists' ideological belief in [[white supremacy]], the bill was also motivated by the electoral power of Coloured voters to swing a number of Cape constituencies from the National Party to the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]].{{sfn|Loveland|1999|p=260}}

The bill attracted much opposition both inside and outside Parliament. The United Party leader {{nowrap|[[Jacobus Gideon Nel Strauss|J. G. N. Strauss]]}} was against it both because he saw it as a breach of commitments given by earlier National Party leaders and because he believed it would lead Coloured people to form political alliances with black and Indian groups opposed to the white control of South Africa.{{sfn|Loveland|1999|pp=268–269}} A group of Coloured activists formed the National Convention Co-ordinating Committee to oppose the bill within constitutional limits. The Franchise Action Council, a multi-racial organisation, led a campaign of rallies, [[Strike action|strikes]] and [[civil disobedience]]. The [[Torch Commando]] was founded by white Second World War veterans in response to the bill but expanded into a more general movement against the government's policies.{{sfn|Loveland|1999|pp=269–271}}

The National Party did not have enough seats in Parliament to pass the bill with the two-thirds majority in joint sitting that would be required if the entrenchment of sections 36 and 152 was still valid. Based on the ruling in Ndlwana's case (see above) and the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], Malan's government decided to enact it by following the normal parliamentary procedure of a simple majority in each house separately.{{sfn|Loveland|1999|pp=262–268}} The [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]] gave his [[Royal Assent|assent]] on 15 June 1951 and the act was [[promulgation|promulgated]] on 18 June.

== Judgment of the Appellate Division ==
[[File:Dönges cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{nowrap|[[Theophilus Ebenhaezer Dönges|T. E. Dönges]]}}, [[Minister of the Interior (South Africa)|Minister of the Interior]] from 1948 to 1958.]]

{{nowrap|G. Harris}}, {{nowrap|E. Franklin}}, {{nowrap|W. D. Collins}} and {{nowrap|E. A. Deane}}, four voters affected by the Separate Representation of Voters Act, challenged its validity in the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]] in a case that became known as ''Harris v Dönges'' or ''Harris v Minister of the Interior'', as {{nowrap|[[Theophilus Ebenhaezer Dönges|T. E. Dönges]]}} was at the time [[Minister of the Interior (South Africa)|Minister of the Interior]]. Initially the case was dismissed by the [[Cape Provincial Division]], which followed the precedent of ''Ndlwana v Hofmeyr'' to rule that the court had no authority to question the validity of an act of Parliament promulgated and published by the proper authority. This decision was immediately taken on appeal to the Appellate Division.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|pp=1363–1364}}

The government's first contention was that the act did not disqualify voters on the basis of race, as all voters previously qualified were still able to vote, albeit in segregated constituencies. The court dismissed this argument as untenable.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|p=253}} The government then argued that the entrenched clauses in the South Africa Act had been [[Implied repeal|repealed by implication]] by the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931|Statute of Westminster]], and that the precedent of the ''Ndlwana'' case precluded the courts from questioning the validity of an act of Parliament.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|p=1364}}

The government's claim regarding the Statute of Westminster was based on two principal theories. The first was based on the repeal of the application of the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865|Colonial Laws Validity Act]] to South Africa. The Colonial Laws Validity Act provided that any act of a colonial parliament would be valid within the colony unless it contradicted a British act applying to the colony. The argument was that an alteration of the Cape franchise without a two-thirds majority would have contradicted the South Africa Act (which was itself an act of the British Parliament) and therefore would be impermissible under the Colonial Laws Validity Act; and that once that act no longer applied the entrenchment was not enforceable. The court disagreed, noting that section 152 of the South Africa Act specifically empowered the South African Parliament to amend the South Africa Act, and that the Colonial Laws Validity Act had no application and therefore its repeal had no effect.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|pp=255–256}}

The second theory was that, by expanding the legislative powers of the dominion parliaments, the Statute of Westminster had abolished the requirement for a two-thirds majority in joint session. Section 2 of the Statute of Westminster gave a dominion parliament the power to repeal or amend any act of the British Parliament as it applied in the dominion. This power, so the argument went, had been granted to a Parliament consisting of two separate houses acting with simple majorities, and this power could be exercised to amend the entrenched clauses without regard to the supermajority requirement.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|p=257}} Again the court disagreed, ruling that the "Parliament" to which the amendment power had been granted was the Parliament constituted by the South Africa Act, and that this definition of Parliament included the procedural requirement that certain bills be passed by two-thirds majority in joint session. This did not affect the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], as Parliament was fully sovereign over South Africa, and merely obliged to follow certain procedures to pass certain laws.{{sfn|Griswold|1952|pp=1366–1367}}{{sfn|Cowen|1953|pp=257–259}}

The final argument was that the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' bound the Appellate Division to follow the precedent of the ''Ndlwana'' case, in which it had ruled that Parliament can adopt any procedure it sees fit and the courts have no power to question the validity of its acts. The court ruled that it was entitled to overrule its own previous decisions if they were clearly wrong. In ''Ndlwana'' there had been no discussion of the Statute of Westminster nor any argument for or against the conclusion drawn by the court, and the court therefore felt free to overrule it.{{sfn|Cowen|1953|pp=262–263}}

The resulting order of the Appellate Division was that the Separate Representation of Voters Act was "invalid, null and void and of no legal force and effect". The ruling, authored by [[Chief Justice of South Africa|Chief Justice]] [[Albert van der Sandt Centlivres]] and handed down on 20 March 1952, was unanimous.

== High Court of Parliament ==

The response of Malan's government was immediate: on the day the decision was announced the Prime Minister declared that it was unacceptable, that the government refused to abide by it, and that he would take steps to have it overturned.{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=23–24}} In April 1952 {{nowrap|T. E. Dönges}} introduced the [[High Court of Parliament Act, 1952|High Court of Parliament Bill]], which would constitute the members of Parliament into a High Court with the power to review and overturn any ruling of the Appellate Division declaring an act of Parliament to be invalid. This court was described as a "court of law"; it would have a "Judicial Committee" of ten members which could make recommendations, but the decision of the "court" would be determined by a majority vote of members present.{{sfn|Loveland|1999|pp=301–302}}

Dönges, in introducing the bill, argued that it would restore the power of the "sovereign will of the electorate" to determine which laws were valid, and would relieve the Appellate Division of accusations of political bias. {{nowrap|J. G. N. Strauss}} of the opposition denounced the bill as establishing a "political court [...] a bogus court set up in order to express the will of the Caucus of the National Party".{{sfn|Loveland|1999|p=302}}{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=25–26}} The bill was attacked in the English-language press, with the ''[[Cape Times]]'' calling it "an insult to the intelligence of the judiciary".{{sfn|Loveland|1999|p=304}} It even met with opposition from a number of prominent Nationalists.{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=29–30}}

Despite the opposition, the High Court of Parliament Bill was forced through Parliament. It was passed by the House of Assembly on 15 May 1952 and by the Senate on 27 May. A petition asking the Governor-General to withhold [[Royal Assent|assent]] was rejected and the bill was assented to on 3 June.{{sfn|Scher|1988|p=29}} The Speaker of the House of Assembly was nominated as President of the High Court of Parliament, and he appointed a Judicial Committee of six government members and four opposition members, with {{nowrap|[[Charles Robberts Swart|C. R. Swart]]}}, the [[Minister of Justice (South Africa)|Minister of Justice]], as chairman. The opposition members resigned before the first meeting of the committee on 21 July 1952. After three days of hearings the committee recommended the reversal of the Appellate Division's ruling and the validation of the Separate Representation of Voters Act. The High Court of Parliament, which consisted only of Nationalist members of Parliament due to an opposition boycott, approved this recommendation on 27 August.{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=30–31}}

Meanwhile, the plaintiffs from the first ''Harris'' case returned to the ordinary courts to challenge the validity of the High Court of Parliament Act. On 29 August the [[Cape Provincial Division]] ruled that the act had the effect of altering the entrenched clauses, and that as it had not been passed by a two-thirds majority in joint session it was invalid.{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=33–34}} The government's appeal, under the title of ''Minister of the Interior v Harris'', was heard in the Appellate Division on 27–29 October, and on 13 November the court handed down a unanimous decision upholding the ruling of the Cape court.{{sfn|Griswold|1953|p=866}}

The court ruled that the existence of the entrenched clauses in the South Africa Act necessarily implied that those protected by the clauses had the right to have any law affecting them tested for validity by a court ("''[[Maxims of equity#Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy|ubi jus ibi remedium]]''"). Parliament, therefore, could not remove this power from the courts of law, and the High Court of Parliament was not a court of law but rather Parliament functioning under another name. As such, it had only the powers given to it by the South Africa Act, and these did not include the power to amend the entrenched clauses without a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting.{{sfn|Griswold|1953|pp=867–869}}{{sfn|Scher|1988|pp=37–38}}

This was the height of the constitutional crisis. A general election was due to be held in 1953; if the government refused to accept the rulings of the Appellate Division and conducted the election on the basis of separate representation for white and coloured voters, the system of government could be imperilled. The officials responsible for voter registration would be forced to follow either the government's instructions and risk an [[injunction|interdict]] from the courts, or to follow the court's ruling and risk sanctions from the administration.{{sfn|Scher|1988|p=35}} There was the possibility that the courts could invalidate the entire election in the Cape Province and therefore the existence of the Parliament elected in 1953.{{sfn|Scher|1988|p=38}}

The government, therefore, while continuing to insist that the court's rulings were wrong, announced that it would accept them.{{sfn|Scher|1988|p=39}} The elections [[South African general election, 1953|were held on 15 April 1953]] with coloured voters in the Cape voting alongside white voters. Despite this, the National Party was returned in government with a larger majority: 94 seats out of 156, as opposed to 79 seats out of 153 in 1948.

== Packing of the Senate ==
[[File:JG Strijdom.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{nowrap|[[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|J. G. Strijdom]]}}, Prime Minister from 1954 to 1958.]]

During 1953 and 1954, the National Party tried to re-validate the Separate Representation of Voters Act by convincing enough opposition members to support it to obtain a two-thirds majority; this effort was not successful.{{sfn|Scher|1988|p=40}} In 1955 the new Prime Minister {{nowrap|[[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|J. G. Strijdom]]}} adopted a new plan: the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]] (the upper house of Parliament) would be packed with National Party members to ensure the government would have the necessary two-thirds majority in a joint sitting.

As originally constituted by the South Africa Act, the Senate consisted of forty Senators. Eight were nominated by the [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]], and thus effectively by the government of the day. For each province eight Senators were elected by an electoral college consisting of the members of the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] representing that province and the members of the [[provincial council (South Africa)|provincial council]]. These elections were conducted by the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system of [[proportional representation]].{{sfn|Beinart|1957|pp=550–552}} In 1936 the [[Representation of Natives Act]] added four Senators indirectly elected to represent black people. In 1949 another four were added to represent the territory of [[South-West Africa]].{{sfn|Beinart|1957|pp=558–559}} In 1955, then, there were 26 Senators supporting the government and 21 supporting the opposition (and one vacant seat).

The [[Senate Act, 1955]] reconstituted the Senate along new lines and expanded it to eighty-nine members. The number of nominated Senators was doubled to sixteen. The number of elected senators was increased to be, for each province, one-fifth of the size of that province's electoral college, with a minimum of eight Senators per province; so the [[Cape Province]] had twenty-two Senators, the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] twenty-seven, and the other two provinces eight each. The four Senators elected under the Representation of Natives Act and four representing South-West Africa remained. The Senate Act also changed the system for electing provincial Senators from STV to simple majority voting, meaning that the majority party in each electoral college could choose all the Senators for that province. The result was that the National Party was able to control seventy-seven Senatorial seats: the sixteen nominated by the Governor-General, the fifty-seven elected for the Cape, Transvaal and the [[Orange Free State]], and the four representing South-West Africa.{{sfn|Beinart|1957|pp=559–560}}

With the new Senate, the National Party commanded a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting, and thus was able to pass the [[South Africa Act Amendment Act, 1956]]. This act declared the original Separate Representation of Voters Act to be valid, and repealed the parts of section 35 of the South Africa Act entrenching the Cape franchise as well as the parts of section 152 entrenching section 35.{{sfn|Wade|1957|p=162}} (There remained one unrelated entrenched clause guaranteeing the equality of the English and Afrikaans languages.)

The government's opponents returned to the courts to have this new act also declared invalid, arguing that the Senate Act was passed as part of a deliberate scheme to circumvent the entrenched clauses. This time, however, the court disagreed. On 9 November the Appellate Division handed down a decision under the title of ''Collins v Minister of the Interior'' in which it ruled that Parliament had the power to alter the composition of the Senate, a power explicitly granted by the South Africa Act, and that its motivation was irrelevant. The Senate Act was therefore valid, and thus a joint sitting of the House of Assembly and the reconstituted Senate had the power to amend the entrenched clauses.{{sfn|Wade|1957|pp=162–163}}

To ensure its success, the government had also passed the [[Appellate Division Quorum Act, 1955]], expanding the Appellate Division to eleven judges, thus allowing the appointment of six new judges presumed to support the Nationalist position. This proved to have been unnecessary, as only one judge, Oliver Schreiner, dissented from the ruling.

== Later developments ==

Separate representatives for Coloured voters were first elected in the [[South African general election, 1958|general election of 1958]]. Even this limited representation did not last, being ended from 1970 by the [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968]]. Instead, all Coloured adults were given the right to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which had limited legislative powers. The Council was in turn dissolved in 1980. In 1984 a new constitution introduced the [[Tricameral Parliament]] in which Coloured voters elected the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]].

In 1960, a new Senate Act reduced the size of the Senate and restored the single transferable vote system of election of the provincial Senators. In 1961 South Africa became a republic under [[South African Constitution of 1961|a new constitution]]; this constitution repealed the now-unnecessary High Court of Parliament Act.

In 1994, with the end of apartheid, a new constitution was introduced which guarantees the right to vote for all adult citizens. This right, along with [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|many other rights]], is entrenched in the constitution. The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] has the explicit power to invalidate acts of Parliament that are unconstitutional.

'''Consip S.p.A.''' is a [[joint-stock company]], set up in 1997, held by the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Italian Ministry of economy and finance (MEF)]], which is the sole shareholder. The company operates in keeping with the MEF’s strategic goals, working exclusively to serve the Public Administration sector.

Consip is member of the [[Procurement G6]], an informal group leading the use of [[Government procurement in the European Union#Framework agreements|framework agreements]] and [[e-procurement]] instruments in [[Public procurement]].

== Corporate profile ==
Consip’s mission is to make the use of public resources more efficient and transparent, by providing tools and skills to [[public administration]]. The goal is to allow them to perform public purchases and at the same time stimulate a competitive participation of enterprises to [[Government procurement|public tenders]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first=| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-22/italy-may-cut-spending-by-20-billion-euros-corriero-says.html|title= Italy May Cut Spending by 20 Billion Euros|publisher= Bloomberg|date= April 22, 2012|accessdate= May 12, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Consip obtained the [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2008]] quality certification for the “design, implementation and launching of [[framework agreement|framework]] contracts and [[E-commerce|e-marketplaces]] for the [[procurement]] of public Goods and Services, in its role as a central purchasing body”.

== History ==
Consip, under the original name of CON.S.I.P. “Concessionaria Servizi Informativi Pubblici”, was founded in 1997 for the purpose of bringing about changes in IT management for the former Italian Ministry of the treasury, budget, and economic planning.

Through Legislative Decree n. 414 of 19 November 1997, Consip was assigned with [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] activities for Italy’s national [[public administration]] in the areas of finance and accounting. Subsequently, through the Decrees of the Ministry of the treasury of 22 December 1997 and 17 June 1998, the company was put in charge of managing and developing [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]  services for said Ministry.

Two years later, Consip was assigned with launching the “Programme for the rationalisation of public administration purchases”. In fact, in enforcing the 2000 Budget law, through the Ministerial Decree of 24 February 2000, the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of economy and finance]] put Consip in charge of assisting the public administrations with their procurement of goods and services.

Over the years, many projects have influenced the development of activities assigned to the company. Today, Consip operates as Italy’s central purchasing body, providing support for individual PAs, and carrying out new tasks assigned through legal provisions and/or administrative acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first=| url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/80da640e-461b-11e3-b495-00144feabdc0.html#axzz31UHYWoyP|title= Italy’s new spending tsar eyes path of austerity amid excess|publisher= Financial Times|date= November 5, 2013|accessdate= May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first=| url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/47fe5c28-c73f-11e1-8865-00144feabdc0.html#axzz31UHYWoyP|title= Italy cuts spending by further €26bn|publisher= Financial Times|date= November 5, 2013|accessdate= May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main activities ==
The company carries out activities in consulting, assistance, and support in procuring goods and services for Public Administrations (PAs).

Consip’s activities involve three main areas:
* as central purchasing body, it runs the Programme for the rationalisation of public administration purchases, through the use of ICT and innovative procurement tools: framework contracts, [[e-marketplace]] for public administration, [[Government procurement in the European Union#Framework agreements|framework agreements]], dynamic purchasing system, ASP tenders (Central [[Procurement]] Area).
* based on specific agreements, it supports the individual PAs in all areas throughout the procurement process (Vertical [[Procurement]] Area).
* through legal provisions and/or administrative acts, it develops programmes that make use of its know-how in the area of procurement, as well as its ability to manage complex and innovative projects in the sphere of Public Administration (Other Initiatives Area).

== Methodology ==
Consip offers [[consultancy]] and project-design services, having developed, over time, technical, legal and project [[management]] skills.
Consip is a competence centre specialized in all phases of the procurement value chain; it stands beside public administrations both in the procurement [[strategic planning]] phase and in the real purchasing phase, by providing e-procurement tools, assistance and consultancy.
Consip relies on about 340 staff members, with an average age of 43 years. 83% of the employees are university graduates and 51% of them are women.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''David Locke Hall''' is a highly decorated former [[Assistant United States Attorney]], [[Naval Intelligence]] officer, and author.

==Early life==
Hall was born in [[California]] in 1955.  He received a BA from [[Dartmouth College]], an MBA from [[Yale]], and JD and MA degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  After law school, Hall served as a law clerk to the Honorable [[Walter King Stapleton]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].

==Career==

===Assistant United States Attorney===
Hall served for 23 years with the [[United States Department of Justice]] as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]], retiring in 2013.  He tried a large number of significant cases to verdict, including mobster Roy Stocker of the [[K&amp;A Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Slobodzian,"Federal Jury Convicts 3 In Drug Ring", The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall also prosecuted the Leath Cocaine Trafficking Organization, the leaders of which were involved in shooting Philadelphia Police Officer Donald McMullin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386/pdf/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386-2.pdf; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/266613/OFFICER-HOPES-TO-WORK-BESIDE-HIS-TWIN-AGAIN.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

A significant focus of Hall's prosecutorial career was the investigation and prosecution of weapons proliferation and technology transfer offenders.  In the 1990s, he prosecuted the Armaments Corporation of South Africa ([[Armscor (South Africa)|Armscor]]), Kentron, Fuchs Electronics, and others for violations of the Arms Export Control Act during the [[apartheid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/616104/After-35-years-US-lifts-S-Africa-arms-embargo.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARMSCOR case was a significant point of contention between the United States and the Republic of South Africa because ARMSCOR and Kentron were state-owned corporations.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-01/news/mn-602_1_south-africa; https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/02/21/us-refusal-to-drop-case-against-s-african-firm-causes-friction/2d1fc0c2-e314-4a0f-a049-f398b64bcf9c/&lt;/ref&gt;  After lengthy negotiations, the dispute was resolved by the pleas of ARMSCOR, Kentron, and Fuchs to criminal charges and the payment of fines in excess of $11 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2009, Hall investigated and prosecuted Amir Ardebili, an Iranian arms procurement agent working in Shiraz, Iran, acquiring components for the F4, F14, and other military aircraft, as well as microchips for use in phased array radar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-iran/iranian-pleads-guilty-to-u-s-arms-trafficking-charges-idUSTRE5B15JU20091202&lt;/ref&gt;  The years long investigation resulted in an undercover meeting between Ardebili and U.S. agents on October 1 and October 2, 2007 in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, where Ardebili was arrested by Georgian authorities.  He was extradited to the United States in January 2008.  Ardebili pled guilty to violations of the Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, smuggling, conspiracy and money laundering in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/file/438491/download&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ardebili case is the subject of a book, Operation Shakespeare: The True Story of an Elite International Sting, written by John Shiffman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Operation-Shakespeare/John-Shiffman/9781451655162&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2013, Hall led the undercover investigation and prosecution of Xiang Li, a Chinese software pirate. Xiang Li's Chengdu, China-based operation sold over $100 million in cracked software products with multiple high-tech applications, including telecommunications, explosive simulation, aerospace, satellite tracking, and flight simulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/business/chinese-man-pleads-guilty-in-copyright-violation-case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The undercover investigation led to a meeting on Saipan between federal agents and Xiang Li in June 2011.  At that meeting, Xiang Li delivered 20 gigabytes of proprietary data hacked from a defense contractor.  Xiang Li was charged with trafficking in more than $100 million in stolen copyrighted software.  He pled guilty in January 2013 and in June 2013 was sentenced to 12 years incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2013/130108wilmington2.pdf;  https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USDHSICE/2013/06/11/file_attachments/217734/Crack_99_Sentencing_Memorandum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has testified before the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives on "Examining the Effectiveness of the Kingpin Designation Act in the Western Hemisphere."&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-examining-effectiveness-kingpin-designation-act-western-hemisphere/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hall also served as the Special Prosecutor for the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team. During this time, he worked closely with FBI Special Agent [[Robert King Wittman]].  Hall negotiated the return of three stolen [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings from Brazil in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/us/national-briefing-midwest-minnesota-stolen-rockwell-paintings-found.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he led the successful undercover investigation and prosecution of Marcus Patmon, an art thief who sold stolen works by [[Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2009/ba100209c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hall forfeited and returned to Iraq a collection of Mesopotamian artifacts in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2010/ba102510a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hall affected the return to Peru of a gold Moche monkey head (circa 300 A.D.) that had been looted from the royal tombs of Sipan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/peruvian-artifact-repatriated&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hall seized and forfeited the Rosenberg Diary, the long-lost diary of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], Nazi propagandist and Reich Minister for the occupied eastern territories. The Rosenberg Diary is now part of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Museum]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-de/pr/long-lost-rosenberg-diary-recovered&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Service===
Hall served in the [[United States Navy]] and Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer for thirty years.  Commissioned in 1984, he retired at the rank of Captain in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents2/NAVADMINS2/NAV2005/NAV05204.txt&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded three intelligence units and served with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], in addition to numerous Navy commands.  He was a third generation naval officer, his father having served as a Marine Corps officer with the [[Second Marine Division]] in [[World War II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7746">The '''Decree-Law 15/93 of January 22''' ({{lang-pt|Decreto-Lei n.º 15/93, de 22 de Janeiro}}) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] drug control law implementing the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref name="gddc-eng"/&gt;
It classifies substances into six categories, Table ({{lang-pt|Tabela}}) I through Table VI. Tables I and II are each further broken down into classes: A, B, and C.

This law was also the first that created the crime of money laundering in Portuguese law.

The introduction of the law, which is primarily aimed at controlling drug trafficking, says that although the use of drugs is socially censurable, that "does not prevent drug addicts from being seen in the first place as persons who are in need of medical assistance" who should receive care.  Thus, "drug consumers are presently legally punishable in an almost symbolic fashion" that encourages treatment.&lt;ref name="gddc-eng"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|"''Tal não significa, todavia, que o tocicodependente não deva ser encarado, em primeira linha, como alguém que necessita de assistência médica e que tudo deve ser feito para o tratar, por sua causa e também pela protecção devida aos restantes cidadãos.''
&lt;br /&gt;
''Em conformidade com tais afirmações, o consumidor de drogas é sanciondo pela lei vigente de maneira quase simbólica, procurando-se que o contacto com o sistema formal da justiça sirva para o incentivar ao tratamento, na hipótese de ter sido atingido pela toxico-dependência.''"&lt;ref name="orig-law"/&gt;|group=nb|name="law1"}}

While drug use is illegal in Portugal, the law's introduction notes of occasional drug users: "it is necessary above all to avoid them being labelled, marginalised, pushed into an impasse or towards avenues whose only way out is drugs."&lt;ref name="gddc-eng"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|"''Para os consumidores ocasionais, acima de tudo deseja-se a sua não etiquetagem, a não marginalização, enfim, que o seu semelhante o não empurre para becos sem saída ou que a saída acabe mesmo por ser a droga.''"&lt;ref name="orig-law"/&gt;| group=nb| name="law2"}} However, the Portuguese government condemned the Dutch pragmatic policy, well known for its absence of user punishment.

Drug trafficking is punished with very harsh sentences; in the most severe cases, it can be punished by 10 years to 25 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="drugtext"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Demand reduction''' refers to efforts aimed at reducing the public desire for illegal and illicit drugs. The [[drug policy]] is in contrast to the [[supply reduction|reduction of drug supply]], but the two policies are often implemented together. Some discussions of demand reduction make a distinction between policies that address single issues (such as public "knowledge-of-harms") or are short-term interventions(in-school programs), and those that approach drug demand as a complex issue with multiple social risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spooner|first1=Catherine|last2=Hall|first2=Wayne|last3=Lynskey|first3=Michael|title=Structural determinants of youth drug use|date=2001|publisher=Australian National Council on Drugs|location=Tuross Head, N.S.W.|isbn=1877018015|url=http://www.ancd.org.au/images/PDF/Researchpapers/rp2_youth_drug_use.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists such as [[Milton Friedman]] argue that due to the law of [[supply and demand]], reducing demand is the only effective way to reduce drug use long-term.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It is questionable, however, whether demand reduction programs actually reduce demand.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

{{Democracy}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Demoicracy''' (also demoi-cracy) is a polity of multiple distinct people (''demoi''), polity of polities. The term is derived from ''demoi'' (δῆμοι in original [[Ancient Greek]], plural form of δῆμος or ''demos''), meaning "peoples" and ''kratos'' (κράτος) meaning "power" (to govern oneself). It is apparently meant to become an alternative to [[democracy]], understood as power of a single ''demos''. The term is used mainly to describe the genus of the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]) but is also gaining currency in more general theories of democracy above state level.

==History==
Philippe van Parijs used the term "demoi-cracy" negatively in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs 'Should the European union become more democratic?' in Follesdal, Andreas &amp; Koslowski, Peter ''Democracy and the European Union'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the existing state of affair in Europe and in contrast to "European demos-cracy". This is not the meaning of the term in mainstream scholarship today. Instead, the term refers to [[Kalypso Nicolaïdis]] original statement in 2003 that the EU ought to be understood as a demoicracy in the making,  a third way against two alternatives which both equate the possibility of democracy with the existence of a single demos, either national demos (the EU as association of democratic states) or supranational (the EU as a federal state). In contrast, the EU is not and should not be conceived of as any form of state (federal or any other) and does not depend on the existence of a single European demos to be demoicratic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaïdis, Kalypso 'Our European Demoï-cracy: Is this Constitution a Third Way for Europe?' in Nicolaidis, Kalypso &amp; Weatherill, Stephen ''Whose Europe? National Models and the Constitution of the European Union'', European Studies at Oxford Series, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'We the Peoples of Europe' in Foreign Affairs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept has both descriptive and normative aspects. It tries to square the circle between the common criticism that the EU is undemocratic (the ''[[democratic deficit]]'' thesis) and the claim that there is no European demos (the ''no demos thesis''), purporting that a demos is not a ''sine qua non'' for democracy and multiple separate demoi can effectively control the government and in that sense exercise [[popular sovereignty]]. Later, Nicolaidis refined her definition of demoicracy as "a Union of peoples who govern together but not as one" [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.12006/full  &lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'European Demoicracy and Its Crisis,' Journal of Common Market Studies March Volume 51 No 2: 351–369, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Philosophy==
Nicolaïdis’s originally advanced the concept as an alternative to the calls of the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas 'Why Europe Needs Constitution?' in 11 ''New Left Review'' (2001). See also Jurgen Habermas &amp; Jacques Derrida 'February 15, or What Binds Europeans Together' in 10 ''Constellations'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the former German foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]]&lt;ref&gt;Joschka Fischer 'From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration', Speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin, 12 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  that a common European [[Cultural identity|identity]] must and should be ‘forged’. Instead, she argued in favour of a [[community]] which recognises its irreducible internal [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and is based on [[mutual recognition]] of differences rather than shared values as Habermas would have it.  While both sides of the debate premise their argument on some arguable empirical claims (distinct ‘European’ values or celebration of tolerance respectively), neither of these is necessary for the normative plausibility of demoicracy as a theoretical concept. Currently many other commentators maintain that the concept is uniquely adequate for the age of interdependence of states and globalization of governance which should supersede the 'nation-centred' vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Werner Muller 'The Promise of Demoi-cracy: Diversity and Domination in the European Public Order' in Neyer, Jurgen &amp; Wiener, Antije ''The Political Theory of the European Union''(2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps that is why the term was latter embraced by some of the major proponents of deliberative democracy like [[James Bohman]]&lt;ref&gt;James Bohman 'From Demos to Demoi: Democracy across Borders' in 18 Ratio Juris (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samantha Besson]]&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Besson 'Deliberative Demoi-cracy in the EU: Towards the Deteritorialisation of Democracy' in Samantha Besson &amp; Jose Luis Marti, ''Deliberative democracy and its discontents'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  (even if not by Habermas himself). With the work of the latter authors the concept gained currency beyond the EU-scholarship and especially among the [[cosmopolitan republicanists]] as the most promising way for realisation of [[transnational democracy]]. Bohman in particular sees demoicracy as an emancipation project. It is meant to avoid domination which can occur across borders (citizens of one state may suffer from decisions of citizens of another which are taken arbitrarily). As domination can occur also internally all oppressed groups may qualify as demoi deserving a voice in governance. Thus, Besson suggests a dynamic concept of ''demoi'', which comprises all those affected by any particular decision (and thus subject to arbitrary domination by the group of the decision-makers).

==European Union==
With regard to the EU the concept has been criticized because it does not provide an answer to the 'no demos thesis' but merely disguises the problem of democratic deficit and forgoes the capacity of peoples to collectively control their fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Mair]], ‘Ruling the Void? The Hollowing of Western Democracy’ in New Left Review (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet the concept is certainly more than a euphemism or exercise in scholastic creativity&amp;nbsp;– if the EU is qualitatively different from the nation state (and from the federation) it needs to be analysed in different terms as well. As almost all politicians and academics claim the EU is not and should not become a superstate, it would be grossly misleading to evaluate it in terms of a state. Indeed, it makes little sense to claim that the Union is not a state and in the same time to criticise it for not being a democratic one. On the other hand, if it is recognised that the Union, as a polity of its own kind is to be analysed in idiosyncratic terms, we face a problem of circularity&amp;nbsp;– we face an entity which claims to be a standard to itself.
Recognising that, Francis Cheneval and Frank Schimmelfenning propose to extend the moral constructivism of John Rawls to transnational cases: 'the inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state do not only imply the normative expectation of rule of law and procedural justice for the fundamental institutions of international society. They also imply normative expectations of democratic government in a society of liberal  democratic states. The inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state will eventually filter through into the relational structure of liberal democratic states.'&lt;ref name="euce"&gt;Francis Cheneval &amp; Frank Schimmelfenning 'The Case for Demoicracy in the EU' (2011) available at http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/8h_cheneval.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus they set out to derive abstract moral principles for a demoicracy and use them to judge the EU subsequently. Their principles apply to transnational as well as to national level, and they find that the EU is approaching these principle while 'major demoi-cratic deficits remain at the national level.'&lt;ref name="euce" /&gt;  In spite of this optimistic result, there is at least one deficiency of the EU from demoicratic perspective and it is that the governance discourse is almost exclusively elitist. This is especially problematic as demoicracy is calling for even more involvement of citizens on issues of governance.

==Development==
Most demoicracy scholarship is abstract, and very little has been done to flesh out what an actual demoicracy should look like. Yet there are few practical claims that seem shared by all of the commentators. The first is the reliance on networks as agents of democracy beyond the nation-state where discourses are not mediated by states or nationality. The second is the active participation of citizens in these networks so that they are involved in the decision-making, deliberations and contestation at every level. All demoicrats would emphasise the importance of horizontal relationships between citizens, organisations and institutions from the different ''demoi'' on issues of their collective governance or on the governance of other states. Rights and legitimate interests of citizens are not limited to their own demos/polity but are extended across the borders to what is usually considered internal affairs of the other polities and people. This horizontal relationship is what distinguishes a demoicracy from a federation where the internal affairs of a federal unit are insulated from external contestation at least horizontally.

Beyond these general principles however, few details of an actual demoicracy are spelled out. To remedy this, Cheneval and Schimmelfenning with a team of researchers at ETH Zurich have embarked on a project intended 'to map and explain the development of demoicratic institutions.'&lt;ref name="ETH"&gt;The project 'Designing "Demoi-cracy" in the European Union' of the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) Zurich. More information is available at http://www.eup.ethz.ch/research/demoicracy/&lt;/ref&gt; A precious few examples of genuine demoicratic institutions have been identified by other researchers. Bohman celebrates the system of policy coordination through committees and agencies in the EU as a demoicratic mechanism.&lt;ref name="ETH" /&gt; This is noteworthy, as from the traditional, that is ''demo''-cratic, perspective the influence of numerous EU committees and working parties is quite questionable. In the same vein, Michael Buess reconsiders the interaction between the EU agencies and their national counterparts from demoicratic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Buess 'European Union Agencies' Relationships with their National Counterparts' presentation at European Union Studies Association Conference Boston, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example of demoicratically interlinked institutions is the so-called ‘yellow card’ or [[Early Warning Mechanism]] introduced by the [[Lisbon Treaty]]. According to Vesco Paskalev this is an attempt to provide an institutionalized network which enables many ''demoi'' to deliberate together on substantive EU legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Vesco Paskalev 'Lisbon Treaty and the Possibility of a European Network Demoi-Cracy' (2009), European University Institute Working paper available at http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/13005/LAW_2009_20.pdf?sequence=1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3673">'''Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law''' is an [[Israel]]i law passed in 1988, that prohibits the [[employer]] from [[Discrimination|discriminating]] between [[Application for employment|job applicants]] or [[employee]]s on the following criteria:
*Sex
*Sexual orientation
*Pregnancy
*Fertility treatment
*Parenting
*Age
*Race
*Religion
*Nationality
*Country of origin
*Residence
*Political view
*Reservist duty

Anything required by the character or substance of the position or job is not to be deemed discriminatory by the law.&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 2(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibition of discrimination applies to hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or [[Severance package|severance pay]] and [[Employee benefit|benefits]] and payments provided for employees in connection with their [[retirement]] from employment. The law was enacted in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 27&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced an earlier 1981 law.&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 25&lt;/ref&gt; 
    
The law further provides that, under certain conditions, provisions in an enactment, [[Collective bargaining|collective agreement]] or [[employment contract]] made in connection with maternity are not to be considered discriminatory. It also provides that any rights given to working mothers are to be given equally to working fathers, under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Protection from [[sexual harassment]] is addressed in section 7, which states that an employer shall not "act against" an employee who rejects, or opposes, any act of a sexual nature committed by the employer or by the supervisor of the employee.

Violation of the law constitutes both a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]]&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 10&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crime|criminal offence]],&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, sections 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; and courts may grant compensation even when no material damage was caused.&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 10(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, civil proceedings can be initiated by an employee, an employee organization or [[civil rights]] group,&lt;ref&gt;Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, section 12&lt;/ref&gt; with special protection granted to the worker filing the complaint. The Israeli Ministry of Economy (formerly known as the [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry]]) is responsible for promoting the law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1860">'''''Englander v Telus Communications Inc''''',  2004 FCA 387 is a leading [[Federal Court of Appeal]] decision on Canadian [[privacy law]] under [[PIPEDA]].

==Background==
Mathew Englander filed a complaint with the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] against [[Telus]], his residential telephone service provider, for disclosing its customers' personal information to third parties without the customers' knowledge and consent, and for charging customers a two-dollar fee to have an unlisted phone number.

The Privacy Commissioner found the complaint not well-founded, citing a [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) rule that allowed a fee of up to two dollars for being de-listed. Englander then applied to the [[Federal Court of Canada]] – Trial Division for a [[declaration (law)|judicial declaration]] that Telus's policies contravened PIPEDA, and other relief, but the court dismissed the application.

==Opinion of the Court of Appeal==
The Court of appeal held that Telus was permitted to charge a fee under the CRTC regulations for name removal. However, the Court also found that Telus violated PIPEDA by not gaining full consent when they failed to offer the option to have the name excluded from the white pages when the customer signed up for the program.

'''Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters''' is a [[European Union regulation]] in the field of judicial cooperation. It allows [[Letter rogatory#Taking of evidence|taking of evidence]] from one member state to another without recourse to [[consular]] and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic channels]]. The regulation applies to all the [[member states of the European Union]] with the exception of [[Denmark]]. The [[Danish European Union opt-out referendum, 2015]], which would have opted-in, was rejected by the populace.

Taking of evidence in civil cases prior to the regulation was done by either under the [[Hague Evidence Convention]] or by means of a ''[[letter rogatory]]'' (also called a letter of request), a formal request from a [[court]] in one country to take evidence to another in which the [[witness]] is domiciled. This formal document usually required transmission from the originating court to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MFA) in the state of origin, who then forwarded it, possibly through various [[Embassy|embassies]], to the MFA in the destination state. The foreign MFA would then pass the documents to the judicial authorities in that state, who would then go about obtaining the required evidence. The evidence would then be returned via the same long winded channels.

This regulation enables a somewhat simplified route by allowing direct contact between the [[court]]s in the member states. A standardised request form included in the annex to the regulation must be used. This aids the process by being widely recognised by the relevant authorities. The regulation also contains various articles to promote the use of communication technologies such as [[Conference call|telephone conferencing]] and [[videoconferencing]].

[[File:Suomalainen sotilasvala.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Finnish conscripts taking their military oath]]

'''Military oath''' in the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] is taken by [[conscripts]] on a legal basis in the beginning of their military service. If the conscript is unwilling to take the oath, another option is to take the military affirmation. Before the conscript is to take the oath, he must be briefed on the rights and responsibilities of a soldier, as well as on the meaning of the oath. The oath is administered by the unit's commanding officer and in the presence of the unit's flag. The military oath used to be available only to members of the church, however, current legislation no longer makes such a distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2007/en20071438.pdf | title = Conscription Act | publisher = Ministry of Defence | accessdate = February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/show.asp?tunniste=HE+6/2003&amp;base=erhe&amp;palvelin=www.eduskunta.fi&amp;f=WORD | title = Hallituksen esitys Eduskunnalle laiksi asevelvollisuuslain 28 §:n muuttamisesta| publisher = Parliament of Finland| accessdate = August 14, 2008| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finlex"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2007/20071443 | title = Valtioneuvoston asetus asevelvollisuudesta | publisher = Parliament of Finland| accessdate = February 5, 2017| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the military oath is taken after the basic training period or about seven weeks into the conscript's military service. Depending on the circumstances, the oath ceremony is held either at the garrison or at a nearby municipality. The aim is to make the event as ceremonious as possible. The relatives of the conscript's are usually invited to attend the ceremony. The ceremony also includes a parade, field service, equipment demonstration and lunch. After taking the oath, the conscripts receive the rank of private. The military affirmation is usually taken on the same day in a smaller ceremony. The conscripts who take the assurance usually still participate in the oath ceremony, but do not take the oath itself.

==Oath and affirmation text==
===Finnish text===
Minä N. N. lupaan ja vakuutan kaikkivaltiaan ja kaikkitietävän Jumalan edessä (vakuutuksessa: kunniani ja omantuntoni kautta),
olevani Suomen valtakunnan luotettava ja uskollinen kansalainen. Tahdon palvella maatani rehellisesti sekä parhaan kykyni mukaan etsiä ja edistää sen hyötyä ja parasta.
Minä tahdon kaikkialla ja kaikissa tilanteissa, rauhan ja sodan aikana puolustaa isänmaani koskemattomuutta, sen laillista valtiojärjestystä sekä valtakunnan laillista esivaltaa. Jos havaitsen tai saan tietää jotakin olevan tekeillä laillisen esivallan kukistamiseksi tai maan valtiojärjestyksen kumoamiseksi, tahdon sen viipymättä viranomaisille ilmoittaa.
Joukkoa, johon kuulun sekä paikkaani siinä, en jätä missään tilanteessa, vaan niin kauan kuin minussa voimia on, suoritan saamani tehtävän loppuun.
Lupaan käyttäytyä kunnollisesti ja ryhdikkäästi, totella esimiehiäni, noudattaa lakeja ja asetuksia sekä säilyttää minulle uskotut palvelussalaisuudet. Tahdon olla suora ja auttavainen myös palvelustovereitani kohtaan. Milloinkaan en sukulaisuuden, ystävyyden, kateuden, vihan tai pelon vuoksi enkä myöskään lahjojen tai muun syyn tähden toimi vastoin palvelusvelvollisuuttani.
Jos minut asetetaan esimiesasemaan, tahdon olla alaisiani kohtaan oikeudenmukainen, pitää huolta heidän hyvinvoinnistaan, hankkia tietoa heidän toiveistaan, olla heidän neuvonantajanaan ja ohjaajanaan sekä omasta puolestani pyrkiä olemaan heille hyvänä ja kannustavana esimerkkinä.
Kaiken tämän minä tahdon kunniani ja omantuntoni mukaan täyttää.&lt;ref name="Finlex"/&gt;

===English translation===
I, (name), promise and affirm before the almighty and all-knowing God (in affirmation: by my honor and by my conscience),
that I am a trustworthy and faithful citizen of the realm of Finland. I want to serve my country honestly and, to my best ability, seek and pursue her edification and advantage.
I want everywhere and in every situation, during the peace and during the war, defend the inviolability of my fatherland, her legal system of government and the legal authority of the realm. If I perceive or gain knowledge of activity to overthrow the legal authority or to subvert the system of government of the country, I want to report it to the authorities without delay.
The troop to which I belong and my place in it I will not desert in any situation, but so long as I have strength in me, I will completely fulfill the task I have received.
I promise to act properly and uprightly, obey my superiors, comply with the laws and decrees and keep the service secrets trusted in me. I want to be forthright and helpful to my fellow servicemen. Never will I due to kinship, friendship, envy, hatred or fear nor because of gifts or any other reason act contrary to my duty in service. If I be given a position of superiority, I want to be rightful to my subordinates, to take care of their well-being, acquire information on their wishes, to be their councilor and guide and, for my own self, set them a good and encouraging example. 
All this I want to fulfill according to my honor and my conscience.&lt;ref name="Finlex"/&gt;

The '''Florida Building Code (FBC)''' is a set of standards designed by the [[United States|US]] state of [[Florida]] for buildings. Many regulations and guidelines distributed are important benchmarks regarding [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] protection. [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] was the first in Florida to certify hurricane resistant standards for structures which the Florida Building Code subsequently enacted across all requirements for Hurricane resistant buildings. Many other states reference the requirements set in the Florida Building codes, or have developed their own requirements for hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.allegion.com/IRSTDocs/Brochure/109459.pdf|title=Allegion Windstorm solutions (p. 5)|last=|first=|date=2016-03-16|website=allegion.co/us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many aspects the Florida Building Code is similar to and is based upon the [[International Building Code|International Building Code (IBC)]] used in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridabuilding.org/fbc/q-a/florida_building_code_q-a.doc|title=Florida Building Code Q&amp;A|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Building Code, 5th Edition, released 2014, is currently the latest, with the 6th edition due in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.charlottecountyfl.gov/dept/commdev/Documents/5thEditionFBC_UpdatePresentation.pdf|title=Florida Building Code, 5th Edition (2014) Update|last=|first=|date=June 30, 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://floridabuilding.org/c/default.aspx|title=Florida Building Commission Site|last=|first=|date=|website=floridabuilding.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Guidelines ==
The 2010 edition of the Florida Building Code introduced significant changes to wind load design, in particular the presentation of the wind speed maps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridabuilding.org/fbc/wind_2010/flyer_wind_january2012.pdf|title=Changes to the Wind Speed Maps and Wind Design – 2010 Florida Building Codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] norms, are both included in the High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ) and contain more stringent requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other counties such as [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] do not require the same HVHZ building standards for compliance with the Florida Building Codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/|title=Palm Beach County News - Sun Sentinel|website=www.sun-sentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Miami-Dade County and the State of Florida maintain web-searchable databases of products approved for use as hurricane protection. These typically include not only actual test results from certified independent testing laboratories, they also contain "Product Approval Drawings" or "Installation Instructions" which provide specifications for hurricane shutter assembly and installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/building/pc-search_app.asp|title=Miami-Dade County - Building - Product Control Search|last=Services|first=Miami-Dade County Online|website=www.miamidade.gov|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact tests conducted on building materials are measured and tested via TAS201, 202 and 203.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.iccsafe.org/app/book/content/PDF/2001%20Florida%20Codes/Test%20Protocols/Testing%20Application%20Standard%20201-94.pdf|title=Testing Application Standard (TAS) 201-94|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.iccsafe.org/app/book/content/PDF/2001%20Florida%20Codes/Test%20Protocols/Testing%20Application%20Standard%20202-94.pdf|title=Testing Application Standard (TAS) 202-94|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.iccsafe.org/app/book/content/PDF/2001%20Florida%20Codes/Test%20Protocols/Testing%20Application%20Standard%20203-94.pdf|title=Testing Application Standard (TAS) 203-94|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F010324-0002, Flughafen Köln-Bonn, Adenauer, de Gaulle-cropped.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles de Gaulle]], 20 May 1961]]

A '''referendum on the direct election of the President''' was held in [[France]] on 28 October 1962.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p674 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question was whether to have the [[President of France|president of the French Republic]] elected by direct popular vote, rather than by an [[electoral college]]. It was approved by 62.3% of voters with a 77.0% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p685&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reform was controversial because it strengthened the executive at the expense of [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], and because of the disputed constitutionality of the procedure used.

==Background==
In the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth Republic]], [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] elected the President of the Republic. In the original 1958 constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], the president was elected by an [[electoral college]], in a manner similar to the [[Senator of France|senators]]: electors were the members of Parliament, members of the [[departments of France|departmental]] assemblies, and representatives of cities, towns and villages (such as mayors).&lt;ref&gt;See [[:s:fr:Constitution de 1958 avec modifications#Article 6|Article 6 of the 1958 Constitution]]. Note that most versions of the constitution available online and in books are not the original version, but some later amended version.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles de Gaulle]] was elected in this manner in the [[French presidential election, 1958|1958 presidential election]].

The presidential office in the Third and Fourth republic was largely ceremonial, with most executive power vested in the "president of the Council of ministers" (short: "president of the Council" or ''président du conseil''), a more powerful analogue to the present-day [[Prime minister of France|Prime minister]]. Charles de Gaulle, who largely designed the constitution of the Fifth Republic, wanted a more powerful presidential office. The proposed change would have the president elected by the [[two-round system|two-round system of voting]];  This direct election by more than half of the non-blank ballots directly cast by the citizenship would give the office much more legitimacy and status than indirect election by the presidential college, thus greater influence even with unchanged constitutional powers.

==Proposal and debate==
:''See [[French legislative election, 1962]] for more about the French politics of that time.''
Charles de Gaulle soon preferred to be elected by direct popular vote, which would give him a stronger political position, and proposed that the Constitution be amended.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/espace-pedagogique/le-point-sur/les-textes-a-connaitre/discours-du-20-septembre-1962.php radiophonic speech] to the nation of 20 September 1962 by Charles de Gaulle, announcing the forthcoming referendum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was highly controversial. Part of the controversy concerned the constitutional processes for modifying the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; According to article 89 of the [[Constitution of France]], any constitutional reform must be first approved by both houses of Parliament: the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] and the [[Senate of France|Senate]]. Then it is either approved by a referendum, or by a solemn joint session of both houses known as [[Congress of France|Congress]]. Instead, Charles de Gaulle used Article 11 of the Constitution, which allows the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], then [[Georges Pompidou]], to request the President to submit to a referendum a bill in certain areas of law, including "the organization of public powers". To summarize, supporters of de Gaulle and the referendum contended that Article 11 allowed bills to be passed on constitutional matters, while opponents considered that the existence of a special process in Article 89 precluded this.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conflit"/&gt;

Many legal scholars and politicians disagreed with this application of Article 11, which they felt was unconstitutional, while [[Gaullism|Gaullist]]s generally supported the move.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; [[François Mitterrand]], former minister and future President of the Republic, characterized the referendum as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Mitterrand]], ''Le coup d'état permanent'' ("The permanent coup d'état", alluding to [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency), 1966; later edition 1998, Julliard, {{ISBN|2-260-00378-8}}: ''Ainsi s'explique le secret de son obstination à obtenir par le référendum
inconstitutionnel de 1962 cette réforme'' ("Thus is explained [De Gaulle's] obstination to obtain this reform by the unconstitutional referendum of 1962")&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaston Monnerville]], president of the Senate, referred the matter to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] (Article 61). The council however ruled that it fell outside of its jurisdiction to strike down a reform voted by the French people, thus upholding de Gaulle's action.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Alec Stone, ''The Birth of Judicial Politics in France: The Constitutional Council in Comparative Perspective'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-507034-8}}, chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/1962/62-20-dc/decision-n-62-20-dc-du-06-novembre-1962.6398.html decision 62-20 DC] from the Constitutional Council.&lt;/ref&gt; This was unsurprising: from 1958 to 1970, under Charles de Gaulle's presidency, the Constitutional Council was sometimes described as a "cannon aimed at Parliament",&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; protecting the executive branch against encroachment by Parliament; all referrals except the one from Monnerville had come from the Prime Minister, who always got a ruling of partial unconstitutionality (the Council had struck down for unconstitutionality provisions introduced by Parliament that the Prime Minister disagreed with).&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; Monnerville went as far as to use the strong word of ''forfaiture'' ("abuse of authority") against the behaviour of Prime Minister Pompidou, who had accepted the referendum project.&lt;ref name="conflit"&gt;[[French Senate]], ''[http://www.senat.fr/evenement/archives/D23/1962.html Le conflit du référendum de 1962]'' ("The conflict of the referendum of 1962")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19621003&amp;pageDebut=09522&amp;pageFin=&amp;pageCourante=09522 Decree 62-1127 of 2 October 1962], preceded by a letter from Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]] to President Charles de Gaulle proposing him to submit to a referendum. following article 11 of the Constitution, a bill changing the method for electing the President of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the National Assembly were also very unhappy about the situation. On 4 October 1962, the Assembly [[vote of no-confidence|voted no-confidence in the Government]],&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the National Assembly, [http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/1/cri/1962-1963-ordinaire1/003.pdf 4 October 1962], second sitting; vote tally on p. 3268. p. 38 in the PDF file&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the automatic resignation of the Prime Minister (Constitution, article 49-2); this was the only successful vote of no-confidence of the Fifth Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/institutions/approfondissements/motion-censure-veritable-moyen-controle.html La motion de censure : véritable moyen de contrôle ?] ("The no-confidence vote: true means of control?")&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was supported by, among others, former prime ministers&lt;ref&gt;More precisely: during the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the position corresponding to the prime minister was known as ''Président du conseil des ministres'' ("president of the Council of ministers"), shortened to ''Président du conseil''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Guy Mollet]], who severely criticized the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;See debates of the National Assembly on 4 October 1962: [http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/1/cri/1962-1963-ordinaire1/002.pdf first sitting], [http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/1/cri/1962-1963-ordinaire1/003.pdf second sitting].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles de Gaulle]] dissolved the Assembly within a few days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19621010&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=09818&amp;pageFin= Decree of 9 October 1962] dissolving the National Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; thus provoking [[French legislative election, 1962|legislative elections in November]], and appointed Georges Pompidou again.

==Aftermath==
Since the referendum was positive, the mode of election of the president changed, and Charles de Gaulle remains the only president of France elected by an electoral college. Charles de Gaulle [[French presidential election, 1965|was reelected in 1965]], this time by direct suffrage.

The '''GNU Lesser General Public License''' ('''LGPL''') is a [[free software license]] published by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF). The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own (even [[proprietary software|proprietary]]) software without being required by the terms of a strong [[copyleft]] license to release the source code of their own components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source code availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a [[shared library]], so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for [[Library (computing)|software libraries]], although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.

The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong [[copyleft]] of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) and more [[Permissive free software licence|permissive]] licenses such as the [[BSD license]]s and the [[MIT License]]. The word "Lesser" in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user's complete freedom in the use of software; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, but not for any proprietary components.

==History==
The license was originally called the '''GNU Library General Public License''' and was first published in 1991, and adopted the version number 2 for parity with GPL version 2. The LGPL was revised in minor ways in the 2.1 point release, published in 1999, when it was renamed the GNU Lesser General Public License to reflect the FSF's position that not all libraries should use it. Version 3 of the LGPL was published in 2007 as a list of additional permissions applied to GPL version 3.

==Differences from the GPL==
The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, "used by") a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is [[free software]] or [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="not_use_LGPL"&gt;Stallman, Richard. [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt; The non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a [[derivative work]]. If it is a derivative work, then the program's terms must allow for "modification for the customer's own use and [[reverse engineering]] for debugging such modifications." Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a derivative work or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|dynamically links]] to a library through a [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|.so]], [[Dynamic-link library|.dll]], or similar medium is generally accepted as not being a derivative work as defined by the LGPL. It would fall under the definition of a "work that uses the Library". Paragraph 5 of the LGPL version 2.1 states:

:A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

Essentially, if it is a "work that uses the library", then it must be possible for the software to be linked with a newer version of the LGPL-covered program. The most commonly used method for doing so is to use "a suitable [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|shared library]] mechanism for linking". Alternatively, a [[statically linked library]] is allowed if either source code or linkable object files are provided.&lt;ref name="LGPL_Section_4"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html#section4 Gnu Lesser General Public License, Section 4], pt. d) 0)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compatibility==
One feature of the LGPL is the permission to [[Software relicensing|relicense]] under the GPL any piece of software which is received under the LGPL (see section 3 of the LGPL version 2.1, and section 2 option b of the LGPL version 3). This feature allows for direct reuse of LGPLed code in GPLed libraries and applications.

Version 3 of the LGPL is not inherently compatible with version 2 of the GPL.  However, works using the latter that have given permission to use a later version of the GPL are compatible:&lt;ref name="LGPL_FSF"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#LGPL GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt; a work released under the GPLv2 "or any later version" may be combined with code from a LGPL version 3 library, with the combined work as a whole falling under the terms of the GPLv3.&lt;ref name="LGPL_FSF_MATRIX"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#gpl-compat-matrix Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation]. [[Free Software Foundation]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGPL for libraries==
The former name "GNU Library General Public License" gave some the impression that the FSF recommended software libraries use the LGPL and that programs use the GPL. In February 1999, GNU Project leader Richard Stallman wrote the essay ''Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library'' explaining that the LGPL had not been [[deprecation|deprecated]], but that one should not ''necessarily'' use the LGPL for all libraries:

:Which license is best for a given library is a matter of strategy ... Using the ordinary GPL for a library gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary developers: a library that they can use, while proprietary developers cannot use it ... When a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software through other alternative libraries ... the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.&lt;ref name="not_use_LGPL" /&gt;

Stallman and the FSF sometimes advocate licenses even less restrictive than the LGPL as a matter of strategy. A prominent{{cn|date=October 2018}} example was Stallman's endorsement of the use of a [[BSD license|BSD-style]] license by the [[Vorbis]] project for use in its libraries.&lt;ref name="Vorbis_and_BSD"&gt;Stallman, Richard. [https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3 &lt;nowiki&gt;Re: [open-source] [Fwd: [icecast-dev] Xiph.org announces Vorbis Beta 4 and the Xiph.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming language specifications==
The license uses terminology which is mainly intended for applications written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or its family. Franz Inc. published its own preamble to the license to clarify terminology in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] context. LGPL with this preamble is sometimes referred as LLGPL.&lt;ref name="LGPL_preamble"&gt;[http://opensource.franz.com/preamble.html Preamble to the Gnu Lesser General Public License]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] has a special feature, [[wikibooks:Ada Programming/Generics|generics]], which may prompt the use of [[GNAT Modified General Public License]]: it allows code to link against or instantiate GMGPL-covered units without the code itself becoming covered by the GPL.

[[C++]] templates and [[Header-only|header-only libraries]] have the same problem as Ada generics. Version 3 of the LGPL addresses such cases in section 3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://listengine.tuxfamily.org/lists.tuxfamily.org/eigen/2008/02/msg00003.html LGPLv3 for a C++ Pure Template Library ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class inheritance===
Some concern has risen about the suitability of object-oriented classes in LGPL'd being [[Inheritance (computer science)|inherited]] by non-(L)GPL code. Clarification is given on the official GNU website:

:The LGPL does not  contain special provisions for inheritance, because none are needed. Inheritance creates derivative works in the same way as traditional linking, and the LGPL permits this type of derivative work in the same way as it permits ordinary function calls.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, David.

'''Gibson and Weldon''' was a law practice at 27 [[Chancery Lane]] in London and the name of its tutorial firm which from 1876 until 1962 prepared hundreds of thousands of future [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s in England and Wales for their examinations.&lt;ref&gt;''International Bar Journal'' (November 1973). [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.barjournals/intbrjrnl0004&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= "Book Review: ''Gibson's, 1876–1962: A chapter in legal education''"], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and Weldon also published the monthly journal ''Law Notes'' and a series of legal textbooks from adjacent offices at 25–26 Chancery Lane. The firm's principles were Albert Gibson (1852–1921) and Arthur William Weldon (1856–1943). After the death of Arthur Weldon the tutorial firm continued until 1962 when it was merged with the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]'s own law school to form the College of Law (since 2013 known as the [[University of Law]]).

==History==
The latter part of the 19th century saw the introduction of formal examinations for entry into the legal profession. From 1862 solicitors were required to pass the Intermediate and Preliminary Examinations set by the Law Society, and later a prestigious Honours Examination was introduced. Compulsory written examinations for barristers were introduced in 1872. The university law schools concentrated on the principles, as opposed to the practice, of the law and found it increasingly difficult to sustain courses which could provide the practical knowledge required to pass the examinations. The Council of Legal Education, established by the [[Inns of Court]] in 1852, had the same problem.&lt;ref name = "Abel"&gt;Abel, (1998).

Beard Books (reprint of the 1988 edition). {{ISBN|1587982501}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn led to the rise of specialist tutorial firms which legal historian Patricia Leighton has termed "the first professional law teachers."&lt;ref name = "Leighton"&gt;Leighton, Patricia (2014).

Paper presented at the [[Society of Legal Scholars]] Conference, Nottingham 2014. Retrieved 12 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The firms were largely established and run by practicing attorneys in London. The tension arising in the profession between the systems followed by the university law schools and those of the tutorial firms had sometimes led them to be dismissed as "[[crammer]]s". It was a tension reflected in Gibson and Weldon's own 1905 advertisement stating that their "system of student preparation is as far as possible that of a Law School and all idea of preparing students on a 'cram' system is disregarded."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Leighton (2014) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1929, while still an undergraduate at Cambridge, [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]], the future [[Chief Justice of India]], applied to Gibson and Weldon to prepare him for the barrister examination in six weeks. The firm refused, writing to him "we do not work miracles."&lt;ref&gt;Hidayatullah, Mohammad (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=31nqgwKuK3sC&amp;pg=PA54 ''Law in the Scientific Era''], p. 54. Universal Law Publishing (reprint of the 1981 edition). {{ISBN|8175342609}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Over 60 years after the firm's founding, the British jurist [[R. M. Jackson]] wrote in ''The Machinery of Justice in England'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was in my time a pupil of Gibson and Weldon and I received better training from Mr. Weldon than I ever had in Cambridge, and by that I do not mean just the know-how to pass examinations but a real insight into the ways of lawyers and the courts.&lt;ref name = "Stevens"&gt;Stevens, Robert Bocking (January 1969).

Retrieved via [[JSTOR]] 12 June 2016 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gibson and Weldon began in 1876 when Albert Gibson who had qualified as a solicitor in the Easter 1874 Honours examination began advertising for pupils who needed coaching for the Law Society examinations. In 1881, he was joined by the newly qualified Arthur Weldon who had been one of his first pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TOIyAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=gibson+weldon+solicitors&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=spent ''Graya: A Magazine for Members of Gray's Inn''] (1957). Volume 10, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Gibson and Weldon, along with Indermaur and Thwaites,{{efn|The principles of Indermaur and Thwaites were [[John Indermaur]] (1852–1925) and Charles Thwaites who qualified as a solicitor in 1880, six years after Indermaur.

The two firms also dominated the law publishing market.&lt;ref name = "Leighton" /&gt; January 1882 saw the first edition of ''Gibson's Law Notes'', a monthly magazine for law students which originally published model answers and study advice for the Law Society examinations and other articles of interest to the legal profession. In 1885 it became simply ''Law Notes'' and remained in publication until the mid-1990s, long after Gibson and Weldon had ceased existence as a tutorial firm. Gibson and Weldon also published guides to the profession such as ''How to Become a Barrister'' and ''How to Become a Solicitor'' and numerous student-centered text books which were frequently updated in multiple editions. Their text book on [[conveyancing]], first published in 1888 ran to 21 editions, the last of which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|499718708}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For a time Edward Power Bilbrough was a partner in their practice at 27 Chancery Lane and also co-authored a textbook on the Companies Act of 1900 with Gibson and Weldon.{{efn| Edward Power Bilbrough later married Mary Lewis, an actress and the sister of [[Lewis Waller]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Law Times'' (1909). "Marriages", Vol. 126, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, he left to form his own practice in 1901, and Gibson, Weldon and Bilbrough once again became Gibson and Weldon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[London Gazette]]'' (7 January 1902). [https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/27395/page/179/data.pdf "Gibson, Weldon, and Bilborough"], p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, several other lawyers joined the firm as tutors and as authors of their teaching materials. These included Gibson's godson Henry Gibson Rivington (1872–1954), Arthur Clifford Fountaine (1875–1931) and Hermon Joseph Bond Cockshutt (1907–1970). In addition to their taught courses, which normally consisted of three months of intensive teaching, Gibson and Weldon also ran correspondence courses for [[articled clerk]]s working outside London or unable to take time off work to attend in person. [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]] studied for all his examinations in the early 1930s via their correspondence courses.&lt;ref name = "Hogg"&gt;Hogg, Quintin (1990). ''A Sparrow's Flight: The Memoirs of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone'', p. 70. HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0002155451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, ten years after the death of Albert Gibson, the firm was incorporated as a [[limited liability company]], Gibson and Weldon (Law Tutors) Ltd.{{efn|Despite its merger into the College of Law in 1962, Gibson and Weldon (Law Tutors) Ltd. was not formally dissolved until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies House]].

Retrieved 13 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1961 the company was acquired by the Law Society, whose own law school was one of their competitors. The following year, the society merged the two schools into the College of Law with branches in London and [[Guildford]]. Hermon Cockshutt, an expert on tax law and the senior partner in Gibson and Weldon after the death of Arthur Weldon in 1943, had been instrumental in the negotiations leading to the firm's acquisition by the Law Society. He became the Deputy Chairman of the Board of the newly formed college.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Law Society Gazette]]'' (1970). "Hermon Joseph Bond Cockshutt", Vol 10, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|John Widgery]], the future [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], was another of Gibson and Weldon's tutors who continued teaching at the newly formed college.&lt;ref&gt;''Law Notes'' (1981). "Lord Widgery". Vol. 100, No. 9, p. 226. Quote: "Lord Widgery never lost touch with his legal roots: he maintained contact with his former colleagues at Gibson's and subsequently with the College of Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Antony Donell (1923–2006), the last of the former partners of Gibson and Weldon on the staff of the College of Law, retired in 1988. Donell had prepared and updated the 21st and final edition of ''Gibson's Conveyancing''.&lt;ref&gt;''Law Notes'' (1988). "R. A. Donell",  Vol. 107, No. 7, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, with the aim of solving or avoiding such conflicts, it includes regulations on the act of soliciting.&lt;ref name="page 3"/&gt;

==Background of Law Enactment==
During the 1970s, [[Japan]] experienced an increase in consumer demand and product diversity. Various methods of communication, transportation and delivery became available and competition among retailers intensified. Many of them began to look for ways to increase their customer base by selling at places other than shops. New methods of selling products, such as [[Door-to-door|door-to-door sales]] and [[mail order]], began to appear.&lt;ref name="page3"&gt;Consumer Affairs Agency, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethical standards had not yet been put in place for this new industry, and consumers were not accustomed to these new vending approaches. In many cases, these were the only points of contact between consumers and businesses, and conflicts occurring later on, could not be easily resolved. These conflicts started increasing.&lt;ref name="page3" /&gt; Also, during the second half of the 1960s, unethical use of [[Multi-level marketing|Multi-level Marketing]] was deemed by lawmakers to cause social problems.&lt;ref name="page 3" /&gt; To handle these social problems and conflicts, the Act of Specified Commercial Transactions was enacted in 1976 at the 77th assembly of the [[National Diet|National Diet of Japan]].&lt;ref name="page4"&gt;Ibid, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the Act==
This Japanese law mainly pertains to commercial transactions such as:

* [[Door-to-door|Door-to-door sales]]
* [[Mail order|Mail order sales]]
* [[Telemarketing]]
* [[Multi-level marketing|Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)]].

==Articles of the Act pertaining to Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)==
As of June 2016, Japanese Laws pertaining to [[Multi-level marketing|Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)]] are stated in Articles 33 to 40. Some Regulations from Articles 33, 34 and 36 Regarding Multi-level Marketing (MLM) are outlined below;

===1. Coordinator's Name Must Be Stated===
According to Article 33 Part 2, it is prohibited to solicit without first stating the nature of the MLM business and the coordinator’s name.&lt;ref name="page242" /&gt;

; Explanation:

There have been cases of MLM solicitors visiting someone’s house, organizing a house party or some alumni reunion, and not being truthful about the purpose of their visit.&lt;ref name="page242"&gt;Ibid, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Those solicitors then skillfully talk people into signing up for MLM, and many cases, people sign up for MLM without knowing about the financial burden they are getting themselves into.&lt;ref name="page242" /&gt; Essentially, people are being solicited in spite of the fact that they may not have wanted to be solicited in the first place. Many people may not wish to be solicited perhaps because they have no interest in MLM or are too busy to devote time for MLM. When solicitors visit someone without first announcing the true purpose of the visit, they deny that person the chance to consider if he or she even wants to be solicited in the first place.&lt;ref name="page242" /&gt; The purpose of Article 33 Part 2 is to protect the interests of people who may not wish to be solicited.&lt;ref name="page242" /&gt;

Solicitors must announce from the start the company name and the name of their coordinator. Further, people who are not familiar with MLM might not realize what kind of business they are about to be solicited for. Thus, solicitors must also announce from the start the amount of money involved. More precisely, solicitors must begin with a statement such as: "I would like to recruit you for some business in which you will buy (exact amount of money) of health supplements, would you be interested?"&lt;ref name="page244"&gt;Ibid, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. False Claims regarding Prospects of Income===
According to Article 34, it is prohibited to misrepresent facts or make false claims regarding prospects of income.&lt;ref name="page249" /&gt;

; Explanation:

It is illegal to misrepresent facts or make false claims regarding the prospects of making money with MLM. For example, if there is no absolute guarantee of making a certain amount of money, making statements suggesting otherwise amounts to making false claims. Such false claims include statements such as: "If you join this business, you will make a monthly income in the seven figures", "If you do this business for one month you will make more money than a white-collar worker does".&lt;ref name="page249"&gt;Ibid, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The following three cases also amount to making false claims:&lt;ref name="page249" /&gt;

* a) Telling people only about a few rare cases of successful MLM distributors and failing to mention the difficulty and low possibility of achieving the high income of such successful MLM distributors.&lt;ref name="page249" /&gt;
* b) Telling people "This is not Multi-level Marketing"&lt;ref name="page249" /&gt;
* c) Telling people "This business falls under a category approved by the Ministry of Japan.&lt;ref name="page249" /&gt;

===3. No Soliciting on a Private Property===
According to Article 34 Section 4, soliciting on private property is prohibited without first declaring one’s true intent.&lt;ref name="page251" /&gt;

; Explanation:

There have been cases of people signing up for MLM without really intending to, for they were unable to make an informed decision or use rational judgment, partly because they felt cornered by a solicitor who entered a private property without first announcing the intent to solicit.&lt;ref name="page251"&gt;Ibid, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; A legal amendment of 2008 now prohibits such act or behaviour.&lt;ref name="page251" /&gt;
Examples of private property include the office of a company, someone’s house, a hotel room, the meeting room of a hotel, the meeting room of a public facility, a karaoke room, and a restaurant rented for a private group for the evening.&lt;ref name="page252"&gt;Ibid, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, to begin soliciting in a public space and continue soliciting in a private property also constitutes an act in violation of Article 34.&lt;ref name="page252" /&gt; As soon as someone solicits in a private property, he or she is in violation of Article 34.&lt;ref name="page252" /&gt; Offenders found in violation of Article 34 face a fine of up to 3 million yen and/or a sentence of up to 3 years in jail.&lt;ref name="page252" /&gt;

===4. No e-mailing Multi-level Marketing ads===
According to Article 36 Part 3, it is prohibited to advertise Multi-level Marketing through e-mail without prior written consent from the e-mail recipient.&lt;ref name="page260"&gt;Ibid, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation''' ('''JCVI''') is an independent expert advisory committee of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].  JCVI was established in 1963 "To advise the Secretaries of State for Health, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] on matters relating to communicable [[diseases]], preventable and potentially preventable through [[immunisation]]."  The advisory body makes recommendations to the British government concerning [[vaccination schedule]]s and [[vaccine]] safety.

JCVI is recognized as a [[Departmental Expert Committee]] in the UK.  (Following the Government’s review of public bodies that completed in 2012, JCVI ceased to be an Advisory [[Non-Departmental Public Body]].)  It is a statutory expert Standing Advisory Committee established in [[England]] and Wales under the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) Act 1977, and the NHS Order 1981, as the [[Standing Advisory Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]].  It is also a Sub-Committee of the [[National Professional Advisory Council]] covering Scotland.

==Roles and responsibilities==

The JCVI has a responsibility to provide high quality and considered advice and recommendations to the UK Health Ministers.  This includes giving advice on recommendations on matters of both a 'routine' nature and also on any specific or special matters that Ministers may request.  In formulating any advice and recommendations, the Committee must take into account the need for and impact of vaccines, the quality of vaccines and the strategies to ensure that their greatest benefit to the public health can be obtained from the most appropriate use of vaccines.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

JCVI members meet and report as one Committee usually three times a year.  Its recommendations, as accepted by the Secretaries of State, are published in "Immunisation against infectious diseases" and also through other routes as necessary (e.g., [[Chief Medical Officer, United Kingdom|Chief Medical Officer]] (CMO) Letters).{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Membership==

The JCVI chairman is Professor Andrew Pollard of [[Oxford Vaccine Group]] in the Department of Paediatrics at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=G1&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation | title=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation | publisher=Gov.UK | accessdate=26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current members' names and affiliations are published online&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt; although year of appointment is not stated. According to the published code of practice &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224864/JCVI_Code_of_Practice_revision_2013_-_final.pdf |title=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation: Code of Practice |publisher=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation |date=June 2013 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointments are normally of three years duration. In accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the [[Commissioner for Public Appointments]], members cannot serve on the Committee for more than 10 years.

==Position on MMR==

The JCVI has firmly endorsed the efficacy and safety of the [[MMR vaccine]]. Among many developments, in February, 1988, fifteen experts and officials met in the UK to discuss adverse events reported after the administration of the vaccines which contained the [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] Urabe [[mumps]] virus strain. According to JCVI's minutes, the group "read a report of cases of [[mumps encephalitis]] which had been associated with MMR vaccine containing the Urabe strain of the mumps virus."{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The JCVI "expressed concern" about giving triple vaccines to children with a personal or family history of [[convulsion]]s, but considered it appropriate to proceed with a planned introduction of the MMR vaccine in October 1988, including two products containing Urabe strain.  After the start of the mass MMR immunisation programme, additional evidence that the strain was linked with [[viral meningitis]] surfaced in a number of countries, and by 1990, many had withdrawn products containing it. In November 1992, it was withdrawn in the UK, following the publication of government-sponsored research&lt;ref&gt;[http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kwk045v1]&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed a high incidence of transitory mild meningtis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doctor.medscape.com/viewarticle/553729]&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, government agencies have acted to prevent the importation of single vaccines containing this strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukmicentral.nhs.uk/headline/database/viewnewssearch.asp?offset=4490&amp;NewsID=1434]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Andrew Wakefield]] published what he said were his concerns in the ''[[Journal of Adverse Drug and Toxicological Reviews]]'' commenting on early studies of MMR, none of which were critical of the vaccine. The article was reviewed by the JCVI, which unequivocally rejected Wakefield's claims, with government agencies publishing a detailed rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/vaccination/012201wakefield.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714135958/http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/vaccination/012201wakefield.htm |archivedate=14 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 [[Andrew Wakefield]] was struck off by the [[General Medical Council]] for fabrication of results and failure to declare a financial interest in the importation of single strain vaccines. In 2011 [[The British Medical Journal]] ran  articles over 3 weeks documenting his fraud and criticising [[The Lancet]] editor for delay in accepting evidence of fraud and withdrawing the publication.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Position on thimerosal==

As is the case in the United States and many other countries, the mercury-based additive [[thimerosal]], previously thought necessary for multi-dose vials of vaccines such as the [[DPT vaccine|DPT]] shot, has largely been phased out. According to the JCVI, it has been shown that the amount of mercury in the blood of children receiving thimerosal-containing vaccines is well below levels that may be "associated with any toxic effects." Reports reviewed by the JCVI contend that mercury exposure in the UK immunisation programme is low.  However, JCVI endorsed recommendations to remove the preservative "even though there is no evidence of [[Neurotoxin|toxicity]], as a precautionary measure, thiomersal should be phased out over time..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/immvax/thiomersal.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jure uxoris''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "by right of (his) wife".&lt;ref&gt;In Latin, ''jure'' is the [[ablative case]] of ''jus'', meaning a legal right.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = HC | last = Black | title = Law Dictionary | edition = 4th | year = 1968}}, citing {{Citation | last = Blackstone | title = Commentaries | volume = 3 | page = 210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When a man uses a title of [[nobility]] because his wife holds it ''[[suo jure]]'' ("in her own right"), the man is said to hold the title ''jure uxoris''. Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands. For example, married women in England were legally incapable of owning real estate until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].

Kings who ruled ''jure uxoris'' are not to be confused with [[King consort|kings consort]], who were merely consorts of their wives, not co-rulers.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
During the feudal era, the husband's control over his wife's real property, including titles, was substantial. At the point of marriage, the husband gained the right to possess his wife's land during the marriage, including any acquired after the marriage.&lt;ref name="Emanuel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Property |last=Emanuel |first=Steven L. |date=2004 |publisher=Aspen Publishers, inc. |location=New York |pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst he did not gain the formal legal title to the lands, he was able to spend the rents and profits of the land and sell his right, even if the wife protested.&lt;ref name="Emanuel" /&gt;

The concept of ''jure uxoris'' was standard in the [[Middle Ages]] even for [[Queen regnant|queens regnant]]. In the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem]], [[Guy of Lusignan]], [[Conrad of Montferrat]], [[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] and [[Amalric II of Jerusalem]] all received their titles as a result of marriage.

[[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] married Queen [[Mary of Hungary]] and obtained the crown through her, retaining it after her death. After the death of Sigismund, [[Albert II, King of the Romans|Albert II of Austria]] inherited the throne of Hungary by marrying the king's daughter [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]].

A king ''jure uxoris'' could remain king even after the death or divorce of his wife. When the marriage of [[Marie I of Boulogne]] and [[Matthew of Boulogne]] was annulled in 1170, Marie ceased to be countess, while Matthew I continued to reign until 1173. In some cases, the kingdom could pass to the husband's heirs, even when they were not issue of the wife in question (cf. [[Jogaila]], who became king by marrying [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] and passed on the kingdom to his children with [[Sophia of Halshany]]).

Kings ''jure uxoris'' in the medieval era include:
*[[Rudolph of France]], whose wife [[Emma of France|Emma]] was daughter of King [[Robert I of France]]
*[[Philip IV of France|Philip I of Navarre]], who was married to [[Joan I of Navarre]]
*[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]], who was named [[King of Jerusalem]] by virtue of his marriage to [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]]
*[[Louis I of Naples]], whose wife was [[Joanna I of Naples]]
*[[Philip III of Navarre]], who was married to [[Joan II of Navarre]]
*[[John I of Castile]], who was a claimant to the throne of Portugal by virtue of his marriage to [[Beatrice of Portugal]]

==Renaissance==
By the time of the [[Renaissance]], attitudes had changed in some countries: a woman sometimes remained monarch, with only part of her power transferred to her husband. This was usually the case when multiple kingdoms were consolidated, such as when [[Catholic Monarchs|Isabella and Ferdinand]] shared crowns.

The precedent of ''jure uxoris'' complicated the lives of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s daughters, both of whom inherited the throne in their own right. The marriage of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]] was commonly seen as an attempt to bring England under the influence of Catholic Spain, with the [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain]] being designed specifically to prevent Philip from seizing power ''jure uxoris''. This tactic in the end ensured [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s accession; she, in turn, resolved concerns over ''jus uxoris'' by never marrying. In Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]] had married [[Antoine de Bourbon|Antoine of Navarre]] in 1548, and she became queen regnant at her father's death in 1555. Antoine was crowned co-ruler ''jure uxoris'' with Jeanne in August.

==Partial transference of power==
In Great Britain, husbands acted on their wives' behalf in the [[House of Lords]], from which women were once barred. These offices were exercised ''jure uxoris''.

When [[Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Lady Priscilla Bertie]] inherited the title [[Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Baroness Willougby de Eresby]] in 1780, she also held the position of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]]. However, her husband [[Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr|Sir Peter Gwydyr]] acted on her behalf in that office instead.

==Conditions==
In Portugal, a male consort could not become a king ''jure uxoris'' until the [[queen regnant]] had a child and royal heir. Although [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen Maria II]] married her second husband in 1836, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha did not become [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|King Ferdinand II]] until 1837, when their first child was born. Queen Maria's first husband, [[Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Auguste of Beauharnais]], never became monarch, because he died before he could father an heir. The queen's child did not have to be born after her accession. For example, [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] already had children by her husband when she acceded, so he became [[Peter III of Portugal|King Peter III]] at the moment of his wife's accession.

{{citation needed span|Currently in Spain, the husband of a peeress in her own right may use his wife's title socially|date=July 2016}}, although he is not technically entitled to it under the law. For example, [[Jaime de Marichalar]] was often referred to as the Duke of Lugo during his marriage to [[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo]]. After their divorce, he ceased to use the title. His brother-in-law [[Iñaki Urdangarin]] was referred to as the Duke of Palma before corruption allegations prompted the King to take action. Since 12 June  2015, he is no longer referred to as the Duke of Palma de Mallorca, following the removal of that title from his wife, [[Infanta Cristina]].

Freiherr&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Karl Albert''' Christoph Heinrich '''von Kamptz''' (16 September 1769 in [[Schwerin]] - 3 November 1849 in [[Berlin]]) was a German jurist.

==Life==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
Kamptz's parents were the later Mecklenburg-Strelitz Minister Albrecht von Kamptz (1741-1816) and his wife Louise Friederike Amalie (born von Dorne). From October 1787 he studied law, first at the Friedrich University Bützow, then from 1788 to 1790 at the Georg August University of Göttingen. After preparatory service as assessor, he was appointed head of the school commission and speaker at the secret council and government in Neustrelitz. In 1794 he resigned from the civil service. On the Mecklenburg state parliament on 19 November 1798 he was elected by the knighthood to the ordinary assessor of the court and district court in Güstrow; He was appointed on February 27, 1802 by the Swedish-Pomeranian knighthood assessor at the Wismar Tribunal. On 2 September 1804, he was presented to the Prussian court, under appointment as chamberlain, to the Kurbrandenburg due Assessorat at the Imperial Chamber Court in Wetzlar. On March 27, 1805, after passing the examination, he was appointed a member of the highest court of the Old Reich - the last appointment of any member before the revocation of the Imperial Court in 1806 in the wake of the dissolution of the German Reich Constitution.

He turned down an appointment as Vice President of the Württemberg Supreme Judicial College in Stuttgart. He remained until 1809 as a pensioner in Wetzlar and participated in the settlement business of the court. This included a fierce and publicly conducted argument with the former procurator Philipp Jacob von Gülich, who had been taken over in the Mecklenburg judicial service. In 1809 he returned to Neustrelitz; the following year, as Prussian chamberlain, he led the body of Queen Luise to Prussia and in 1811 found a position there at the Berlin Court of Appeals, where he worked as a member of the Oberappellationssenats. His other career led Kamptz on the Office of the Executive Director of the Ministry of Police (1817) and First Director of the Ministry of Justice (1825) to the appointment of the Real Secret Minister of State and Justice in 1832. In addition to his post as police director in the Interior Ministry, he was also later in 1822 head of the teaching department in the Ministry of Culture. In 1829, the Academy of non-profit sciences took Erfurt Kamptz as a member and elected him in 1829 as its president. As such, Kamptz became the successor of Count Dorotheus Ludwig von Keller. In 1848 Kamptz resigned from this office. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the city of Berlin honored Kamptz with the award of honorary citizenship.

Throughout his life, Kamptz was very conservative, which earned him the shameful name "liberal-eaters" in the press. The writer E. T. A. Hoffmann caricatured Kamptz in his work Master Floh as "police crook Knarrpanti". Kamptz especially excelled in the pursuit of the "Jacobin" activities and the burning of books at the Wartburg Festival in 1817 in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In addition to Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich, he was one of the toughest opponents and pursuers of the freedom of press issued there in 1816 under Grand Duke Carl August. Not only in the literature, but also in the contemporary liberal press Kamptz opposed strong resistance. Thus, Friedrich Förster polemicized in 1818 in the journal Nemesis as a result of the Wartburg Festival clearly against Kamptz. The stumbling block is the position paper published by Kamptz in the Yearbooks of the Prussian Legislature, "Discussion, as he calls it, 'on the public-burning of pamphlets.'" Kamptz, evidently cleared by the public burning of his Codex Gensd.  In his essay, armerie "personally offended" attacks the event on the Wartburg and argues (not only legally) for the prosecution and punishment of such acts. Kamptz considers that "the theoretical masters of the state are just as harmful to the state as the political professors are to the sciences," Förster quoted him, and calling for reference to the Spanish Inquisition, "That they [burn] for all, especially faithless and shameful crimes, eg. It should be introduced, for example, for the works of public teachers and histrion (sic) Which have been employed by the state to make young citizens faithful citizens and servicemen, but do not fulfill that provision, but at an early age they are poisoned by their demagogic principles breathe! "These words clearly aimed against the political professors in Jena, specifically against the "Histrion" Luden, one of the most important "spiritus rectores" of the Jenaer Urbschenschaft. In addition to the polemical correction of Förster, "Histriones" had been actors in Rome, "who appeared in the oldest Possenspielen the Romans, Satyra and Mimus," and not, as Kamptz uses it, historians, he comments on the demand of Prussia: "He likes to build a pyre, heretical works and heretics to throw in the flames".

Nevertheless, Kamptz condemns the burning of "permitted" writings as "iniuria". Forester replies to the lawyer Kamptz: "The author seems to know neither what Iniurie, nor what crude Iniurie is, nor what Iniurien punished by official channels, otherwise he would certainly immediately instruct the Grand Ducal-Weimar court authorities of their office."

The Berlin tailoring revolution of 1830 was directed less at the King, but rather, as the historian Ilja Mieck writes, at the reactionary clique of Wittgenstein and Kamptz, for their non-compliance with the royal constitutional promises made.

On December 30, 1802 in Prützen Hedwig, he married Susanna Luzia, b. von Bulow (born May 25, 1783, † August 13, 1847), a daughter of the Droste Friedrich Christian von Bülow on Prützen, Hägerfelde, Mühlengeez and Critzow, and the Hedwig Heilwig, b. from Behr to Nustrow. The couple had four children: Hedwig Louise Friderika Albertine (1803-1868), married in his first marriage to the Pomeranian President Wilhelm von Bonin (1786-1852), in his second marriage to General Otto von Bonin (1795-1862); Friedrich Albert Carl Anton (1805-1833), Heilwig Maria Sophia Florina (1806-1807) and (Albert) Ludwig (Florus Hans) (1810-1884).

On the basis of various indications, family researchers consider it possible that Kamptz was the biological father of the prehistorian, archivist and conservator Georg Christian Friedrich Lisch. In 1838 Kamptz was elected a member of the Leopoldina.

'''Law reform''' or '''legal reform''' is the process of examining existing [[law]]s, and advocating and implementing changes in a [[legal system]], usually with the aim of enhancing [[justice]] or efficiency.

Intimately related are law reform bodies or [[Law Commission|law commissions]], which are organizations set up to facilitate law reform. Law reform bodies carry out research and recommend ways to simplify and modernize the law. Many law reform bodies are [[statutory corporation]]s set up by governments, although they are usually independent from government control, providing intellectual independence to accurately reflect and report on how the law should progress.

Law reform activities can include preparation and presentation of [[legal case|cases]] in [[court]] in order to change the [[common law]]; [[lobbying]] of [[official|government official]]s in order to change [[legislation]]; and [[legal research|research]] or [[legal writing|writing]] that helps to establish an empirical basis for other law reform activities.

The four main methods in reforming law are [[repeal]] (get rid of a law), creation of new law, [[Consolidation bill|consolidation]] (change existing law) and [[codification (law)|codification]].

==Definition==
The expression "law reform" is used in a number of senses and some of these are close to being wholly incompatible with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hurlburt, William H. Law Reform Commissions in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Juriliber. 1986. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Law Reform Commission Act 1975]], the expression "reform" includes, in relation to the law or a branch of the law, its development, its codification (including in particular its simplification and modernisation) and the [[statute law revision|revision]] and consolidation of [[statute law]], and kindred words must be construed accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Reform Commission Act 1975]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1975/en/act/pub/0003/sec0001.html section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlation with judicial reform==
[[Judicial reform]] is the complete or partial political reform of a country's judiciary. Judicial reform is often done as a part of wider reform of the country's political system or a legal reform. The President of the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]], Valery Zorkin, gives in his article, "Twelve Theses on Legal Reform in Russia", first published in Russian magazine ''Legislation and Economics'', N. 2, 2004 an explained correlation between legal and judicial reform: "Complete legal reform should normally include not only judicial reform, but also reform of various aspects of the structural system and content of legislation, legal education, [[legal awareness]] by the population, and also the corporate consciousness of the whole legal community. Judicial reform usually aims to improve such things as law courts, procuracies, advocacy (bar), inquest, executory processes, and record keeping." .&lt;ref&gt;"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with economics==
Legal reform can be the driver for all other reforms, including reform of the economy. A true market economy cannot be created without ensuring both full guarantees of private property and transparent predictability for entrepreneurial activity, on the one hand; and sufficiently reasonable legal control over economic processes, on the other hand. Legal reform should be an integral part of any on-going reform process. Legal reform is a tool for implementing necessary reforms, to balance competing interests, create a dynamic and sustainable economy, and build a sustainable [[civil society]]. During last decades the judiciary became active in economic issues related with economic rights established by constitution because "economics may provide insight into questions that bear on  the proper legal interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Posner R. The Constitution as an Economic Document. The George Washington Law Review. November 1987. Vol. 56. No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Since many a country with a transitional political and economic system continues treating its constitution as an abstract legal document disengaged from the economic policy of the state, practice of judicial review of economic acts of executive and legislative branches became to grow.

The budget of the judiciary in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].  It is important to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: the [[State (polity)|state]] (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian example==
In modern Russia, aspects and directions of development of judicial reform were formulated in the Judicial Reform Concept, enacted by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Russian Parliament]] on October 24, 1991. This document still remains legally valid and applicable.

Valery Zorkin stressed that "the [[separation of powers]] principle, also proclaimed in the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]], requires observance of [[judicial independence]].  And such independence requires proper funding of the courts and their activities. It is well known that Russian courts remain under-funded.  However, the cumulative economic costs suffered by both state and private enterprises as the result of under-performance by various judicial institutions, especially by the courts of general [[jurisdiction]] and the arbitration courts, is at least twice the order of magnitude as the financial burden carried by the state and society in financing such judicial institutions. The elimination of under-funding of the courts would definitely improve the efficiency of their work and be worthwhile.

Taking into account the specifics of historical developments in Russia, one may assert that without undertaking a large-scale legal reform it would be extremely difficult to succeed concurrently with judicial reform. It is necessary now to start unfolding a full-scale legal reform, which has to be completed by the year 2020. The official public presentation and implementation of such legal reform should become the prime responsibility of [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]] authorities. The program of legal reform needs to be adopted in the form of a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4366">[[Image:Lenslok2.jpg|thumb|Lenslok prism and audio cassette]]

'''Lenslok''' is a [[copy protection]] mechanism found in some computer games and other software on the [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari computers&lt;!-- i.e. not the 8-bit VCS *console*--&gt;]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Sinclair QL]], [[MSX]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. The most well-known game to use it was ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' for the ZX Spectrum.

== Overview ==

Lenslok was released in 1985 as a plastic lens in a foldaway frame.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; The Lenslok device was essentially a row of [[prism (optics)|prism]]s arranged vertically in a plastic holder. Before the game started, a two-letter code was displayed on the screen, but it was corrupted by being split into vertical bands which were then rearranged on screen. By viewing these bands through the Lenslok they were restored to their correct order and the code could be read and entered allowing access to the game. The device was small enough when folded flat to fit next to an [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] in a standard case.

In order for the Lenslok to work correctly the displayed image has to be the correct size. This meant that before each use the software needed to be calibrated to take account of the size of the display. Users found this setup particularly annoying, at least in part because they found the instructions that were initially shipped unclear. Additionally, the device could not be calibrated at all for very large and very small televisions, and some games shipped with mismatched Lensloks that prevented the code from being correctly descrambled. The Lenslok system was not used in later releases of ''Elite''.

The Lenslok copy protection system for the Commodore 64 version of Elite was very easy to bypass because a bug existed where the letters 'A' and 'D' were always the first combination generated by Lenslok. A simple crack, where the letters were input during the copy protection check by adding a few lines of machine language code, was effective in defeating Lenslok.

== Usage issues ==
Dan Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' explains that Lenslok was difficult to operate with difficult instructions, requiring recalibrations, and sometimes didn't work at all, including with screen sizes too large or too small. Whitehead notes that the "problems with Lenslok were undoubtedly exaggerated".&lt;ref name=EG&gt;''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/banging-the-drm-article?page=2 Banging the DRM]'', [[Eurogamer]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel Barter of ''[[GamesRadar]]'' similarly notes that Lenslok didn't work on some screens.&lt;ref name=GR&gt;''[http://www.gamesradar.com/protect-and-serve/2/]'', [[GamesRadar]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Lenslok was used only on 11 releases.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt;

== Software ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10564">This is a '''list of [[law school]]s and [[faculty of law|law faculties]] in [[Canada]]'''.

[[Canada]] is mostly a [[common law]] jurisdiction.  However, the province of [[Quebec]] uses the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system for private law matters. As a result, Quebec's [[French language|French-language]] law schools are exclusively civil law schools, and typically possess additional language requirements.

==Legal education in Canada==
Generally, entry into law programs in Canada is based primarily on a combination of the student's previous grades as well as, for English-language common-law programs, their score on the [[Law School Admission Test]] (LSAT). Factors such as specialized degrees, work experience, community involvement, personal character, extracurricular activities and references are sometimes taken into account, for which the Universities of [[University of Calgary Faculty of Law|Calgary]], [[University of Windsor Faculty of Law|Windsor]] and [[McGill University Faculty of Law|McGill]]'s holistic law school admissions are well known, but the LSAT remains far more determinative of admission than comparable standardized tests for other disciplines, such as the [[MCAT]] or [[GMAT]]. Quebec law schools, including the dual-curriculum, bilingual [[McGill University Faculty of Law]], do not require applicants to write the LSAT, although any scores are generally taken into account; nor do the French-language common-law programs at the [[Université de Moncton École de droit]] and [[University of Ottawa Faculty of Law]].

All of Canada's law schools are affiliated with [[public university|public universities]], and are thus public institutions. This practice has been held to have helped reduce disparities in the quality of students and instruction as between the schools.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since there is a limited number of positions in each law school's annual admissions, entry to all [https://www.todayblogpost.com/best-law-school-canada/ Canadian law schools] is intensely competitive: most law schools receive far more applicants than they can accommodate. Most schools focus on their respective regions, and many graduates remain in the region in which the school is located, though the relatively uniform quality of the law schools affords greater geographic mobility to graduates.

After completing the Juris Doctor, LL.B., or B.C.L. , students must [[articling|article]] for about a year (in Quebec, the six-month ''stage'' is the equivalent to articling); this can be a challenge for those with lower grades, as there are often a shortage of articling positions, and completion of articles is required to be able to practice law in Canada. Articling involves on-the-job training, at a lower introductory salary, under the supervision of a lawyer licensed by the Provincial Bar who has been practising for a minimum of 5 years. After ten to sixteen months of articling and [[call to the bar]], lawyers are free to practice in their own right: many are hired by the same lawyer or firm for which they articled, while some choose to begin independent practices or accept positions with different employers. Others may leave the private practice of law to work in government or industry as a lawyer or in a law-related position.

'''Neo-prohibitionism''' (also spelled '''neoprohibitionism''' and '''neo-Prohibitionism''') is a current movement to attempt to stop consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in [[society]] through [[legislation]] and policies which further restrict the sale, possession, and marketing of alcohol in order to reduce average [[per capita]] consumption and change social norms to reduce its acceptability.

==Use of the term==
The term is usually used critically to describe groups or individuals, rather than by the groups or individuals themselves. For example, [[Candy Lightner]], the founder of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), eventually left the organization in anger and has since gone on to criticize it as neo-prohibitionist, stating that MADD "has become far more neo-prohibitionist than I had ever wanted or envisioned … I didn't start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving".&lt;ref name="washtimes_madd-strugles"&gt;Bresnahan, S. (2002). "MADD struggles to remain relevant." ''Washington Times'', August 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Lightner was criticizing MADD's leaders who had called for the criminalization of all driving after drinking any amount of alcoholic beverage.

In Europe, the [[World Health Organization]] in 1992 launched a so-called Alcohol Action Plan that aimed at a continuous reduction of the per capita consumption; this attempt was criticized as "crypto-prohibitionism" and finally it failed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasso Spode]], WHO, in: Jack S. Blocker et al. (eds.), ''Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History'', Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio 2003, vol. 2, pp. 688-691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
The concept of neo-prohibitionism has been used and studied by scholars at [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iliberty.org/debates/id.3271/debates_detail.asp+%22Institute+for+Humane+Studies+at+George+Mason+University%22+%22Drunk+Driving+Laws%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1 George Mason University Institute for Humane Studies iLiberty project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ohio State University]],&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1838">The '''Office of National Narcotics Intelligence''' (ONNI) was a [[United States]]' [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[law enforcement agency]] under the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] that dealt in analysis of [[illegal drugs]] and was tasked to develop a National Narcotics Intelligence System. It conducted analysis only and had no operational responsibilities. Liaison was conducted with CIA and NSA. ONNI was founded in August 1972 under order of President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. The agency was headed by former [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] Assistant to the Director (third position in FBI after Director and Deputy Director) [[William C. Sullivan]] until ONNI was consolidated into the newly created [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] in July 1973 (along with the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]], the [[Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement]], some [[customs|Customs officers]]. Waldo H. Dubberstein, who worked in ONNI's Analysis Division, had been head of all [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) analysis for the Middle East and South Asia, committed suicide in April 1983 after being indicted for selling classified DIA intelligence reports to Libya. It also helped set up information systems and analytical operations for the EU.

'''One Penn Plaza''' (1 Penn Plaza) is a [[skyscraper]] in [[New York City]], located between [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd Street]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], west of [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], and adjacent to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] and [[Madison Square Garden]]. It is the tallest building in the [[Pennsylvania Plaza]] complex of office buildings, hotels, and entertainment facilities.

== History ==
The skyscraper was designed by [[Kahn &amp; Jacobs]] and completed in 1972. It reaches {{convert|750|ft|m}} with 57 floors. The tower has three [[Building setback|setbacks]] at 7th, 14th, and 55th floors. From its location on the west side of [[Manhattan]], most south, west and north-facing tenants have unobstructed views of the [[Hudson River]].

One Penn Plaza is currently owned by [[Vornado Realty Trust]]. It was previously owned by Helmsley-Spear Inc., which sold the building  for $420 million in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Helmsley, Poised to Sell Empire, Mends Fences Along the Way |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/18/nyregion/helmsley-poised-to-sell-empire-mends-fences-along-the-way.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 18, 1998 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, plans were made to install a [[cogeneration]] plant in order to heat the building more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Towers in Manhattan Gather Heat from Power Generators |first=Alec |last=Appelbaum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/realestate/commercial/25cogen.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, it was reported that when the new plant was activated, it nearly cut the building's carbon output in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One Penn Plaza Flicks the Switch on Power Plant That Almost Halves Carbon Footprint |first=Jill |last=Colven |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20101116/midtown/one-penn-plaza-flicks-switch-on-power-plant-that-almost-halves-carbon-footprint |newspaper=[[DNAinfo New York]] |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310152744/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20101116/midtown/one-penn-plaza-flicks-switch-on-power-plant-that-almost-halves-carbon-footprint |archivedate=March 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 80 percent of the action in the 2011 independent film ''[[Margin Call (film)|Margin Call]]'' was shot on the 42nd floor of the building, which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace.

== Architecture ==
One Penn Plaza is built with [[structural steel]] and [[concrete]], with grey solar glass and [[anodized aluminum]] on the outside walls.

The building has 14 entrances and 44 elevators in seven banks. An underground [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] provides 695 spaces for cars and is accessible from both 33rd and 34th Streets. Direct passageways at each end of the building provide underground connections to the [[Long Island Rail Road]] concourse of Pennsylvania Station, which is located one block to the south. The ground floor is leased to several commercial tenants, including the top floor of a {{convert|142000|sqft|m2}}, three-story [[K-Mart]] store (formerly occupied by [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]), and a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kmart Coming to Manhattan With 34th Street Store |first=John |last=Holusha |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/25/realestate/kmart-coming-to-manhattan-with-34th-street-store.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 25, 1996 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public plaza and fountain are located on the west end of the building. Unlike traditional fountains, steam is dispensed in the winter and fog is dispensed in the summer to prevent water from splashing out during gusty wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penn Plaza Solves Wind Problem With a Special-Effects Fountain |first=James |last=Barron | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/24/nyregion/penn-plaza-solves-wind-problem-with-a-special-effects-fountain.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 24, 1997 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
The '''Imperial Reform Edict''' ({{lang-ota|اصلاحات خط همايونى}}, ''Islâhat Hatt-ı Hümâyûnu''; Modern {{lang-tr|Islâhat Fermânı}})&lt;ref&gt;Osman Nuri, Ahmet Refik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MNkNAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA+%D8%AE%D8%B7+%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86&amp;dq=%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA+%D8%AE%D8%B7+%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=KOb5TLzwMITCcdW3la0L&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCTgK Abdülhamid-i ''Sani ve Devr-i Saltanatı: Hayat-i Hususiye ve Siyasiyesi''], Kitaphane-yi İslam ve Askeri, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; was a February 18, 1856 edict of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] and part of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms.  The decree from [[Sultan]] [[Abdülmecid I]] promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all regardless of [[religion|creed]]. The decree is often seen as a result of the influence of [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], which assisted the Ottoman Empire against the Russians during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856) and the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] which ended the war.

Hatt-ı Hümayun was a promise by the Sultan to his citizens, subjects. Sultan promised to be held responsible for the constitution of the "Provincial Councils" and "Communal Councils" and the fairness of this process and the results. In matters concerning all the subjects of the State (related with Hatt-ı Hümayun), the spiritual leader of every congregation, along with its official appointed for one year by the government, will participate in the negotiations of `Meclisi Valay-i Ahkam-i Adliyye', a law court established in 1837 to deal with cases of high officials. Sultan also promised (personal judge of fairness) the freedom of voting in the councils. 
[[File:mehemet aali.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mehmet Emin Ali Pasha|Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]], the principal architect of the [[Hatt-ı Hümayun|Islâhat Fermânı]].]]
These goals are promised by the Sultan and the final consideration is in him; in meaning Hatt-ı Hümayun is the Sultan's ideas.

==Content==
Hatt-ı Hümayun "unites all the previous reforms" (beginning with [[Edict of Gülhane]]) and applies previous reform to all the subjects of the Empire, without distinction of class or religion, for the security of their persons and property and the preservation of their honor.

Hatt-ı Hümayun did not release the government from its previous obligations; spiritual immunities (Christian millets  or other non-Muslim protectorates). Regarding these responsibilities review process established under each millet such that they form a commission composed ad hoc of members of its own body to give formulate (discuss) and submit the reforms required by the progress of Ottoman civilization.

===Religion and civic duties===
Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that all forms of religion freely worshiped, no subject hindered in the exercise of the religion, nor be in any way annoyed. No one shall be compelled to change their religion.

Hatt-ı Hümayun brought accountability, such that the Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Archbishops, Bishops, and Rabbis began to take an oath on their entrance into office according to a form agreed upon (content of the oath is verified by the state), which they will be responsible for honoring their oath. In to build trust (prevent bribery); the income of these people (in public work) is replaced by fixed revenues of the Patriarchs and heads of communities, and by the allocation of allowances and salaries equitably proportioned to the importance, the rank, and the dignity of the different members of the clergy.

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted the full freedom of the repair, according to their original plan, of buildings set apart for religious worship, for schools, for hospitals, and for cemeteries; if these activities are performed at "non-mixed communities" under the towns, small boroughs and villages. To prevent the destruction of historical architectures, and keep track of public investments the plans of these different buildings, in case of their new erection, must, after having been approved by the Patriarchs or heads of communities, be submitted to Imperial order, or make known its observations upon them within a certain time.

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that each community have equal power on the repair according to the original plan of the buildings for religious worship, schools, hospitals, and cemeteries; only if these activities are performed at "mixed communities" of the towns, small boroughs and villages. The authorities (decision making) in mixed populations use imperial system to pronounce a sovereign decision (imperial system visioned as a buffer).

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted the government the responsibility of the formation of roads and canals to increase the facilities of communication and the sources of the wealth.

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted the organization of new Code to determine how the works of public utility can be supported (raised from private and special taxes levied in the provinces). These funds could only be used to benefit of the establishment of ways of communication by land and sea.

===Education===
Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that all the subjects, without distinction, shall be received into the Civil and Military Schools. Every community is authorized to establish Public Schools of Science, Art, and Industry. However, in these public schools the methods of instruction and the choice of professors in schools of this class shall be under the control of a "Mixed Council of Public Instruction (Council of Public Instruction)" (Education ministry).

===Justice===
Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that all commercial, correctional, and criminal suits between Muslims and Christian or other non-Muslim subjects, or between Christians or other non-Muslims of different sects, shall be referred to "mixed tribunals". The proceedings were in public. The parties were confronted. Production of witnesses was granted which the testimonies were accepted upon an oath. Suits relating to civil affairs publicly tried. Civil affairs resolved before the Mixed Provincial Councils with the Governor and Judge.

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that there will be formulation of the new Codes; penal, correctional, and commercial laws, and rules of procedure and they were translated and published in all the languages.

Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that the reform of the penitentiary (houses of detention, punishment, or correction) and other establishments. Activities had to reconcile the rights of humanity and with those of justice. Corporal punishment is abolished administered.

===Public security===
Hatt-ı Hümayun granted that police organization (policies and regulations) can not deny the guarantees for the safety of person and property. After the revision (defines a commission) officers are responsible. The police force was organized in capital, provincial towns and in the rural districts in separate organizations.

==Effect==
Although the goal of the Hatt-ı Hümayun was to bring equality among Ottoman citizens, the process was perceived more as one intended to please Europe. The biggest change was the Ottoman State's acceptance of the notion of "minorities". Previously, Muslim government organizations (civil and military schools) begin to accept non-Muslim citizens. The official state language principle (Ottoman Turkish for written communication) was broken, and the Empire became a multi-language system. Patriarchates began to administer justice on the state level, which could be said to weaken the judicial sovereignty of the State.

Some rules were cheered by the Non-Muslims
*Non-Muslims could become civil servants,
*The possibility to transfer their inheritance cases to Patriarchates,
*The publishing of murder and commerce laws in the languages of the minorities,
*The establishment of higher court (judiciary) and the representation of all congregations with two representatives from each.
*The extending of powers of Patriarchates in administering justice,
*The extending of the [[right to property]] to foreigners.
Some rules were not cheered by the Non-Muslims
*The obligation to do one's military service,
*The reexamination of religious privileges to make them equal (some millets lost privileges relative to others)
*The abolition of arbitrary fees exacted by priests all along from their congregations
*The establishment of salaries (fixed income) to spiritual leaders (priest, patriarch etc.)
*The obligation of spiritual leaders to take the oath of devotion

Hatt-ı Hümayun in bringing equality among ([[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]), created a discontent to the Armenian Patriarchate.&lt;ref&gt;Dadian (Migirditch), "La society armenienne contemporaine" revue des deus Mondes, June 1867. pp803-827&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Hatt-ı Hümayun Armenian Patriarch was not only the spiritual leader of the community, but its secular leader (all Armenians, Armenian nation) as well. The Armenians ([[Armenian national movement|"Armenian nationals"]]) wanted to abolish oppression by the nobility, and draw up a new `National Regulation', which limited the powers of Patriarch whose jurisdiction was extended to 50 regions and could at will dismiss the Bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Dadian (Migirditch), "La society armenienne contemporaine" revue des deus Mondes, June 1867. pp803-827&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the Council accepted the draft regulation on May 24, 1860, and presented it to the Babiali. The Babiali ratified it with some minor changes, with a firman on March 17, 1863, and made it effective. In 1863 the [[Armenian National Constitution]] (Ottoman Turkish:"Nizâmnâme-i Millet-i Ermeniyân") was [[Ottoman Empire]] approved form of the "Code of Regulations" composed of 150 articles drafted by the "Armenian intelligentsia", which defined the powers of Patriarch (position in Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]) and newly formed "[[Armenian National Assembly (Ottoman Empire)|Armenian National Assembly]]".&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. (EDT) Hovannisian "The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times" page 198&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian Patriarch with the sharing of his powers with the [[Armenian National Assembly]] and limitations brought by [[Armenian National Constitution]] perceived the changes as erosion of its community.

During the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire|fall of the Ottoman Empire]], foreign powers often influenced the government by means of foreign loans and aid as well as exploitation of the [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] and its groups of [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] minorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22441">'''Overpopulation in domestic pets''' is the [[Overpopulation (biology)|surplus]] of [[pet]]s, such as [[domestic cat|cat]]s, [[domestic dog|dog]]s, and [[Exotic pet|exotic animal]]s. In the United States, a 6 to 8 million animals are brought to [[Animal shelter|shelters]] each year, of which an estimated 3 to 4 million are subsequently [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], including 2.7 million considered healthy and adoptable.&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt; Euthanasia numbers have declined from the 1970s, when U.S. shelters euthanized an estimated 12 to 20 million animals.&lt;ref name="HSUS criticism"/&gt; Most [[humane society|humane societies]], [[animal shelter]]s and [[rescue group]]s urge animal caregivers to have their animals [[spaying and neutering|spayed or neutered]] to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters that could contribute to this dynamic.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

==Global effects==
Dealing with a population of unwanted domestic animals is a major concern to [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] groups. Domestic animal overpopulation can also be an ecological concern. It is also a financial problem: capturing, impounding and eventual [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] costs taxpayers and private agencies millions of dollars each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/03/prweb3747034.htm |title=New Research Exposes High Taxpayer Cost For ‘Eradicating’ Free-Roaming Cats |publisher=Prweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unwanted pets are also commonly released to the wild, sometimes contributing to severe damage to ecosystems (e.g., the effect of introduction of exotic snakes to Florida's [[Everglades]]).

==Statistics==

===Bahrain===
In Bahrain the number of stray dogs has been increasing since early 2000s with the situation getting out of hand in late 2010s which caused a lot of controversy regarding the case from people claiming to be bothered and attacked by stray dogs and stray dogs puppies being inhumanely murdered (or burned). On the other hand, since 2014 an act has been put by the Bahrain Society for the Prevention of [[Cruelty to animals|Cruelty to Animals]] (BSPCA) and made a plea to the government to help keep the Catch, Neuter and Return programme (CNVR) running.&lt;ref name="bahrainbspca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.gdnonline.com/NewsDetails.aspx?date=04/07/2015&amp;storyid=359781 |title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=GULF DIGITAL NEWS |date=August 24, 2013 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent attacks on farms also happened, Sheikha Marwa bint Abdulrahman Al Khalifa also contributed to the case and decided to build a shelter (welfare) for the strays to neuter and rehabilitate them to prevent further attacks while also cooperating with the Bahrain stray dogs society group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MISC_281760.html|title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=Trade Arabia |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Canadian Federation of Humane Societies]] (CFHS) has been collecting statistics from Canadian animal shelters since 1993.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} A survey in 2013 included data from 100 of 186 humane societies and [[SPCA]]s.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} However, municipal animal services agencies were not included, hence "the data in this report represents only a fraction of homeless companion animals in Canada."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} In 2012, the surveyed shelters took in just over 188,000 animals, and euthanized 65,423 animals, representing 35% of all intakes.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Six times as many cats were euthanized as dogs, or 41% of cats and 15% of dogs.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The report said a gradually improving trend, but that cats have a far worse outcome than dogs: "More than twice as many cats enter shelters than dogs, and though adoption rates for cats are similar to those for dogs, fewer cats are reclaimed and many more are euthanized."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal911.ca/half-a-million-unwanted-pets-euthanized-in-quebec-in-2013/ In 2013, half a million unwanted pets were euthanized in Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Estimates of animals brought to shelters and of animals subsequently euthanized in the U.S. have issues with their reliability. [[The Humane Society of the United States]] provides shelter statistics with this caution: "There is no central [[data reporting]] system for U.S. animal shelters and rescues. These estimates are based on information provided by the (former) National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy."&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; The HSUS provided numbers of 6 to 8 million animals taken to shelters, 3 to 4 million animals euthanized, and 2.7 million of the euthanized animals being healthy and adoptable, as estimates for 2012-2013,&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; and also for annual figures in an August 2014 article.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

The National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy conducted a survey over four years, 1994-1997, and cautions against the use of their survey for wider estimates: "It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate the numbers of animals entering animal shelters in the United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters."&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; Summary statistics from the survey said that in 1997, 4.3 million animals entered the surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt;

The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] provides alternate numbers, saying that there are about 13,600 community animal shelters in the US.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; "There is no national organization monitoring these shelters", and "no government institution or animal organization is responsible for tabulating national statistics for the animal protection movement."&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; However, national estimates are provided of 7.6 million animals entering shelters each year, with 2.7 million of them euthanized.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt;

The [[American Humane Association]] said the difficulties in estimating numbers, and provides a higher figure, saying that in 2008, an estimated 3.7 million animals were euthanized in shelters.&lt;ref name="AHA euth stats"/&gt;

A 1993 study of US dog populations considered a wider range of sources than animal shelters.&lt;ref name="Article about Patronek study"&gt;[http://www.naiaonline.org/naia-library/articles/are-there-too-many-dogs-and-cats/ "Are there too many dogs and cats?: Pet overpopulation myths and Facts"], Norma Bennett Woolf, National Animal Interest Alliance, March 19, 1997, referring to Gary J. Patronek and Andrew N Rowan, "Determining Dog and Cat Numbers and Population Dynamics", Anthrozoos Vol. 8, No. 4, (1995), pp. 199-205; that article referred to the original 1993 study: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233502996_Development_of_a_Model_for_Estimating_the_Size_and_Dynamics_of_the_Pet_Dog_Population "Development of a Model for Estimating the Size and Dynamics of the Pet Dog Population"], Gary J. Patronek, Anthrozoos, Vol. 12, 1993; No. 7(1), pp. 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that 4 million dogs entered shelters, with 2.4 million (or 60%) euthanized (p.&amp;nbsp;203).&lt;ref name="Patronek 1995"/&gt;

==Reasons for relinquishment==
Unwanted dogs and cats may have been acquired from any source. Large numbers of animals are placed in shelters by pet owners each year for reasons such as moving, allergies, behavioral problems, and lack of time or money, or the pet animal giving birth to young. Another common reason for surrendering a pet is because of milestones, like marriage or the birth of a new baby.&lt;ref name="americanhumane1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/adoption-pet-care/issues-information/pet-overpopulation.html |title=Pet Overpopulation |publisher=Americanhumane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purebred animals==
The [[American Pet Products Association]] says that since purebreds are only 5% to 6% of the US pet cat population, the overpopulation problem is mainly due to mixed or random bred animals, and avoiding purebred cats would make little difference.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) says that 25% of the dogs who enter animal shelters are purebred.{{Relevance inline|reason= This 25% includes lost purebred pets that are subsequently returned to their owners. It doesn't distinguish between purebreds that came from backyard breeders, professional breeders, or puppy mills. For this to mean anything, we'd need to no the relative rate of non-purebred dogs entering shelters, showing that purebreds were disproportionately contributing to unwanted pets. |date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=HS.org&gt;{{cite web |title=Pets by the Numbers Pet ownership survey data and The HSUS's estimates on pets adopted from or euthanized in U.S. shelters in 2012 and 2013 |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html |website=Humane Society.org |accessdate=5 January 2015 |date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) and the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) say the benefits of purebred dogs or cats include that they have been developed over time to show specific traits that are useful for hunting, rescue, assistance and other needs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; Animal buyers, including pet owners, may choose a purebred to ensure they know ahead of time the size and other characteristics a young animal will grow into.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA also says that purebred cats may make better pets because they have a weaker hunting instinct.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The HSUS says that a pedigree is not a guarantee of health and temperament, and that mixed breed dogs and cats often show good characteristics of both breeds, and may be less likely to have genetic defects.&lt;ref name=HSUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

The AKC says [[breeder]]s offer services and information about the animals they sell, such as a detailed pedigree, and expertise in the health and temperament of the breed they specialize in.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says animal shelters may offer animals that have already had necessary veterinary procedures, such as [[spaying]] or [[neutering]], [[vaccination]], [[deworming]], and [[microchipping]].&lt;ref name=HSUS2012/&gt;

The best practices set by the AKC for responsible breeders include screening customers so animals are placed in a good home, and follow up services including collecting long term health and development data about animals they have bread, and guaranteeing to take back any animals if their situation is not mutually beneficial for the pet and the owner, and then placing them in a new home.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The AKC says that their organization serves to prevent animal cruelty by suspending the benefits of their breed registry and other services from members convicted of animal cruelty, and that their inspection program actively uncovers cases of inhumane treatment of dogs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says the AKC has lobbied against laws to stop puppy mills, and that many of the breeders certified as humane by AKC inspectors were later convicted of animal cruelty offenses, while the AKC says it has favored legislation that is necessary, but worked to stop well-intentioned laws that are unenforceable or counterproductive, such as kennel population limits that may harm genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=HSUS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS does not advocate banning breeding but encourages prospective pet owners to seek a breed rescue organization rather than buying directly from a breeder.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

[[Backyard breeding]] and [[puppy mill]]s are motivated by profit and the perceived high demand for a particular breed, often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through [[pet store]]s or directly from the breeders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/ |title=Puppy Mills: The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Humanesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AKC says that negligence and cruelty to animals is illegal throughout the US, and that the solution to irresponsible breeding is more effective enforcement of the law, rather than blaming responsible breeders or the demand for purebred animals.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA's legislative stance is similar to the AKC.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA also says that cat overpopulation is due to free roaming, unaltered pet cats, and feral cats, not purebreds.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA says that animal control agencies have failed to publicize complete statistics on the killing of dogs and cats that are dangerously aggressive, concealing the degree to which pet animal euthanasia will always be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=CFAleg&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.cfa.org/Legislative/LegislativeGroup.aspx |title= CFA's Legislative Group |publisher=[[Cat Fanciers' Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to premise==
[[Nathan Winograd]] of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a promoter of [[no-kill shelter]]s, says that overpopulation is a myth and logical fallacy, which many animal control agencies use to avoid criticism for high numbers of killings and low numbers of adoptions.&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says that traditional shelters kill animals primarily out of habit and convenience, even when space is available for the animals.&lt;ref name="Overpopulation myth"/&gt;{{rp|6}} He says that using [[trap-neuter-return]] (TNR) for stray and feral cats, his organizations have been able to save all healthy and treatable animals, and raise their save rates to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="No Kill 101"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt; He says there are enough homes for all the homeless animals: "Based on the number of existing households with pets who have a pet die or run away, more homes potentially become available each year for cats than the number of cats who enter shelters, while more than twice as many homes potentially become available each year for dogs than the number of dogs who enter shelters."&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says his methods, including TNR for stray and feral cats, and comprehensive changes in animal control, rescue, shelter and community efforts have succeeded in saving all healthy and treatable animals, amounting to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; Winograd says that hundreds of No Kill Communities have been created across the U.S., and they are increasing in number throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Dollars &amp; Sense"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; In October 2014, the website "Out the Front Door" documented 212 communities in the U.S. saving more than 90% of impounded animals.&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt;

Christie Keith, social media adviser for animal welfare organizations, said in 2012 that the use of the term "overpopulation" to justify shelter killings involves the logical fallacy of a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; If a shelter with no adoption program was able to save more animals when a program was added and then enhanced, was the improvement in save rates due to a "Reduction in 'pet over-population'? Or improvement in shelter management practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; When communities are able to save more than 90% of the animals admitted, Keith asks, "Did they reduce 'pet over-population,' or did they become a no-kill community by implementing modern, proven, progressive sheltering practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;{{What?|date=December 2017}}

In a 2008 article, dog advocate Loretta Baughan said that underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. She said that the great majority of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanieljournal.com/33lbaughan.html "Pet underpopulation: The Pet Shortage in the U.S. by Loretta Baughan"], Loretta Baughan, Spaniel Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 4, Jan.-Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qualified Production Activities Income''' is a class of income which is entitled to favored tax treatment under Section 199 of the [[United States]] Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Former section 114 of the United States Internal Revenue Code excluded "extraterritorial income" which constituted "qualifying foreign trade income" under former section 941 from income.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 114 (repealed).&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of these provisions was a reduced tax burden in exchange for increased exports, creating an incentive for individuals and businesses within the United States to export. In August 2001, a panel of the [[World Trade Organization]] ruled that former section 114 of the United States Internal Revenue Code constituted a violation of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures as a prohibited [[export subsidy]], and a WTO Appellate Body affirmed the finding in January 2002. The finding was based on the fact the provision resulted in the United States government forgoing revenue to which it was otherwise entitled and the fact the resulting subsidy was conditioned on export performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/108abrw_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress]] repealed the exclusion in 2004. To offset the loss of the section 114 benefit, Congress enacted Section 199 regarding qualified production activities income.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samuel A.; Federal Income Taxation of Individuals (Second Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanics ==

Section 199 allows [[manufacturers]] to deduct nine percent of their "qualified production activities income" (QPAI) in 2010 and following years.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The deduction is in the process of "phasing-in," with three percent of QPAI allowed as a deduction in 2005 and 2006, and six percent allowed in 2007-2009.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 99(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the deduction is to reduce the rate of taxation on QPAI.

QPAI is defined as the portion of taxpayer income which is equal to the excess of the taxpayer's domestic production gross receipts over the sum of the cost of goods that are allocable to such receipts, and other expenses, losses, or deductions which are properly allocable to such receipts.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(c)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic production gross receipts===
Domestic production gross receipts is defined in the provision as the gross receipts of the taxpayer derived from any lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of:

1. tangible personal property, computer software, or sound recordings manufactured, produced, grow, or extracted by the taxpayer in whole or significant part within the United States;&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(c)(4)(A)(i)(I).&lt;/ref&gt;

2. a qualified film, defined as a non-pornographic film where not less than 50 percent of the total compensation relating to production is compensation for services performed in the United States by actors, production personnel, directors, and producers;&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(c)(4)(A)(i)(II) and 26 U.S.C. 199(c)(6).&lt;/ref&gt;

3. electricity, natural gas, or potable water produced by the taxpayer in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(c)(4)(A)(i)(III)&lt;/ref&gt;

4.construction of real property performed within the United States where the taxpayer is engaged in actively conducting a construction trade or business in the ordinary course of that business;&lt;ref&gt;199(c)(4)(A)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; and

5. engineering or architectural services performed within the United States where the taxpayer is engaged in actively conducting an engineering or architectural trade or business and in the ordinary course of that business provides such services with respect to construction of real property with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;199(c)(4)(A)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, domestic production gross receipts specifically do not include gross receipts derived from the sale of food or beverages at a retail establishment, from the transmission or distribution of electricity, natural gas, or potable water, or from the lease, rental, sale, exchange, or other disposition of land.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 199(c)(4)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==

The overall effect of the provision is to encourage domestic production. While this might seem to be a quite different goal than that of the provision it replaced, in theory, increased domestic production should indirectly lead to increased exports as the domestic demand is satisfied. While the QPAI deduction constitutes the United States government forgoing revenue which would otherwise be available to it, it should not run afoul of the same WTO rules because the availability of the deduction is not conditioned on export performance.

Every business in the manufacturing sector, whether small or large, should consider the manufacturing deduction under IRC § 199. While section 199 comes with a complex set of rules, it nonetheless represents a valuable tax break for businesses that perform domestic manufacturing and certain other production activities. However, businesses should weigh its benefit against the cost of calculating and supporting it. For tax years beginning in 2010 and thereafter, the benefit is fully phased in at 9% of income from qualified production activities, so more businesses may now find the effort worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2010/Sep/20102727.htm Maximizing the Section 199 Deduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2666">'''Startup Act 3.0''' ({{USBill|113|S.|310}}) was legislation considered in the [[113th Congress]] intended to encourage the growth and viability of startup companies in the United States through a series of changes to American tax, immigration, and regulatory policies. It is the third iteration of Startup Act legislation originally introduced into the United States Senate by [[Jerry Moran]] (R-KS) in 2011 and then reintroduced as [[Startup Act 2.0]] by Moran and [[Mark Warner]] (D-VA) in 2012. The legislation has earned broad support from entrepreneurs and the technology industry. Provisions of the bill have been scored by economists as considerable vehicles of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/startup-visa-could-create-up-to-1-point-6-million-u-s-jobs-in-next-10-years-according-to-kauffman-foundation-report.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It has bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress.

The legislation was reintroduced in the [[114th Congress]] as "Startup Act", ({{USBill|114|S.|181}}).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/181&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand French|Commission_Stasi|date=January 2012}}
The French '''commission Stasi''' is a commission set up to reflect upon the application of the ''[[laïcité]]'' principle. Named after the chair [[Bernard Stasi]], [[ombudsman]] of the (French) Republic (''médiateur de la République'') since 1998, and consisting of 20 members, it was set up by the [[President of France|president of the Republic]] [[Jacques Chirac]] on 3 July 2003. It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.

==Overview==

Jacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission.&lt;ref&gt;France 5, ''Dossiers - Débat Public :'' [http://www.france5.fr/actu_societe/W00137/9/102197.cfm La laïcité (La Commission Stasi)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as [[Cardinal Lustiger]], intellectuals such as [[Régis Debray]] and [[Patrick Weil]] as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1275-t2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;



The commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the [[hijab]] in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.

In response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.

==Principles==

The report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and [[freedom of thought]] particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.

The Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or [[reasonable accommodation]] into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].

{{Chinese|first=t|t=張五常|s=张五常|p=Zhāng Wǔcháng}}
'''Steven Ng-Sheong Cheung''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʌ|ŋ}}; born December 1, 1935) is a Hong-Kong-born American economist who specializes in the fields of [[transaction cost]]s and [[property right]]s, following the approach of [[new institutional economics]]. He achieved his public fame with an economic analysis on China open-door policy after the 1980s. In his studies of economics, he focuses on economic explanation that is based on real world observation (an observation first approach). He is also the first to introduce concepts from the [[Chicago School of Economics]], especially [[price theory]], into China.  In 2016, Cheung claimed to have written "1,500 articles and 20 books in Chinese" during his academic career.&lt;ref name="Reminiscence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=Steven N.S.|title=Steven N.S. Cheung's Reminiscence of Himself - A Reply to Ning Wang|journal=Man and the Economy|date=2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his PhD in economics from [[UCLA]], where his teachers were the American economists [[Armen Alchian]] and [[Jack Hirshleifer]]. He taught in the Department of Economics at the [[University of Washington]] from 1969 to 1982, and then at the [[University of Hong Kong]] from 1982 to 2000. During this period, Cheung reformed the syllabus of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|A-level]] Economics examination, adding the concepts of the postulate of constrained [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]], [[methodology]], transaction cost and property right, most of which originate from the theories of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]].  

==Academic career==
A [[Hakka]] of [[Huiyang]], [[Guangdong]] ancestry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Steven N.S. Cheung: My father 张五常：我的父亲 | url=http://www.hakkaonline.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=80086&amp;extra=page%3D12}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in Hong Kong in 1935, Cheung fled to China in 1941 due to the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]]. From 1959 to 1967, he studied Economics at [[UCLA]] and prepared a PhD dissertation. From 1967 to 1969, he did postdoctoral research at the [[University of Chicago]], analysing share tenancy and variable rural land resource allocation, and was hired as an assistant professor after impressing [[Milton Friedman]] in a debate. In 1969, he moved to the [[University of Washington]] where he taught until 1982. Under the advice of several friends, including [[Ronald Coase]], he returned to Hong Kong as a professor in [[University of Hong Kong]] to support the economic reforms of China.

Unlike modern mainstream economists, Cheung's analysis does not rely on advanced mathematical techniques but solely on the two basic building blocks of price theory: one is the axiom of constrained maximisation and the other, the law of demand (one that already incorporates the law of diminishing marginal returns). One of the constraints which he emphasizes most is transaction cost (or better termed institutional cost).

His theory of share tenancy has enhanced the understanding of contractual arrangement, which was largely ignored by neo-classical economists. According to Cheung, [[sharecropping]] is not necessarily exploitative. It will achieve the same efficient allocation as labor markets under competition and zero transaction costs (Cheung, 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Private property rights and sharecropping|journal=Journal of Political Economy |year=1968|first=Steven |last=Cheung|author2=|volume=76|issue=6|pages=107–122|doi= 10.1086/259477|jstor=1830153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of transaction costs, sharecropping can be efficient by lowering the monitoring costs of wage contracts and increasing risk-sharing benefits relative to rent contracts (Cheung, 1969).

This implication is revolutionary; sharecropping was perceived as an inferior arrangement for years. After the publication of ''[[The Fable of The Bees]]'', our perception of [[externalities]] is no longer the same: as long as corresponding property rights are clearly delineated, OR transaction cost is zero, externalities can be internalized through private negotiation/contract arrangement without government intervention.

In 1983, Cheung published probably his most important journal article, "The Contractual Nature of the Firm".  While a firm cannot be defined easily, Cheung interprets it as a kind of contractual arrangement being used to replace the market (i.e. price mechanism) to reduce transaction costs (e.g. the cost of price searching). Cheung once stated that when he finished writing the article, he knew that it would become a work that will last generations, and still be read a hundred years later. Thus, "[he] beheld the sky and laughed."{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Outside of the academic world, Steven Cheung is most well known for his numerous writings directed at a popular audience, especially the Chinese public. He is also known for his famous wit; in 1969 he wrote an article "Irving Fisher and the Red Guards", published in the renowned ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', arguing [[irony|ironically]] that the activities of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] in China stemmed from their use of a "refined concept of capital". Unbeknownst to the readers, the article was written under considerable emotional pain; his close friend, the [[table tennis]] champion [[Rong Guotuan]], had just committed suicide after being tortured by the Red Guards.

Cheung maintained a lifelong friendship with former mentors [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Milton Friedman]], the latter of whom officiated his wedding.&lt;ref name="Reminiscence" /&gt; He accompanied Friedman in his numerous tours of China, and was present when Friedman met with Chinese leader [[Zhao Ziyang]] to discuss economic reforms.

Cheung was also an avid photographer. He took the most iconic photo of Milton Friedman, which was featured on the cover of Friedman's treatise ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''.&lt;ref name="Reminiscence" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Nobel Prize winners like [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1991/coase-lecture.html "Ronald Coase's Nobel prize lecture"] from nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf "Joseph Stiglitz's Nobel prize lecture" (page 2/Footnote 2)] from nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt; have acknowledged intellectual provocation by Cheung in their respective Nobel lectures.  [Coase citation missing]. While referring to Cheung's "brilliant, valiant attempt" to prove that sharecropping does not matter to the incentives of the workers, Stiglitz credited Cheung's "[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf unreasonable assumptions, especially concerning information]" for motivating him to develop the theories of the role of information in economics.

==Practical research==
Steven Cheung is highly respected for his deep devotion to his research. In order to understand real life phenomena, he personally engaged in numerous economic activities, such as fish farming, selling citrus fruit, inspecting the petroleum industry, and haggling over the price of antiques. He has criticized the isolation of most economists from real life problems.

==Contribution to economics and China's economic development==
Cheung's contribution to economics and China's economic development can be roughly grouped in the following areas,

# [[New Institutional Economics]]
## how different kinds of contractual arrangement affect transaction costs, which are often ignored by neoclassical economists
## realizing the importance of transaction costs (as Cheung often mentions in his writings, if there is no transaction costs (the original starting point assumption by Coase), there is no difference in using different institutional arrangements (e.g. market or government)).
## the nature of the firm (a government, to a certain extent, is a firm and can be more efficient than the market in some areas),
# [[Methodology]]
## emphasis on economic explanation (according to Cheung, economic explanation is the ONLY objective of the study of economics);
## the analysis of relevant and observable real world constraints: Adam Smith's tradition,
## downward sloping demand curve: [[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical]] tradition,
## theories must be potentially [[Falsifiability|refutable]] but not yet refuted (Cheung considers many mainstream concepts not observable, leading to the non-refutable nature of many theories (such as utilities, welfare))
## focus on capturing the underlying and relevant constraints to explain economic phenomena that might seem odd and strange on the surface.
# China's economic development
## Considerable influence among the Chinese speaking population (most of his works after 1982 are written in Chinese);
## Prediction of China's institutional reform (which, in general, has been quite accurate)
## Analysis of the deficiencies in the Chinese state owned enterprises

===Comments on China's modernization===
He wrote many books (in Chinese) commenting on China's modernization programs from an economic point of view. In the 1980s, Cheung predicted and strongly supported an economic transformation of China as a [[market economy]]. However, in that decade, China went through serious inflation, leading to strong economic, political and social tensions.

However, after 1992, China continued to reform economically.  Steven Cheung claimed that most of his ''predictions'' have come true.  One of his major ideas, the replacing of [[state-owned enterprise]]s by private enterprises, turns out to be very consistent with the direction taken by Chinese political leaders and policy makers.

Later on, after the leaders of Shanghai began economic reforms, he predicted that it would immediately become one of the financial centers of the world, surpassing Hong Kong. The prediction was met with heavy skepticism, but turned out to be correct in some respect. As of 31 January 2015, Shanghai Stock Exchange overtook the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization. However, Shanghai has yet to catch up with Hong Kong in terms of financial infrastructure, and Shanghai's dream of overtaking Hong Kong has yet to be fully fulfilled.

==Legal troubles==
On January 28, 2003, Cheung was [[indictment|indicted]] on thirteen counts by a US federal [[grand jury]]. The charges consisted of six counts of filing a false income tax return, six counts of filing false foreign bank account reports, and one count of Consipiracy to Defraud the United States. Cheung was accused of failing to report incomes from Hong Kong parking lots and other business. As a U.S. citizen, Cheung is obliged to report incomes from anywhere in the world, even if he does not reside in the United States. The law is uncommon in other countries. Cheung insists that he relied on the advice of his tax consultant, and did not know he was supposed to report the income in question.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030129&amp;slug=cheung29&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have said that ignorance of the U.S. tax policy is common among U.S. expatriates; the U.S. government generally does not pursue investigations of failures to report overseas income for non-residents. When discovered, offenders are often simply requested to turn in the unpaid tax. It is unknown why the U.S. government chose to investigate Cheung, and further to pursue a federal grand jury indictment; journalists have suspected ulterior motives.&lt;ref&gt;http://economicexplanation.tripod.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a professor at [[University of Hong Kong]], because of the [[extradition]] agreements between the US and Hong Kong, Cheung has since stayed in [[mainland China]], a country that has no such agreements with America. He now writes books and works as a columnist for the China website [[Phoenix Television|ifeng.com]]. Occasionally, he pays visits to various universities in mainland China.

From 1998 to 2003, Steven Cheung's company, Steven N. S. Cheung Inc. had a subsidiary in Seattle called Thesaurus Fine Arts, which specialized in Asian antique pieces. The store closed when [http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/search?skip=0&amp;maxReturn=20&amp;period=archive&amp;searchType=date&amp;sectionID=&amp;query=%22thesaurus+fine+arts%22&amp;prevQuery=steven+cheung&amp;type=new a series of investigative reports in the Seattle Times] alleged that many of the antiques were fake. &lt;sup&gt;[source needed]&lt;/sup&gt; In 2004, the Washington State Attorney General filed consumer fraud charges against Thesaurus Fine Arts. In 2005, Thesaurus Fine Arts settled for up to $550,000 in fines, attorney fees, and restitution. Cheung was dropped from the case as a result. Cheung has denied ownership of Thesaurus. Thesaurus is a subsidiary of Steven N. S. Cheung Inc., but it is claimed that Cheung is "not an officer, director or shareholder" of Thesaurus.

The '''Sunset Strip curfew riots''', also known as the "[[hippie]] riots", were a series of early [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era clashes that took place between police and young people on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Hollywood, California in 1966.

== History ==
By the mid 1960s, The Sunset Strip had become a place dominated by young members of the hippie and rock and roll [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. While this brought many artistic initiatives to the neighborhood, problems simultaneously arose in the form of alcohol and drug abuse and the disturbance of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/what-were-the-1966-sunset-strip-riots-really-like-eyewitnesses-look-back-7587386|title=What Were the 1966 Sunset Strip Riots Really Like? Eyewitnesses Look Back|last=Whiteside|first=Jonny|date=November 11, 2016|work=LA Weekly|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the city's administration implemented a handful of measures to curtail the growing nuisance. They targeted the Strip's most prominent rock club, the [[Whisky a Go Go]], forcing its managers to change its name to the Whisk .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/sunset-strip-hippie-riots-4fc770b22c7a|title=During the Sunset Strip 'hippie riots,' young people and celebrities fought for the right to party|last=Reimann|first=Matt|date=April 18, 2017|website=Timeline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of strict (10:00&amp;nbsp;pm) [[curfew]] and [[loitering]] laws to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons.&lt;ref name="LATimes 2007-08-05" /&gt; This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their [[civil rights]], and for weeks tensions and protests swelled. On Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day. Hours before the protest one of L.A.'s rock 'n' roll radio stations announced there would be a rally at [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]], a club facing forced closure and demolition at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights, and cautioned people to tread carefully.&lt;ref name="Priore 2007" /&gt; That evening, as many as a 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Peter Fonda]] (who was handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws.&lt;ref name="LATimes 2007-08-05" /&gt;

The unrest continued the next night and off and on throughout November and December. Meanwhile, the local administration had decided to get tough, and [[Rescission (contract law)|rescinded]] the "youth permits" of twelve of the Strip's clubs, thereby making them off-limits to anybody under 21. In November 1966, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] voted to acquire and demolish the Pandora's Box.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, Erwin (November 30, 1966). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/486331132.html?dids=486331132:486331132&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI City Moves Swiftly to Condemn Teen Club: Ordinance Will Lead to Buying of Pandora's Box.] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The club was eventually demolished in early August 1967.&lt;ref name="felton"&gt;Felton, Dave (August 4, 1967). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/512045512.html?dids=512045512:512045512&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI Hippies Pout, Politicians Cheer as Pandora's Box Is Wrecked.] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Timeline''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Matt Reimann, the riots anticipated a cultural rift that only grew in the coming years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this light, Bob Gibson, manager of the Byrds and the Mamas and the Papas reflected: "If you had to put your finger on an event that was a barometer of the tide turning, it would probably be the Sunset Strip riots."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Straight Whisky: A Living History of Sex, Drugs, and Rock 'n' Roll on the Sunset Strip|last=Quisling|first=Erik|publisher=Bonus Books|year=2003|isbn=1566251974|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
Regarding the importance of the Sunset Strip riots, ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Woody Haut argues that "it was, if nothing else, an early salvo in ''[[Culture war|the culture wars]],'' a battle which continues to this day (...)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/sunset-strip-riot-hippie-los-angeles|title='Anarchy on Sunset Strip': 50 years on from the 'hippie riots'|last=Haut|first=Woody|date=November 11, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore argues that the riot's most lasting effect had to do with the music that came out of the event.

The incident provided the basis for the 1967 low-budget teen [[exploitation film]] ''[[Riot on Sunset Strip]]'', and inspired multiple songs:

* "[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]" performed by [[Buffalo Springfield]] and written by [[Stephen Stills]]. The song is often used as an [[antiwar]] [[protest song]] despite not being originally intended as one.&lt;ref name="pc34" /&gt; Regarding the events, Stills has said: "Riot is a ridiculous name, it was a funeral for Pandora's Box. But it looked like a revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|date=August 5, 2007|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ultrahazardous activity''' in the [[common law]] of [[torts]] is one that is so inherently dangerous that a person engaged in such an activity can be held [[strictly liable]] for injuries caused to another person, even if the person engaged in the activity took every reasonable precaution to prevent others from being injured.  In the [[Restatement of the Law]] 2d, Torts 2d, the term has been abandoned in favor of the phrase "inherently dangerous activity."

==Categories of ultrahazardous activity==

Several categories of activities are commonly recognized as being inherently hazardous; those who engage in them are subject to strict liability. These include:

*Transportation, storage, and use of [[dynamite]] and other [[explosives]]
*Transportation, storage, and use of [[radioactive contamination|radioactive]] materials
*Transportation, storage, and use of certain [[dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]]
*Keeping of [[wildlife|wild animals]] (i.e. animals that are not normally domesticated in that area)
**Note that in this context, "domesticated" does not merely refer to animals that are commonly bred and raised in captivity, such as [[alligator]]s.
*Keeping of [[domesticated animals]] that have a ''known propensity'' for dangerous behavior (e.g. keeping a [[dog]] that has attacked people before)&lt;ref&gt;The injury, however, must arise from what makes the animal dangerous. See ''[[Alwin v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.]]'', 610 N.W.2d 218 (Wis. Ct. App. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone who is injured by one of these inherently hazardous activities while [[trespassing]] on the [[property]] of the person engaged in the activity is barred from suing under a strict liability theory. Instead, they must prove that the property owner was [[negligent]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], this area of law is governed by the rule established in ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]''.

==Determining if an activity is ultrahazardous==

Factors determining an activity is ultrahazardous:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Langan v. Valicopters, Inc.'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;
#The relative possibility of harm.
#The level of seriousness of potential harm.
#The level of activity{{spaced ndash}}most persons would not regularly engage in ultrahazardous activities.
#Whether decreasing the possibility of harm requires exceptional measures of caution.
#Whether the risk of the activity outweighs its social value.
#Inappropriateness of the activity in the area where it is engaged in.

{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}
A '''''whodunit''''' or '''''whodunnit''''' (a colloquial [[elision]] of "Who [has] done it?" or "Who did it?") is a complex, plot-driven variety of the [[detective fiction|detective story]] in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric, amateur, or semi-professional detective.

==Etymology==
Journalist [[Wolfe Kaufman]] claimed that he coined the word "whodunit" around 1935 while working for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=1946wolfe&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Wolfe|title=Bits of Literary Slang|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gRoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3821%2C4432702|accessdate=April 27, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=June 10, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an editor of the magazine, [[Abel Green]], attributed it to his predecessor, [[Sime Silverman]].&lt;ref name=1985words&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=William &amp; Mary|title=Words... Wit... Wisdom|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oj9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zAIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5656%2C3661243|accessdate=April 27, 2013|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=Jun 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest appearance of the word "whodunit" in ''Variety'' occurs in the edition of August 28, 1934, in reference to a film adaptation of the play ''[[Recipe for Murder (play)|Recipe for Murder]],'' as featured in the headline, "U's Whodunit: Universal is shooting 'Recipe for Murder,' [[Arnold Ridley]]'s play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |title=U's Whodunit: Universal is shooting 'Recipe for Murder,' Arnold Ridley's play|date=August 28, 1934 |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/search?search=whodunit&amp;searchType=&amp;startYear=1906&amp;endYear=2013&amp;searchDate=8%2F28%2F1934 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was eventually titled [[Blind Justice (1934 film)|''Blind Justice'']].

==History==
The "whodunit" flourished during the so-called "[[Golden Age of Detective Fiction|Golden Age]]" of detective fiction, between 1920 and 1950, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing. Many of the best-known writers of whodunits in this period were [[United Kingdom|British]] — notably [[Agatha Christie]], [[Nicholas Blake]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Christianna Brand]], [[Edmund Crispin]], [[J. I. M. Stewart|Michael Innes]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Gladys Mitchell]] and [[Josephine Tey]]. Others – [[S. S. Van Dine]], [[John Dickson Carr]] and [[Ellery Queen]] — were American, but imitated the "English" style. Still others, such as [[Rex Stout]], [[Clayton Rawson]] and [[Earl Derr Biggers]], attempted a more "American" style.

Over time, certain conventions and [[clichés]] developed which limited surprise on the part of the reader – vis-à-vis details of the plot – the identity of the murderer. Several authors excelled, after successfully misleading their readers, in revealing an unlikely suspect as the real villain of the story. They often had a predilection for certain casts of characters and settings, with the secluded [[English country house]] at the top of the list.

One reaction to the conventionality of British murder mysteries was American "[[hardboiled|hard-boiled]]" crime fiction, epitomized by the writings of [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dashiell Hammett]] and [[Mickey Spillane]], among others.  Though the settings were grittier, the violence more abundant and the style more colloquial, plots were, as often as not, whodunits constructed in much the same way as the "[[cozy (genre)|cozier]]" British mysteries.

Currently{{when| date=November 2018}} popular are live "whodunit" experiences, including game form, where guests at a private party might use cards, a board, or video from a pre-packaged box, to perform the roles of the suspects and detective; and there are a number of murder mystery [[dinner theater]]s, where either professional or community theatre performers take on those roles, and present the [[murder mystery]] to an audience, usually in conjunction with a meal. Typically before or immediately following the final course, the audience is given a chance to offer their help in solving the mystery.

Recent additions to the subgenre of the whodunit include [[Simon Brett]], the [[Thackery Phin]] novels of [[John Sladek]], [[Lawrence Block]]'s ''[[The Burglar in the Library]]'' (1997) (which is a [[parody|spoof]] set in the present in an English-style [[country house]]), [[Kinky Friedman]]'s ''[[Road Kill (novel)|Road Kill]]'' (1997), [[Ben Elton]]'s ''[[Dead Famous (novel)|Dead Famous]]'' (2001), and [[Gilbert Adair]]'s ''[[The Act of Roger Murgatroyd]]'' (2006).

An important variation on the whodunit is the [[inverted detective story]] (also referred to as a "howcatchem" or "howdunnit") in which the guilty party and the crime are openly revealed to the reader/audience and the story follows the investigator's efforts to find out the truth while the criminal attempts to prevent it.  The ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' TV movie series is the classic example of this kind of detective story (''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' also fit into this genre). This tradition dates back to the inverted detective stories of [[R Austin Freeman]], and reached an apotheosis of sorts in ''[[Malice Aforethought]]'' written by Francis Iles (a pseudonym of ''[[Anthony Berkeley]]''). In the same vein is Iles's ''[[Before the Fact]]'' (1932), which became the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] movie ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]''. Successors of the psychological suspense novel include [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s ''[[This Sweet Sickness]]'' (1960), [[Simon Brett]]'s ''[[A Shock to the System (1990 film)|A Shock to the System]]'' (1984), and [[Stephen Dobyns]]'s ''[[The Church of Dead Girls]]'' (1997).

===Parody and spoof===
In addition to standard humor, [[parody]], spoof, and [[pastiche]] have had a long tradition within the field of crime fiction. Examples of pastiche are the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories written by [[John Dickson Carr]], and hundreds of similar works by such authors as [[E. B. Greenwood]]. As for parody, the first Sherlock Holmes spoofs appeared shortly after [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]] published his first stories. Similarly, there have been innumerable [[Agatha Christie]] send-ups. The idea is to exaggerate and mock the most noticeable features of the original and, by doing so, amuse especially those readers who are also familiar with that original.

There are also "reversal" mysteries, in which the conventional structure is deliberately inverted. One of the earliest examples of this is ''[[Trent's Last Case]]'' (1914) by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]] (1875–1956). Trent, a very able amateur detective, investigates the murder of Sigsbee Manderson. He finds many important clues, exposes several false clues, and compiles a seemingly unassailable case against a suspect. He then learns that that suspect cannot be a murderer, and that while he found nearly all of the truth, his conclusion is wrong. Then, at the end of the novel, another character tells Trent that he always knew the other suspect was innocent, because "I shot Manderson myself." These are Trent's final words to the killer:

:'[...] I'm cured. I will never touch a crime-mystery again. The Manderson affair shall be Philip Trent's last case. His high-blown pride at length breaks under him.' Trent's smile suddenly returned. 'I could have borne everything but that last revelation of the impotence of human reason. [...] I have absolutely nothing left to say, except this: you have beaten me. I drink your health in a spirit of self-abasement. And ''you'' shall pay for the dinner.'

Another example of a spoof, which at the same time shows that the borderline between serious mystery and its parody is necessarily blurred, is U.S. mystery writer [[Lawrence Block]]'s novel ''[[The Burglar in the Library]]'' (1997). The burglar of the title is Bernie Rhodenbarr, who has booked a weekend at an English-style country house just to steal a signed, and therefore very valuable, first edition of [[Raymond Chandler|Chandler]]'s ''[[The Big Sleep]]'', which he knows has been sitting there on one of the shelves for more than half a century. Alas, immediately after his arrival a dead body turns up in the library, the room is sealed off, and Rhodenbarr has to track down the murderer before he can enter the library again and start hunting for the precious book.

''[[Murder by Death]]'' is [[Neil Simon]]'s spoof of many of the best-known whodunit sleuths and their [[sidekick|sidekicks]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Murder By Death (1976) Simon's Breezy 'Murder by Death'|author=Canby, Vincent|authorlink=Vincent Canby|date=June 24, 1976|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E5DE1E38E53BBC4C51DFB066838D669EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1976 film, [[Sam Spade]] (from ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'') becomes Sam Diamond, Hercule Poirot becomes Milo Perrier, and so on.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The characters are all gathered in a large country house and given clues to solve the mystery.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[The Real Inspector Hound]]'' is a send-up of crime fiction novels and features a bumbling detective.

The 2001 film ''[[Gosford Park]]'' paid homage to the classic whodunit premise, while at the same time presenting an original story.

===Homicide investigation===
The term ''whodunit'' is also used among [[homicide]] investigators to describe a case in which the identity of the killer is not quickly apparent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Since most homicides are committed by people with whom the victim is acquainted or related, a whodunit case is usually more difficult to solve.
