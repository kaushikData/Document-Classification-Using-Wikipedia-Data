The '''Basel Accords''' (see alternative [[#Spelling|spelling]]s below) refer to the banking supervision Accords (recommendations on banking regulations)—[[Basel I]], [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]]—issued by the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS).
They are called the Basel Accords as the BCBS maintains its [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]] at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] and the committee normally meets there. The Basel Accords is a set of recommendations for regulations in the banking industry.

==The Basel Committee==
{{main|Basel Committee on Banking Supervision}}
Formerly, the Basel Committee consisted of representatives from central banks and regulatory authorities of the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] countries plus [[Luxembourg]] and [[Spain]]. Since 2009, all of the other [[G-20 major economies]] are represented, as well as some other major banking locales such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]. (See the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision|Committee]] article for a full list of members.)

The committee does not have the authority to enforce recommendations, although most member countries as well as some other countries tend to implement the Committee's policies. This means that recommendations are enforced through national (or [[European Union|EU]]-wide) laws and regulations, rather than as a result of the committee's recommendations - thus some time may pass between recommendations and implementation as law at the national level.

== Spelling ==
The Basel Committee is named after the city of [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]]. In early publications, the Committee sometimes used the British spelling "Basle" or the French spelling "Bâle," names that are sometimes still used in the media. More recently, the Committee has deferred to the predominantly German-speaking population of the region and used the spelling "Basel", which is also a common spelling in English.

'''Benjamin Franklin''' (February 1, 1812 – October 22, 1878) was an important conservative figure in the American [[Restoration Movement]], especially as the leading antebellum conservative in the northern United States branch of the movement. He is notable as the early and lifelong mentor of [[Daniel Sommer]], whose support of the 1889 Sand Creek Declaration set in motion events which led to the formal division of the [[Churches of Christ]] from the [[Disciples of Christ]] in 1906.

According to contemporary biographies "His early religious training was according to the [[Methodist]] faith, though he never belonged to any church until he united with the Disciples." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Living Pulpit of the Christian Church: A Series of Discourses, Doctrinal and Practical |url=https://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/wmoore/tlp/TLP15.HTM#Page339 |author=Moore, W. T. |year=1868 |publisher=R. W. Carroll &amp; Co.|pages=339–340|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|editor=Moore, W. T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Born near present-day [[Belmont County, Ohio]] in 1812, Franklin was said to be a fourth-generation descendant of a brother of [[American Revolutionary War]] figure [[Benjamin Franklin]], for whom he was named. He was the eldest son of a fairly big family.&lt;ref name="Hagger 1938"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Benjamin Franklin|author=Hagger, Thomas|title=Heralds of Christian Unity: Being Brief Biographical Sketches of Some Pioneers of the Restoration Movement|location=Melbourne, Australia|publisher=Austral Printing and Publishing Company|year=1938|pages=31–35|url=https://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/thagger/HERALDS.HTM#Page31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712010934/http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/thagger/HERALDS.HTM#Page31|archivedate=July 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Franklin was near 21 years old, thus in late 1832 or early 1833, Franklin's father moved the family to farmland about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Middletown, Indiana|Middletown]] in [[Henry County, Indiana]]. Franklin himself purchased {{convert|80|acre|m2}}.

=== Career ===

==== Restoration Movement conversion ====
In November 1834, pioneer Restoration Movement preacher and elder [[Samuel Rogers (clergyman)|Samuel Rogers]] moved to the Falls of Rough Creek in Henry County from [[Kentucky]], becoming a neighbor of the Franklin family.

Rogers began to preach [[Restoration Movement]] doctrine using a local schoolhouse to deliver his orations. He was quickly rejected as heretical by the [[Methodist]] leadership in the area: however, his family was sympathetic toward the neighbor and soon came under his theological influence. Franklin was baptised by full immersion in 1836 by Rogers near [[Middletown, Indiana|Middletown]] in [[Henry County, Indiana]], along with many others who were baptised in the same meeting. (One source also credits [[Elijah Martindale]] in Franklin's conversion.&lt;ref name="Shaw1966"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hoosier Disciples|author=Shaw, Henry K.|publisher=Bethany Press, for the Association of the Christian Churches in Indiana|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Of those baptised at this meeting, six or seven would go on to become preachers in the movement: Franklin, three of his brothers, Eider Adamson, John T. Rogers, and possibly another whose name was forgotten by one of Rogers' biographers.&lt;ref name="Brown 1904 (Rogers)"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Samuel Rogers |author=Brown, John T.|title=Churches of Christ: A Historical, Biographical, and Pictorial History of Churches of Christ in the United States, Australasia, England, and Canada. |location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=John P. Morton and Company|year=1904|pages=447–449|url=https://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/jtbrown/coc/COC1333.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early ministry and editorship ====
At the [[Connersville, Indiana|Connersville]] State Meeting in 1842, Franklin was designated as the lead evangelist of the northeastern quarter ("district") of [[Indiana]]: the districting plan soon failed for lack of local funds to pay the evangelists' salary of US$500 per year.

Franklin began preaching at [[New Lisbon, Indiana]] in 1842. He began publishing his ''Reformer'' in 1845, soon changing the name to ''Western Reformer''. He moved to [[Milton, Indiana]] in 1846 and published the journal from his own shop. This publication was to be merged with Hall's ''Gospel Proclamation'' as the ''Proclamation and Reformer'' in 1850. Franklin served as one of two secretaries at the Disciples' eighth state meeting at [[Columbus, Indiana]], which convened on October 3, 1846.

Later, Franklin published the ''Christian Age'' with collaborator [[David S. Burnet]]. His last publication was the [[American Christian Review]] begun in 1856: following Franklin's death the name of the paper would be changed to the [[Octographic Review]]. He was said to have influenced the founding of [[Butler University]] as well as other national societies, and was also said to have been an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and [[pacifist]], like many of his contemporaries within the movement.

After changing residences several times in Indiana and Ohio, Franklin settled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1850, where he remained for 14 years. It was during the 1850s that Franklin changed his views to oppose missionary societies.&lt;ref name="Shaw1966"/&gt;

==== ''The American Christian Review'' ====
In 1856, Franklin began to publish the ultra-conservative ''American Christian Review,'' which he published until his death in 1878. Its influence, initially considerable, was said to have waned following the [[American Civil War]]. Franklin undertook a rigorous program of publication correspondence, and traveling lectures which took him to "many" U. S. states and Canada.

Franklin's last move was to [[Anderson, Indiana]], where he lived from 1864 until his death.

==== Traveling orator ====
In 1871 Franklin gave a series of sermons at [[Wellsburg, West Virginia]]. It was here that he attracted the interest of a young [[Bethany College (Bethany, West Virginia)|Bethany College]] student named [[Daniel Sommer]], becoming a lifelong mentor of Sommer, who would take up Franklin's mantle as publisher following Franklin's death. Sommer would become notable for his participation in the 1889 Sand Creek ''Address and Declaration'', a particularly strong statement of exclusivity which helped to drive the split between the [[Disciples of Christ]] and more conservative [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]].

=== Personal life ===
Franklin married Mary Personet on December 15, 1833 with whom he had eleven children. Nine survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Brown 1904 (Franklin)"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Benjamin Franklin |title=Churches of Christ: A Historical, Biographical, and Pictorial History of Churches of Christ in the United States, Australasia, England, and Canada. |author=Brown, John T.|location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=John P. Morton and Company|year=1904|pages=420–421|url=https://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/jtbrown/coc/COC1311.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died suddenly at his home in [[Anderson, Indiana]].

==Biography==
Beny Steinmetz was born in [[Netanya]], the fourth child of Rubin Steinmetz.&lt;ref name=Guardian_01&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Beny Steinmetz: Israeli diamond dealer who likes to keep a low profile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/30/beny-steinmetz-international-israeli-profile|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited the [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]]-based Steinmetz Diamond Group from his father.&lt;ref name="forbes2010"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Beny-Steinmetz_N65G.html Forbes 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmetz lives in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]].&lt;ref name="nyer2013"&gt;Patrick Radden Keefe, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/07/08/130708fa_fact_keefe?currentPage=all "Buried Secrets: How an Israeli billionaire wrested control of one of Africa's biggest prizes"], ''The New Yorker'', 8 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Steinmetz along with his brother Daniel founded what subsequently became known as Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR). Beny currently occupies an advisory role to the company's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="BSG Resources Limited"/&gt; 

In March 2014, the Swiss daily ''[[Le Temps]]'' reported that Beny Steinmetz had sold shares in the Steinmetz Diamond Group (SDG) to his brother Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/03/30/swiss-newspaper-reports-beny-steinmetz-sells-interest-in-diamond-business/ Swiss Newspaper Reports Beny Steinmetz Sells Interest In Diamond Business], ''[[Jewish Business News]]'', 30 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/guinea-strips-beny-steinmetz-bsg-resources-mining-contracts-corruption|title=Guinea to strip Beny Steinmetz company of mining concessions|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an investor of Gabriel Resources Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/steinmetz-unit-invests-in-gabriel-resources-2009-11-12|title=Steinmetz unit invests in Gabriel Resources|publisher=Mining Weekly|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koidu Holdings]], which formerly operated as a joint venture, has been wholly owned by the BSGR company since 2007.&lt;ref name="koiduholdings"&gt;[http://www.koiduholdings.com/company-history.php Koidu Holdings Company History] Retrieved 2012-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baxter"&gt;Joan Baxter, ''Dust from our eyes: an unblinkered look at Africa'', Wolsak and Wynn Publishers Ltd., 2008, p. 226 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I_kMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;dq=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UtEQTrLjNdSftwfalYn3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, he founded STI Ventures NV, a [[venture capital]] firm that invests in [[start-up companies]] in Israel.&lt;ref name="stiventuresnv"&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=91278 STI Ventures NV BusinessWeek]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he was the owner of [[Tucows]].&lt;ref name="isla"&gt;''ISLA'', Volume 54, Issue 12, [[Oakland, California]]: Information Services on Latin America, 1999, pg. 7379 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eTAcAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;dq=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cNgQTqPrI4KbtwfdwcXjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt; BSGR and another investment firm, IMR, also control Cunico. A now-defunct company, of which he was a founder and shareholder, [[Nikanor plc]], listed in London, was acquired by [[Katanga Mining]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="KatangaHist" /&gt; With his company called Scorpio, he owns real estate in [[Kazakhstan]], Russia, and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="forbes2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

The March 2011 issue of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated his personal wealth at US$6 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/beny-steinmetz ''Forbes Rich List'': The World's Billionaires 2011 - Beny Steinmetz], forbes.com; accessed 21 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2008, a three-year exploration permit for [[Simandou]] Blocks 1 &amp; 2, in the [[Republic of Guinea]], was awarded to BSGR Guinea, after the government of Guits to mine the northern half of Simandou, days before he died, to Steinmetz for $160 million. Steinmetz then soon sold a 51% share on to [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]] for $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21603507-guineas-government-may-last-be-dealing-sensibly-its-mineral-riches-let|title=Guinea and its iron ore: Let the people benefit, for once|magazine=The Economist|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Justice Department]] and the [[FBI]]  investigated BSGR's acquisition of the rights to extract half of the iron ore deposits at [[Simandou|Simandou, Guinea]], due to concerns about corruption and bribery.&lt;ref name="nyer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/fbi-arrest-bribery-10bn-mountain FBI arrest agent over bribery cover up claim in battle over $10bn mountain], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-corruption-deal-of-the-century-how-guinea-lost-billions-of-pounds-in-simandou-mining-licensing-8662534.html "The corruption deal of the century: How Guinea lost billions of pounds in Simandou mining licensing], ''The Independent'', 17 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|HOfNE2gZH1o}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSGR denied these allegations and in an interview to the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', Steinmetz said: “We are the victims. We have done only good things for Guinea, and what we’re getting is spit in the face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/08/buried-secrets|title=Buried Secrets|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 the Guinean government accused BSGR of obtaining the Simandou mining rights by paying bribes to the wife of then-president [[Lansana Conté]] in 2008, and that the rights would be stripped from BSGR and its partner [[Vale (mining company)|Vale S.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinea to strip Beny Steinmetz company of mining concessions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/guinea-strips-beny-steinmetz-bsg-resources-mining-contracts-corruption|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014|author=Ian Cobain|author2=Juliette Garside|author3=Anne Penketh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2014 BSGR started an [[international arbitration]] proceeding against the Republic of Guinea in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]], challenging the government's decision to revoke its mining rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/guinea-mining-simandou-idUSL5N0RB45320140910|title=BSGR pushes ahead with arbitration against Guinea over Simandou mining rights|date=10 September  2014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] then filed suit against Steinmetz, BSGR and Vale alleging that they had devised a [[RICO]] scheme to steal "valuable mining rights" held by Rio Tinto.&lt;ref name="GUA1may"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cobain|first=Ian|title=Rio Tinto sues Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/01/rio-tinto-sues-beny-steinmetz|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Steinmetz subsequently hired former FBI director [[Louis Freeh]], defense attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]], and law firm [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]], as part of his defense team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverstein|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Silverstein|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/02/louis-freehs-latest-investigation-billionaire-businessman-accused-bribing-african-government|title=Louis Freeh's Latest Investigation: Billionaire Businessman Accused of Bribing African Government|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=2 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102234158/https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/02/louis-freehs-latest-investigation-billionaire-businessman-accused-bribing-african-government|archivedate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Rio Tinto's RICO lawsuit against BSGR was dismissed, with U.S. District Judge [[Richard Berman]] ruling that Rio exceeded the [[statute of limitations]] when filing their claim against BSGR in 2014 and that the company failed to identify a pattern of racketeering activity by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authors=Erik Larson &amp; Bob Van Voris|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-20/steinmetz-bsg-resources-win-ruling-dismissing-rio-tinto-suit|title=Steinmetz, BSG Resources Win Dismissal of Rio Tinto Lawsuit|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November 2016, Alan Davies, head of the Rio Tinto department responsible for Simandou, was suspended due to an investigation into the lawfulness of Rio Tinto's payment to Francois de Combert, former managing partner at Lazard and personal adviser to the president of Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-11/billionaire-steinmetz-says-rio-probe-proves-guinea-mine-plot|title=Billionaire Says Rio Probe Proves Elaborate Plot to Strip Prized Guinea Mine Rights|date=11 November 2016|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 December 2016, ''[[France 24]]'' aired recordings from 2012 that it claimed were conversations between Francois de Combret and unnamed people involved in negotiations over the future of Simandou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20161201-exclusive-audio-recordings-guinea-president-conde-simandou-mine-bribery-rio-tinto|title=Audio recordings drag Guinea president into mine bribery scandal|date=1 December 2016|newspaper=France 24|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian media referred to the controversy as ''Guineagate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iron-ore/recordings-suggest-rio-tinto-consultant-hand-in-hand-with-guinea-20161202-gt2lbw|title=French claims Rio's consultant working 'hand in hand' with officials in Guinea|date=2 December 2016|newspaper=Financial Review||access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Steinmetz was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and bribery charges  following an investigation carried out by Israeli, American, Swiss, and Guinean authorities in coordination with the [[OECD]].&lt;ref name="Billionaire"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/billionaire-vs-billionaire-israels-steinmetz-sues-soros|title=Billionaire vs. billionaire: Israel's Steinmetz sues Soros|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was placed under [[house arrest]] on 19 December 2016, due to accusations that he paid tens of millions of dollars to senior public officials in Guinea to advance his businesses, specifically in connection with BSGR's purchase of Simandou.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"&gt;{{cite news|title=BSGR sues billionaire George Soros over loss of Guinea iron project|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bsgr-lawsuit-idUSKBN17G1LL|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmetz was released without charge the following month.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-corruption-steinmetz-idUSKBN14O1QT Billionaire Beny Steinmetz released from Israel house arrest], Reuters.com, 4 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2017, BSGR filed a suit against American billionaire [[George Soros]] in U.S. federal court in New York, claiming he had engaged in a lengthy effort to defame the company and sabotage its business in Simandou and around the world.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billionaire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-14/george-soros-sued-by-fellow-billionaire-in-10-billion-mine-row|title=Soros Sued by Fellow Billionaire in $10 Billion Mine Brawl|date=14 April 2017|publisher=Bloomberg News|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Soros spokesman called the allegations "frivolous and entirely false" and described the lawsuit as "a desperate [[PR stunt]] meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;Tara Cunningham, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/04/15/miner-bsg-resources-sues-billionaire-george-soros-loss-guinea "Miner BSG Resources sues billionaire George Soros over loss of Guinea iron project"], ''Telegraph'', 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2016, Steimetz was indicted [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] by Romanian [[National Anticorruption Directorate]], on charges of the unlawful recovery of [[Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern]]'s inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/actualitate/dna-cere-arestarea-strategului-lui-basescu-345480.html|title=Bombă aruncată de DNA: Se cere arestarea a patru afaceriști extrem de influenţi|publisher=antena3|date=10 March 2016|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court in Romania dismissed the request for a warrant for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-romanian-court-refuses-arrest-warrant-for-beny-steinmetz-1001126076|title=Romanian court refuses Steinmetz arrest warrant|website=Globes|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2017, Steinmetz was  arrested as part of a joint investigation by Israeli and Swiss anti-corruption officials over allegations of fraud, breach of trust, bribery, obstruction of justice and false registration of corporate documents" with the apparent purpose of money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-billionaire-arrested-in-international-money-laundering-probe-502413|title=Israeli billionaire arrested in int'l money laundering probe|last1=Eisenbud |first1=Daniel|last2=Shaham|first2=Udi|date=14 August 2017|website=jpost.com|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
In 2007, Steinmetz and his wife Agnes founded the Agnes and Beny Steinmetz Foundation in order to unify their multiple volunteer activities under the auspices of one philanthropic organization. The Foundation is primarily engaged in financing projects in the fields of education, healthcare, and culture for young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1001158166|title=מי הגיע לאירוע ההוקרה של קרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ? - גלובס|website=Globes|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agnes and Beny Steinmetz Foundation also supports programs that work with at-risk youth, runs after-school facilities for children from disadvantaged families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetz-foundation.com/?module=category&amp;item_id=20|title=The Agnes &amp; Beny Steinmetz Foundation|website=www.steinmetz-foundation.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers scholarships to students from difficult socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netanya.ac.il/Interested/Scholarships/Pages/Scholarships7.aspx|title=netanya.ac.il/Interested/Scholarships/Pages/Scholarships7.aspx|website=www.netanya.ac.il|language=he-il|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also donates to several organizations and institutions, including the Tel Aviv Museum, the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers (mainly supporting the soldiers of the Tzabar Battalion Of the Givati Brigade),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ametz.awis.org.il/1147-2|title=חוגגים עשור לקרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ {{!}} המגזין של פרויקט אמץ לוחם|website=ametz.awis.org.il|language=he-IL|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Israel Cancer Association, and various hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com/he/home|title=קרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ {{!}} עמוד הבית|website=www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com|language=he-il|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, the Foundation held a festive event to celebrate a decade of giving. Attendants included representatives of the many organizations the Foundation had supported over the years by contributing a cumulative amount of tens of millions of shekels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com/ten-years-celebration|title=אירוע חגיגת עשור לקרן אניאס ובני שטינמץ|website=steinmetzfoundationnews.com|access-date=21 February 2018|language=he-il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biography work''' is essentially about interest in the human being and the great mystery of existence we call human life.  It is an active practice for developing self-knowledge.  It is a search for meaning out of which may arise greater social understanding—deeper, genuine interest in one's fellow man.  Biography work is founded upon the vast work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], collectively called [[Anthroposophy|spiritual science]] or [[anthroposophy]]--"wisdom or knowledge of the human being."  Anthroposophy is often described as a path from the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the world or cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts
| website = wn.rsarchive.org
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A profound relationship exists between the cosmos or [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]] and the human being as microcosm.  Indeed, anthroposophy suggests the human being ''is'' a microcosm of the macrocosm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, biography work works directly with physical existence, life on earth, which itself speaks volumes, if we will but "learn to read the text" of the individual experience, as well as that of the [[archetype]].  The human being is a bridge then:  on the one hand, embedded in the earth, directed by the rhythms of nature, the seasons, night and day, etc.; and, on the other hand, belonging to the spiritual world.  "The only real hope of people today is probably a renewal of certainty that we are rooted in the earth, and at the same time in the cosmos," as so beautifully described by [[Václav Havel|Vaclav Havel]] (''The Measure of Man'').

== Individuality and Connection to Others ==

The human life, one's biography, is shaped by the inherently creative and uniquely individual power of the "I" or Higher Ego&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = An Outline of Occult Science

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Higher Self.  It is an exploration of the role of the "I" in unfolding a life full of gifts, opportunities, illnesses, accidents, struggles, tasks, responsibilities, and perhaps above all questions. Biography work invites new self-understanding and, in turn, awakens interest in the experiences of others.  In an evermore virtual world, biography work fosters real meetings and genuine appreciation for the diversity of human endeavor and creativity.   

== History ==
Biography Work was first developed in the 1970s, arising out of a picture of human development given by Rudolf Steiner early in the twentieth century.  Steiner described physical, soul, and spiritual development from birth to death in great detail, and included, as a significant aspect of the whole human being, the soul’s further spiritual growth after death and through successive lifetimes, i.e. [[reincarnation]].  Steiner knew that in our time there would be tremendous need for increased social understanding, and that study of human development would be an essential foundation of such understanding.

One of the earliest descriptions of biography work given by Rudolf Steiner appears in the lecture titled "How Can the Destitution of Soul in Modern Times Be Overcome?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/KnoSpi_index.html
| title = Lecture: How Can the Destitution of Soul in Modern Times Be Overcome?
| website = wn.rsarchive.org
| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is as follows:  "As many descriptions as possible of how human beings really develop—what I would call the positive natural history of individual human development—must be disseminated in an understanding way.  Wherever we can we should describe how this or that person developed—we should be able to give a loving account of human development, as we have observed it. The study of life is needed, the will to the understanding of life."

Drawing on the many references found in multiple lectures given by Rudolf Steiner, students of his work and leaders in the anthroposophical community began to create practices that are today collectively referred to as "biography work" (or sometimes "social art").  Two of those leaders, [[Bernard Lievegoed]], a Dutch physician, and Gudrun Burkhard, a physician who still lives and practices in Brazil, both teachers and authors as well, led a pioneering initiative and introduced this new way of life-consultation, first in their respective regions and soon to the world.  In the United States, the efforts of George and Gisela O'Neil culminated in the publication (by Florin Lowndes, after the O'Neils' deaths) of ''The Human Life'', a rich depiction of human development, birth to death, a thorough exploration of their original work in developing the life-chart, and a comprehensive collection of references made by Dr. Steiner regarding human biography.

== Method or Ways of Working ==
Biography work is about listening. At the heart of biography work is the understanding that each life story is a unique revelation of intention and deep wisdom. For the biography practitioner, each “journey” is sacred, and there is an understanding that the “traveler” is continually informed by both individual and universal truths. Biography practitioners bring a broad perspective, artistic exercises, and true listening to life explorations.
Biography work is phenomenological; its methods based in [[Phenomenological model|phenomenology]], particularly as developed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].  Biography practitioners (also called biography workers, social artists) work via the following: workshops, adult education courses, one-on-one or small group conversation, counseling, consultation and continuing education for professionals. 
=== Workshops and Courses ===

These are offered on a variety of themes and the learning process is typically infused with social art.  Sessions might include short talks, biography exercises, work with [[storytelling]], nature observation, artwork, [[meditation]] or inner practice, and conversation.  One of the gifts of working in groups is a heightened appreciation for each unique life as it resonates within the context of universal patterns. 
=== Conversation ===

Being one of the most human of activities, conversation is central to biography work.  
=== Counseling ===

Some certified biography practitioners are also licensed in counseling, psychotherapy, social work and the like. They typically work in a formal or clinical setting and are able to address crises, life-changing events, inner difficulties, and illness.
=== Consultation and Continuing Education ===
 
Biography practitioners can bring new perspectives to existing professions such as art therapy, medicine, care for the elderly, hospice, work with the homeless, and more.

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s '''Bureau of International Information Programs''' ('''IIP''') supports the department's public diplomacy efforts by providing and supporting the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences.  IIP is one of three bureaus that report to the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] and the [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] are the sister bureaus.

== History ==

When the Foreign Affairs and Restructuring Act abolished the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) on October 1, 1999, USIA's broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), and its non-broadcasting information functions were given to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The Bureau of International Information Programs was created out of this restructuring.

== Mission and purpose ==

According to the bureau's page on the Department of State website, IIP "provides and supports the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences to build America's reputation abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureau of International Information Programs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/index.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical and virtual places include over 700 American Spaces around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Spaces|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/amerspaces/|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large social media community that numbers over 12 million followers.  Content includes publications, video, and U.S. expert speakers, who engage foreign audiences both in person and through virtual programs.  IIP manages the infrastructure for all embassy and consulate websites, translations of public remarks by the President and Secretary, and maintains internal websites with resources for use by public diplomacy officers for overseas programs.

==Role and responsibility==

The Bureau of International Information Programs provides public diplomacy materials and support in three primary areas:

; Digital
IIP operates the department's embassy and consulate websites, which attract more than 150 million unique visitors per year (http://usembassy.gov) in over 60 languages.  IIP also supports embassy social media efforts with theme-based Facebook pages and Twitter sites in six languages, reaching more than 12 million fans and followers.

IIP also operates an interactive web-chat platform that links foreign audiences to U.S. subject matter experts, opinion-makers, community leaders, and government officials in more than 800 programs each year. In September 2014, the bureau launched a new social sharing platform [https://share.america.gov ShareAmerica] to distribute public diplomacy content that is interesting, policy-relevant, and visually appealing.

; American Spaces
American Spaces exemplify the United States' commitment to a core tenet of democracy: the citizen's right to free access to information.  Hosting more than 16 million visits each year, American Spaces support public diplomacy by creating a place for in-person engagement with foreign audiences.  Over 700 Spaces are hosted in embassies, schools, libraries, and other partner institutions in 169 countries.  They provide information about United States' policy, culture, and values as well as study in the United States.  They also support English language learning and activities for alumni of international visitor programs.

; Public Diplomacy (PD) Content
IIP creates and curates content that provides context and information on U.S. foreign policy topics in a variety of formats ranging from video to print publications to audio books, reaching more than one billion people a year.  Much of this content, along with transcripts of the Secretary's and President's speeches, is available to embassies in multiple languages.  IIP also produces more than 125 video products each year and recruits more than 650 speakers annually, including Supreme Court justices, renowned authors, innovators, scholars, entrepreneurs, journalists, and sports figures who connect directly with more than 160,000 people in local markets via in-country and virtual events.

; Analytics
IIP has an advanced analytics capacity to measure output, campaign performance, perform audience analysis and track over 2,000 Department of State social media properties.

The '''Business Continuity Institute (BCI)''' was established in 1994 to enable individual members to obtain guidance and support from fellow [[business continuity]] practitioners.

The BCI has around 8,000 members in more than 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebci.org/index.php/about/generalinfo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 David Thorp replaced Lorraine Darke as Executive Director after she spent 12 years in the role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/business-continuity-news/1326-bci-appoints-new-executive-director&lt;/ref&gt;

}}In a '''case competition''', participants strive to develop the best solution to a business or education-related [[case study]] within an allocated time frame, typically with teams of two or more individuals pitted against each other in a head-to-head or broader relative ranking.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCB" /&gt; Teams deliver presentations for judges and, while competitions vary in composition, a standard [[wikt:format|format]] and purpose exists.

== History ==
The case competition concept originated in the United States and originally included participants from domestic universities. The notion of expanding to include international competitors emerged later, with the concept eventually taking hold across North America and Western Europe. Today, a wide range of international competitions are hosted in various countries in North America, Europe, and Asia,&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a case competition? |url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |work=Copenhagen Business School |publisher=Copenhagen Business School |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephanie Wold Hadler |date=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126093841/http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. International case competitions have also begun expanding beyond the undergraduate level, as competitions like the Wharton China Business Society International Case Competition offer high school divisions &lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/wharton-china-business-forum|title=Wharton China Business Society International Case Competiton}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [http://www.aub.edu.lb/osb/menarcci/ Middle East &amp; North Africa Regional Case Initiative]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (MENARCCI) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). MENARCCI's goal is to serve as a depository of all necessary knowledge about the case method, sources of cases and publishing outlets, and the links to all cases on the Region available on-line. In the Middle East, cases competitions are conducted by [http://www.aub.edu.lb the American University of Beirut] and [http://www.aucegypt.edu the American University in Cairo].

==Format==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Formats vary according to a number of dimensions. The following dimensions are often used to classify and compare competitions: Host: corporate versus educational institution; Participant selection: "by invitation" versus "by application"; and, Level: undergraduate, [[Postgraduate education|graduate]]. Formats may vary along practical dimensions, including: Case specificity (whether the case has been written especially for the competition or not); Number of teams; Organization (student-run, professional etc.); Rules, e.g.:Time (common formats are 3-4 or 24 hours), Materials, Degree of access to expert advice (either from within the competition or externally, and electronically or face to face).

Some competitions add complexity to create a more interesting challenge. For example, [[Ohio State University|Ohio State University (OSU)]]'s Center For International Business Education And Research (CIBER), in its annual Case Challenge, created teams from the overall pool of participants, regardless of school, dissolving the usual school-based team format. For the Ohio State scenario, once the students are assigned to teams, a full day of [[Team building|team-building]] exercises is run for competitors.

Competitions can be internal to a [[business school]], or they can involve teams from multiple schools. Sometimes the competition includes several rounds, with the final round typically judged by outside [[Senior management|company executives]] (sometimes the panel consists of executives from the actual company in the case). For example, the [[University of Washington]]’s [[Foster School of Business]]' 2010 round of its Global Business Case Competition featured a customized case on the [[Boeing|Boeing Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives Global Business Case Competition|url=http://www.foster.washington.edu/centers/gbc/globalbusinesscasecompetition/Pages/archives.aspx|work=Foster|publisher=Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2002-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boeing executives acted as judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Participation==
Participants exercise skills and knowledge on a "[[Reality|real world]]" case for an actual organization, with the support of representatives who can provide professional advice.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; Other competitions select an issue based on its degree of importance, and employ the competition as a means to both highlight the issue and create potential solutions through the efforts of the competitors.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Nonprofit and Public Leadership {{!}} Educational Case Leadership Competition |url=http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |work=University of California, Berkeley {{!}} Haas School of Business |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Staff |year=1996–2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510134032/http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants can also be assessed as potential [[candidate]]s for [[analysis]]-based jobs within the targeted companies.

Teams in case competitions are tasked with assessing the situation facing the organization, analyzing available information, crafting a solution, and defending their recommendations. In general, teams adhere to a time limit and specific rules. Each team is judged independently, and the judges' decision is final, although a confidential summary [[evaluation]] is generally provided.&lt;ref name="Molson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact John Molson MBA International Case Competition|url=http://www.mbacasecomp.com/en/contact|work=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|publisher=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheque fraud''' ([[British English|en-GB]]), or '''Check fraud''' ([[American English|en-US]]), refers to a category of [[crime|criminal acts]] that involve making the unlawful use of [[cheque]]s  in order to illegally acquire or borrow funds that do not exist within the account balance or account-holder's legal ownership. Most methods involve taking advantage of the ''[[Float (money supply)|float]]'' (the time between the negotiation of the cheque and its clearance at the cheque writer's financial institution) to draw out these funds. Specific kinds of cheque fraud include '''cheque kiting''', where funds are deposited before the end of the float period to cover the fraud, and '''paper hanging''', where the float offers the opportunity to write fraudulent cheques but the account is never replenished.

==Types of cheque fraud==

===Cheque kiting===
{{main|Cheque kiting}}
Cheque kiting refers to use of the [[float (money supply)|float]] to take advantage and delay the notice of non-existent funds.

=== Embezzlement ===
While some cheque kiters fully intend to bring their accounts into good standing, others, often known as ''paper hangers'', have pure fraud in mind, attempting to "take the money and run."

==== Bad cheque writing ====
{{main|Non-sufficient funds}}
A cheque is written to a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear. The buyer will then take possession of the cash, goods, or services purchased with the cheque, and will hope the recipient will not take action or will do so in vain.

==== Abandonment ====
The paper hanger deposits a cheque one time that s/he knows is bad or fictitious into his/her account. When the bank considers the funds available (usually on the next business day), but before the bank is informed the cheque is bad, the paper hanger then withdraws the funds in cash. The offender knows the cheque will bounce, and the resulting account will be in debt, but the offender will abandon the account and take the cash.

Such crimes are often used by petty criminals to obtain funds through a quick [[embezzlement]], and are frequently conducted using a fictitious or stolen identity in order to hide that of the real offender.

This form of fraud is the basis for the [[Advance-fee scam#Fake cheque and cheque cashing scams|Nigerian cheque scam]] and other similar schemes; however, in these cases, the victim will be the one accused of committing such crimes, and will be left to prove his/her innocence.

=== Forgery ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Sometimes, [[forgery]] is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. One form of forgery involves the use of a victim's legitimate cheques, that have either been altogether stolen and then cashed, or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator, by adding words and/or digits in order to inflate the amount (raising a cheque).

Other cases involved the use of completely fake cheques, as in the case of [[Frank Abagnale]]. The perpetrator passes or attempts to pass a cheque that has been manufactured by him/herself, but that represents a non-existent account.

=== Unusual cases ===
[[Cheque washing]] involves the theft of a cheque in transit between the writer and recipient, followed by the use of chemicals to remove the ink representing all parts other than the signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Bruce |url=http://www.ckfraud.org/washing.html |title=Check Washing - WHAT IS IT? |publisher=Ckfraud.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator then fills in the blanks to his or her advantage.

Sometimes the cheque fraud comes from an employee of the bank itself, as was the case with Suzette A. Brock, who was convicted of theft for writing five corporate cheques to her own birth name from her desk as a loan servicing agent for Banner Bank of Walla Walla, WA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.union-bulletin.com/articles/2009/04/08/local_news/090408local06theftsentence.txt |accessdate=December 17, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notorious "bad cheque artist" of the 20th century, [[Frank Abagnale]], devised a scheme to put incorrect [[MICR]] numbers at the bottom of the cheque he wrote, so that they would be routed to the incorrect [[Federal Reserve Bank]] for clearing. This allowed him to work longer in one area before his criminal activity was detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abagnale Jr. |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Abagnale, Jr. |title=Catch Me If You Can: The True Story of a Real Fake |year=1980 |publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap |location=New York |isbn=0-448-16538-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg (director) |date=2002 |title=[[Catch Me If You Can]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=DreamWorks |location=USA
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie, [[Catch Me If You Can|Catch Me if You Can]], which outlines Abagnale's crime spree, it shows Abagnale soaking plastic [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] airplanes in his bathtub and removing the Pan Am insignia on the toys. He would then place the decals on the bad cheques he was writing while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. From his schemes, Abagnale amassed over $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spielberg-ocr.com/pay-checks.html|title=Forging Pay Checks with Decals {{!}} Spielberg, Abagnale and OCR|last=Vynckier|first=Ivo|work=Catch the Truth If You Can {{!}} Spielberg, Abagnale and OCR|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combating cheque fraud==
In most jurisdictions, passing a cheque for an amount of money the writer knows is not in the account at the time of negotiation (or available for [[overdraft protection]]) is usually considered a violation of [[criminal law]]. However, the general practice followed by banks has been to refrain from prosecuting cheque writers if the cheque reaches the bank after sufficient funds have been deposited, thereby allowing it to clear. But the account holder is normally held fully liable for all bank penalties, civil penalties, and criminal charges allowable by law in the event the cheque does not clear the bank.

Only when the successful clearance of a cheque is due to a [[check kiting|kiting scheme]] does the bank traditionally take action. Banks have always had various methods of detecting kiting schemes and stopping them in the act. Computer systems in place will alert bank officials when a customer engages in various suspicious activities, including frequently depositing cheques bearing the same, large monthly total deposits accompanied by near-zero average daily balances, or avoidance of tellers by frequent use of ATMs for deposits.

New technology in place today may make most forms of cheque kiting and paper hanging a thing of the past. As new software rapidly catches illegal activity at the teller/branch level instead of waiting for the nightly runs to the back office, schemes are not only easier to detect, but may be prevented by tellers who deny customers illegal transactions before they are even started.

Part of how banks are combating cheque fraud is to offer their clients fraud protection services. Because it is impossible for banks to know every cheque that a customer writes and which may or may not be fraudulent, the onus is on the clients to make the bank aware of what cheques they write. These systems allow customers to upload their cheque files to the bank including the cheque number, the amount of money, and in some cases, the payee name. Now, when a cheque is presented for payment, the bank scrubs it against the information on file. If one of the variables does not match, then the cheque would be flagged as a potentially fraudulent item.

These services help with external fraud but they do not help if there is internal fraud. If an employee sends information to the bank with fraudulent items, then the bank would not know to deny payment. A system of dual controls should be put into place in order to not allocate all capabilities to one person.

Before the passage of the ''[[Check 21 Act|Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Services|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/check_about.htm|work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when cheques could take 3 or more days to clear, ''[[playing the float]]'' was fairly common practice in the US in otherwise-honest individuals who encountered emergencies right before payday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Less Travel for Your Checks|journal=The Ledger|date=Winter 2004–2005|url=http://www.bostonfed.org/education/ledger/ledger05/winter/winter0405.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circular and abandonment frauds are gradually being eliminated as cheques will clear in Bank B the same day they are deposited into Bank A, giving no time at all for non-existent funds to become available for withdrawal. With image-sharing technology, the funds that temporarily become available in Bank A's account are wiped out the same day.

While there may still be some room for retail kiting, security measures taken by retail chains are helping reduce such incidents. Increasingly, more chains are limiting the amount of cash back received, the number of times cash back can be offered in a week or a given period of time, and obtaining [[transactional account]] balances before offering cash back, thereby denying it to those with low balances. For example, [[Walmart]]'s policy is to determine account balances of those obtaining cash back, and some [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] locations will not offer cash back on any accounts with balances under $250, even when funds are sufficient to cover the amount on the cheque. Customers who are noted to obtain cash back frequently are also investigated by the corporation to observe patterns.

Some businesses will also use the cheque strictly as an informational device to automatically debit funds from the account, and will return the item to the customer thereafter. However, in the [[United States]] this is done through the [[ACH Network]]; though faster than traditional check clearing, contrary to popular belief the ACH Network is not instantaneous. Though this practice reduces the room for kiting (by reducing float), it does not always eliminate it.

'''Clark L. Wilson''' (August 31, 1913 – August 12, 2006 in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Virginia]]) was an American industrial psychologist who introduced the concept of 360 feedback surveys for management training and development applications. From 1970-1973 he developed his first [[360-degree feedback]] survey, the "Survey of Management Practices". It was based on a learning sequence he called the Task-Cycle-Theory. Today, 360 feedback surveys of many types are standard tools for management training and development worldwide.

==Background==
Wilson studied under psychologist [[J.P. Guilford]] as a University of Southern California graduate student after World War II. Guilford had expanded on the work by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]], pioneer in the field of psychometrics, by using factor analysis to assess management skills. Guilford’s work led Wilson to experiment with identifying important management and leadership skills through psychometrics. He eventually developed his Task Cycle assessment tools as an application of Guilford’s statistical approach.

Wilson borrowed the concept of multi-rater feedback from the field of psychological assessment, particularly as it was being applied by the [[US Army]] during World War II. Managers and leaders, he believed, could learn and improve if they knew how others perceived their skills and behaviors. He also believed that management skills can be learned, like any other skill, through a learning sequence. While Wilson started out calling this system multi-level feedback, others eventually dubbed it 360-degree feedback—the name by which it is now best known. It is also sometimes called multi-rater feedback.

===Early Developments===
He developed the Survey of Management Practices as a teaching tool for his management classes at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut) Graduate School of Business, where he was the Warner G. Bradford Proofessor of Management. He had students use the survey in their workplaces.

The feedback consisted of survey statements which were rated on a seven-point agree/disagree scale. The statements were strictly limited to observations about behaviors such as planning or communications, avoiding aspects of [[Personality psychology|personality]] such as sociability or excitability. Each individual would rate him or herself on the same survey as the supervisor, direct reports, and peers who were also providing ratings.

By the mid-1970s more companies, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Pitney Bowes]] and several utilities were using the instrument and contributing data to the norm database. With wider use and accumulated data, Wilson was able to study the reliability and validity of the instrument. He also studied performance data on feedback recipients and was able to verify a mathematical basis for the Task Cycle learning sequence. He found that when a manager or executive practiced the Task Cycle skills with balance and in sequence, a measurable increase in effectiveness could be documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.performanceprograms.com/Surveys/FAQWilsonHistory.shtm Performance Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041957/http://www.performanceprograms.com/Surveys/FAQWilsonHistory.shtm |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
The Clark Wilson Group, formed in 1973, merged with [http://www.boothco.com/ The Booth Company] in 2017. The Task Cycle® line of assessments now consists of ten off-the-shelf offerings, with dozens of customized versions in circulation.

===Research Conclusions===
Up to the time of his death, Wilson continued to develop and publish a full range of assessment tools. He published his last book in 2003 at the age of 89. ''How and Why Effective Managers Balance Their Skills'' offers conclusions based on 30 years of research. Wilson summarizes: "After over 30 years of analysis, the problem of most managers is very clear. Too many managers try to exercise control without providing the technical and teambuilding skills needed to achieve their goals". This imbalance derails individuals and undermines organizational performance, he asserted, while the presence of these skills—which can be learned—measurably improves business outcomes.

===Academic and Professional===
Clark Wilson received his A.B. from [[Stanford University]] in 1935. He joined the U.S. Navy in World War II and served in the submarine force in the Pacific theater and was awarded the [[Silver Star]] and [[Gold Star]]. He earned a Ph.D. in applied psychology from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1948. He was a Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]] and a Fellow of the [[Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychologists]].

Dr. Wilson died in August, 2006.

==Location, campus, and community==
[[File:CSU Rhodes Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rhodes Tower]]]]
[[File:Sanborn-CSU.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Adam Smith's Spinning Top #2'', sculpture by [[Jim Sanborn]] at CSU]]
CSU's main campus in [[downtown Cleveland]] is bounded on the east and west by [[Interstate 90]] and East 17th Street, respectively; and by Payne Avenue to the north and Carnegie Avenue on the south. It also has a satellite campus in [[Westlake, Ohio]] which is in the [[Greater Cleveland]] [[metropolitan area]] in [[Cuyahoga County]]. As of spring 2013, the combined student body (undergraduate and graduate students) totaled over 17,000.

===Campus expansion===
In 2006, Cleveland State University completed its state-of-the-art student Recreation Center, and a renovation of Parker Hannifan Hall for the College of Graduate Studies.

To make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus by building thousands of housing units, anchored by a new dormitory, [[Fenn Tower]], a reuse of the school's most historic building. Fenn Tower housed what was the world's longest [[Foucault pendulum]], but the pendulum was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006 and is now in the Cleveland State University archives.

The university worked with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and "collegetown" amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly along the main thoroughfare of [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]]. In 2010, Euclid Avenue was upgraded as part of the [[HealthLine|Euclid Corridor Project]] which brought [[bus rapid transit]] to the university and connected [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] in downtown Cleveland to [[University Circle]], approximately four miles to the east.&lt;ref&gt;city.http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/csu_officials_envision_large_e.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland State University's $65 million construction project, intended to transform the campus from a mostly commuter school into a residential campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David I.

Both projects were finished in 2010.

In 2011, the new Euclid Commons dorms complex, which features apartment-style living for CSU students, opened. That same year, the university's Dramatic Arts Program moved into the renovated Middough Building and [[Allen Theatre]] at [[Playhouse Square Center]] in collaboration with the [[Cleveland Play House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marvin Fong / Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/03/cleveland_state_universitys_dr.html |title=Cleveland State University's drama program is booming under director Michael Mauldin |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, CSU opened the Galleries At CSU on Euclid Avenue. Also in 2012, Cleveland State University partnered with the [[South China University of Technology]] allowing students to complete their education and receive joint degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/10/cleveland_state_university_par.html|title=Cleveland State University partners with Chinese university, which will send students to CSU|work=cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall semester of 2012, the first phase of the private Langston apartment and retail complex opened along Chester Avenue across from Rhodes Tower. In the spring semester of 2013, the former Viking Hall dormitory was torn down to make way for the university's new Center for Health Professions. This was opened in the fall of 2015. The University is partnering with [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]] or NEOMED to train future health care professionals to specifically work in urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neomed.edu/admissions/medicine/csu |title=NEOMED-CSU Partnership for Urban Health — NEOMED |publisher=Neomed.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are working on adding a new physics department onto the campus and starting to build a better physics department

===Student media===
The campus' student-run radio station, 89.3 [[WCSB (FM)|WCSB]], has a 630-[[Watt]] [[Radio transmitter|transmitter]] on top of [[Rhodes Tower]] (formerly called University Tower).  Additionally, Cleveland State is served in print by The Cauldron, an independent student newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csucauldron.com|title=The Cauldron Student Newspaper|work=The Cauldron Student Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cleveland Stater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandstater.com/ |title=The Cleveland Stater |publisher=The Cleveland Stater |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication, The Vindicator, and The Gavel which won the 2005 American Bar Association's -Student Division's first prize for the best law school newspaper in the country. There is no [[student television station]] at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center.

===Information technology===
CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) [[computer network]], an initiative of [[Case Western Reserve University]] that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network.

===Greek Organizations===
Cleveland State University is home to 4 NIC fraternities, [[Delta Sigma Phi]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], and [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]. There are 4 NPC sororities, [[Alpha Sigma Alpha]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Phi Mu]], and [[Theta Phi Alpha]] and there are 4 NPHC organizations, [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], and [[Sigma Gamma Rho]].

==Athletics==
{{Main|Cleveland State Vikings}}
When the school was still known as Fenn College, the [[sports team]]s' [[Athletic nickname|nickname]] was the [[Fenn College Foxes|Foxes]]. When the University was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU's sports teams became the "Vikings". That nickname stands to this day. The [[school colors]] are forest green and white. For many years the school mascot was the [[comic strip]] character [[Hägar the Horrible]] along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, "Vike" was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named "Magnus" was introduced in August 2007.

Cleveland State fields [[Varsity team|varsity]] teams in seventeen sports. Most of the teams compete in the [[Horizon League]]. The [[Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball|men's basketball team]] was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|tournament]], it upset heavily favored 3-seed [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]] and [[Saint Joseph's University|St. Joseph's]] before being beaten by [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] by one point, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4th seeded [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons|Wake Forest]] before falling to the [[Arizona Wildcats|University of Arizona]] in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509997,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Cleveland State Shocks Wake Forest | date=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also fields a wrestling team that competes in the [[Eastern Wrestling League]].

===Fielding a football team===
On October 14, 2008 CSU President Michael Schwartz stated "he wants a blue ribbon panel to give him a recommendation on the [[College football|football]] team before July 1, 2009, when he is scheduled to retire. He also said the program will have to be structured to pay for itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/10/cleveland_state_university_con.html] Cleveland State considers a new name and a new football team.  Accessed October 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a football team became an official item on the student government election ballot. Although over two-thirds of the voters favored establishment of a football team over half of them were not willing to pay a fee for Division I non-scholarship football in addition to any potential future tuition increases that may be instituted by the University.&lt;ref name="Board of elections"&gt;[http://www.csuohio.edu/studentlife/boardofelections/index.html Question 1: Are you interested in having Cleveland State University add a Division I non-scholarship football team (e.g. University of Dayton, Butler University) to its intercollegiate athletic program? 1.

===Factory===
The Colchester Rubber Company factory was located at the intersection of Lebanon Avenue and Mill Street in the factory buildings which previously belonged to the Hayward Rubber Company which was in operation from 1847 to 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Colchester Historical Society Collections&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hayward Rubber Company was founded by [[Nathaniel Hayward]], who co-invented [[vulcanised rubber]] with [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicbuildingsct.com/?cat=217 |title=Historic Buildings of Connecticut » Colchester |publisher=Historicbuildingsct.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the original Colchester Rubber Company factory ruins can still be seen at the site today.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Papers in the Historical Archives of Colchester Library collection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Jablonowski |url=http://www.naugatuckhistory.com/hi-cradle_of_the_rubber_industry.htm |title=CT: Cradle of the Rubber Industry - Naugatuck Historical Society |publisher=Naugatuckhistory.com |date=1904-06-01 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of Colchester |publisher=William Raveis Real Estate. |url=http://www.nutmeghollowofcolchester.com/common/content.asp?PAGE=336 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714212616/http://www.nutmeghollowofcolchester.com/common/content.asp?PAGE=336 |archivedate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the workers in the factory originally came from Ireland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standrewofcolchester.org/brief_history.html |title=St. Andrew Church History |publisher=StAndrewOfColchester.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding Owners===
The Colchester Rubber Company was founded by George Watkinson who was born 1838.  Prior to founding Colchester Rubber Company, George Watkinson was a manager at the Candee Rubber Company.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Colchester Rubber Company factory, or Rubber Works, at Colchester were co-managed by George Watkinson and his son Irving Watkinson.  Irving Watkinson was a busy man, as he also kept the Colchester town weather station and was the proverbial man about town raising show dogs and horses while selling bicycles for the Columbia Brand and being the Captain of the town’s baseball team.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Products===
[[File:Colchester Rubber Company advert shoes.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Image of the Colchester Rubber Company Factory catalogue pages from around 1890|Colchester Rubber Company catalogue pages from around 1890]]
The Colchester Rubber Company manufactured high end rubber footwear for men, women and children.  Their speciality products were working boots for cold and wet weather, rain boots and galoshes.  To complement these products, during the short summer season of April to July, they also made and sold canvas and rubber shoes under the classification of “Tennis” shoes.  The somewhat misleadingly named “Tennis” shoe range included shoes for walking, baseball, bicycle, tennis and yachting.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Colchester Rubber Co. advertising materials, catalogues and relics 1888-1893&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colchester Rubber Company’s products were rated high end quality and considered by some as #1 in their field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tennis Shoes – Specifics and buying Tips | publisher=EndGame Reviews| url=http://endgamereviews.com/?p=88 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710191753/http://endgamereviews.com/?p=88 |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “Tennis” shoes were the promenade shoe of choice at Newport, Rhode Island during the Gilded Age.  The products were also exported worldwide and during the late 1880s and early 1890s were seen on the beaches and board-walks in Europe’s many resorts.

In 1892 Colchester Rubber Company displayed their footwear at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World’s Fair]] and Exposition.

===Company Takeover===
During 1892, Colchester Rubber Company was acquired by The United States Rubber Company as part of their intention to form a monopoly and control the rubber industry in the United States of America by buying a majority of the rubber companies which were in operation at that time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Logan, Kevin J. (November 10, 2009). [http://www.uri.edu/library/special_collections/registers/manuscripts/msg78.xml "Guide to the Colt Family Papers 1793-1961"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004221459/http://www.uri.edu/library/special_collections/registers/manuscripts/msg78.xml |date=October 4, 2012 }} (XML). University of Rhode Island Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factory Closure===
During the 1893 Depression, the decision was made by The United States Rubber Company to close the factory in Colchester and discontinue the Colchester Rubber Co. brand.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

This decision was, in part, based on the fact that the town of Colchester was located on what was considered a poor water source for manufacturing and was far from seaports and land transportation hubs.  The decision to close the factory was kept secret from the employees and the people of the town of Colchester.  George Watkinson was promoted to a Vice President position with The United States Rubber Company in the spring of 1983 and left the town of Colchester on a guise of going on vacation.  He was replaced in Colchester by Joseph Banigan who oversaw the last of the production from the factory in Colchester as well as the factory closure.   During the Christmas holiday in 1893 the factory employees and the people of the town of Colchester were told that the company was going to re-tool the factory and it would be opened after New Year.  Instead of this happening, all the machinery was removed from the factory in Colchester and shipped to The United States Rubber Company’s holdings at Providence, Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  A Colchester Advocate newspaper article in early 1894, editorialized, asked when was the factory was going to re-open.&lt;ref&gt;Colchester Advocate Newspapers 1888-1894&lt;/ref&gt;  When it became clear that the factory was going to stay closed, the town collapsed half of the population leaving and a majority of the businesses in the town subsequently closing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In around 1895, George Watkinson left The United States Rubber Company and opened The Watkinson Rubber Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which, for a period of time was allowed to compete with The United States Rubber Company.  The Watkinson Rubber Company factory remained open until around 1903 and was subsequently acquired by U.S. Rubber.  George Watkinson is believed to have died around that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/18/102485564.pdf New York Times Article]. NYTimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Records show that Irving Watkinson stayed in the area, with him living in Norwich, Connecticut in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/connecticutmotor1920stat/connecticutmotor1920stat_djvu.txt "Connecticut Motor Vehicle Register 1920"]. Motor Vehicle Department, Hartford, Connecticut. Archived at archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th Century===
During the 20th century, The United States Rubber Company used the Colchester Rubber Company’s logo to co-brand seconds products, destroying the original brand by over-stamping.  This type of branding was done by United States Rubber Company and was not related in any way to the original Colchester Rubber Co. brand products of the 1800s.

As of October 2010 a pair of co-branded seconds, bearing both Keds and Colchester Rubber Co. logos, were on display at the Basketball Hall of Fame at Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoopedia.nba.com |title=Main Page - Hoopedia |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820052645/http://hoopedia.nba.com/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball Sneakers==
[[File:Colchester Rubber Company ball logo image.jpg|thumb|alt=Image of the Colchester Rubber Company ball logo|Colchester Rubber Company ball logo]]
The brand known for being the world’s first Sneaker brand and inventing the “World’s First Basketball Sneakers”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sneakerhead, author@sneakerhead.com |url=http://www.sneakerhead.com/shoe-history-p4.html |title=History of Shoes |publisher=Sneakerhead.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112120840/http://www.sneakerhead.com/shoe-history-p4.html |archivedate=2011-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; circa 1892.

The town of Colchester was a mere 50&amp;nbsp;miles from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] where basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbasketball.htm Basketball]. inventors.about.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Given his interest in sport, it is believed that Irving Watkinson was a basketball player early in the life of the sport.  Whatever his link with the sport and Dr. Naismith, it is considered that Irving Watkinson designed a shoe specifically for use playing basketball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://col.intuitwebsites.com/History.html History]. IntuitWebsites.com.&lt;/ref&gt; A surviving pair of basketball shoes was discovered in December 2004 at an estate sale in Vista, California. The sale was from a Victorian estate in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafeterra.info/2009/07/worlds-first-basketball-sneakers.html World's First Basketball Sneakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190359/http://www.cafeterra.info/2009/07/worlds-first-basketball-sneakers.html |date=2011-07-21 }}. CafeTerra.info. July  2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known that Dr. James Naismith relocated to Denver in 1895 to attend Gross Medical College&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=James_Naismith James Naismith]. Hoopedia.NBA.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, these original Colchester Rubber Company basketball sneakers are believed to be a prototype sample made for Dr. James Naismith.

The basketball shoes which Irving Watkinson created were canvas high top shoes having a rubber sole which featured a turkey feather design to aids traction and jumping, a rubber toe guard cap and a ball logo at the ankle ball which provides protection.  The design of these basketball shoes is the classic American image of a sneaker and the essence of Irving Watkinson’s design can be seen in the styles and brands which followed through the years including, for example, the Converse All-Star first produced in 1917.

A low quarter utility rubber and canvas shoe, that was illustrated and feature in an 1890s Colchester Rubber Company’s catalogue, appears to have been used as the basis for, and modified to create, these surviving basketball sneakers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  belief is supported by the fact that the sample basketball sneakers do not have matching stock serial numbers and the canvas panels are marked size 9 while the soles are marked size 12.  It is believed that the Colchester Rubber Company may have displayed this style of basketball sneakers at the 1892 Chicago World’s Fair.

==Influence==
The Colchester Rubber Co. brand is also the predecessor of the footwear brands [[Keds]], created in 1916, and Pro-Keds, created in 1949 by the [[United States Rubber Company]] which acquired the Colchester Rubber Company in 1892.&lt;ref name="Basketball Hall of Fame"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ColchesterRubberCo.com |title=intor |publisher=Colchesterrubberco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas Durst''' (born December 19, 1944) is an American [[real estate]] investor and developer.

==Early life and education==
Durst was born in [[New York City]] in 1944&lt;ref name=DurstOrgDouglas&gt;[http://www.durst.org/about/executives/douglas-durst Durst Organization website - About Us: Douglas Durst] retrieved June 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, the son of Bernice (née Herstein) and [[Seymour Durst]]. He is the younger brother of [[Robert Durst]].

Durst's paternal grandfather, [[Joseph Durst]], a penniless immigrant tailor from [[Austria Hungary]], eventually became a very successful real estate manager and developer founding the [[Durst Organization]] in 1915. His father, Seymour, became head of the family business in 1974 upon Joseph's death. Douglas's mother died in a fall when he was a child.&lt;ref name=WSJHelm&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704482704576072202098963980 Wall Street Journal: "Taking the Helm to Change City Landscape" by Dana Rubinstein] December 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas graduated from the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston School]] in 1962 and the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in 1966. He attended [[New York University]]'s Urban Studies program for two years and then joined the family business then run by his father and two uncles, Roy and David.&lt;ref name=DurstOrgDouglas/&gt;

==Career==
Douglas took over the Durst Organization in 1992 upon his father's retirement. He presided over the development of several major buildings in New York City:
*In 1999, the 48-story [[4 Times Square]];&lt;ref name=DurstOrgTimeline&gt;[http://www.durst.org/about/timeline.php The Durst Organization: Timeline], durst.org; retrieved July 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, the 38-story Helena at 601 West 57th Street;&lt;ref name=DurstOrgTimeline/&gt;
*In 2007, the 57-story Epic on 125 West 31st Street;&lt;ref name=DurstOrgTimeline/&gt;
*In 2008, the 58-story [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park]];&lt;ref name=DurstOrgTimeline/&gt;

Durst is a director of the Real Estate Board of New York.&lt;ref name=DurstOrgDouglas/&gt; Durst is known for emphasizing density and sustainability in his projects.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/garden/06qna.html?_r=1&amp; "A Danish Architect Brings His Mountain-Making Ideas to New York"], nytimes.com, January 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New School University Center===
Located on 14th Street and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, the [[New School]] university center was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] and developed by the Durst Organization.  The building is designed to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Gold]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Karissa Rosenfield, [http://www.archdaily.com/316156/in-progress-the-new-school-university-center-som "In Progress: The New School University Center/SOM"], ArchDaily.com, January 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===One World Trade Center development===
{{Main|One World Trade Center#Design evolution|l1=Design evolution of One World Trade Center}}
In 2010, the Durst Organization bid on and won the right to invest $100 million in the [[One World Trade Center]] development becoming a co-developer with the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].&lt;ref name= NYT1&gt;David W. Dunlap,[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/1-world-trade-center-is-a-growing-presence-and-a-changed-one "1 World Trade Center Is a Growing Presence, and a Changed One"], nytimes.com, June 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization specifies that the Durst Organization will receive a $15 million fee and a percentage of “base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project.” The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of savings up to $24 million and stepping down thereafter (to 50 percent, 25 percent and 15 percent) as the savings increased. Durst had offered to work for a fixed $35 million fee, but the Port chose the incentive fee arrangement. Significant changes to the building have been made since his joining of the project,&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

===Bank of America Tower – One Bryant Park===
In May 2010, Douglas Durst, former Vice President [[Al Gore]], and New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] officially opened the [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower]]. It was the first high-rise commercial tower to receive [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] platinum rating in the [[United States]]. The 55 story, 2.1 million square foot building  located on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street was designed by [[Cookfox|Cookfox Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gerrity, [http://www.worldpropertychannel.com/us-markets/commercial-real-estate-1/real-estate-news-bank-of-america-tower-at-one-bryant-park-al-gore-michael-bloomberg-leed-building-the-durst-organization-bank-of-america-2583.php "Al Gore, Michael Bloomberg Open Manhattan's Bank of America Tower"], worldpropertychannel.com, May 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 a group of banks provided [[Bank of America]] and Durst Organization $1.28 Billion to refinance the building. Bank of America provided half of the loan. The other parts came from [[New York Mellon Corp]]., [[Wells Fargo]], Westdeutsche Immobilien Bank, and [[Helaba Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Goldman, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.yfs733Ppvk "Bank of America, Durst Get $1.28 Billion to Refinance NYC Tower"], Bloomberg.com, June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West 57===
In the early 2000s, architect [[Bjarke Ingels]] met Durst when he was in [[Copenhagen]] with his wife, Susanne, a native of [[Denmark]]. He visited Ingels' studio in February 2010.&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;Robbie Whelan,[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577543213184822638 "New Face of Design"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 22, 2012; retrieved October 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2010, Durst Fetner Residential commissioned [[Bjarke Ingels Group]] (BIG) to bring a new residential typology to Manhattan. In 2011, BIG opened an office in New York to supervise W57's development and construction.&lt;ref name=architravel&gt;[http://www.architravel.com/architravel/papernews/west-57th-big-bjarke-ingels-group "West 57th by BIG - Bjarke Ingels Group"], ArchiTravel.com,   September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 2016, [[West 57]] is a 709-unit, four sided, pyramid shaped tower of apartments on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|West Fifty-seventh Street]].&lt;ref name=Whelan/&gt;&lt;ref name="yimby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yimbynews.com/2016/07/landmark-theatres-to-operate-multiplex-at-709-unit-via-57-west-625-west-57th-street-hells-kitchen.html|title=Landmark Theatres To Operate Multiplex At 709-Unit VIA 57 WEST, 625 West 57th Street, Hell’s Kitchen|last=Wilson|first=Reid|date=12 July 2016|website=www.yimbynews.com|dead-url=|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas is a director of [[The New School]], [[The Trust for Public Land]], [[Project for Public Spaces]], and the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]]. He is a trustee of the Old York Foundation, which was established by his father, to help educate people about the history and ongoing problems of New York City.&lt;ref name=DurstOrgDouglas /&gt; Durst is also a prominent environmentalist and operates one of the largest organic farms in New York State.&lt;ref name=DurstOrgDouglas/&gt;

===McEnroe Farm===
In 1987, Durst purchased a piece of land from Ray McEnroe, the owner of an organic farm in [[Dutchess County, New York]], some 100 miles north of Manhattan. He purchased the land to dispose of his horses' manure in an environmentally friendly way.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Bradshaw, [http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20090912/BUSINESS/111120004/McEnroe-Farm-wins-honor "McEnroe farm wins honors"], poughkeepsiejournal.com, September 12, 2009; accessed December 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Durst later partnered with McEnroe, and now the farm is 500 acres, and among the top 25% of organic farms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Citrano, [https://www.forbes.com/2004/09/16/cx_vc_0916organic.html "The Millionaire's Tomatoes"], forbes.com; accessed December 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Douglas Durst suffered a severe leg injury in 1972 when a coal-fired water heater exploded in a [[Newfoundland]] house where he was then living with his wife and young family. “I should’ve died there,” Durst would later tell ''The New York Times''. “It changed my whole outlook on life. I had to get more serious about what I was doing", he said, moving back to the family real estate business following months of recuperation. After suffering more than four decades of pain, part of Durst's lower right leg was amputated in 2015. He walks today with the help of a prosthesis.&lt;ref name=Bagli11Dec/&gt;

===Robert Durst===
In 2001, his estranged brother [[Robert Durst]] was charged with murdering a neighbor and dismembering his body in [[Galveston, Texas]]. Pleading self-defense, he was acquitted of the murder charge.&lt;ref name=WSJHelm /&gt; Douglas was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 2015, and was quoted as saying about Robert: "There's no doubt in my mind that if he had the opportunity to kill me, he would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/series-on-troubled-scion-of-durst-real-estate-family-has-critic-his-brother.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|first=Jim|last=Dwyer|title=Douglas Durst, in Rare Move, Speaks About Robert Durst Ahead of HBO Documentary|date=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Durst told ''The New York Times'' in December 2015 that he believed, until 2001, in his brother's innocence regarding Kathleen McCormack Durst's "disappearance" in 1982. Contrary to his brother's assertions to the documentary filmmakers of ''[[The Jinx (miniseries)|The Jinx]]'', he was never privy to his father's meetings with a lawyer and private detective tasked with investigating Kathleen's disappearance.&lt;ref name=Bagli11Dec/&gt; "I’m going to be a witness in Los Angeles" for the prosecution of his brother for the murder of [[Susan Berman]], whom investigators believe Durst murdered because she knew details of Robert's role in his wife Kathleen's death, "so they don’t want me to talk too much about anything after 2001", Douglas Durst said.&lt;ref name=Bagli11Dec&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/nyregion/durst-organization-new-york-real-estate.html|title=The Durst Dynasty’s Rise, a Scion’s Descent|first=Charles V.|last=Bagli|date=December 11, 2015|accessdate=December 11, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dyal–Upchurch Building''' (also known as the '''Dyal–Upchurch Investment Company Building''') is a six-story, 43,747-square-foot&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt; historic building in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]. It is located at 4 East Bay Street, and was designed by [[architect]] [[Henry John Klutho]]. On April 17, 1980, it was added to the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[Image:DyalUpchurchJAX.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Dyal–Upchurch building in early 1900s.]]
Following Jacksonville's [[Great Fire of 1901]], the building was the first multi-story structure built in the barren downtown area and the first design by Klutho in Jacksonville.&lt;ref name="DYAL"&gt;{{cite news | title=Dyal–Upchurch – then and now | last=Penland | first=Dolly | url=http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2007/04/02/tidbits4.html | publisher=''[[Jacksonville Business Journal]]'' | date=March 30, 2007 | accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAH&gt;{{cite web | last=Wood | first=Wayne | url=http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-27.htm | title=Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage, Dyal–Upchurch Building | accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began on a five-story building, but demand for office space spurred the addition of a sixth floor.&lt;ref name=JAH /&gt; As the name states, Dyal–Upchurch was a Georgia investment company that moved to Jacksonville after the fire. Frank Upchurch had interests in turpentine and lumber, while Benjamin Dyal owned a sawmill. The company ceased business in Jacksonville after 1924.&lt;ref name=DYAL /&gt;

The ''Atlantic National Bank'' was founded shortly after the Dyal–Upchurch building opened in May, 1902 and was located on the first floor until their own building was constructed in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4JQV | publisher=Waymarking.com | title=Dyal–Upchurch Building}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tenants have included an office of the [[National Weather Service]], a regional office for the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, law offices and a financial advice company.

When the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it became eligible to use rehabilitation tax credits when restoration work was performed in 1981, the first building in Jacksonville to do so.&lt;ref name=JAH /&gt;

The [[Husk Jennings]] advertising company bought the building in 1998 for $1.6 million and spent $600,000 to renovate the top floor, where the firm relocated.&lt;ref name="FTU"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hilboldt | first=Brandy | url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021701/dsd_husk.html | publisher=''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' | date=February 17, 2001 | accessdate=2009-12-14 | title=Something old, something new; Renovation revitalizes interior of historic downtown building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2002, the city established the ''Downtown Historic Preservation and Revitalization Trust Fund'' with $7 million to assist companies that purchase and restore old buildings. The fund could pay up to half the cost of exterior work and one-fifth of interior work with a $1 million cap per building. That was sufficient incentive for Husk Jennings to begin a $1.72 million restoration of the rest of the building, for which the city kicked in almost $340,000.
&lt;ref name=FUND&gt;{{cite news | last=Galnor | first=Matt | url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122602/met_11320294.shtml | publisher=''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' | date=December 26, 2002 | accessdate=2009-12-14 | title=Dyal–Upchurch building first to tap trust fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron Kuhn, a commercial developer from [[Orlando, Florida]], purchased the building in December, 2005 for $4.5 million, but defaulted on the mortgage when his company declared bankruptcy in 2008. The Dyal–Upchurch building was repossessed by The Jacksonville Bank in January, and sold on February 28, 2009 for $3.73 million to A. Duda &amp; Sons of [[Oviedo, Florida]].&lt;ref name=JBJ&gt;{{cite news | last=Conte | first=Christian | url=http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2009/03/02/daily48.html | publisher=''[[Jacksonville Business Journal]]'' | date=March 13, 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-14 | title=Dyal–Upchurch building sold for $3.7m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Ellis (Ed) Tozer''' (born 1943) is a British retired management and IT consultant and [[SF author]],&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Ed-Tozer/e/B003E0ZUGW Ed Tozer] at amazon.com. Accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly known for his early work on business information systems in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Andriole, Stephen J. "The collaborate/integrate business technology strategy." Communications of the ACM 49.5 (2006): 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peña-Mora | first1 = Feniosky | last2 = Tanaka | first2 = Shunsuke | year = 2002 | title = Information technology planning framework for Japanese general contractors | url = | journal = Journal of Management in Engineering | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 138–149 | doi=10.1061/(asce)0742-597x(2002)18:3(138)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Tozer started his career in the manufacturing and mining industry.&lt;ref name="T 86"&gt;Tozer (1986); {{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024630186902670 | doi=10.1016/0024-6301(86)90267-0 | volume=19 | title=Developing strategies for management information systems | journal=Long Range Planning | pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he became junior systems analyst at the management consultancy firm Scicon in London; a subsidiary of British Petroleum, originally known as Scientific Control Systems, chaired by Sir [[Maurice Kendall]]. After spells with other consulting firms, he worked with [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]]'s European operation from 1982 to 1984.

In 1984 he founded Edwin E. Tozer Limited, specialized in data management study, which he dissolved after his retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.duedil.com/company/01791018/edwin-e-tozer-limited Edwin E. Tozer Limited]," at duedil.com. Accessed 23-03-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he published his first book, entitled "Application Development Tools." in 1988 his second book, "Planning for effective business Information systems," and in 1996 his third book, entitled "Strategic Is/It Planning."

Since his retirement in the new millennium he has been writing SF literature.&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"/&gt;

== Work ==
In the 1970s Tozer became involved in the [[CODASYL]] development of database languages, and wrote his first articles on databases and systems analysis and design&lt;ref name="DBLP"&gt;{{DBLP |name=E. E. Tozer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in "effective application of Information Technology to business and administrative problems."&lt;ref name="T 86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T 75"&gt;Tozer (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Database Systems Analysis and Design,'' 1976 ===
In the 1976 article "Database Systems Analysis and Design," Tozer made a comparison between the database field and the evolving field of the Programming technology. He argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Developments in the database field have tended to emphasise programming technology, with a dearth of accompanying progress in systems analysis and design methods. This paper puts forward an overall view of system design which is intended to act as a constraining framework. It is based upon a pragmatic approach and is presented in a form which could be (and is being) used on large scale implementation projects.&lt;ref name="T 76"&gt;Tozer (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Orderly analysis and design procedures are encouraged. The taking of premature design decisions is discouraged, especially through the recognition of three distinct views of data: conceptual, implementation and storage, and through recognition of distinctions between design of each of these, specification of mappings between them, and design of programs and run sequences. It is envisaged that specific procedures developed elsewhere (see references) could be incorporated into the methodology described here.&lt;ref name="T 76"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Developing strategies for management information systems,'' 1986 ===
{{see also|History of business architecture}}
In the 1989 article "Developing strategies for management information systems," Tozer presented a model for developing information systems. Tozer's approach was based on his experience of "planning projects in a variety of industries, including wholesale and retail banking, consumer credit, chemicals, Multinational manufacturing and distribution and the oil industry."&lt;ref&gt;Tozer (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Tozer presented a model, which consisted of the following four phases:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* ''Phase 1:'' Determine business information needs: This results from the analysis of a series of senior management interviews which are conducted according to a predefined format. The analysis goes through the stages of functional objectives, critical success factors, control information and other quantitative means for determining the successful achievement of critical success factors, leading to a definition of specific information needs.
* ''Phase 2:'' Development of conceptual architecture for systems and data: This phase produces clear architecture statements for application systems and associated conceptual database... 
* ''Phase 3:'' Determine key priorities and system groupings...
* ''Phase 4:'' Migration plane. The final sets of deliverables are the plans for achieving the business and technical systems as outlined in these architectures...&lt;ref name="FA 1990"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key features of this model, according to Azad (1990) were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [ït] starts with business planning process dealing with logical links and dependencies on corporate and divisional plans.
#Is pragmatic and hence practical.
#Combines formality and business expediency.
#Takes account of trends in business and information planning.
#Encourages the active use of up to date approach in the development if information systems utilising the fourth generation language by the user.
#Follows through into the development of a complete, practical, business orientated information system dealing with what must be done, how long it takes, and how much it is going to cost.
#Is open with regard to extension and enhancement.
#Has been used successfully in major corporations, continues to be used and hence is continuing to develop further.&lt;ref name="FA 1990"&gt;Farsheed Azad. "MSc. Information Engineering: An investigation on models and methodologies for developing an I.S. Stratey," June 1990. at pchelpline.com, uploaded 2012/07. Accessed 23-03-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this 1986 paper Tozer was one of the first to propose the concept of [[business architecture]] in the field of business information systems planning.

=== ''Planning for effective business Information systems,'' 1988 ===
In his 1988 ''Planning for effective business Information systems,'' Tozer developed a particular view on [[Enterprise Data Planning]], that dealt with the complexities of extracting key business needs from senior management and then defining relevant architectural visions for the specific enterprise.

In the early 1980s [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] had been one of the pathfinders in data planning methodologies. He was one of the first to identify data as being an enterprise wide asset that required management, and had developed a series of tools and methods to support that process.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[[James Martin (author)|James Martin]]. ''Viewdata and the information society.'' 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most of the large consulting firms developed their own methods to address the same basic issue. Frequently, their approaches were incorporated into their own branded system development methodologies that encompassed the complete systems development life-cycle.

=== ''Strategic IS/IT Planning,'' 1996 ===
Tozer's "Strategic IS/IT Planning", was published in 1996 by Butterworth Heinemann as part of the Datamation Professional Series. The book mentioned to offer: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Supports a range of business planning techniques such as Portfolio Management and Value Chain Analysis. 
* Helps to ensure accurate and continuing aligning of IS/IT strategy with business goals and intentions. 
* Delivers a complete IS/IT plan, integrated with the business planning process, with effective provision for implementation and continuing maintenance. 
* Incorporates the latest advances in information technology, including Open Systems and Client/Server.&lt;ref name="T 1998"&gt;Tozer (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book was the most comprehensive outline of Tozer's approaches, though it now appears very dated; for example because it didn't even mention the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="T 1998"/&gt;

=== ''Morphosis,'' 2010 ===
In his 2010 [[science fiction]] novel "Morphosis," Tozer has been "speculating that mankind as an evolving species may still be in an early, vulnerable, fledgling state, as much at risk from itself as from environmental factors and competition from other species... [and] sometimes wonders whether it may be necessary - albeit difficult - for us as a species to shed some of the attributes and ingrained reflexes such as our tendency to violent conflict which we developed during our evolutionary struggle for survival so far before we can hope to reach our destiny as a mature species on the wider stage."&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"/&gt;

'''Consulting''' by [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty members]] is the use of [[scholarly]] expertise for the benefit of organizations outside the scholarly community through [[friendship]], [[volunteering]] or in return for some sort of compensation.

[[Universities]] have widely varying [[policies]] on faculty consulting, generally limiting the proportion of a faculty member's time, which may be spent on consulting, and instituting rules to avoid [[conflicts of interest]].

Consulting is distinguished from activities, which are scholarly or [[creativity|creative]], from [[public service]], and from outside activities which are unrelated to the area of scholarly expertise.  For instance, a professor of [[history]] who designs [[sailboats]] on the side is not considered to be consulting, although a professor of [[engineering]] might be.

'''Felix Mandl''' (born December 16, 1898, date of death unknown) was a [[Croatia]]n businessman and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Springer|first=Zvonko|coauthors=|title=1964 - 1967 British Portland Cement CO.

==Early life, background and education==
Mandl was born in [[Wien]] as the fourth child of a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|author1=S. Ciboci|author2=I. Rimac|coauthors=|title=Židov koji je svima bio neprijatelj|trans-title=Jew who was an enemy to everyone|pages=|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=2008-01-15|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/zidov-koji-je-svima-bio-neprijatelj/3286382/|accessdate=2018-01-22|quote= Felix Mandl, imućni Židov i vlasnik cementare u Podsusedu.("Felix Mandl, wealthy Jew and owner of the cement plant in Podsused.")|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied agriculture and philosophy in [[Göttingen]] at the [[University of Göttingen]].

==Career==
Mandl's grandfather founded a cement plant in 1867, which had a branch plant in [[Podsused – Vrapče|Podsused]], district of [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. Later that plant was turned from craft into a corporation with headquarters in [[Zurich]]. Mandl was supposed to move to Zurich, but with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power, he changed his mind.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; Plant in Podsused was named ''"Croatia"''.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

During the [[World War II]] he moved to Zagreb from where he guided the plant in Podsused. Soon he became a victim of political regimes. When the [[Ustaše|Ustashe]] came to power in Croatia, they began to threaten him with murder because he was a Jew. His plant was taken away from him by [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]] regime. Mandl ended up in jail due to listening the [[BBC radio]] program, which was banned at the time.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; He was also arrested by the [[Gestapo]], but was released after five days due to "economic reasons", while other prisoners that were with Mandl in detention were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; After the war Mandl was tried by the communist regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] for alleged collaboration with the fascist government, which was never proven. He was sentenced to ten years of forced labor. Mandl was taken to [[Lepoglava prison]], from which he was released after two years when it was discovered that during the war he helped a [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] fighters.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

In the [[nationalization]] by the communist regime, Mandl was left without any factory, except the one in Podsused, which was later renamed to ''"Sloboda"'', but was soon afterwards destroyed.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

In Kenya in 1951 Mandl founded [[Bamburi Cement]], one of largest cement companies in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kendir.com/bamburi-cement.html|title=Kenya Business Directory|publisher=|work=www.kendir.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107051355/http://www.kendir.com/bamburi-cement.html|archivedate=2010-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mandl was married to Ana Bing from 1931. During World War II he had sent his wife to [[Budapest]], out of a fear that Zagreb was no longer safe for her. Mandl's wife returned to Zagreb after a month, although the threat still existed. While in prison in Lepoglava, Mandl had regularly visits from his wife. On December 5, 1950 Mandl and his wife emigrated to [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

Mandl wrote the book ''"Usprkos svemu ostaju sjećanja (In spite of all the memories remain)"'', in which he described his life.

Recommendation '''G.9963''' is a [[home networking]] standard under development at [[ITU-T|the International Telecommunication Union standards sector, the ITU-T]].

It was begun in 2010 by [[ITU-T]] to add [[MIMO|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (known as MIMO) capabilities to the [[G.hn]] standard originally defined in Recommendation G.9960. The standard is also known as "G.hn-mimo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = G.9963 (ex G.hn-MIMO) |work= ITU-T Work Programme |url= http://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=7726  |accessdate= July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Charles Gatty''' (5 January 1903 – 30 August 1957) was an Australian navigator and aviation pioneer.  [[Charles Lindbergh]] called Gatty the "Prince of Navigators".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/aviation_history/3029141.html Harold Gatty: Aerial Navigation Expert]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Gatty served as navigator, along with pilot [[Wiley Post]], on the flight which set the record for [[Circumnavigation#Notable aerial circumnavigations|aerial circumnavigation]] of the world, flying a distance of 15,747 miles (24,903&amp;nbsp;km) in a [[Lockheed Vega]] named the ''Winnie Mae'', in 8 days, 15 hours and 51 minutes.

==Early career==
Gatty was born on 5 January 1903 in [[Campbell Town, Tasmania]].

He began his career as a [[navigator]] in 1917, at age 14, when he was appointed a [[midshipman]] at the [[Royal Australian Naval College]].  After World War I, he became an apprentice on a steamship in the Australian [[merchant navy]], where he learned [[constellation]]s while standing night watch. He became an expert in [[celestial navigation]] and served on many ships, some sailing between Australia and [[California]]. After the Navy, he worked in [[Sydney Harbour]] provisioning vessels anchored there. In 1927 he relocated to California.

Gatty opened a navigation school, teaching marine navigation to [[yachtsmen]].  In 1928, his attention turned to [[air navigation]].

==Aeronautical navigator==
In 1929, Gatty navigated a [[Lockheed Vega]] on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City for Nevada Airlines, in an effort to demonstrate the feasibility of coast-to-coast passenger service.  The flight made four stops and took 19 hours and 53 minutes, which set the [[transcontinental airspeed record]] for a commercial airliner.

In 1930, Gatty prepared a coast-to-coast route and navigation charts for [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he had also taught as a student. Anne Lindbergh served as navigator with her husband [[Charles Lindbergh|Charles]] on a record-setting cross-country flight of 14 hours and 45 minutes.

The next year, [[Wiley Post]] asked Gatty to accompany him on an effort to break the world record for circumnavigating the earth, which was previously set at 21 days by the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']] airship.  Gatty accepted, hoping to demonstrate the effectiveness of his navigation methods.  The journey began on 23 June 1931 at [[Roosevelt Field]] in New York and followed a 15,000-mile course across Europe, Russia, and Siberia, due to the lack of suitable airfields nearer the equator.  Post and Gatty crossed the Atlantic in a record time of 16 hours and 17 minutes and continued to [[Berlin]], Moscow, and [[Khabarovsk]], then crossed the Bering Sea, landing on the beach near [[Solomon, Alaska]], then to [[Edmonton, Alberta]], arriving finally back at Roosevelt Field after 8 days, 15 hours, and 51 minutes.  The pair received a tickertape parade in New York City.

Air navigation in Gatty's time used [[dead reckoning#Air navigation|dead reckoning]]. When setting out for a destination the [[course (navigation)#Aircraft heading|aircraft heading]] is taken with respect to a [[compass]]. Motion over the earth is determined by the [[wind triangle]]. Heading must therefore be compensated for wind speed as well as [[Heading indicator#Variations|drift rate]]. 
In 1931 [[Popular Mechanics]] published an article featuring Gatty's method for computing the wind drift experienced by an aircraft:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA353 Into the East and Out of the West, Around the World: What Aviation Needs] [[Popular Mechanics]] (September 1931) pp 353–5, link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Gatty's invention consists of an endless film cut across by fine parallel lines. This strip of film moves at a speed synchronous with that of the plane over the earth. The navigator looks through a periscope and makes his observations of the ground. He found the device quite satisfactory, but intends to define it further.

The article also lauds the [[artificial horizon]] and [[turn and bank indicator]] that Post and Gatty used, which was developed by [[Lawrence Sperry]] and manufactured by the [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]].

A year after the circumnavigation with Wiley Post, the US Congress passed a bill allowing civilians to receive the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].  [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] presented the medals to Gatty and Post at the White House on August 18, 1932.  Gatty was offered American citizenship and the newly created position of Senior Aerial Navigation Engineer for the US Army Air Corps.  Gatty expressed his wish to remain associated with Australia and Congress passed a bill allowing foreign citizens to hold that post.

In 1934, Gatty formed the South Seas Commercial Company with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]], with the plan to deliver air service to the islands of the South Pacific.  However, the company was soon sold to [[Pan Am]] who brought Gatty into the company to organise flight routes in that region.

==World War II==
During the Second World War, Gatty was given the honorary rank of group captain in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and worked for the [[US Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) in the South Pacific.  He was later appointed director of Air Transport for the Allied forces, based in Australia, under General [[Douglas MacArthur]].  Gatty moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1943 where he worked on a navigational supplement to a [[survival kit]] for Air Force personnel flying over the Pacific in the event they should become [[castaway]]s.

Gatty produced ''The Raft Book: Lore of the Sea and Sky'' to fill the need:&lt;ref&gt;John R. Stilgoe (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KvB6NPbSByAC&amp;pg=PA212 Lifeboat], pages 211,2 , [[University of Virginia Press]], lk from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia Blakely, "Be Your Own Navigator" [https://blog.library.si.edu/2016/02/be-your-own-navigator/],  (Feb. 22, 2016),  Smithsonian Libraries Unbound&lt;/ref&gt;
: Supplemented by a foldout table for navigation computations, folded paper scales for measuring distances, and a unique worldwide chart, ''The Raft Book'' demonstrates the usefulness of the [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian star-based passage-making technique]]. 
: [Polynesians] viewed the stars as moving bands of light, and knew all of the stars of each band which passed over the islands they were interested in.
: Their method of navigation by these heavenly beacons was to sail toward the star which they knew was over their destination at that particular time.
: Gatty found the lore of birds especially useful for castaways.

==Later career==
After World War II, Gatty relocated to [[Fiji]] with his Dutch-born second wife. Here he formed [[Fiji Airways]] which later became '''Air Pacific''', subsequently the company name was changed in 2013 back to Fiji Airways.

Gatty suffered a [[stroke]] and died in 1957. He was buried in Fiji.

In the end, Gatty advocated "natural navigation" in his book ''Nature is your Guide'' which was published in 1958. He expanded on the ideas of ''The Raft Book'' and developed a narrative of Pacific settlement by Polynesian navigators following [[bird migration#In seabirds|migration of seabirds]]. He attributed cultural significance to the use of the [[pelorus (instrument)#Ancient instrument|pelorus]] by ancient Polynesians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3685">{{Humanism}}
'''Humanistic capitalism''' is a concept that seeks to marry [[humanism]], specifically the safety and health needs of people and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], with an embrace of market forces and a [[market-based economy]].

[[Muhammad Yunus]] describes Humanistic Capitalism as a socially conscious business world where investors are content to recoup their investments but do not expect additional dividends. [http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html]
The idea of humanistic capitalism is linked with the idea that fundamental changes must take place in [[economics]] today, as humanistic capitalism requires that there be a blending of the [[non-profit]] and [[for-profit]] sectors. If investors can accept the decrease in financial returns for those on a social level, humanistic capitalism will become a successful force in driving [[economic]] and [[social change]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Philanthropy]] is a fundamental concept to humanistic capitalism. While the idea of humanistic capitalism is still growing, over “72% percent of social entrepreneurs say that raising money is a problem,” and fundraising is a major issue to social entrepreneurs, who rely on [[philanthropy]] for support and funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html Caroline Hartnell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses today==
There are also many businesses today that already combine the needs of the environment with the needs of people and the environment. SustainAbility,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a company established in 1987, defines their purpose as to “seek solutions to social and environmental challenges that deliver long term value,” and has worked on projects to “identify opportunities to innovate products and services with a reduced [[environmental footprint]].” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainability.com/consultingservices/clientexperience.asp?id=1046 Client Case Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

JEP Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisticcapitalism.com/ JEP Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the philosophies of Humanistic Capitalism to create a kinder, gentler economic approach. The principles of Just Enough Profit (JEP) are used by companies to define what they stand for, how they treat their customers and employees, and how they serve humanity.

==Other views==
In Willis Harman's seminal paper "Humanistic Capitalism: Another Alternative" (Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Vol. 14, No. 1, Winter 1974) he writes "...corporations [must] assume an active responsibility for creating a healthy society and a habitable planet&amp;mdash;not as a gesture to improve corporate image or as a moralistically undertaken responsibility, but because it is the only reasonable long-run interpretation of "good business." In the end, good business policy must become one with good social policy."

Ira Rohter, a professor in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Hawaii]], promoted Humanistic Capitalism as a way to restore power to the people of [[Hawaii]] and their environment. He advocated that all growth be [[sustainable]], [[self-reliant]], and not only focused on profit, but the needs of people. Another key concept of humanistic capitalism, he added, is a [[democracy|democratic]] economy way based on “cooperation [and] openness” in order to meet the needs of Hawaii’s people and environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~irohter/AlternativeEconomyArticle.htm Ira Rohter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leffler is the co-author of ''Get Big Fast and Do More Good: Start Your Business, Make It Huge, and Change the World,'' a guide to entrepreneurship and brand-building.&lt;ref name="HuffPo book" /&gt; He has invested in or advised companies including [[Birchbox]], [[Dollar Shave Club]], and RangeMe.&lt;ref name="Grapevine" /&gt;

==Early life, education and early career==
Leffler was born in Israel to Dan Leffler, an engineer and entrepreneur, and Yaffa Leffler, a school teacher.&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Business Developers|url=http://homeincome.wix.com/homebusiness#!catalogue|website=wix.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was five, the family emigrated to Sydney, where his father built a property development company. In 1993, as Australia hit a major recession, the residential market collapsed and the company failed. The Lefflers lost their life savings and their home.&lt;ref name="Mixergy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune Don't Quit" /&gt;
 
Able to afford only the essentials, if Leffler "wanted to do anything – go to the movies, travel, buy something – it was up to him to figure out how to pay for it."  In order to do so, he got a job at a grocery store, and then Psycho Chicken, a restaurant.  At 18, he started his first business with his best friend, Evan Lever.  Called the Roving Bakery, it was a home delivery service for breads and bagels.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grapevine"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Gerri|title=Inside the mind of a reality show judge|url=https://www.fromthegrapevine.com/arts/ido-leffler-quit-your-day-job-investor-tv-oxygen#!|accessdate=22 May 2017|work=From the Grapevine|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune Don't Quit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marinova|first1=Paulina|title=One Investor’s Advice to Immigrant Entrepreneurs: Don’t Hide Your Accent|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/11/ido-leffler-immigrant-entrepreneur/|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=Fortune|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Entrep Don't Quit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Lindsay|title=Top Lessons From the Judges of a New Female-Focused 'Shark Tank'-Like Show|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/273259|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=Entrepreneur|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help make ends meet, while working full-time as a school teacher, Yaffa Leffler began a successful [[Herbalife]] distributorship. Dan Leffler joined her as the business grew. In 1996 Ido Leffler attended the University of Technology Sydney. He graduated with a bachelor of business degree in marketing and international business in 1999. He then decided to join his parents and became an Herbalife distributor in Indonesia and then in India.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leffler, Ido, and|first1=Kalish, Lance|title=Get big fast and do more good : start your business, make it huge, and change the world|date=2013|publisher=New Harvest/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=Boston|isbn=9780544114487|pages=224|url=https://bepl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1920479/ada|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes Yoobi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bertoni|first1=Steven|title=Why Yes To's Ido Leffler Is Jumping Into the Office Supply Business|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/06/27/why-yes-tos-ido-leffler-is-jumping-into-the-office-supply-business/#7b6283364bda|accessdate=12 May 2017|work=Forbes|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT Yes to"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=David|title=Dead Sea brings life to skincare|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/27eb7b8e-0ab7-11de-95ed-0000779fd2ac.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4gpjnifIH|accessdate=12 May 2017|work=Financial Times|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Trendtrade International, Yes To Inc., SOMA Water===
After returning from India, Leffler founded Trendtrade International with Lance Kalish, an alumnus of UTS whom Leffler met in 1997 through playing soccer.&lt;ref name="Forbes big beauty brand"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNycholas|first1=Kim|title=Building The Next Big Beauty Brand: Yes To|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kymmcnicholas/2011/10/20/building-the-next-big-beauty-brand-yes-to-carrots/#e76cc35529e4|accessdate=13 July 2017|work=Forbes|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focused on international business development.

In founding Yes To Inc., Leffler and Kalish established the Yes To Carrots Seed Fund, a non-profit organization that provided under-served communities with the resources to develop and sustain organic food sources and access to healthy nutrition. In 2012, the company partnered with Mama Hope to create Yes To Hope, which provided schools with funding for year-round organic gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=James Marshall|title=Shake the World: It's Not About Finding a Job, It's About Creating a Life|date=27 August 2013|publisher=Portfolio|location=New York|isbn=978-1591846550|page=112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes Yoobi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bertoni|first1=Steven|title=Why Yes To's Ido Leffler Is Jumping Into the Office Supply Business|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/06/27/why-yes-tos-ido-leffler-is-jumping-into-the-office-supply-business/#7b6283364bda|accessdate=12 May 2017|work=Forbes|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leffler co-founded SOMA Water in 2012 and served as the chairman of its board until May 2017. A water filtration system composed of carafes and biodegradable filtration systems, SOMA donated clean drinking water to people in need through a philanthropic partner, charity: water.&lt;ref name="Soma"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ariel|title=Forget Brita: Building a Better Water Filter|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1681025/forget-brita-building-a-better-water-filter|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=Fast Company|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoobi, Cheeky, Beach House Group, Brandless===
Leffler and Kalish founded Yoobi in June 2014. A school and office supply brand, the idea for Yoobi was based on Leffler's experience shopping for school supplies for his children.  He saw a "distinct lack of vision and creativity" in the products available.  After learning that 99.5% of the elementary school teachers in the United States paid for classroom supplies out of their own pocket,&lt;ref name="desertet"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Lane|title=Give a notebook to a school kid by buying a notebook from Target|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865606252/Give-a-notebook-to-a-school-kid-by-buying-a-notebook-from-Target.html|accessdate=13 July 2017|work=Deseret News|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leffler and Kalish established a one-for-one system; each time a Yoobi product was purchased, an item such as crayons, pens, and rulers was added to a pack of school supplies which contained 1000 products. Yoobi worked with the Kids In Need Foundation to determine what students needed.&lt;ref name="Yoobi Fast Co" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ yoobi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes Yoobi" /&gt;

In 2014, Leffler co-founded Cheeky Home, a line of paper and plastic tableware.  The company donated a meal to Americans facing hunger through the nonprofit organization Feeding America for every product sold.&lt;ref name="Cheeky"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levitt|first1=Shelley|title=How This Guy’s Racing to End Hunger by Selling Paper Plates and Cups|url=http://www.success.com/article/how-this-guys-racing-to-end-hunger-by-selling-paper-plates-and-cups|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=Success|date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-founded Beach House Group, a brand and product development company.

Leffler founded Brandless with [[Tina Sharkey]] in early 2014. Described by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' as the "[[Procter and Gamble]] for millennials," the company creates and sells organic and natural products. For every order placed at Brandless.com a meal is donated through Feeding America.&lt;ref name="brandless fortune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rao|first1=Leena|title=Exclusive: Investors Bet on Brandless as the Next Procter and Gamble for Millennials|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/07/brandless-procter-gamble/|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=Fortune|date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandless launched in July 2017.&lt;ref name="tech crunch brandless"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Ryan|title=Brandless|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/brandless/|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==
In 2016, Leffler appeared as a judge on the [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] television series ''Quit Your Day Job.'' A reality show which allowed entrepreneurs to pitch their business ideas to the panel of entrepreneurs and investors,  ''Quit Your Day Job'' focused on women and minority entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="shark tank"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tulshyan|first1=Ruchika|title=Watch 'Quit Your Day Job': 'Shark Tank' For Women And Minority Entrepreneurs|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ruchikatulshyan/2016/03/31/watch-quit-your-day-job-shark-tank-for-women-and-minority-entrepreneurs/#6a8b0f3a392b|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=Forbes|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leffler and Kalish wrote a guide to modern entrepreneurship, ''Get Big Fast and Do More Good,'' published by Harcourt in 2014.  Kalish and Leffler described the book as "very simply, operating a business in an ethical, moral way with equal regard to our consumers, our partners, the environment and the well-being of everyone involved in the production of our products."&lt;ref name="HuffPo book"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Mei Mei|title=How to Get Big Fast and Do More Good|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/meimei-fox/how-to-get-big-fast-and-d_b_4278112.html|accessdate=5 July 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">The '''International Society for Labour and Social Security Law''' is an international association whose purpose is to study [[Labour law|labour]] and social security law at the national and international level, to promote the exchange of ideas and information from a comparative perspective, and to encourage collaboration among academics, lawyers, and other experts within the fields of labour and social security law.

Founded in 1958, the ISLSSL is composed of national affiliates whose members are scholars, union and management lawyers, judges, government officials, arbitrators, industrial relations and human resources specialists, and others interested in promoting international exchange of ideas and information and in developing collaboration among experts in the fields of labor, employment and employee benefits law.

The current members of the Executive Committee are Steven L. Willborn (Chair), George Nicolau, Vice-Chair, and Alvin L. Goldman, Secretary-Treasurer.

For many of those active in issues in the workplace, the internationalization of labor law and relations is becoming a reality.  To highlight just a few areas in this field of growing attention to the global legal landscape, those in academia work on issues of comparative labor and employment law, union lawyers consider international aspects of comprehensive corporate campaigns in support of the objectives of their clients, and management attorneys are increasingly called upon to give advice on the international ramifications of the employment policies of their employer clients. 

==World Congress==
The ISLSSL conducts a World Congress every three years and Regional Congresses (open to registrants from all regions) during the interim years. These meetings allow members both to combine travel with expanded understanding of how labor and employment law operate elsewhere and explain their system to others. ISLSSL conferences also facilitate development of new personal contacts and promote important scholarship, education and training in the fields of comparative and international labor law, employment law, and related fields. 

In recent years, ISLSSL World Congresses were convened in Jerusalem in 2000, in Montevideo in 2003, in Paris in 2006, in Sydney, Australia in 2009 and in Santiago, Chile in 2012. A World Congress will be hosted in Cape Town, South Africa in 2015. 

==Regional branches==
The ISLSSL maintains several regional branches. Recent Western Hemisphere Regional Congresses have been held in Lima, Peru; Querétaro, Mexico; and in the Dominican Republic. Recent Asian Regional Congresses were hosted in Manilla and Taipai, and recent European Regional Congresses were held in Stockholm, Bologna, Sevilla (2011) and Dublin (2014). In addition, the U.S. Branch sponsored a one day conferences in Chicago in May 2005 and in Philadelphia in 2012.

==Publications==
The U.S. Branch of the ISLSSL and the [[University of Illinois]] College of Law publish ''The Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'', a quarterly law journal which publishes articles in the field of comparative and transnational labor and employment law. The journal publishes comparative analysis articles on labor law, employment policy, labor economics, worker migration, and social security issues. Many articles focus on legal systems in developing countries or post-colonial nations with emerging or new legal systems. The target audience for the journal is academics, practicing attorneys, policy makers, students, workers and labor movement officials and activists. The journal's stated policy is to make the publication readable and of practical value to officials in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cllpj.law.illinois.edu/ ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Motley Morehead''' (July 4, 1796 – August 27, 1866) was an American lawyer and politician who became the [[List of Governors of North Carolina|29th]] [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]] (1841 to 1845). He became known as "the Father of Modern North Carolina."&lt;ref&gt;http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/john-motley-morehead-1796-1866/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and family life==

Born in [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia]], Morehead was the son of Obedience (Motley) and John Morehead. His parents moved to [[Rockingham County, North Carolina]] when Morehead was two.

After a private education including the [[Caldwell Institute]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], Morehead attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. There he became a member of [[The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies]], and graduated in 1817.

==Career==
Morehead read law under Archibald Murphey and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1819. He practiced law in [[Wentworth, North Carolina]]. In 1821, [[Rockingham County, North Carolina|Rockingham County]] voters first elected him to serve in the [[North Carolina General Assembly]]. Beginning in 1826, [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County]] voters twice elected Morehead to represent them in the North Carolina House of Commons. In 1835, Morehead was chosen to be a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention, where he advocated representation based on population (which benefitted western North Carolina because of its relatively few enslaved people).

Voters elected Morehead governor in 1840, and he became the first governor inaugurated in the new State Capitol. During his two gubernatorial terms, Morehead supported the new public school system, extending railroad lines, river and harbor improvements and constructing canals and turnpikes, but the Democrats in the state legislature passed few of those measures. During his final year, Morehead supported creation of a school for the deaf, which would be named in his honor.

After his term as governor ended in 1845, Morehead returned to his home, [[Blandwood Mansion and Gardens|Blandwood]], in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], designed by [[New York City]] architect [[Alexander Jackson Davis]]. There, Morehead entertained numerous politicians and personalities of the day, including [[Dorothea Dix]].

Morehead helped raise private funds for a railroad line to accompany $2 million finally authorized by the legislature, which became the [[North Carolina Railroad]]. In 1854, Morehead became the first president and the railroad's terminus was named [[Morehead City, North Carolina]] in his honor in 1860. His successor at the railroad, [[Charles Frederick Fisher]], however, endured significant criticism during the intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/fisher-charles-frederick&lt;/ref&gt; Morehead also built a cotton mill in [[Leaksville, North Carolina|Leaksville]], and served on the Board of Trustees of UNC, his alma mater.

Morehead returned to the North Carolina house in 1858. In 1861, he represented North Carolina at a conference to avoid war. With the failure of the conference and the secession of North Carolina, Morehead served in the Confederate Congress.

==Death and legacy==
Morehead died at [[Rockbridge Alum Springs Historic District|Rockbridge Springs, Virginia]] in 1866. He is buried in the [[First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro|Old First Presbyterian Church Cemetery]] located at the [[Greensboro Historical Museum]] in Greensboro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/t/u/r/Jim-Turner-Silver-Spring/GENE2-0008.html|title=Jim-Turner-Silver-Spring - User Trees - Genealogy.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:John Motley Morehead Bust.JPG|thumb|left|Marble bust of Morehead at the [[North Carolina State Capitol]]]]

His grandson, [[John Motley Morehead III]] (United States Ambassador to Sweden 1930-33), bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million, commissioned the university's planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. His granddaughter [[Lily Morehead Mebane]] was decorated by the governments of France and Serbia for her relief work after [[World War I]]; she later served two terms in the North Carolina state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.digitalnc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/ncimages/id/3960/rec/1 A photograph of Lily Morehead Mebane in her relief worker uniform], c. 1921, in Rockingham County Legacy: A Digital Heritage Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Richardson Harris''' (22 October 1790 – 21 August 1829) was an early settler of Mexican Texas and the namesake of [[Harris County, Texas]]. He founded the town of Harrisburg, Texas and Harris County, Texas is named in his honor.

==Family life==
John Richardson Harris was born on 22 October 1790 to John and Mary (Richardson) Harris in [[Cayuga, New York]]. After serving in the [[War of 1812]], he married Jane Birdsall, and they took residence near [[Waterloo, New York]]. Their first sons were born there: DeWitt Clinton Harris and Lewis Birdsall Harris. The family migrated to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri in 1819, where Mary Jane Harris and John Birdsall Harris were born.&lt;ref name=hto&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|author=Beazley, Julia|title=Harris, John Richardson|access-date=2 July 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fha85|date=28 February 2017|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aulbach569&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Aulbach|year=2012|location=Houston|publisher=Louis Aulbach|title=Buffalo Bayou: An Echo of Houston’s Wilderness Beginnings|pages=569–572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gone to Texas==
{{History of Texas}}
Harris prepared to locate to Texas at the urging of [[Moses Austin]]. To prepare for this gamble, he resettled his family in upstate New York. In 1823, he sailed his boat from [[New Orleans]] to Buffalo Bayou, where he scouted locations for a trading post.  
Harris was granted a [[Spanish customary units#League (unit of area)|league]] of land {{convert|4,428|acres|abbr=off}} at Buffalo Bayou on 16 August 1824. He contracted for a town plat of Harrisburg in 1826, while he established a trading post and a grist mill there.&lt;ref name="harrises"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pioneer Harrises of Harris County, Texas|author=Looscan, Adele B.|journal=The Southwestern Historical Quarterly|volume=31|issue=4|year=1928|pages=365{{endash}}373|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|jstor=30242532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aulbach569/&gt;  He named the new town for [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], the namesake of his great-grandfather. In addition to the grist mill, he ran a saw mill with the assistance of his two brothers, David Harris and William Plunkett Harris, and his business partner, Robert Wilson. They also offered carpentry and blacksmithing services. Harris and Wilson managed a small fleet of sailing ships, which imported trade goods from the United States and Mexico, and exported cotton and lumber.&lt;ref name=aulbach569/&gt; John Richardson and David Harris founded a second trading post at [[East Columbia, Texas#History|Bell’s Landing, Texas]].&lt;ref name=hto/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Harris started building what was the first steam saw mill in Texas. With machine belts needed to complete the project, he sailed to New Orleans. He arrived amidst a yellow fever epidemic and died there on 21 August 1829.&lt;ref name=aulbach569/&gt;

In 1833, two parties filed claims on the John Harris Richardson estate. Wilson and William Plunkett Harris claimed the real estate and equipment as their own. John Richardson Harris’s widow, Jane Harris, and DeWitt Clinton Harris arrived in Texas for the first time to make a competing claim. In 1836, [[Augustus Chapman Allen]] and [[John Kirby Allen]] approached the Harrises to make a bid on the  Harrisburg site, but ownership of the property had still not been settled. By 1838, Mary Jane Harris and her family constructed a house on that property and reorganized the town in order to sell lots.&lt;ref name=aulbach569/&gt;

Harris County, Texas was named for John Richardson Harris.&lt;ref name="tsha"&gt;{{cite web|series= Handbook of Texas Online|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07|title=Harris County|first=Margaret Swett|last=Henson|date=15 June 2010|access-date=2 July 2018|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591"> [[File:Kjerringøy.jpg|thumb|Privileged trader [[Erasmus Zahl]]'s trading center in [[Kjerringøy]]]]
A '''privileged trader''' ({{lang-no|nessekonge}}, literally 'peninsular king', also known as a ''væreiere'' 'community owner')&lt;ref&gt;Apostle, Richard A. et al. 1998. ''Community, State, and Market on the North Atlantic Rim: Challenges to Modernity in the Fisheries''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 32, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term that was used for fish merchants or landowners that enjoyed special privileges along the coast of [[Northern Norway]] from the second half of the 1700s onward.&lt;ref&gt; [https://snl.no/nessekonge ''Store norske leksikon'': nessekonge.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Kennedy, John Charles. 2006. ''Island Voices: Fisheries and Community Survival in Northern Norway''. Delft: Eburon, p. 25. &lt;/ref&gt; The term ''nessekonge'' itself goes back centuries earlier, to the Viking era, referring to local chieftains that held power over a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Julia Ann. 1997. ''The Cultural Politics of Fishing: Negotiating Community and Common Property in Northern Norway''. Dissertation. Stanford, CA: Stanford University, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Their privileged status refers to their having received special permission from the king to engage in trade. There are believed to have been 200 to 300 privileged traders' centers or [[fishing village]]s from [[Brønnøysund]] in the south to [[Vardø]] in the north. The privileged traders experienced their peak from the second half of the 1800s to 1910. After this, the development of fishing fleets and public transport by steamship made fishermen less dependent on the local fish buyers, and catches could then be traded wherever the best profit was to be had.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The privileged traders enjoyed a dominant economic, social, and political position in the local milieu. They controlled the local trade, fresh fish purchases, and fish processing, and they often owned the local estate. They sought to supply the locals with all the goods they needed from elsewhere, and this sales monopoly resulted in no room for competition. They covered needs ranging from food and fuel to boats and finished log houses. Often the sale of goods and purchases of fish happened at the same time, so that trade was more of a barter and the privileged trader profited from both the purchase and sale. Because there was little money in circulation, not only these exchanges were kept in written account books, but also the residents' other expenditures were recorded in the books maintained by the privileged trader; for example, taxes or costs of medical treatment. Fishermen’s dole-fish (the share of the catch they were entitled to)&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave, R. H. Inglis. 1895–1899 (reprinted 1987). ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy''. London: MacMillan, p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; was also often handled by the privileged trader, and so he acted as a bank in many ways. This also applied to loans—both for working capital for fishing, as well as consumer loans for houses and land, equipment, and boats. There was often little chance of the debt being paid off. The privileged traders secured the debts by having the borrowers pledge their property as security. If the people could not repay their debt, this could lead to foreclosure or [[forced sale]] and the loss of their boats, houses, or other property, which was their source of livelihood. Practice varied on how the debt was enforced; some allowed the old owners to remain on the farm as tenants, whereas others evicted them and brought in new residents. Often the privileged traders had not only a trade monopoly, but also political power, such as mayor or other offices, which often undermined the municipal system.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The best-known privileged trader was [[Erasmus Zahl]] of [[Kjerringøy]],&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Walter. 1997. ''Knut Hamsun''. Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the model for [[Knut Hamsun]]'s character Mack in his novels.&lt;ref&gt;Combüchen, Sigrid. 2006. ''Livsklättraren: en bok om Knut Hamsun''. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Régis. 2002. ''Knut Hamsun''. Lausanne: Age d'homme, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4857">The '''''Repartimiento''''' ({{IPA-es|repaɾtiˈmjento}}) (Spanish, "distribution, partition, or division") was a colonial [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] system imposed upon the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population of Spanish America]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]]. In concept it was similar to other [[tribute]]-labor systems, such as the ''[[mita (Inca)|mita]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] or the [[corvée]] of [[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime France]]: the natives were forced to do low-paid or unpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months each year on Spanish-owned farms, mines, workshops (''obrajes''), and public projects. With the [[New Laws]] of 1542, the ''repartimiento'' was instated to substitute the ''[[encomienda]]'' system that had come to be seen as abusive and promoting unethical behavior. The ''repartimiento'' was not [[slavery]], in that the worker is not owned outright—being free in various respects other than in the dispensation of his or her labor—and the work was intermittent. It however, created [[slavery]]-like conditions in certain areas, most notoriously in silver mines of 16th century [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spodek |first=Howard |authorlink= Howard Spodek|coauthors= |title= The World's History, Third Edition: Combined Volume (pages 457-458)|date= February 2005|publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |location= |isbn=978-0-13-177318-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decades of the colonization of the Caribbean the word was used for the institution that became the ''[[encomienda]]'', which can cause confusion. It was a way for people to pay tribute by doing laborious jobs for the mother country. 

The ''repartimiento'', for the most part, replaced the ''encomienda''  throughout the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] by the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Peru ''encomiendas'' lasted longer, and the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] word ''mita'' frequently was used for ''repartimiento''. There were instances when both systems (''repartimiento'' and ''encomienda'') coexisted.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In practice, a [[conquistador]], or later a Spanish settler or official, would be given and supervised a number of indigenous workers, who would labor in farms or mines, or in the case of the Philippines might also be assigned to the ship yards constructing the [[Manila galleon]]s. The one in charge of doing the ''reparto'' ("distribution") of workers was the ''[[Corregidor (position)|Alcalde Mayor]]'' (local magistrate) of the city. Native communities that were close to Spanish populations were required to provide a percentage of their people (2-4%) to work in agriculture, construction of houses, streets, etc.  The diminution of the number of natives in the Americas due to European diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]] and [[typhus]]) to which the native populations had no resistance, as well as to desertion from the work fields, led to the substitution of the ''encomienda'' system and the creation of privately owned farms and [[hacienda]]s. Many native people escaped the ''encomienda'' and ''repartimiento'' by leaving their communities. Some looked for [[Wage labour|wage labor]]; others signed contracts (''asientos'') for six months to a year, during which time the worker was required to be paid a salary (something the Spanish Crown did not enforce or support), and provided living quarters as well as religious services. There were many cases in which both wage and ''repartimiento'' laborers worked side-by-side on farms, mines, ''obrajes'' or haciendas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3294">'''Rose Blumkin''' (December 3, 1893-August 9, 1998) was the founder of [[Nebraska Furniture Mart]] who sold the business to [[Warren Buffett]] of [[Berkshire Hathaway]]. 

==Biography==
Blumkin was born to a [[Jews in Belarus|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fau.edu/library/bro55b.htm | title=Jewish Heroes and Heroines in America | accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Rose Gorelick in [[Schidrin]] near [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]] where her father was a [[rabbi]] and her mother ran a grocery store. When she was twenty, Rose married Isadore Blumkin. Blumkin immigrated to the United States in 1917 and [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1919 where she started a used clothing store and then opened the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937 originally selling used furniture.&lt;ref name="Snowball"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Alice|title=The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life|date=2009|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781408807323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCB3ULgTzhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1408807327&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijkYStpJPbAhVH1lMKHVnWD8oQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumkin grew that business to become the largest indoor furniture store in America and eventually sold 90% of the business to Buffett in 1983 for $60 million.&lt;ref name="Snowball" /&gt; Blumkin later opened another store and started competing with Buffett with "Mrs. B's Clearance and Factory Outlet across the street from the Furniture Mart" until Buffett acquired that company as well with a non-competition clause.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feder|first1=Barnaby J.|title=Rose Blumkin, Retail Queen, Dies at 104|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/13/business/rose-blumkin-retail-queen-dies-at-104.html|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203022037/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/13/business/rose-blumkin-retail-queen-dies-at-104.html|archivedate=February 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumkin continued to be involved in day-to-day operations until shortly before her death at the age of 104.

Blumkin was also an active philanthropist and namesake of the [[Rose Blumkin Performing Arts Center]], and large donor to the [[Omaha Jewish Community Center]]. She received honorary degrees from [[New York University]] and [[Creighton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=Karen|title=The women of Berkshire Hathaway lessons from Warren Buffett's female CEOs and directors|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118227411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumkin was buried in the [[Golden Hill Jewish Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16546">'''Say on pay''' is a term used for a role in [[corporate law]] whereby a firm's shareholders have the right to vote on the [[remuneration]] of executives.

Often described in [[corporate governance]] or management theory as an [[agency problem]], a corporation's managers are likely to overpay themselves because, directly or indirectly, they are allowed to pay themselves as a matter of general management power.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see [[Model Articles]] para 3; and under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], see s 141(a)&lt;/ref&gt; Directors are elected to a board that has a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] to protect the interests of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, [[Companies Act 2006]], ss 170, 172&lt;/ref&gt; In large listed companies, executive compensation will usually be determined by a compensation committee composed of board members.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see the [[Combined Code]] A.3.1; in the US, see the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) rules; in Germany see the [[German Corporate Governance Codex]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that “say on pay” reforms strengthen the relationship between the [[board of directors]] and shareholders, ensuring that board members fulfill their fiduciary duty. [http://millstein.som.yale.edu/Davis_Say_on_Pay_Policy_Briefing.pdf] Critics of the policy believe that “say on pay” does not effectively or comprehensibly monitor compensation, and consider it to be reactionary policy rather than proactive policy, because it does not immediately affect the Board of Directors. Some argue it is counter-productive because it diminishes the authority of the Board of Directors. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11485334/2/c_2984789] The effect of ‘say on pay’ measures can be binding or non-binding, depending on regulatory requirements or internal corporate policy as determined by proxy votes.&lt;ref&gt;David Orisson, '[http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ Say On Pay = New tool of Social Responsibility?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823072522/http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ |date=2013-08-23 }}'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
{{main|Swiss referendum "against corporate Rip-offs" of 2013}}

On the 3rd of March the Swiss voted by 69.7 per cent to ensure shareholders, pension funds and not banks, entirely control questions of executive pay. Shareholders must elect all members of a company's remuneration committee of all Swiss public listed companies. They further should receive annual votes on the identity of all members of the [[board of directors]]. The role that banks played in casting votes on other shareholders behalf has been abolished.

==Australia==
The [[Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Act 2011]] introduced in the [[Corporations Act 2001]] new sections 250R(2), 250U-V, so that if at two consecutive meetings over 25% of shareholders vote against the directors’ remuneration package, the directors have to stand for election again in 90 days.

==UK law==
{{see also|UK company law}}
Originally [[UK company law]] set a default rule that the remuneration of directors was to be set, binding, by the company's general meeting, under [[Table A]], article 54, attached to the [[Companies Act 1862]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/tableA/comm7Aug1862CoAct1862_P1.pdf Table A of the CA 1862 art 54]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time more and more companies gave the right to directors, which is the position found in the [[Model Articles]] for companies today, that remuneration of the directors shall be determined by the directors.

The United Kingdom was the forerunner in mandating that shareholders be allowed a ''non-binding'', or advisory vote on pay. In the UK, section 439 of the [[Companies Act 2006]] mandates a vote on director pay at the yearly accounts meeting. Directors are expected to have disclosed their remuneration package in a "Remuneration Report" (section 420). Failure to do this leads to fines.

In addition, UK law regulates more tightly a number of elements beyond basic director pay. Employee share schemes that directors have must be approved by ordinary resolution under the [[London Stock Exchange]] Listing Rule 9.4.1. Under the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], with which all listed companies must comply or explain why they do not, a binding vote on approval of [[long-term incentive plan]]s is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Combined Code B.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 188 of the Companies Act 2006 a [[shareholder resolution]] is necessary to approve a director’s contract lasting more than a 2-year term (reduced from approval beyond a 5-year term under the old Companies Act 1985, section 319). Lastly, frivolous categories of compensation are limited under section 215, by prohibiting payments for loss of office (i.e. no [[golden parachutes]]), except, under section 220, in respect of damages for existing obligations and pensions.

Although the say on pay provision in section 439 is not binding on the board, the message in UK law is influential, because company members have an unrestricted right to fire any director, with reasonable notice, under section 168. The debate, however, moved on to whether the vote should become binding.&lt;ref&gt;T Helm and R Wachman, '[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/07/david-cameron-fat-cat-pay David Cameron to curb 'fat cat' pay with people power]' (8 January 2012) The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Changes were introduced in the [[Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]] section 79 to make the overall policy of pay be capable of being rejected by shareholders, but that no specific right to determine the amount has yet been introduced.

==US law==
{{see also|United States corporate law}}
In the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] §951, a new say on pay provision was introduced. 

There had been several recent efforts to require Say on Pay resolutions in the United States. In 2007, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee Rep. [[Barney Frank]] sponsored legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives, giving shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8946280?f=related] Then Senator [[Barack Obama]] authored a "Say on Pay" proposal, but his legislation stalled in the Senate. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11037327/c_11036422] 

The economic crisis has affected corporate governance in the United States of America. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA), which established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], required say on pay resolutions at companies with outstanding funds from the TARP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonwatch.com/blog/2008/09/28/bailout-text-tarp-taxpayers-are-really-payin/]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Senator [[Chris Dodd]] amended Section 111 of the EESA, and updated policy on Executive Compensation in Section 7. The amended legislation continued the "Say on Pay" policy established originally in the EESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1enr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2009, Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] stated that companies that have received exceptional financial recovery assistance from the TARP fund would have to subject executive compensation to "Say on Pay" resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530151237/https://treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that the Administration supports "Say on Pay" legislation, and it would authorize the SEC authority to implement "Say on Pay" regulations at all companies, not only those that have outstanding funds from the TARP, contingent on Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jun2009/db20090610_656281.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily Business Week June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Treasury reconciled its proposals from February 4 with Congressional amendments to the EESA in the Final Interim Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610213259/http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm |date=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2009, H.R. 3269, the "Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009" passed the House of Representatives. The House bill included a section that allowed for a 'say on pay' for all public institutions in the United States. Additionally, it had a provision for a shareholder vote on golden parachutes. In the Senate, Senator Charles Schumer had introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights. The House and Senate bills were reconciled in a final bill that was signed by President Obama on July 21, 2010 called The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, only 2.6% of companies which voted on say on pay measures failed to pass them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001924/http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU proposals==
{{see also|EU company law}}
The [[European Union]] has remained tentative about harmonising rules on CEO pay. In the High Level Group of Company Law Experts' ''Final Report'' in 2002, they stated they would not wish to impose a requirement for voting EU wide, yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some Member States require, or are considering requiring, a form of mandatory or advisory vote by 
shareholders on the remuneration policy.  We do not believe a shareholder vote on the remuneration policy generally should be an 
EU requirement, as the effects of such a vote can be different from Member State to Member State.  The important thing is that 
shareholders annually have the opportunity to debate the policy with the board.&lt;ref&gt;High Level Group of Company Law Experts, [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/docs/modern/report_en.pdf ''Final Report''] (2002) p.65; from the EU Commission's [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212120815/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background |date=2008-02-12 }} on company law modernisation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a different approach is taken to share schemes, which were recommended to be more closely scrutinised.

==German reforms==
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
The Coalition Government of Germany has recently passed reforming legislation to the [[Stock Corporation Act]] to introduce a non-binding say on pay.

==Examples of shareholder revolts==
Incidents at large UK companies in which shareholders have "revolted" against the size of pay awards given to board members, since the "say on pay" legislation was introduced.

*[[Vodafone]] shareholders voted 10% against, and 30% in abstention from £13m in shares for CEO Sir Chris Gent. (July 2001)
*[[Royal &amp; Sun Alliance]] shareholders voted 28% against a £250,000 retention bonus for CFO Julian Hance and £1.44m severance pay for CEO Bob Mendelsohn. The share price had just dropped. (May 2003)
*[[GlaxoSmithKline]] shareholders voted 50.72% (advisorily) against a £22m bonus salary and stock [[severance package]] for CEO [[Jean-Pierre Garnier]]. Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said it was just the difference in culture to the US that was holding Britain back and they should accept it. The TUC had been lobbying pension funds. (May 2003)
*[[ITV Network|ITV]] shareholders were 40% against a £15m (£1.8m cash, rest shares) payoff to Chairman Michael Green. It was justified on the basis that he would have taken legal action were it not paid, because he was removed prior to the Carlton/Granada merger.
*[[Berkley (property company)|Berkley]] Managing Director and founder of the property company had 47% of shareholders vote against his £1.2m (out of a total £4.7m package) under a long term incentive scheme that he had not actually belonged to. (August 2003)
*[[Unilever]] Former chairman Niall Fitzgerald got £1.2m after profits fell. (April 2005)
*[[Tesco]] shareholders voted 15% against an £11.5m bonus on [[Sir Terry Leahy]]’s salary as CEO. It was linked to the success of the firm's Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US. The [[Association of British Insurers]] and [[Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants Ltd|PIRC]] were against. (June 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article2008127.ece Shareholder revolt over planned £11.5m payout for Tesco chief], The Times, June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of mandatory shareholder advisory "say on pay" voting in the US, 37 Russell 3000 companies failed to receive majority support from shareholders.  In the second year of voting, 44 Russell 3000 companies have failed as of June 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/sop/four-more-companies-fail-say-on-pay#.T9eCpbX-tBk Four more companies fail Say on Pay], Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SBCG-SOP-2012-06-06.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of June 6)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies include:

*[[Nabors Industries]] shareholders voted against "say on pay" in both 2011 and 2012 (75% opposition in 2012) given concerns over the company's high CEO pay and severance payments.  Shareholders also voted against the company's new incentive bonus plan and long-term incentive plan in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/nabors-severance-idUSL1E8H6IXJ20120606 Nabors owners reject exec pay, want severance nod], Reuters, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Hewlett Packard]] failed a "say on pay" vote in 2011 in light of new CEO [[Léo Apotheker]]'s employment agreement and the company's stock performance.
*[[Citigroup]] failed "say on pay" with 55% opposition in 2012 after giving CEO [[Vikram Pandit]] three retention grants valued at $27.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SBCG-SOP-2012-04-251.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of April 25)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, April 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic skepticism==
[[Brian Cheffins]] of [[Cambridge University]] and [[Randall Thomas]] of [[Vanderbilt University]] predicted that a 'say on pay' could hold back sudden jumps, but it would not stop the general upward drift in pay rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=268992]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Krause and colleagues argued that 'say on pay' offered little information to the board of directors beyond disapproval of CEO compensation not being in line with firm performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Whitler|first2=Kimberly A.|last3=Semadeni|first3=Matthew|date=2014-02-01|title=Power to the Principals!

'''Standard Oil Building''', also known as the Stanbalt Building, is a historic [[office building]] located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is a 15-story [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] [[skyscraper]] designed by [[Clyde N. Friz]] (1867-1942), one of Baltimore's best-known Beaux Arts designers, and built in 1922. The steel-frame "U"-shaped office building is clad in limestone. It was built by the [[Standard Oil Company]] at a time when that business was once one of the nation's principal corporations, the dominant supplier of gasoline and fuels.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1255.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Standard Oil Building|date=May 2000|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=George E. Thomas|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard Oil Building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;  In its later years as an office building, the building primarily housed offices for the City of Baltimore.  Following an extensive, $25 million renovation, the building reopened as residential apartments in 2002 by the [[Southern Management Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-10-17/news/0210170346_1_standard-oil-building-mount-vernon-downtown|date=2002-10-17|work=Old Standard Oil Building gets apartment makeover|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tariq Krim''' (born October 25, 1972, in [[Paris]]) is a French serial entrepreneur, creator of [[Netvibes]] and currently the founder and [[CEO]] of [[Jolicloud]], a personal [[cloud computing|cloud content computing]] platform and Joli OS, a free [[operating system]] based on the Jolicloud platform. In 2008, he was the first French national named by the ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref name="MIT Technological review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roush|first=Wade|title=2007 Young Innovators Under 35: Tariq Krim|url= https://www.technologyreview.in/TR35/Profile.aspx?Cand=T&amp;TRID=612|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Chevalier de l’[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] (Knight of the French Order of Arts and Letters) by the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Ministère de la Culture"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nomination ou promotion dans l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres janvier 2011| url=http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Ministere/Les-services-rattaches-au-Ministre/Section-des-distinctions-honorifiques/Nomination-ou-promotion-dans-l-ordre-des-Arts-et-des-Lettres-janvier-2011|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Ministère de la Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Tariq Krim spent his childhood in the historic area of Paris, [[Le Marais]]. His father was an economist and his mother a teacher. Passionate about computers from an early age (he was given his first computer at 10, and created his first [[Minitel]] server at 12 years old), Krim went on to study physics at the [[University of Paris VII]] and obtained his [[post-graduate degree]] from the [[Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications]] (ENST).&lt;ref name="Les Echos" group=""&gt;{{cite news|last=PAQUETTE|first=EMMANUEL|title=Netvibes ou la liberté donnée à l'internaute créateur |url= http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/2007/lesechos.fr/11/22/300220474.htm|accessdate=22 November 2007|newspaper=Les Echos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
=== Journalism ===
In 1994, after meeting with [[Jean-Francois Bizot]], Krim became a writer for ''[[Novamag]]'' and wrote articles about cyberculture. He continued his career in journalism for the financial daily ''[[La Tribune]]''. First based in Paris, then in [[California]] (he opened the newspaper's [[Silicon Valley]] branch),&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|date = 16 May 2007 |last=Brafman|first =Nathalie | title =Tariq Krim, le nouveau gourou du Web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2007/05/16/tariq-krim-le-nouveau-gourou-du-web_910806_651865.html|accessdate=17 May 2007| work=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krim published numerous articles on the Internet industry, including a piece on digital music distribution two years before [[Napster]] was founded.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Entrepreneurship ===

In 1999, when the internet was still in its infancy in France, Krim decided that he was done with writing about internet innovation and would just "go and do it".&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Ian|title=Netvibes, Tariq Krim|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/nov/04/news.weekendmagazine6|accessdate=4 November 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he founded what would become L8Rmedia, a consulting and publishing company specializing in digital media. Its first branch was in [[San Francisco]]; he later expanded to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Wall Strip Chat (Video)"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lindsay|title=Wall Strip Chat Sits Down With Tariq Krim|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x34ul8_wallstrip-chat-tariq-krim_fun?start=13#from=embed|newspaper=Wall Strip Chat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main online publication, GenerationMP3 (formerly "MPTrois.com"), attracts 1.5 million readers per month.&lt;ref name="Les Echos"/&gt; and pioneered the use of [[Citizen journalism|participatory journalism]] in France.&lt;ref name=SME&gt;{{cite web|title=SME Speakers|url=http://sime.nu/speakers/tariq-krim/|work=SME Speakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a leading publication on [[mp3]] technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2005, Krim created Netvibes with Florent Frémont, a developer friend. The personalized dashboard publishing platform claims over 10 million users worldwide, half of whom are in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Les Echos"/&gt; 

In 2008, Krim left as the head of the company to create Jolicloud in 2009, co-founded with Romain Huet, the company's [[Chief Technical Officer|CTO]].&lt;ref name="Wishful Thinking"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sepúlveda Schulz|first= Rodrigo| title = Interview With Tariq Krim|url=http://www.angelmendez.es/2009/04/16/interview-with-tariq-krim-jolicloud-ceo/|accessdate=16 April 2009|newspaper =Wishful Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their vision is to combine cloud technology with a simple user interface. Krim first developed Joli OS, a free operating system, which enabled users to optimise low-cost devices or recycle older computers. In 2012, Jolicloud launched an [[HTML5]]-based cloud platform.&lt;ref name="Tech Crunch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=Mike|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/jolicloud-pivots-up-organise-your-personal-cloud-life-online/|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolicloud is backed by $4.2 million in [[venture capital]] funding from [[Atomico Ventures]], formed by [[Kazaa]] and [[Skype]] founders [[Niklas Zennström]] and [[Janus Friis]], and Mangrove Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/tariq-krim|accessdate=11 March 2010|newspaper=Plugg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062832/http://plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/tariq-krim|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mentoring ==
In 2008, Krim co-founded ISAI, "the French tech entrepreneurs' fund", which provides seed capital for web and mobile technology startups.&lt;ref name="isai"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAI|url=http://www.isai.fr/en/home/|website=ISAI|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAI's co-founders are all members of France's digerati: Orianne Garcia, founder of Terrafemina.com; Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet, founder of [[Priceminister|PriceMinister]]; Ouriel Ohayon, founder of TechCrunch France and [[AppsFire]]; [[Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux]], CEO of [[Virgin Mobile]]; and Stéphane Treppoz, Chairman of the Executive Board of [[Sarenza]].&lt;ref name=01Net&gt;{{cite news|last=Chicaud|first=Sandrine|title=Six pointures du Web créent un fonds d'investissement pour les jeunes pousses| url= http://pro.01net.com/editorial/396406/six-pointures-du-web-creent-un-fonds-dinvestissement-pour-les-jeunes-pousses/|accessdate=14 November 2008| newspaper= 01Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combined effort has helped launch websites such as co-voiturage.fr and InstantLuxe.com. Krim has said that he has a "passion for building highly disruptive new products".&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last= Schonfeld| first=Erick| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/15/technology/disruptors_netvibes.biz2/index.htm|accessdate=20 September 2006| work=CNNMoney|title=Web users feel the 'vibes'|date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Net freedom ==
As one of the first French journalists equipped to write about online conundrums such as [[copyright infringement]] or [[music piracy]] piracy, Krim became an expert on the digital rights of authors.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt; He advised [[Adami (union)|Adami]], a French civil society that allocates the rights of performers. In 2004 he published a study called "[[Peer-to-Peer]], an New Business Model for Music", in which he cites another study by the French Directorate of Economic Forecasting and Analysis, which concluded that "no systematic correlation can be made between downloading and the state of the music industry".&lt;ref name="Adami Study"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krim|first=Tariq|url=http://www.irma.asso.fr/IMG/pdf/Etude-P2P-Tariq-KRIM-ADAMI.pdf|title=Le Peer to peer: Un otre modele economique pour la musique|work=Study|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought leadership ==
Krim is a speaker at global technology and media conferences and summits. He regularly appears on mainstream media, sometimes as an "expert on the Internet" but mostly as Netvibes' charismatic founder. He is currently acknowledged as one of Europe's industry experts on [[cloud computing]] and the future of the Internet.&lt;ref name="ARCEP Colloque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/actes-colloque-mai-juil2011.pdf|title=Growth, Innovation, Regulation|work=Arcep|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, he was awarded the [[Information Technology]] for Business Creation Prize by [[Telecom ParisTech]] and its engineering association (AIST).&lt;ref name="Paris Tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecom-paristech.org/docs/2008101113535_08prixcreateur.pdf|title=Les lauréats Prix du Créateur d'Entreprise - Tariq Krim|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krim is one of six French personalities to have been selected as a Young Global Leader (YGL) by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name="WEF Young Global Leaders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/tariq-krim/index.html|title=Tariq Krim: Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jolicloud|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krim served on the [[Conseil national du numérique]] as a vice president from 2013 to 2016.

[[File:TheJoyOfWork.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Joy of Work'' by Scott Adams]]
'''''The Joy of Work''''' (1998) by [[Scott Adams]] is a two-part book. The first part offers recommendations as to how office workers can find [[happiness]] at their [[cubicle desk]]s and the second part is a formula for creating [[humor]], based on the author's experience penning the ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="Touzet2010"&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|author=Claude Touzet|title=Conscience, Intelligence, Libre-arbitre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekkODUMG-t0C&amp;pg=PA87|year=2010|publisher=Touzet|isbn=978-2-919411-00-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The title is a comic reference to the 1972 sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The first part of the book explains "how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers", including how to deal with superiors, meetings and co-workers and how to avoid work while having fun; an entire chapter is devoted to office [[Practical joke|pranks]]. The second part is an analysis of humor and how to write funny material. Adams writes, "The third part of the book is made entirely out of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that's why."

The book includes a response to [[Norman Solomon]], who attempted to depict Scott Adams as a proponent of downsizing in his 1997 book, ''The Trouble with Dilbert''. People who were offended by certain Dilbert strips are also addressed, with Adams concluding that it is the "proximity" of sensitive subjects to negative concepts that causes "people who are angry for no good reason (nuts)" to take offense.

The '''visible trade balance''' is that part of the [[balance of trade]] figures that refers to [[international trade]] in physical goods, but not trade in services; it thus contrasts with the [[invisible balance]].

Most countries do not have a zero visible balance: they usually run a surplus or a deficit. This will be offset by trade in services, other income transfers, investments and monetary flows, leading to an overall [[balance of payments]]. The visible balance is affected by changes in the volumes of [[imports]] and [[exports]], and also by changes in the [[terms of trade]].

In aggregate, the World often appears to have a negative visible balance with itself; i.e. imports of goods appear to exceed exports. There are numerous causes for this, such as measuring imports on a [[cost, insurance and freight]] basis while measuring exports on a [[free on board]] basis, or statistical errors occurring when imports are more closely recorded than exports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Workplace Strategy''' is the dynamic alignment of an [[organization]]’s work patterns with the work environment to enable peak performance and reduce costs.&lt;ref name="Savage A E"&gt;Savage A E (2005) Workplace strategy: What it is and why you should care. ''Journal of Corporate Real Estate'', 7(3).[http://www.artofthefuture.com/JCRE2.html])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components and aims==
The role of the person charged with developing the strategy, the 'workplace strategist', is to understand the organisation's requirements and recommend a workplace solution that will help them meet their current and future needs. The workplace strategy may facilitate meeting [[Strategic planning|business objectives]] such as: reducing property costs, improving business performance, merging two or more organisations/cultures, and relocating or consolidating occupied buildings. In more simple terms, the workplace strategy provides a response to either running out of space, having too much space, or wanting to introduce organisational change. The workplace strategy and its implementation quite often occur at an opportune moment such as a property lease break or a company merger or acquisition.

The proposed workplace strategy will focus on how to use the space more efficiently and effectively. Recommendations often include moving from cellular (predominantly private office) environments to [[open plan]], or introducing new ways of working and moving to a flexible, activity-based or agile working environment, as first proposed by [[Frank Duffy (architect)|Frank Duffy]] and Veldhoen + Company in nineties. [[Flexible working]] is where the occupants have access to a range of work settings, including working at home or on the move, but also share workstations, often referred to as [[hot desking]] or the related [[Hoteling]].

Easy to follow reviews of how to develop a workplace strategy are provided by Eley and Marmot&lt;ref&gt;Eley J &amp; Marmot A (1995) ''Understanding Offices: What Every Manager Needs to Know About Office Buildings''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; and Springer.&lt;ref&gt;Springer T (2011) ''Fundamentals of Workplace Strategy''. Jasper, IN: Kimball Office.[http://www.kimballoffice.com/cms/documents/1562/Kimball%20Office_Fundamentals%20of%20Workplace%20Strategy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace consultants==
Workplace strategies tend to be developed by specialist workplace [[consultant]]s or the service may provided from within an architectural practice. Savage notes that:&lt;ref name="Savage A E"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; "The successful implementation of a workplace strategy requires an interdisciplinary team, internal and external to the organization ... A workplace consultant may be retained to engage the team, help define success criteria, manage the process, and assess results." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
External workplace consultants are professionals from a number of backgrounds: business management, interior design and architecture, building surveying, real estate and facilities management, human resources and building research. The Workplace Consulting Organization ([http://www.workplaceconsulting.org WCO]) is the professional body for consultants offering workplace strategy services.

==Research==
Research is currently under way by the [[General Services Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;Kampschroer K, Heerwagen J &amp; Powell K (2007) Creating and Testing Workplace Strategy. ''California Management Review'', 49(2).[http://hbr.org/product/creating-and-testing-workplace-strategy/an/CMR361-HCB-ENG "Creating and Testing Workplace Strategy"].&lt;/ref&gt; to test the impact of workplace strategies, design and new technologies on business performance.

==In Ireland==
The [[National Centre for Partnership and Performance]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] has established a [http://www.newunionism.net/library/workplace%20democracy/NCPP%20-%20A%20National%20Workplace%20Strategy%20-%202005.pdf "National Workplace Strategy"] defined as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"the Government's blueprint to help transform Ireland's workplaces into Workplaces of the Future, by promoting greater levels of partnership-led change and innovation in our places of work, regardless of size or sector. As Ireland continues its economic and social transition to a knowledge-based economy and society, the Strategy’s underlying premise is that all companies and organisations can achieve improved performance and an enhanced [[Quality of working life]] by improving their capacity to manage change and innovation within the workplace."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
